Don's waste your time on writing silly tests for getters and setters. Another test will probably set the Name and then get that property so you will have code coverage for the getter. You should test anything public facing, including properties. If you don't test a property, you run the risk that someone may add some logic inside it, breaking the functionality. Also you shouldn't rely on it being tested in other tests. This makes your tests brittle, and makes it harder to identify where the problem is as a test will be testing more than one thing.
