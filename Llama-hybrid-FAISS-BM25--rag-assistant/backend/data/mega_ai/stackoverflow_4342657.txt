Format DateTime string representation in GridView dataset

Just looking for some strategies to modify the typical mm/dd/yy 00:00:00 to simply mm/dd/yy of a datetime item being returned in a dataset that is bound to the gridview thanks the item is within a dataset and I am simply doing the following gridview.DataSource = GetDataSet(); gridview.DataBind(); So I don't have a ton of interaction with the dataset at the moment. I could brute force iterate through it and do something like foreach(Table) foreach(Row) grab date Col, format and concat to look as desired but this is very messy and was wondering if there is a more elegant solution.
