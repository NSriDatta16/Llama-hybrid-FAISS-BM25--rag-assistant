var ddlYear = document.getElementById('ddlYear'); var ddlMonth = document.getElementById('ddlMonth'); var ddlDay = document.getElementById('ddlDay'); var y = ddlYear[ddlYear.selectedIndex]; var m = ddlMonth[ddlMonth.selectedIndex]; var d = ddlDay[ddlDay.selectedIndex]; // past var dt = new Date((y+1), (m-1), d); var moreThanOnYearAgo = dt new Date(); The y+1 is because if we're adding one year, and are still less than new Date() (today), then it's more than one year ago. The m-1 is because months in the Date constructor are an enum, which means January is 0.
