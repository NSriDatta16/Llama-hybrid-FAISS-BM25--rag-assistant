How do I add values from two different arrays of hashes together?

I have two arrays of hashes. The keys for the hashes are different: player_scores1 = [{:first_name=>"Bruce", :score => 43, :time => 50}, {:first_name=>"Clark", :score => 45, :minutes => 20}] player_scores2 = [{:last_name=>"Wayne", :points => 13, :time => 40}, {:last_name=>"Kent", :points => 3, :minutes => 20}] I'd like to create a new array of hashes which adds up :score and :points together and assign it to a key called :score. I'd also like to combine the :first_name and :last_name and assign it to a key called :full_name. I want to discard any other keys. This would result in this array: all_players = [{:full_name => "Bruce Wayne", :score => 56}, {:full_name => "Clark Kent", :score => 48}] Is there an elegant way to do this?
