Unit Test Organization

I'm using Nunit for unit testing, and added another project called "Unit Testing" to my current solution. I referenced Nunit, and changed the Namespace to the same namespace used in the main project. I can't seem to figure out how to get access to all the classes, files, etc in the main project. Is there something I have to do to link two projects?
