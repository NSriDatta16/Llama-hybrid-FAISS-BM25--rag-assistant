Origin of Rectangle in CGRectMake

I have a simple screen in my iPhone app where I want a rectangle of 320x100 at the bottom of the screen to capture a touch. Here is my code inside touchesBegan:withEvent : for (UITouch *touch in touches) { CGPoint touchPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; NSLog(@"touch @ %f, %f", touchPoint.x, touchPoint.y); // build a rectangle where we want to capture a URL tap CGRect rectangle = CGRectMake(0, 480, 320, 100); NSLog(@"midX, midY = %f, %f", CGRectGetMidX(rectangle), CGRectGetMidY(rectangle)); // check to see if they tapped the URL if (CGRectContainsPoint(rectangle, touchPoint)) { NSLog(@"You touched inside the rectangle."); } } Now this code does not work as intended...the log from the mid point of the rectangle shows that my rectangle is built at midX, midY = 160.000000, 530.000000 . According to the CGPoint documentation, the origin (0, 480) is the lower left-hand corner, but this is acting like the origin is the upper left-hand corner. When I change the origin of my rectangle to 0, 380, everything works as intended. Maybe I'm not properly caffeinated yet this morning, but why am I seeing this discrepancy between the documentation and the execution?
