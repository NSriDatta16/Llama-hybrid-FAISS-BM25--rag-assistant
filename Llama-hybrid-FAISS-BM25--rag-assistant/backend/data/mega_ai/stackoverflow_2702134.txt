In my experience it helps to be more resrictive, I made the team filling out (paper) forms why this jar is needed and what license... and they did rather type in a few lines of code instead of drag along 20 jars to open a file using only one line of code, or another fancy 'feature'. Using maven could help for a while, but when you first spot jars having names like nightly-build or snapshot, you will know you're in jar-hell. conclusion: Choose dependencies well
