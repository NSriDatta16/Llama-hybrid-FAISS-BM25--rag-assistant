I argue that the additional overhead is negligible Agreed - trying too micro optimize performance by not using UserControls should be frowned upon. and it makes for better-organised code, It can, and if it does in your particular context - then, yeah, it's a good idea. and who knows, you may re-use the functionality at some point in the future. Yeah, you may. Or you may not. This is a wash, and is best refuted by Y(P)AGNI (You (probably) ain't going to need it). So - to summarize, it depends on whether it really does make for better organized code.
