Are notebooks with NVIDIA GPU usually Gaming notebooks?

I am planning to purchase a notebook to do some Machine Learning development and ideally would like to have NVIDIA GPUs so that I can use CUDA as well. Doing a search of the best notebooks for this, I find that (almost) all of them are gaming notebooks. I have never been part of the gaming community, so my question is: Are notebooks that are equipped with NVIDIA GPUs usually gaming notebooks?
