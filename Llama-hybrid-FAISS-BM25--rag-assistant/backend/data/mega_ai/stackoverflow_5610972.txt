The problem is that you have too much text in the cell with rowspan. It simply forces the table to be higher so that the images aren't high enough to cover their cells. If you want to fill the cell with text to get the last paragraph exactly at the bottom (or just to use all of the available space in the cell), then you have to set the exact size of every element in the cell to override the different margins, paddings and line heights that different browsers have. Another alternative to put a paragraph at the bottom is to use absolute positioning. Then the layout is not as sensetive to variations between browsers. And, as John pointed out, you should of course have a doctype on the page so that it renders in Standards Compliance Mode instead of Quirks Mode, that will also help to reduce the difference between browsers.
