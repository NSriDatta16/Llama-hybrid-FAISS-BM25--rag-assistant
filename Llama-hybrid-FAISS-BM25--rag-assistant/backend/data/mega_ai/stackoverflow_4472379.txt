I am surprised no one has come across this situation before? Even without the layout plugin, my solution is not very pretty. In order to simulate the page without the layout plugin, I had to keep the top and the left pane using position:fixed property in css. And there is no center div at all. I add the new div directly to the body of the html. The reason is I don't want to see additional scrollbars on top the browser scrollbars. In other words the center pane should scroll when the browser scrollbars are moved. I am attaching the solution so you have an idea. I am open to any solution even without the layout plugin if i can simulate the previous attached file using any other approach. i am attaching my page without the layout plugin but am not sure if that is the only elegant solution left. You can check the solution here http://jsfiddle.net/c7wrT/ Is adding the dynamic div directly to the html body a good approach?
