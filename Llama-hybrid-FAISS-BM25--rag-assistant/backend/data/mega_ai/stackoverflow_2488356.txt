You could use stack storage without using the 'new' operator so the class is essentially packed like a struct, and then export the entire memory region out to file. When you want it again, allocate the memory region and read the class data back into it from file, and then access that as you would normally. It won't be portable, but it will work. It's quite nice on machines like the Nintendo DS to store level data when you save something using an editor, although certainly not pretty (and dangerous on complex systems, furthermore!) Note: I'm not recommending that you do this, but it's valid on some embedded platforms, as mentioned. I just wanted to post something interesting, which homebrew devs actually do in C++ on the Nintendo DS when developing using palib.
