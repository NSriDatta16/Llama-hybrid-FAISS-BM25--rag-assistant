Is the posterior distribution $P(\theta|\mathbf{X})$ a statistic?

The textbook definition of a statistic is any function of the data, $g(\mathbf{X})$. Much of frequentist inference is concerned with deriving sampling distributions for various statistics under some null model, so it makes sense that the term "statistic" has a precise definition and is used quite often. The goal of Bayesian inference, on the other hand, is to derive the posterior distribution $P(\theta | \mathbf{X})$ of some parameter $\theta$ upon observing data $\mathbf{X}$. The discussions I've seen on Bayesian inference tend not to give a definition for the term "statistic." I have two questions: Do Bayesians use the term "statistic" in the same way that frequentists do, or does Bayesian inference not depend as heavily on the concept of a statistic? Is it accurate to say that the posterior distribution $P(\theta|\mathbf{X})$ is itself a statistic? Even if it is technically correct, is it "morally" correct?
