Resource interpreted as other but transferred with MIME type text/html

I'm transferring fragments of HTML via Ajax. Safari (4.0.5) reports: "Resource interpreted as other but transferred with MIME type text/html." The file name of the file I get has a .html extension. The server does set the header for this: Content-Type:text/html As I said, the content is a fragment of HTML, which is injected into the page (with jQuery). The contents of the file look like: ... some valid html ... What else might Safari need to see to make it interpret the received content as HTML? TIA. -- addition -- Here's the Ajax jQuery code: $.ajax({ url: url, dataType: 'text', async: false, success: function(json) { callback(json); }, error: function(request, status, error) { callback(undefined); } });
