GAN for illumination removal

I'm reading a paper using GAN to process illumination in image. In the paper, the author mentioned using the SSIM loss for quality evaluation of the reconstructed image. However, in the SSIM loss, there is a hyperparam C1,C2, which depend on the dynamic value of the pixels (the author said it is 1 for their model). However, the paper doesn't mention the output layer of the Generator, which i assume that it is the tanh function. But tanh's output value would be between -1 and 1 (dynamic value = 2), which contradict with the SSIM hyperparam i have mentioned. Can anyone explain this for me?
