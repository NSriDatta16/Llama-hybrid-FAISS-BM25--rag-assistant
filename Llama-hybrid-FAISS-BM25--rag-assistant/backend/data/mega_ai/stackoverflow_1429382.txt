play audio in an embedded media player

I have a client station that downloads .wav file and plays with the embedded medai player by using AxWindowsMediaPlayer library. I need to download the audio and give the url of the file to my media player. I was just wondering if there is any way that I don't store it in a physical storage, and load it from a memory for the media player. There would lots of audio control on the media player though. thanks.
