A few guesses (on a general extension installation note): Make sure that your file permissions are correct (make them match other working modules) Verify that you have copied the module XML file into app/etc/modules/ Check in the backend under System -> Configuration -> Advanced for an entry for your module (it should be present and enabled) Once this is the case, clear out all your magento caches Log out and in (I know you tried this) Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
