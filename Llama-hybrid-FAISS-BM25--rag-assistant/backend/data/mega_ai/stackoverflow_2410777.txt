Resize entire QTableWidget (not columns or rows)

Probabaly a newbie question here. Is there a way for the user to drag resize QTableWidget? My QTableWidget is nested inside a tab widget, therefore it is not a window by itself. I tried implementing a QSizeGrip, but when I drag resize the grip the entire window resizes and not just the table.
