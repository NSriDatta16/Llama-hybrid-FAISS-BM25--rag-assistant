is logging an exception on the code of the Exceptions base class a good design approach?

some friends just finished the implementation of an app and they use Custom Exceptions. something that took my attention is that when a custom exception was raised they logged the exception in the code of the exception base class they implemented. so my question will be is this a good design approach?. my thinking is that a logging helper is more usable public class BaseCustomException: System.Exception { public BaseCustomException() { TightlyCoupledClass.Log(this); } }
