I wouldn't look for a rigorous definition of omnibus test. It seems typically used for overall tests with wide scope, packing several tests into one. Other terms used with similar import are portmanteau statistic and factotum statistic. Over a century or more, there have been all sorts of fashions over terminology, including statisticians reaching for their Latin and Greek (ancillary, histogram, chi-square, heteroscedasticity), statisticians reaching for their thesaurus (as here), statisticians naming tests after their teachers or friends, ideally in pairs (Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis), and statisticians eager to show off their homespun sides (jackknife, bootstrap). Even the words that look familiar had to be invented (average, mode, regression).
