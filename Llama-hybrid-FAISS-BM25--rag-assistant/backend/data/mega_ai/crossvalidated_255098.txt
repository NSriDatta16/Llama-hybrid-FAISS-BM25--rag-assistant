Might be easier to interpret if you think of $r$ as $$ r = (x - \mu) $$ where mu is a fixed vector and $x$ is a vector for which you are asking the question, "how likely is $x$, given a fixed $\mu$ (and $C$)?" For example, if you label some pixels (vectors in 3D) in a picture as being skin or not-skin, then you can construct 2 multivariate normals for each label. Each of these distributions will have their own $\mu$ (3D) and covariance (3x3). Then, you can evaluate unlabeled pixels under each state . When combined with prior information about skin/non-skin, you can use a Bayesian approach to determine the posterior probability that an unlabeled pixel is skin.
