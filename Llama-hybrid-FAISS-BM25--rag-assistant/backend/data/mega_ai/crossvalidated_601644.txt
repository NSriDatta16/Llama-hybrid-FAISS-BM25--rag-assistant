How to compare three conditions that are not from normal distribution?

Mice were exposed to light for 0, 1, and 4 hours. I have an algorithm that calculates their cell embeddings depending on the duration of exposure. As a result, violin plots of my data look like this: my independent variable (cell embeddings) has negative and positive values. What would be the best way to find if stimulation significantly affected mice's gene expression? I assume I can't use ANOVA cause my data is not normally distributed.
