I've used CruiseControl with Xcode (similiar to what Pragmatic Automation suggested) and had reasonable success. I'm also very familiar with CruiseControl and it's relatively horrific configuration format setup. I've also used BuildBot to good effect, but found that it's strengths didn't really match my needs (distributed slaves building and reporting across multiple different systems). Configurating buildbot setups can be an art in and of itself, although it's not difficult. It's all essentially writing scripts in python. Since Hudson has become available, I'd recommend it as an avenue for running continuous integration. It has a web based interface (CruiseControl's primary deficiency in my mind) and is very flexible in the various systems that it supports. You can invoke command line driven builds quite easily and very obviously. That said, I haven't set up an instance using Hudson and Xcode, where I have for the other systems, so this is partially speculation on my part.
