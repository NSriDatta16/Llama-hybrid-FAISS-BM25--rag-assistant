The reason all of the examples your finding are for Silverlight is because MVVM is by-and-large a Microsoft invention. It has to do with the ease of tying WPF views with data. The "ViewModel" is little more than a way of describing a subset of functions performed by the Controller in a traditional MVC design model; some MVVM descriptions even include a controller. With that said, it doesn't really matter whether your app follows the MVVM or MVC models precisely. It's more of a high-level, organizational idea that should guide your design and development. If you're totally clueless about the models you can find any number of quickie web tutorials , and probably some printed literature on the subject.
