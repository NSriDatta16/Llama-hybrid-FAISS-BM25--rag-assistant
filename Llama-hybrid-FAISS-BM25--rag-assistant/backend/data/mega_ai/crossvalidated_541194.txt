Transforming F-dist or long one tail

I have been going through different kaggle datasets recently to apply different techniques I have learned. I have seen loads of articles related to preprocessing your features with normalization or standardization. Generally the rule I have been following is that if the underline distribution is normal, or approx normal, then apply standardization otherwise normalization. This has worked relatively well, but with this current dataset I am experiencing several features that follow the F-dist or long 1 sided tail (also looks like the beta distribution shape). What are some techniques that are utilized to transform/handle these types of features before feeding into a logistic regression model? I have tried searching, blindly, for some information on handling these distributions but to no avail. Any help pointing me in the right direction of what to search for would be very much appreciated!
