It all depends: An internal struct would only be useful if you need to organize VERY many items. And if this is the case, you ought to reconsider your design. An external struct would be useful if it will be shared with other instances of the same or different classes. (A model, or data object class/struct might be a good example) Is only ever advisable for trivial, throw-away code. This is the standard way of doing things but it all depends on how you'll be using the class.
