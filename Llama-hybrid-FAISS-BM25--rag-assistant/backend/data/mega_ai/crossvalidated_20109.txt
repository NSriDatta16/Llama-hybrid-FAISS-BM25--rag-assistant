The difference between them is nothing to do with the type of PCA they perform, just the method they use. As the help page for prcomp says: The calculation is done by a singular value decomposition of the (centered and possibly scaled) data matrix, not by using eigen on the covariance matrix. This is generally the preferred method for numerical accuracy. On the other hand, the princomp help page says: The calculation is done using eigen on the correlation or covariance matrix, as determined by cor . This is done for compatibility with the S-PLUS result. A preferred method of calculation is to use svd on x , as is done in prcomp ." So, prcomp is preferred , although in practice you are unlikely to see much difference (for example, if you run the examples on the help pages you should get identical results).
