Should I use Poisson or Binomial distribution to solve this question?

My question goes as below: A major warehouse facility has 10 semi-trailer loading bays, which can all be used simultaneously. On average only 7 bays are in use. a. What is the probability that all bays will be in simultaneous use. b. What is the probability that one or more semi-trailers will have to wait for a bay to become available. c. Show a loading bay demand for zero to fifteen semitrailers. Please suggest which distribution Binomial or Poisson to use for this question?
