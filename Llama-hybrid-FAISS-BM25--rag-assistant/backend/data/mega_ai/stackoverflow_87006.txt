I would use AccuRev. I've used svn, cvs, clearcase (base, ucm), ccc/harvest, but none of them can beat AccuRev's strengths. "3000+ developer organization with several site"? you can use Accurev distributed solution (AccuReplica) for that - which mean you have one single master server and as many as you want replicas on remote sites (so those with the "slow link" won't suffer much) Above all AccuRev brings a unique approach - a truly new concept/design/implementation of stream-based SCM tool. Not in the (bad) way ClearCase-UCM did that (because ClearCase "streams" were eventually branches), but in slick modern way. The best is to try it yourself, I know that they offer a trial of 30 days with enough licenses to toy with the tool - try it and you won't want to consider other tools. My promise.
