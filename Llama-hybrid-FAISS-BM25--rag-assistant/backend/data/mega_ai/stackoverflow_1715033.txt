What is the best presentation tool for technical stuff?

While recently exploring prezi I realized there have to be better tools than PowerPoint for presenting something, especially technical stuff. What differentiates technical stuff from other stuff in my opinion is the support of these features: be able to insert large code fragments scroll in code fragments annotate (highlight) text/code easily have several "steps", ie. on pressing a key, something is highlighted, displayed, moved, etc. (this is missing in prezi) include images with dynamic sources (eg. to include yuml diagrams ) Here is a great overview of alternatives, has anybody evaluated some?
