Bayesian updating - coin tossing example

I have a question about Bayesian updating. In general Bayesian updating refers to the process of getting the posterior from a prior belief distribution. Alternatively one could understand the term as using the posterior of the first step as prior input for further calculation. The below is a simple calculation example. Method a is the standard calculation. Method b uses the posterior output as input prior to calculate the next posterior. Using method a, we get P(F|HH) = 0.2. Using method b, gives P(F|HH) = 0.05. My question is as to how far method b is a valid approach ? Problem: You toss a coin twice, get 2 Heads. What is the probability that the coin is fair, i.e. $Pr(Fair\ coin| HH)$? Now for the first toss: $Pr(Fair\ coin| H) = \frac{Pr(Head|Fair)\cdot P(Fair)}{Pr(Head|Fair) \cdot P(Fair)+Pr(Head|Biased) \cdot P(Biased)} = \frac{Pr(H|F)\cdot P(F)}{P(H)} \quad\quad (1)$ Assuming starting prior belief P(Fair) = 0.5, want to find P(F|H) for the first toss Below are the calculation for the intermediate steps: $P(H|F)= {n \choose x} \theta^{x}(1-\theta)^{n-x} = {1 \choose 1} 0.5^{1}(0.5)^{0}= 0.5$ $P(H)= P(H|F) \cdot P(F)+ P(H|Biased) \cdot P(Biased)=(0.5 \cdot 0.5) +(1 \cdot 0.5) = 0.75$ (Note: P(H|Biased) = 1 because assuming an extreme example with Heads on both sides of the coin, the probability of getting Heads with a biased coin = 1 (makes calculation easy)) Hence, plugging into (1), we get : $Pr(F| H) =\frac{Pr(H|F)\cdot P(F)}{P(H)} = \frac{0.5 \cdot 0.5}{0.75} = 0.33$ Now, we toss the coin again and get another H. To calculate $Pr(F| HH) $ , we a) continue using P(Fair)=0.5 $Pr(F|HH) = \frac{Pr(HH|F)\cdot P(F)}{Pr(HH|F) \cdot P(F)+Pr(HH|Biased) \cdot P(Biased)} = \frac{Pr(HH|F)\cdot P(F)}{P(HH)} \quad\quad (2)$ $P(HH|F)= {n \choose x} \theta^{x}(1-\theta)^{n-x} = {2 \choose 2} 0.5^{2}(0.5)^{0}= 0.25$ $P(HH)= P(HH|F) \cdot P(F)+ P(HH|Biased) \cdot P(Biased)=(0.25 \cdot 0.5) +(1 \cdot 0.5) = 0.625$ Hence, plugging into (2), $Pr(F|HH) =\frac{Pr(HH|F)\cdot P(F)}{P(HH)} = \frac{0.25 \cdot 0.5}{0.625} = 0.2$ Alternatively, what if we calculate $Pr(F| HH) $ by using b) our updated belief P(Fair)=0.33 which we got from Pr(F|H) in the first step In this case, $P(HH|F)= {n \choose x} \theta^{x}(1-\theta)^{n-x} = {2 \choose 2} 0.33^{2}(1-0.33)^{0}= 0.1089$ $P(HH)= P(HH|F) \cdot P(F)+ P(HH|Biased) \cdot P(Biased)=(0.1089 \cdot 0.33) +(1 \cdot 0.67) = 0.705937$ Hence, plugging into (2), $Pr(F|HH) =\frac{Pr(HH|F)\cdot P(F)}{P(HH)} = \frac{0.1089 \cdot 0.33}{0.705937} = 0.05091$ Using method a, we get P(F|HH) = 0.2. Using method b, gives P(F|HH) = 0.05. My question is as to how far method b is a valid approach ?
