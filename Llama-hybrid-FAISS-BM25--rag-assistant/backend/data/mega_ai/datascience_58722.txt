Do timesteps must have the same temporal distance in training a RNN?

I have a recurrent neural network with LSTM units that I want to train with batches of 6 timesteps. Each timestep is a record of a dataset and represents the temporal aggregation over 5 minutes of data taken every 10 seconds. Unfortunately, the dataset has temporal interruptions, so sometimes two successive records in the dataset can be temporally separated by 10 minutes to a few weeks. I was wondering if the timesteps I give to the network in each batch must all be separated by the same temporal distance, that is in my case they must all be within 5 minutes of each other or it is sufficient that they are subsequent and therefore I could also give the network for example a batch with 4 records at a distance of 5 minutes from each other and then 2 taken for example two days later. UPDATED: The data comes from an electronic system so the time interruptions are due to the device being turned off. Rarely it is turned off only for a few minutes while most of the time it remains off for longer periods, like hours or sometimes days. Among other elements, the device includes a battery, therefore many of the features present in the dataset records are temperature, current and voltage readings which change value during temporal interruptions (little when turned off for a few minutes and significantly when turned off for hours or days). The goal of the network is to predict the value of some features two steps ahead.
