The question was answered on MathOverflow by Iosif Pinelis: The paper you refer to says (in line 1 of Sect. 2.2) that $\mathcal{F}$ is the unit ball of a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (not the entire RKHS). So, $|f(a)|=|\langle f, \phi(a)\rangle|\le\|f\| \|\phi(a)\|\le1\times\sqrt{\langle\phi(a),\phi(a)\rangle}=\sqrt{k(a,a)}\le\sqrt K$ for all $f\in\mathcal{F}$ and all points $a$. So, any change of the value of $x_i$ incurs a change of $\Delta(p,q,X,Y)$ not exceeding $\frac1m\,\times2\times\sqrt K=\frac{2}{m}\sqrt{K}$ (in absolute value).
