Is there a way in rails 3 to redirect any Internet Explorer user to specific page?

I want to redirect all IE users to a specific page that tells them we don't support IE and that they should try another browser. How can I do this using rails 3 routes and still allow public users to view the public area of the site? My routes are something like this... MyApp::Application.routes.draw do constraints(NoSubdomain) do root :to => 'public#index' end constraints(Subdomain) do root :to => 'internal#index' end end I know there is the ability to match user_agent but i'm not able to get it to redirect all ie users who try to go to the internal part of the site (account.myapp.com) to '/ie' page. Any ideas? MyApp::Application.routes.draw do constraints(NoSubdomain) do root :to => 'public#index' end constraints :user_agent => /MSIE/ do match "*" => redirect('/ie') end constraints(Subdomain) do root :to => 'internal#index' end end
