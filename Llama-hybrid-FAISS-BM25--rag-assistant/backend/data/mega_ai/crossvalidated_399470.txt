What convolutional layers do, is they slide a kernel over the image as illustrated in this cheetsheet by Stanford CS 230 : It is not only more efficient (less weights, since they are shared), but also it seeks for same features in different regions of the picture. If you used dense layer in here, the model would need to re-learn discovering those features independently for each region of the picture. This makes it much more complicated, but also it needs you to have data where in training set the features are distributed in all regions of the pictures. So if you had thousands of cars on pictures in your training set, but if there were none in upper left corner of the pictures, your classifier knows nothing about cars if they appear in upper left corner. With CNN's it wouldn't matter. For more details, check also this tutorial from another Stanford course .
