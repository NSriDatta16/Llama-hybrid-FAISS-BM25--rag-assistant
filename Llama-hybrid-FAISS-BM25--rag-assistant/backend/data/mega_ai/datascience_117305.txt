You can use functions from the dplyr library for this, something like the following should work: df %>% # select postcodes you are interested about filter(str_detect(Postcode, "^AB1 2")) %>% # create groups for which to calculate the average group_by(format(Date_Of_Sale, "%Y-%m"), Postcode) %>% # calculate the average of the sale price summarise(avg_sale_price = mean(Sale_Price)) This should give you a dataframe that contains the average sale price for each combination of the postcode and the period.
