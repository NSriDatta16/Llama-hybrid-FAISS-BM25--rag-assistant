Actually in your case I guess the pure images are not that important. The features that you extract from them are important because if your feature space is constructed base on intensity of images at different picture elements, pixels, then you will need so many coefficients. As an easy solution, use MNIST digits and use shape features to extract features from the images of numbers. You can use plausible number of features and then use PCA for the data that is in the new feature space that you have just constructed. In this case smaller number of coefficients will be needed if the features are fine.
