Mean conditional on filtration

I'm quite new to time series analysis. I'm reading a text book, where the conditional expected value of a process $(X_t)$ is written as $E[X_t|\mathcal{F}_{t-1}]$, where $\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$ is called the "natural filtration", which apparently (from what I understood) is a sigma-algebra that contains all the past observations in the series. Can someone explain in simple terms, why does $\mathcal{F}_{t-1}$ need to be a sigma-algebra? Can't we just say that it's the collection of all $X_s$ for $s
