Use multinomial logistic regression on the identity of the HOH. Let $h_i$ be the identity of the HOH for household $i$. This variable ranges from 1 to the size of the household. The model for choosing the HOH is: $$ p(h_i=h | x_i, w) = \frac{\exp(w'x_{ih})}{\sum_{j} \exp(w'x_{ij})} $$ where $w$ is the parameter of the model and $x_{ij}$ is the attributes of the $j$th person in the household. If all households were the same size, then you could easily fit this model using mlogit in R. But since they have different size, I'm not sure if this package can do it. A simple approximation would be to fit a binary logistic regression where the training points are the differences $(x_{ih} - x_{ij})$ for all $i$ and $j$, the outcomes are always 1, and there is no bias term allowed. Once you have estimated $w$, apply the formula above to predict the HOH of a new household.
