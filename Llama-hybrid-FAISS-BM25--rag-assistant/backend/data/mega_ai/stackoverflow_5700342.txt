Amazon S3 folder manipulation with PHP

I have one instance in Amazon EC2. It is a Photobook. User can signup and upload images and they can create a photobook. S for that we want S3 storage. I searched a lot for a good PHP class to manipulate these folders, images and html files. Now I have no idea how we can create folder, delete folder and search for a folder. Can anyone help find a solution for these folder/image manipulation requirements like create , search, delete?
