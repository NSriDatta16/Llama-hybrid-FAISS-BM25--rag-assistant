Number of variables if some are interpolated

Since I didn't found a question close enough to my problem I would very much appreciate your help on the following. (Due to reasons I changed the subject) Let's say I want to make a prediction on the number of crimes committed per year. I have data for the last 12 years. The problem is now, that since I have for the crimes and some of the independent variables (e.g. average temperature) the monthly values and hence would like to do a monthly model, for others I have only one value per year (e.g. population). First I simply interpolated* the yearly ones and did normal regression. But then I started thinking: there are rules of thumb how many times more data you need than variables (I found the numbers 10 to 30 times more and various formulas). I know they are only rules of thumb but let's assume for a moment they are not completely wrong: I have 12 years, i.e. 144 months. Does this mean I should only include one of the yearly variables (since I have only 12 years), but can include several of the monthly ones, or can I "trust" the interpolation (see *) and use them as if they would be also monthly? (Or do I have to take a completely different approach?) The main reason I ask is that I want to avoid that at the end, someone reads what I have done and simply says "obviously unscientific and hence wrong". _* I know this is usually not a good idea, but here they are all rather "stable" ones like the population (assume it's not a touristic place with huge seasonal changes).
