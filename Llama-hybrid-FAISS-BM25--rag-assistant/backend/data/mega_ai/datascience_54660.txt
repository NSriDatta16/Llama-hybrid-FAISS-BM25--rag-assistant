If you have enough data , LSTMs will definitely outperform SVRs. However, on most real world problems SVRs will perform better due to the small dataset size in my experience. In the Paper: E-Commerce Price Forecasting Using LSTM Neural Networks from Houda Bakir, Ghassen Chniti, and HeÃÅdi Zaher you can find a comparison where LSTMs outperform SVRs, especially in terms of variance in RMSE over several time series.
