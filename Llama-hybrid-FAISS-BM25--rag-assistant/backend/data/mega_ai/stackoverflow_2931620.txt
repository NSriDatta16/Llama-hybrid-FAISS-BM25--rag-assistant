how to prevent text selection when dragging mouse in Firefox?

I am wondering how those drag and drop widgets cancel text selection in the dragging element and other elements in the page. I tried the following code which works in IE8 (cannot select text) but does not work (can still select text) in Firefox. Hello World document.onmousemove = function() { return false; }
