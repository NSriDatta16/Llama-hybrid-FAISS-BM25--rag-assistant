Sounds interesting... but very difficult. Since you say this is a 'one-off', what about something like this instead? Take a screenshot of this application. Run the screenshot through an OCR program If you are able to read the text you are looking for in a predictable way, you're halfway there! So now if you can read a OCR'd screenshot of your application, it is a simple matter of writing a program that does the following: Scripts the steps to get the data on the screen Creates a screenshot of the data in question Runs it through an OCR program like Microsoft Office Document Imaging Extracts the relevant text and does 'whatever' with it. I have done something like this before with pretty good results, but I would say it is a fragile solution. If the application changes, it stops working. If the OCR can't read the text, it stops working. If the OCR reads the wrong text, it might do worse things than stop working... As the other posters have said, reaching into memory and pulling out data is a pretty advanced topic... kudos to you if you can figure out a way to do that!
