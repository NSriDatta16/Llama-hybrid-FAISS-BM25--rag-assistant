I see this question has been asked long time ago; however, no answer points out to the significant shortcomings and misunderstandings in the question yet. Please note: You state that R^2 = ESS/TSS = 1 - RSS/TSS. This is only true in a linear context. The equality TSS = RSS + ESS holds true only in linear regression with intercept. Thus you can not use those definitions for random forests interchangeably. This is why RMSE and similar are more typical loss functions. More importantly for statistical purposes: R^2 follows an unknown distribution (also in the linear setting). That means, testing a hypothesis with statistical significance using R^2 is not as straightforward. Cross-Validation, as mentioned by Zach , is a good choice. As for user88 response: Cross validation with Wilcoxon test is a valid approach. A recent paper uses Wilcoxon signed ranks test and Friedman tests for comparison of different methods and algorithms.
