Interpreting coefficients of first differences of logarithms

My problem is interpreting coefficients of such time series model: \begin{equation} \ln Y_t - \ln Y_{t-1} =b_1 \cdot \left(X_{t}-X_{t-1}\right)+b_2 \cdot Z_t.\end{equation} I don't know how to interpret coefficients $b_1$ and $b_2$. Hope that someone can help.
