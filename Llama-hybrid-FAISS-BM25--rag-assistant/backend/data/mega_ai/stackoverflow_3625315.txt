Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) are inspired by the biological model of evolution and natural selection. In the natural world, evolution helps species adapt to their environments. Evolutionary algorithms are based on a simplified model of this biological evolution. To solve a particular problem we create an environment in which potential solutions can evolve. The environment is shaped by the parameters of the problem and encourages the evolution of good
