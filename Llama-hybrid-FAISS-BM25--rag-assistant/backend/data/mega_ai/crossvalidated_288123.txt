How can I correct a negative tendency of residuals?

I ran few algorithms on a continuous target variable. I have 40,000 observation for training and 5000 observations in out-of-sample. I used linear regression, decision tree and xgboost. All of them gave me residuals that when I averaged them or aggregate show a strong negative bias toward the target variable. How can I fix it and what is the cause for this? Here are the residuals results: Target variable plot: Linear regression Model.Xgboost Model.decisionTree Avg. -16.77700338 -16.76011315 -16.97068065 Sum -124166.602 -124041.5974 -125600.0075 Residuals plot:
