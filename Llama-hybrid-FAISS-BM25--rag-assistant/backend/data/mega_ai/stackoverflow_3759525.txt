.htaccess codeigniter multiple domains

I'd like to know if it is possible to organize the following structure of the CodeIgniter installation: - Main folder -- codeigniter -- images -- site1-application -- site2-application -- site1-index.php -- site2-index.php The main idea is to use the same images and codeigniter folder across the multiple web sites for easier maintanance. For now I do have two web sites that are resides in two standard installations and I'm unable to share the images folder nor to update system libraries simulaneously at multiple web sites. I've played alittle with the .htaccess file, but no luck for me :( Thanks in advance!
