Your first interpretation "given that I have Jar B, what range of number-of-chips can I guess that'll get me right coverage 70% of the time?" is the good one and the horizontal brackets may be misleading. Nevertheless, once the column-wise "in or out the interval" labeling done (so that it gathers 70% of the data for a given parameter value), the confidence interval for a given observation (the number of chips) consists in a set of jars and this is what represent the horizontal brackets.
