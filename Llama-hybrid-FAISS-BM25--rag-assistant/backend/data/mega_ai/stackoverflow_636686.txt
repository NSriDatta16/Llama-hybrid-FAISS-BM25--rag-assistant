Signal processing library in Java?

I'd like to compute power spectral density of time series; do some bandpass, lowpass, and highpass filtering; maybe some other basic stuff. Is there a nice open-source Java library to do this? I've hunted a bit without success (e.g., Googling "power spectral density java" or "signal processing java" and clicking through links, looking in Apache Commons, Sourceforge, java.net, etc.). There are lots of applets, books, tutorials, commercial products, etc., that don't meet my needs. Update : I found org.apache.commons.math.transform for Fourier transforms. This doesn't implement power spectral density, bandpass, etc., but it is something.
