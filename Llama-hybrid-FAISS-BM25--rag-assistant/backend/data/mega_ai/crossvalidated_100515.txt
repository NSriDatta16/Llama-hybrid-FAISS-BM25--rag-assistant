I think that, rather than dilute the outliers in the data as you have it, it would be better to make the data not have those outliers. It appears that the reason you have them is that there are certain periods when there is no purchasing of the material (or almost none). You then take a ratio of 1/0 or 1/(some very small number) and get a huge predicted length of time. Two ideas: Use a longer period of time. Use a weighted moving average of several periods of time. The former would be simpler to implement but might miss some important information; the latter shouldn't be that hard to do.
