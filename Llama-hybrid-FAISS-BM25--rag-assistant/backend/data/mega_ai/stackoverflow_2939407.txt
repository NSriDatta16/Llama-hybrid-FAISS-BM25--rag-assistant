The C++ Standard, section 6.7 says: The zero-initialization (8.5) of all local objects with static storage duration (3.7.1) is performed before any other initialization takes place. A local object of POD type (3.9) with static storage duration initialized with constant-expressions is initialized before its block is first entered. An implementation is permitted to per- form early initialization of other local objects with static storage duration under the same conditions that an implementation is permitted to statically initialize an object with static storage duration in namespace scope (3.6.2). Otherwise such an object is initialized the first time control passes through its declaration; such an object is considered initialized upon the completion of its initialization. Which indicates that local static objects are normally initialised the first time the control flow encounters them. However, they may well be allocated before this - the standard is somewhat reticent on what static storage actually is, except with reference to static object lifetimes.
