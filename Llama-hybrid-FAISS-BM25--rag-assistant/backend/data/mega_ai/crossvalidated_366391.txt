Weighted linear regression from log-likelihood?

I have 500 time-series and for each one, I compute the best (aka max likelihood) parameter α in a model that I'm testing, along with the corresponding log-likelihood. Now I wish to uncover a linear relationship between my α and some other property of the time-series, say β. What are my options regarding linear regressors which would somehow take into account the log-likelihoods? In other words, how do I translate log-likelihood into some sort of weighting or error-bars in a rigorous and meaningful way? In the example below, for instance, most high-alpha points have low log-likelihoods and the correct slope is therefore smaller than a simple linear regression would yield. edit: For a more concrete example, let's assume my time-series are almost sinusoids with different periods $T$ and also have, say, a wavelength $\lambda$ assigned to them which should scale linearly with the period of oscillation. So my MLE routine returns $T_{1} = 42$ seconds with log-likelihood $1000$ and I know for this time series that $\lambda_{1} = 521 \pm 5$ nm. Some other series might return $T_{2} = 33$ seconds, log-likelihood $10$ and I know $\lambda_{2} = 314 \pm 7$ nm. How do I take the quality of the period estimate into account when fitting $T$ vs $\lambda$ ?
