Capturing correlation failure between two time series

I have two time series as shown in the figure. The step curve in black is the trigger that causes the blue curve. As you can see first two peaks in both the series occur in the same time interval, however, the third peak on the blue curve does'nt seem to be caused by the step series in black. I need to capture such anomalous instances. I have tried doing co-variance analysis between the series; piece-wise, i.e. as the data is time aligned, I divide the series in several time intervals, and then check co-variance between the series at each time interval. Any low co-variance value indicates that the series are not much correlated in that particular interval. I am not a statistician so I am not sure if this approach is right or if there are better and more efficient methods to achieve what I am after. The datasets I'm working with are huge (up to a couple of millions samples). Right now I am also trying wavelet coherence analysis on this as suggested in the post here - statistical analysis between two time series Though I am not sure how I am supposed to interpret the results of the analysis to catch those anomalous time intervals. Any help or guidance is much appreciated. Thanks in advance.
