simple vb.net database program

Over 6 years ago I did visual basic programming. I used VB6 for an editor. I did it for a semester in college, and I didnt make a good grade. Since then I have been doing other things in life. However I was asked at work to create a web application. I am creating my application in vb.net 2003. I began desigining the interface of the web form. I have 5 forms, all of them need to connect to a database which I already have prepared. I created the database in MS Access. If I can get one of the forms to look at the database, I think I can get the rest of them to do it. I have tried using beginner tutorials online and I am not finding anything thats helpful. The closest tutorial I have found that could atleast give me an idea of what to do, the code doesnt work, I did everything to the 'T'. http://www.startvbdotnet.com/ado/msaccess.aspx Is there anyone out there that can help me?
