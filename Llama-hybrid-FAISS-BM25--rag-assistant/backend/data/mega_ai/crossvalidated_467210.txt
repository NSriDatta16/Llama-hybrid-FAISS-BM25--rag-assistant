After fighting with the problem some more, in the end I did use an imputation approach: I adjusted the number of samples for all combinations of aquarium (this is the random factor) and sampling timepoint to 6, by randomly picking one (or two) of the available observations depending on how many were missing. Then I ran adonis2 with restricted permutations. I repeated this process 100 times, and then used the average of the R2, F, p output as final result.
