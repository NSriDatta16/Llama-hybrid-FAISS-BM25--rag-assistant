What you are referring to is "polling" where your client side code will make a request to the server every X seconds to check for updates. It's an easy to implement solution, which is why you see it so often. However, a better solution is to use Comet. In 2006, Alex Russell coined the term "Comet" to identify a technique whereby the client makes and HTTP request to the server and the server keeps that connection open indefinitely. With this open connection, the server can then push updates to the client in the response when there are updates. When the response is received, the client immediately opens a new long-lived HTTP connection. I encourage you to do a search for "Comet" and whatever server-side language you are using to find a framework that will get you started. Comet Daily has some really great demos, from chat applications to games, that use Comet. If you have a tool like Firebug or Chrome Debugger, you can observe the response/request cycle of these real-time applications. http://cometdaily.com/2009/10/23/concrete-comet-examples/
