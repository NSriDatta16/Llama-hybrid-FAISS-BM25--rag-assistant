Efficient persistent storage for simple id to table of values map for java

I need to store some data that follows the simple pattern of mapping an "id" to a full table (with multiple rows) of several columns (i.e. some integer values [u, v, w]). The size of one of these tables would be a couple of KB. Basically what I need is to store a persistent cache of some intermediary results. This could quite easily be implemented as simple sql, but there's a couple of problems, namely I need to compress the size of this structure on disk as much as possible. (because of amount of values I'm storing) Also, it's not transactional, I just need to write once and simply read the contents of the entire table, so a relational DB isn't actually a very good fit. I was wondering if anyone had any good suggestions? For some reason I can't seem to come up with something decent atm. Especially something with an API in java would be nice.
