Sub-Namespaces for Organization Bad Practice?

Would it be considered bad practice to use sub-namespaces for purely organizational purposes? For example: namespace vehicles { namespace cars { // Stuff here } namespace boats { // More stuff here } } I can see how this would be a problem on large projects, because it would be inconvenient to type vehicles::cars::function a lot. What about small projects, though?
