jQuery plugin that supports drag-n-sort list with deletion and limit on list-length?

I'm building a feature for a website that allows a user to Enter a string and add that string as an item to a list Sort the list by dragging the items up and down Delete items from the list Enforce a limit to the length of the list. For example say I want to limit each list to 10 items or fewer. If a user tried to add an 11th item that should not be allowed. Communicate actions to back-end server/database: whenever an element is added, deleted, or dragged to a different position in the list, that information needs to be sent back to the back-end server/database I looked at jQuery UI Sortable plugin but it doesn't really do what I need. Is there any jQuery plugin that does the above 5 things? If I need to modify jQuery UI Sortable (or something similar) to do what I need, how do I do that? I'm very new to this so any help is really appreciated. I prefer jQuery as I'm already using it for this project. But if some other libraries is more appropriate for this purpose I'd love to hear about them too. Thanks.
