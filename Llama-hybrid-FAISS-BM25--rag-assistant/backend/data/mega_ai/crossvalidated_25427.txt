You essentially have a feature (aka attribute) for each word. In many SVM implementations this is not as inefficient as you might think as they are generally optimized to handle sparse matrices. This is very standard in text classification, usually not with a binary value for each attribute, but rather a calculation representing the words frequency in the document using Term Frequency (TF) and Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). Much of the research surrounds what that calculation should be. Since you seem to be dealing with queries and repetition of words in the query isn't a problem, you could use a binary value to start and see what kind of results you get from that.
