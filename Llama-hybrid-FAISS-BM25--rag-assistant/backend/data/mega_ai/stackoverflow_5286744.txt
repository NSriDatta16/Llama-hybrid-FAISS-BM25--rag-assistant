Upload Photo from iPhone to PHP Using PhoneGap

I have a simple upload form working in PHP (works in web) and also am able to capture a photo from iPhone using PhoneGap (base64) and displaying it on the device. But I can't figure out how to upload it to my server with PHP. Here's the code running in PHP: INDEX.PHP \n"; } } include("list_images.php"); ?> And here are the two includes... UPLOAD_FORM.PHP "> LIST_IMAGES.PHP '; } } closedir($handle); ?> Here's the code running on iPhone 4 (iOS 4.2) in PhoneGap INDEX.HTML (running in WWW directory in PhoneGap) --> // If you want to prevent dragging, uncomment this section /* function preventBehavior(e) { e.preventDefault(); }; document.addEventListener("touchmove", preventBehavior, false); */ function onBodyLoad() { document.addEventListener("deviceready",onDeviceReady,false); } /* When this function is called, PhoneGap has been initialized and is ready to roll */ function onDeviceReady() { // do your thing! } function getPicture(sourceType) { var options = { quality: 10 }; if (sourceType != undefined) { options["sourceType"] = sourceType; } // if no sourceType specified, the default is CAMERA navigator.camera.getPicture(getPicture_Success, null, options); }; function getPicture_Success(imageData) { //alert("getpic success"); document.getElementById("test_img").src = "data:image/jpeg;base64," + imageData; } Camera From Camera From Photo Library Incidentally, while I can grab a fresh picture from the device camera, I've been completely unable to get images from the Library... if anyone knows how to do that, I'd appreciate feedback there too. Had anyone been able to upload photos from PhoneGap/iPhone to PHP? Any source code on both sides of this would be GREATLY appreciated.
