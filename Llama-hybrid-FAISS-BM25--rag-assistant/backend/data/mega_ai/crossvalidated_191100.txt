How can I test for seasonality when the trend is not supposed to be monotonic but sinusoidal?

My knowledge of time-series analysis is limited. So far I have only assessed whether there was a seasonality in my time series data with the assumption of monotonic trend. To test that I would have performed either the Cox-Stewart Test or (preferably) tested for auto-regression considering an additional variable reflecting the distribution of the months (1 to 12, and comparing it to a second model with a meaningless variable going for instance from 1 to 13). However I would need now to test my time series data (divided in months, over 10 years approx) for a seasonality which would allow data not only to have a monotonic pattern but also a sinusoidal pattern. How could I do that? I normally use Stata but might do it in R as well (if necessary...)
