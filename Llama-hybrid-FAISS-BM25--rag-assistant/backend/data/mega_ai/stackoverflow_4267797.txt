Infragistics UltraGrid : Unable to enter edit mode for focused column

Info: I am working with a C#.NET 3.5 winforms application and using Infragistics ultrgrid 8.2 in it. The grid has 5 columns, of which first three are readonly and 4th and 5th are valuelisted dropdowns. The 4th column is called "From". What do I want to achieve: When form launches, I want to set focus to first row cell for "From" column and also have it in edit mode. What have I coded : I have written following function private void SetFocus() { _grid.Focus(); _grid.ActiveCell = _grid.Rows[0].Cells["From"]; _grid.PerformAction(UltraGridAction.EnterEditMode); _grid.DisplayLayout.Bands[0].Columns["From"].Editor.Focus(); } Which when called through form's paint event, works fine. But it is irritating to see the control get focus on each paint. Calling this on load, gets the focus right; but does not set the control in edit mode. Thanks already Jyotsna
