One option would be to try recreating these same plots using the ggeffects package. Here is a quick example of how you would do this for a binary logistic regression model without interactions among its predictors: data(mtcars) mtcars $cyl cyl) m The plots p1 and p2 can be customized further quite easily - see for example the ggeasy easy package, which makes customization of ggplots a breeze ( https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggeasy/vignettes/shortcuts.html ). For models with interaction terms, refer to the package vignette: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggeffects/vignettes/ggeffects.html
