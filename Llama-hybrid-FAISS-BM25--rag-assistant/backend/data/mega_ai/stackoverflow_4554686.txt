You'd have to call it on an object which is an instance of the interface, so either HulkHogan would have to implement IPerson or an instance of something which implements IPerson would have to be supplied to (or instantiated within, though that is not preferred) HulkHogan . More to the point (based also on your previous questions), what do you expect to accomplish by calling a method which has no implementation?
