How to model LCGA with time-varying covariate

We have the following data set that contains: Variable $X$ - measures a proportion of young employees in an organization Variable $Y$ - measures a proportion of young managers in the same organization $X$ and $Y$ are measured at 4 time points, 3 years apart. These variables are curvilinearly related to each other at each time point. We would like to test an LCGA model identifying class trajectories in X (including a quadratic term) and use Y at Time 1 as a covariate. Such a model will test whether management at Time 1 predicts employee class trajectories. Is this approach appropriate or we have to include Y as a time-varying covariate, as it correlates with X at each time point? is there a way to include a time-invariant covariate Z (dichotomous) that is expected to moderate the above-mentioned class trajectories?
