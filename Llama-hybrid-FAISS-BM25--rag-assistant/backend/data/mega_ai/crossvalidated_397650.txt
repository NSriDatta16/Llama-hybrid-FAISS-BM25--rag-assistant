change in frequency of time series data

I am working on a survey data which is quarterly from 2008 to 2014 and it becomes bi-monthly 2014 onwards. Can someone please suggest how to tackle this data? It is not possible to interpolate due to many missing values? Is it appropriate to use the entire data as one single time series and then carry out my analysis?
