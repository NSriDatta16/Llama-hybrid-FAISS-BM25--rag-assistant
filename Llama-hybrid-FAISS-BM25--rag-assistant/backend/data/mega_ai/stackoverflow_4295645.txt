It's not clear what you mean by 'a (animated) view' to capture, but be aware that android apps running with normal permissions cannot access the raw framebuffer. The computation part of ffmpeg builds in the ndk without undue work and there's a lot you can read about on the web, but the output (or in your case input) drivers are a bit of a permissions problem. Also you should expect encoding to be much slower than real time unless you can somehow manage to leverage hardware acceleration features of your particular device's SOC.
