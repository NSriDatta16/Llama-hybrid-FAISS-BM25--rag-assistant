While this does not directly answer your question, this might guide you a little bit. It's possible to balance out your lopsided training data. For example, if you are using SVM implementation in python's Scikit-learn library, you can specify a class weight ( details here ). There are some additional tweaks you can do but I think this could help you get started on it. I would definitely not suggest you to synthesize additional data as I feel this would create bias and is redundant. You might also consider checking out this post: SVM for unbalanced data
