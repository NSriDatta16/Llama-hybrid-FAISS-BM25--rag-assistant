These techniques do different things. Gradient descent is an optimization technique, therefore it is common in any statistical method that requires maximization (MLE, MAP). Monte Carlo simulation is for computing integrals by sampling from a distribution and evaluating some function on the samples. Therefore it is commonly used with techniques that require computation of expectations (Bayesian Inference, Bayesian Hypothesis Testing).
