Correlation between posterior samples of the parameters

I used Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to run a MCMC to some failure data in Bayesian analysis and the posterior samples of the parameters were obtained. There's a strong correlation between the posterior samples. Does the correlation affect the point estimates from the posterior values? Can anyone please help me with the interpretation of the correlation between the posterior parameter values? Thank you
