IDE capable of saving to two locations and a SVN repo?

I’m just wondering if anyone’s come across or could recommend an IDE that’s capable of the following: Key requirements: Save to two locations as a part of the normal save operation. (Local or network drive and a web server dev box.) Subversion integration (in addition to the above). Windows based Code highlighting (and ideally function completion/hinting, etc.) for PHP, JavaScript & HTML. Ability to switch between multiple projects. (And ideally export project configuration information.) Unfortunately, the only IDE that I’ve managed to locate thus far that fits the bill is Dreamweaver CS4, which seems like complete overkill especially when you consider the fact that it’ll only ever be used as a text editor. (i.e.: We'd never touch design mode, etc.) As such, I’m just wondering/hoping that some of you out there might be aware of a more elegant solution that fits the bill. Update to clarify goal The key goal is to save to a file server, a web development server (to view changes in real-time) and also to integrate with SVN. I realise this is odd - the rationale being that I'm trying to get the organisation I work for to take some baby steps towards using version control, and this seems the only feasible back door.
