You could simply try repeatedly until you get a number in the range you want, throwing out numbers you don't want. This has the fancy name "acceptance-rejection method" in math. It's simple, and it works. In case you're worried that this could take a long time, in theory it could. But this approach is used all the time in statistical applications. The probability of going through a while-loop N times decreases rapidly as N increases, so the average number of times through the loop is small.
