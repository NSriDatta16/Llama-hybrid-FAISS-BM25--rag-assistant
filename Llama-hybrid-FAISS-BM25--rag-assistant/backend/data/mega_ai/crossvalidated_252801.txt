Frequency-Domain Linear Regression MATLAB

I am trying to implement this tutorial Frequency-Domain Linear Regression https://www.mathworks.com/help/signal/ug/frequency-domain-linear-regression.html?requestedDomain=www.mathworks.com on my time series, but I don't understand part after first diagram, 3rdparagraph. There is sentence "Sampling the data monthly, the highest frequency in the spectral analysis is 1 cycle/2 months." How that can be highest frequence, isn`t it 1cycle/1month, because data are collected every month?
