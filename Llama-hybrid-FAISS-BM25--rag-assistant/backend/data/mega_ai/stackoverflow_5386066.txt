I would stop and consider why you are doing this. I can't help but think its not necessary. Even if you decide this is necessary (which i doubt) - You are pretty much recreating globals() . Type that into your interpretter and see if you still want to do this. Organize it further like senderle suggested in your other post. And maybe post a broader question with help for organizing your project.
