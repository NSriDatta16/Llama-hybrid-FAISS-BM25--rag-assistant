Your model fit, well. ARIMA(0,0,0) can often appear in time series. An Autoregressive Let us have a look at how an ARMA(p,q) (Autoregressive-Moving-Average) modell is structured. $x_t = c + \epsilon_t + \sum\limits_{i}^p * \phi_i *x_t-_1 + \sum\limits_{i}^q\epsilon_t-_1 $ An ARMA(p,0) modell is the same as an AR(q) modell (Autoregressive modell of order p) . It can be represented using the following representation. $x_t = c + \epsilon_t + \sum\limits_{i}^p * \phi_i *x_t-_1 + \epsilon_t $ An ARMA(0,q) modell is the same as an MA(q) modell (Moving-Average modell of order q) . It can be represented using the following representation. $x_t = \mu + \epsilon_t + \sum\limits_{i}^q\epsilon_t-_1 $ Hence an ARMA(0,0) modell is the same as an AR(0) (Autoregressive model of order 0) model or an MA(0) Moving average modell of order 0 modell. An ARMA(0,0) modell is shown in the next equtation. $x_t = c + \epsilon_t$ So the ARMA(0,0) model is made up of two parts: A Constant An error term This means ARMA(0,0) , but now have a closer look what ARIMA(0,0,0) means. The I in ARIMA stands for integration. You have to integrate the time series I before applying the ARMA modell. So in our case you have to integrate it 0 times. An example for an ARIMA(0,0,0) modell is a time series only containing a constant and white noise, so for example a time series in which all values are the same is ARIMA(0,0,0) Here is some explanatory code in R: Generate two processes FirstARIMA is a time series which consists only of a constant. SecondARIMA is a process which consists of a constant and a normally distributed error term (gaussian noise). library(forecast) ARIMA000 Shows you that the first process is an ARIMA(0,0,0) process. Series: FirstARIMA ARIMA(0,0,0) with non-zero mean Coefficients: intercept 10 sigma^2 estimated as 0: log likelihood=Inf AIC=-Inf AICc=-Inf BIC=-Inf auto.arima(SecondARIMA) Shows you that the second process is also an ARIMA(0,0,0) process. Series: SecondARIMA ARIMA(0,0,0) with non-zero mean Coefficients: intercept 10.1683 s.e. 0.2434 sigma^2 estimated as 0.6581: log likelihood=-11.57 AIC=27.14 AICc=28.86 BIC=27.75 I am plotting the two time series. plot.ts(FirstARIMA) plot.ts(SecondARIMA)
