The Microsoft stack is remarkably fast if you avoid all the drag/drop garbage that gives ASP.NET a bad name. IIS is a good web server. SQL Server is a good database. C# compiles to fast code. (qualifications probably needed here :) ASP.NET can be quite lightweight if you use it correctly That's the whole stack. It's all good. You can say what you like about Microsoft, its business practices and its consumer products, but their development tools and servers are top notch. My personal experience with their web stack includes a site that sees ~500 pageviews/second and seldom spikes the server above 15%. That's fast enough for most operations.
