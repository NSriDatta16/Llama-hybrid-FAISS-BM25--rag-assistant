If there's not otherwise pattern (such as a nonlinear trend), lack of slope in an added-variable plot would tend to indicate that the variable wouldn't help you explain the response over what was in the model. However, note that this is still a form of model selection, and will have a similar effect on your inferences* that other forms of stepwise selection would have. * (on test significance levels, confidence interval coverage, bias of estimates and standard errors and so on)
