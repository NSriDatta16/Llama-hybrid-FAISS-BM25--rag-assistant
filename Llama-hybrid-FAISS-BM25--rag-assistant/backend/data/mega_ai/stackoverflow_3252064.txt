Depending on how your repo is organized, you can use git filter-branch to create a new repo for each project, retaining history for each individual project only . Assuming your current repo structure is like this: repo/ project1/ project1-file project2/ project2-file project3/ project3-file You can first clone your repo ( git filter-branch will remove files and their history, so clone your original repo first ). Then, in your cloned repo, you can use git filter-branch to create a new repo (with all the old history) at the root of project1 : $ git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter project1 HEAD Now, your repo will look like the following: repo/ project1-file And it will still contain the history for all files that were stored under project1/ in the old repo. Repeat that step for each project, and you will now have three independent repos, with all the history for their relevant projects.
