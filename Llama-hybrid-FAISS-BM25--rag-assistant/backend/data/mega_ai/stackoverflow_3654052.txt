price filter problem in magento

In magento sidebar basically how the price filter option is working, i went through all the templte and block files under my custom design. I am getting this ranges by default. 1. $0.00 - $10,000.00 (1027) 2. $10,000.00 - $20,000.00 (3) 3. $20,000.00 - $30,000.00 (1) These limits are automatically taken but i want give my own ranges, but they are using only one template file called filter.phtml if i touch that then all other filter options are having problem. How can i customize this price filter as per my own set of ranges? I need something like this # $40.00 - $60.00 (155) # $60.00 - $80.00 (150) # $80.00 - $100.00 (153) # $100.00 - $200.00 (248) # $200.00 - $300.00 (100) # $300.00 - $400.00 (43) # $400.00 - $500.00 (20) # $500.00 - $600.00 (6) # $600.00 - $700.00 (6) # $700.00 - $800.00 (2)
