You may consider (emphasis on may ) embedding immutable meta-data in your file. (See the debate between me and an "older schooler" : Embedded Version Numbers - Good or Evil? ). Even though I have always considered that practice as evil (mixing meta-data information into data), introducing "merge hell", one could argue that it could work, with the right merge manager, for immutable meta-data with a fixed format , like: $Revision$ $Revision: 9.13 $ $Date$ $Date: 2009/03/06 06:52:26 $ $RCSfile$ $RCSfile: stderr.c,v $ But mutable meta-data like logs ? With unknown format or content ? That is bound to fail.
