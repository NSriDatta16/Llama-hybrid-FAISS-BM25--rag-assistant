Define data access layer

It seems that everybody knows you're supposed to have a clear distinction between the GUI, the business logic, and the data access. I recently talked to a programmer who bragged about always having a clean data access layer. I looked at this code, and it turns out his data access layer is just a small class wrapping a few SQL methods (like ExecuteNonQuery and ExecuteReader). It turns out that in his ASP.NET code behind pages, he has tons of SQL hard coded into the page_load and other events. But he swears he's using a data access layer. So, I throw the question out. How would you define a data access layer?
