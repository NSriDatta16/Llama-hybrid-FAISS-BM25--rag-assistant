Using derivatives as features is almost the same as using past values, as both reconstruct phase or state space for dynamic system behind the time series. but they differ in some points, like noise amplification and how they carry information. (see Ref : State space reconstruction in the presence of noise; Martin Casdagli; Physica D - 1991 - section 2) Notice all information is embedded in time series, but using derivatives is going to reinterpret this information, which may be useful or useless. In your case, if you use all parameters and terms, i believe there is no use in it. but in case of using some algorithms like orthogonal forward regression (OFR) it may be beneficial. (see Ref : Orthogonal least squares methods and their application to non-linear system identification; S. CHEN, S. A. BILLINGS; INT. J. CONTROL, 1989)
