How to increase the size of the console window in C#?

I'm creating a prototype for a piece of functionality that I will be implementing in an application, specifically I am displaying data from a collection to the console window but unfortunately some of the lines span wider than the default width of the console window. I've done a bit of digging and found that the only way to increase the width of the window is to dig into the Kernel32.dll and do it manually. As elegant as pInvoke is, does a "shorter" way exist to increase the width e.g. (Console.Width = 300) or is using the Kernel32.dll the only way. Thanks!
