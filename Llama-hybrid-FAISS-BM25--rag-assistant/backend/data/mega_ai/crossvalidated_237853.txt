Is there any programmer-oriented site for deep learning?

I browse and search some deep learning sites, but their contents always contain many mathematical notations or theories. That is normal, I know, but I can't turn them into real knowledge well if I wish to implement some "Hello,world." examples. Is there any programmer-oriented sites for deep learning? None or as little mathematical notations and theories as possible and focusing implementation is the main direction.
