Inverse differencing and inverse box cox on forecasted arima predictions

I am working on a time series project with non-seasonal data which has a non-constant variance. So in order to solve that issue I used box cox transformation to get the data in a suitable format, data %>% BoxCox(lambda) %>% autoplot() data1 = data %>% BoxCox(lambda) then I observed that first order differencing made the data stationery, so I fitted the following arima model to the data.. model After which I did my forecasting using the following function: modelforecast = forecast::forecast(model, h=10) now i need to get the data back in the original scale, so I did the following process: boxinvTransform But the results that I got are nowhere near the scale of the original data... original data: 456800 397800 383700 501900 417100 454100 434000 403700 566500 472200 445800 496500 523800 549600 the data that i got after the above mentioned process: -Inf 0.9434329 1.3769624 1.5894133 1.7242389 1.8205814 1.8943596 1.9534444 2.0023330 2.0437477 2.0794921 What am I missing? Any help will be appreciated.
