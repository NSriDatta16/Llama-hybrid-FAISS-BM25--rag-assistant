Should I trust significant variables from the logistic regression or variables with higher importance in RandomForest?

I am trying to build a model predicting a binary outcome, say screened vs. non-screened. A little bit about the data I have about 40K records. 86% of them have the outcome as screened. It's a very unbalanced data. And I have about 18 predictors. Most of them have a weak correlation with the outcome. The goal here is to find 3-5 predictors that are the most powerful. I tried two methods Regular logistic regression. As you may expect, most cases were significant due to the large sample sizes. > Coefficients: (1 not defined because of singularities) > Estimate Std.

Logistic regression has more significant variables. However, some significant variables are not shown on the top variables with importance in the random forest model. Two variables like no_health_ins and unemployed , which are the top 5 most important variables in the random forest model, do not even show as significant in the logistic regression. How should I interpret it? Is it because most variables are too weak? Should I pick the variables that were both significant in the logistic and show importance in the random forest? And is there anything special we need to deal with the logistic regression when the data is unbalanced? Should I do the undersampling/oversampling first? For the random forest, I try to apply the classwt , but both lead to similar results regarding the importance vector.
