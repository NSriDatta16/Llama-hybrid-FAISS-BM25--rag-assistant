Panel regression with proportion as both dependent and independent

I need to do a panel regression where my data is proportions for both dependent and one of the independent variables. I do not have the underlying data for the proportion so I cannot expand the data and use logistic regression. Any ideas on how to handle this? Poisson regression maybe?
