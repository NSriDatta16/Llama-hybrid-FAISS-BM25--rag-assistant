How do I keep two UIScrollView instances zoomed to the same level?

I have two instances of UIScrollView, and I want them to zoom at the same time. Anyone have any experience doing that? I'm using the NSNotificationCenter to tell my object when to zoom. Initially I thought I could somehow get at the currently visible rect, and just call zoomToRect: , but I don't see a way to do that. What I have now is setting the zoomScale and contentOffset properties. It looks like this: - (void)registerForZoomNotifications { [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(receiveZoomNotification:) name:ZOOM_NOTIFICATION_IDENTIFIER object:nil]; } - (void)receiveZoomNotification:(NSNotification*)notification { UIScrollView *currentScrollView = (UIScrollView*)[notification object]; // zoomLevel [(UIScrollView*)self.view setZoomScale:currentScrollView.zoomScale animated:NO]; // contentOffset [(UIScrollView*)self.view setContentOffset:currentScrollView.contentOffset animated:NO]; } #pragma mark - #pragma mark UIScrollViewDelegate - (void)scrollViewDidZoom:(UIScrollView *)pageScrollView { [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] postNotificationName:ZOOM_NOTIFICATION_IDENTIFIER object:pageScrollView]; } It's not working though, and seems terribly erratic. Ideas anyone? Should I be taking a different approach? EDIT: I should clarify that both scroll views are not visible at the same time. It's not important that they scroll at the EXACT same time, only that ones scroll view is at the same zoom level (and visible rect) as the other after scrolling completes.
