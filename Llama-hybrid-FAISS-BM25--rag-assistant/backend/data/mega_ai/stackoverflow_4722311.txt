taking the sample from Dennis, $ gawk -vRS="aaa" 'END{print}' file g h i here's another way if you don't know before hand, although not as elegant as one awk script. var=$(sort file| uniq -c|sort -n | tail -1| awk '{print $2}') gawk -vRS="$var" 'END{print}' file still, this will only get the duplicate that occurs the most frequency. it does not get the "last duplicate" , whatever that means.
