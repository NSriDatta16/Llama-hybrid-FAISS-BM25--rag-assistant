If you're going to just create a plain store, without content integration, like Eaton suggests, you'd better go with a dedicated ecommerce solution. This being said, if you decide to miss on the "extras" coming from using an integrated CMS/ecommerce solution like Drupal+eCommerce or Drupal+Ãœbercart, you should probably not be using osCommerce anyway, but rather look at something with a different code base, like Magento or ZenCart (which derived from osCommerce originally). If you chose the Magento route, specifically, you will find it is still possible to add Drupal in the mix afterwards if needed, thanks to an existing connector .
