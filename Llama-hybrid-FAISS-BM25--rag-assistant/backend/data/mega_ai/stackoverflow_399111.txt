I tend to think of it this way. The database schema is there to support the application's data storage requirements. What data the application needs to store will be determined by the end user's requirements. If you're not consulting your end user as to their requirements for the application you're obviously headed for trouble, but provided you have a good handle on their requirements (and likely future requirements) then database schema is a technical decision which can be made by the project team without direct input from the end user/client. An end user is unlikely to understand the intricacies of tables, fields, normalization, etc, but they'll understand "the system needs to do xyz". Talk to the end users in a language they understand, and let your team make the appropriate technical decisions.
