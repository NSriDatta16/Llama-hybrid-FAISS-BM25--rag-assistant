count(*) where cond = val, or count(cond = val)

What is the difference between these two methods? select count(*) from `table` where `column` = 'value'; and select count(`column` = 'value') from `table`; To me they seem to do the same thing; I assume this is not the case for the database. Does one method leverage indexes better than the other? In this case I use MySQL but a general answer is preferred here.
