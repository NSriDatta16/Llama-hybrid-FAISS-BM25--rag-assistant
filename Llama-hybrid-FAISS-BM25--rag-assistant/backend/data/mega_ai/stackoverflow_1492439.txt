how to organize the code similar to #region/#endregion in .NET?

While the code is growing big it is getting harder and harder to keep everything well organized. One thing I liked very much the time I developed in .NET was #region/#endregion which enabled to organize the code in logical groups and made further organization much easier. Does anyone know whether there is any similar code organization possible in Java?
