As Christian noted , this is a problem that can be easily tackled by linear regression given the simplicity of the design. The one caveat I would add is that because your dependent variable is an interval scale item, you may need to consider what the residual term for your regression should be. Two possible options here are interval regression and ordinal logistic regression , each with their own strengths. The former can be interpreted the same as any normal OLS regression, while the latter is more for understanding the probability of being assigned to one of the responses.
