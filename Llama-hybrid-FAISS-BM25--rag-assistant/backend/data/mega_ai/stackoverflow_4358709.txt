Zend_Soap - Error parsing WSDL: Start tag expected, '<' not found

For the same WSDL, which is totally valid, I am able to access it properly using PEAR SOAP like this: $WSDL = new SOAP_WSDL($this->wsdlUrl); $proxy = $WSDL->getProxy(); But not able to make it work through Zend_Soap, when used like this: $soapclient = new Zend_Soap_Client($this->wsdlUrl); I get the following error when accessed through Zend_Soap_Client: Error: SOAP-ERROR: Parsing WSDL: Couldn't load from ' https://abc.xyz.com/agent/TestService.php?wsdl ' : Start tag expected, ' Openssl is also enabled in my php.ini Does anybody know why it doesn't work? and how I can fix it to use Zend_Soap properly?
