I agree with the other responders: Sweave is excellent for report writing with R. And rebuilding the report with updated results is as simple as re-calling the Sweave function. It's completely self-contained, including all the analysis, data, etc. And you can version control the whole file. I use the StatET plugin for Eclipse for developing the reports, and Sweave is integrated (Eclipse recognizes latex formating, etc). On Windows, it's easy to use MikTEX . I would also add, that you can create beautiful reports with Beamer . Creating a normal report is just as simple. I included an example below that pulls data from Yahoo! and creates a chart and a table (using quantmod). You can build this report like so: Sweave(file = "test.Rnw") Here's the Beamer document itself: % \documentclass[compress]{beamer} \usepackage{Sweave} \usetheme{PaloAlto} \begin{document} \title{test report} \author{john doe} \date{September 3, 2009} \maketitle \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Page 1: chart} >= library(quantmod) getSymbols("PFE", from="2009-06-01") chartSeries(PFE) @ \end{frame} \begin{frame}[fragile]\frametitle{Page 2: table} >= library(xtable) xtable(PFE[1:10,1:4], caption = "PFE") @ \end{frame} \end{document}
