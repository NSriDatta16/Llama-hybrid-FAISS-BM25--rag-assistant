Troubles resizing SVG in Raphael

I am trying to draw this svg of europe using raphael. For each path in the svg, I've parsed it and do: r.path([countrypath]) . This works, but the problem is that it is gigantic. For example, some of the paths look like M 11689.234, 6005.2561... It isn't even coming close to fitting on a 500x500 canvas. How do I resize this? Raphael's scale/translate don't seem to work, or I don't know how to use it. I noticed in the SVG each path has transform="translate(5.875e-4,7.538462e-5)" Do I need to somehow change the viewBox? Or change the svg path's somehow before it touches Raphael?
