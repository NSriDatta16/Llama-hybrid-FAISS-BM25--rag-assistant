I don't fully understand. You should end up with a CAB file after the build of that sample. You then have to deploy that CAB file to the device. Probably the easiest way is to open the emulator, go into the Settings and map a folder on the PC. That will mount that folder as "Storage Card" on the emulator. Put the CAB in that PC folder, then on the emulator browse to Storage Card and click it to install.
