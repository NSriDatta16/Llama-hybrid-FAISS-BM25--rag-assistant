DSLs(Domain Specific Programming Languages) implemented using different GPLs(General Purpose Programming Languages)

I am looking for DSLs implemented using general purpose programming languages(GPLs) e.g., C#, Java , Scala and so on. Primary goal is to survey various important attributes of well-designed DSL implementations used in a daily basis in Software Industry. I would highly appreciate if you could point me out such DSL implementations (examples or repositories) and state your reasons why you consider it to be a good DSL. Thank you, Adil Akhter EDIT 1: IMHO, this post can contribute to create a listing of interesting prevailing DSLs used extensively in today’s Software Development (after searching, at least I could not find any such listings covering all the GPLs). One of the several inherent benefits of this listing – it can be used create taxonomy of the DSLs and domain they are targeting to. Followings are the related links that describes some interesting DSLs and Tools: DSLs ( categorized by GPLs): Ruby DSLs => Ruby DSL (Domain Specific Language) repositories, examples Clojure DSLs => Are there any Clojure DSLs? Scala DSLs => Interesting DSLs, Implemented in Scala? C# DSLs => SharpDOM ( http://sharpdom.codeplex.com ) Tools: Microsoft Visual Studio Visualization and Modeling SDK : http://code.msdn.microsoft.com/vsvmsdk
