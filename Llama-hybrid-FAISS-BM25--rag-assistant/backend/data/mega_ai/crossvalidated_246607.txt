Being Bayesian means that you pick your prior from your subjective beliefs OR as a reference that you can later calibrate if need be. There is no "true" or even "good" choice for a prior, even within a parameterised family, as for instance a Beta $\text{B}(a,b)$ prior on the probability $p$. Namely, there is no single choice for the hyperparameters $a$ and $b$ until you define the purpose of choosing a prior, an issue that is somewhat outside the Bayesian framework. (Even though priors can be compared by the use of a Bayes factor, but this is not 100% orthodox.) From a Bayesian perspective, the resulting posterior analysis is determined by the prior and relative to this prior. This means in particular that the probabilistic statements based on that posterior are relative, rather than absolute, which explains or may explain the distinction between frequentist and Bayesian probabilistic statements.
