Estimating Titan X graphics card impact on performance

I'm currently training CNNs using Tensorflow (Python) on my GTX 970 (specs here ). I recently took a look at the new pascal based Titan Xs and I'm wondering what an estimated performance/speed gain would be if I upgraded? The memory increase is an obvious benefit for larger models, but I'm mostly wondering about speed. Does the doubling of core count and bump in memory speed offer that much of a performance gain? Anyone have any experience with the new (or old) Titan X cards?
