The VS database project as it is now is more about the storage of the schema in source control alongside your application code. Migrator.NET and other 'migrations' solutions such as Liquibase and DBDeploy are more based around the change management task of applying the appropriate changes to a target server. Here at Red Gate we're hoping to improve the tooling in this area. If you're interested in learning about what we have so far, and telling us what needs to be done to solve your requirements please email me at david.atkinson at red-gate.com .
