Use AJAX instead of TagLib?

I was thinking about the idea of using Ajax instead of TagLib. The most elegant way would be: Using Java Annotation. The idea is, designers or anybody can make the HTML without any taglib ,just using the "standard" HTML tags with id or name, and call the Javascript. That way any WYSIWYG can be used, developer don't have to care about HTML format or the way it's designed. In many (at least open-source) WYSIWYG don't show the taglibs in that final result (or have a template of it), so it's hard to "preview". Other reason is, developer should know Java and HTML/TagLibs should not be a must-have, since we got CSS and AJAX. It should work just like that: MyClass.java : import ... // Use the ResourceBundle resource[.{Locale}].properties @Jay2JI18n(resourceBundle="org.format.resource",name="MyClassForm") public class MyClass { private Integer age; private String name private Date dob; private salary; @Jay2JLabel(resource="label.name") @Jay2JMaxLength(value=50,required=true,) @Jay2JException(resource="exception.message") public String getName() { ... } public void setName(String name) { if ( name.trim().equal("") ) { throw new Exception("Name is required"); } } /* Getter and setter for age */ ... @Jay2JLabel(message="Salary") @Jay2JFormat(format="##,###.00",language="en") @Jay2JFormat(format="##.###,00",language="pt_BR") // or you could use that to access a property of the ResourceBundle //@Jay2I18nResource(resource="money.format") public Date getSalary() { ... } /* Setter for salary and getter/setter for the rest */ ... } Page.html : of it can be a HTML with the fields filled; PageWithFields.html : Name DOB Salary That way the Annotation (no XML, it's like HTML in the way that it's only another file modify and XML is not Java) will define how the HTML will be treated. That way developer can stop developing in HTML and use just JAVA (or JavaScript), do you think that's a valid idea?
