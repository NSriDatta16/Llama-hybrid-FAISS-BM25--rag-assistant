I like to measure code coverage on any non-trivial project. As has been mentioned, try not to get too caught up in achieving an arbitrary/magical percentage. There are better metrics, such as riskiness based on complexity, coverage by package/namespace, etc. Take a look at this sample Clover dashboard for similar ideas.
