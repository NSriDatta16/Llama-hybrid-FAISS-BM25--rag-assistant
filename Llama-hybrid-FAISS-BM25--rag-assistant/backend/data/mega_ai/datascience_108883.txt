Machine learning problem - train and test with different classes

I have a datasets composed like this: library(caret) data So, I have 3 classes in total but: Train: setosa and versicolor Test: versicolor and virginica I tryed to set a decision tree, but obviusly it doesn't work because train and test haven't the same classes. My R code is: trainctrl Is there a model that if in the test meets a virginica class flower is able to tell me that it is another species? In other words, I want a model that can tell me that that flower is completely different from the ones he trained on. Is it possible?
