Use tcpdump in command line or wireshark in desktop. For example, to capture web traffic. tcpdump -s0 -i any -wfile.pcap port 80 To watch it directly remove the -wfile.pcap To read a previously saved file tcpdump -r file.pcap However for web traffic if you are interested of watching the http flow as it comes I like to use tcpflow -C port 80
