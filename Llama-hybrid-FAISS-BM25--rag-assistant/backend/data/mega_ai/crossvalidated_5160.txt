Nonparametric Bayesian analysis in R

I am looking for a good tutorial on clustering data in R using hierarchical dirichlet process (HDP) (one of the recent and popular nonparametric Bayesian methods). There is DPpackage (IMHO, the most comprehensive of all the available ones) in R for nonparametric Bayesian analysis. But I am unable to understand the examples provided in R News or in the package reference manual well enough to code HDP. Any help or pointer is appreciated. A C++ implementation of HDP for topic modeling is available here (please look at the bottom for C++ code)
