Have you considered our Confluence Sharepoint connector? It sounds like that's what your after, it will allow you to use Sharepoint for all the other features, but use Confluence as your wiki http://www.atlassian.com/sharepoint/ . Seeing that you already use Jira, you could use Confluence and leverage off some level of integration between the two products. Let me know if you have any questions.
