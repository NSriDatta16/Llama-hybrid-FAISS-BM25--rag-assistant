It seems to be getting confused when you click and hold and drag your mouse outside the 'movieShow'. Your document.mouseup isn't working so it never sets clicking to false; I think you need to define a mouseout for 'movieShow' that does the same thing as mouseup $('#movieShow').mouseout(function(e){ clicking = false; pageX = 0; })
