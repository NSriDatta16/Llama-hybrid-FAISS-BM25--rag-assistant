I agree with the previous comment on domain knowledge, that will certainly help. As you build experience, you will also get a "feel" for what works. Some parameters work better for NLP, other parameters are more nuanced towards image processing. That's stuff that you're only going to learn after being "in the trenches" for a while. To build that experience, you could try to build your code in such a way so that you try multiple models, each with their own unique parameters. When I am working with a new dataset, I might create multiple loops and/or threads that each build their own model and I'll compare accuracy and loss rates across all models and then narrow down which parameters I want to adjust. That creates a little more work on your part to create this approach and then track the results, but it is a good way for you to learn about what-does-what and it will help you make better decisions in the future.
