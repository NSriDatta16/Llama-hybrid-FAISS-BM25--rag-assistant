Doesn't aggregating time series sometimes throw away quantifiable uncertainty?

Introduction From time-to-time I hear a claim that it is better to forecast on aggregated data because it is more "stable" or has less uncertainty. Here is an example, although I know I have encountered this claim in various other contexts. Aggregates are less volatile and more stable. Hence forecasting at an aggregate level would have a lower forecast error. If the company is OK with weekly granularity, that's the way to go. Conversely, if you forecast at a daily level and then aggregate, any bias in the daily level estimate will get compounded after aggregation. If day to day seasonality is important (ex: weekend vs weekdays) then daily level forecasts become necessary. For example if you want to forecast for a calendar month then # of weekdays vs weekends / holidays becomes important. From my perspective a (univariate) time series data set is an instance of a stochastic process (i.e. a sequence of random variables). For example, if I were to do something like summation over an interval $I$ $$\sum_{t \in I} X_t$$ I would need to consider the change of variables which propagates uncertainty . Examples Constant Random Variable It is clear from a constant function such as $$f(X_1, \ldots, X_t) = 0$$ that it is possible for the probability over the image of a measurable function of a random variable to be degenerate (following a Dirac $\delta$ distribution). This exemplifies an aggregate function having less uncertainty in the output than the input when the input random variables are non-degenerate. Sum of Poisson Random Variables There are plenty of counterexamples though. For example, the sum of a collection of independent Poisson variables is itself a Poisson variable with rate parameter equal to the sum of the respective rate parameters. I.e. suppose $$X_i \sim \text{Poisson}(\lambda_i)$$ for $$i \in \{1, \ldots, n \}$$ then $$\sum_{i=1}^n X_i \sim \text{Poisson} \left( \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i \right).$$ Knowing the properties of a Poisson distribution, it is clear that the sum of the Poisson variables will have a greater variance than any of the individual Poisson variables we started with. Question Am I missing something, or is aggregating time series not always going to result in a reduction of uncertainty resulting in merely ignoring quantifiable uncertainty?
