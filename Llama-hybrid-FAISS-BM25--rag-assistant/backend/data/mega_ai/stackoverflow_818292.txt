If this is going to be for a public application, keep in mind that even if you can get SMTP access outbound you are likely to run into problems down the road. Anti-SPAM protections have gotten fairly picky about network behavior. For example is there is a valid SMTP server on the network and you setup another that may cause trouble for both servers if they appear to have the same IP address from outside the network. A couple of the major blacklists automatically block addresses that appear to have more than one server on them. If you are trying to get around a network admin, at best you are likely to have a fragile system in place. Depending on your network's rules/setup you MIGHT be able to setup your SMTP server package to relay messages off another email server on the network. This should require working with the network or email admin.
