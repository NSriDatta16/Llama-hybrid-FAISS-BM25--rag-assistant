Invoke method on property of each bean in collection

Suppose I have a class A with property b Class A { public int b; } There is a collection that containes instances of class A ArrayList col How can I get an array of all values of property b from col? Is there a way more elegant than iteration through col and getting property of each object and then passign values of b to array? LIst propertyValues = new ArrayList (); for (A a : col){ propertyValues.add(a.b); } Maybe a Spring utility method or something like that?
