Why Fragmentation is Done at IP why not for TCP/UDP

I am looking for the reason Why Fragmentation is Done at IP level but why not for TCP/UDP. Suppose say my frame looks like this |MAC|IP|TCP|Payload|FCS. the whole size if say for eg: 1600. PathMTU happens here, why fragmentation is implemented @ IP level is my question and why not implemented @ TCP/UDP level/code. Thank in advance.
