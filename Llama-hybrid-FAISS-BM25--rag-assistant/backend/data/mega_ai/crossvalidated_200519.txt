My choice would be to continue using p values, but simply adding confidence/credible intervals, and possibly for the primary outcomes prediction intervals. There is a very nice book by Douglas Altman (Statistics with Confidence, Wiley), and thanks to boostrap and MCMC approaches, you can always build reasonably robust intervals.
