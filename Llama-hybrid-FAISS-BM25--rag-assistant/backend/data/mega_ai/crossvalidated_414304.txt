Does this notation in the context of reinforcement learning have an unambiguous measure-theoretic interpretation?

In the context of reinforcement learning , I have seen the formula $$V^\pi(s)=\mathbb E_{\tau \sim \pi}[R(\tau)|s_0=s]$$ and $$V^\pi(s)=\mathbb E_{a\sim \pi}[Q^\pi(s,a)]$$ Does this notation have an exact meaning in the context of the Kolmogorov formalization of probability theory? (where we have a probability space $(\Omega,\sigma,\mathbb P)$ , and where variables like $a$ , $s$ , and $\tau$ would be "random variables", i.e. functions from $\Omega$ to some space). The reason it conflicts somewhat with what I'm used to, is that it assumes a "distribution" $\pi$ , rather than an underlying probability space. EDIT : after some answers: I can see how either onr of these equations can be seen wjthin the context of a probability space: in the first, take $\tau$ to be an element of $\Omega$ , and in the second, take $a$ . I can't see how a single probability space can simultaneously make sense of both of them.
