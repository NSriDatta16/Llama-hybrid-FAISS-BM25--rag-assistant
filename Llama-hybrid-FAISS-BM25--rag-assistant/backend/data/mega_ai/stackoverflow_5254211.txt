Fetching bunch of fields into a custom object defined in a package

Let's suppose I have a package A that has type type_bla is record (id number, ...); Also in the same package body I have a query, that fetches all the fields needed to construct the object. If I had a stored object I could do: select type_bla(t1.id, t2.foo, t1.bar ...) into instance_of_type_bla from table t inner join table2 t2 ON ... But since I have a custom type defined in the package - it has not a constructor, so I obliged to change it to: select t1.id, t2.foo, t1.bar ... into instance_of_type_bla.id, instance_of_type_bla.foo ... from table t inner join table2 t2 ON ... Is it more elegant way to fill such sort of objects?
