The great thing about XML is that you can organize it any way you want. For example: 1234567890ABCDEFG ... Hex data stream example This is a picture of ... whatever XML is a "human readable" way of storing data. Are you familiar with classes or structures? Both allow you to define a data-type in any way you can imagine (with whatever types are available for use). XML is similar in that you can define a new data-type (at least, that may be a convenient way to look at it). How do you want your data stored? Is XML the best way to do that? How should the information you have be organized in a structured document? These are a few question you should answer before continuing. The example above may not express what you are thinking about but can be modified to fit your needs. From the description of your data-storing needs, you probably can dump your strings in between the tags of your choice (whatever you decide they should be). As for the images, you might want to HEX dump the contents or base 64 encode them and dump the resulting string. Don't forget image format.
