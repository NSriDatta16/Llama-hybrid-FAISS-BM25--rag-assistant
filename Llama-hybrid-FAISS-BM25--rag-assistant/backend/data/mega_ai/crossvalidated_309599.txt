This is a very broad question. It is typically better to split something like this into smaller questions that stand on their own. You can fit a model to the periods before the missing data point and forecast into the missing time period. Or do the same "backwards" from after the data point. Or take the average of the observation before and after the missing data point, which is linear interpolation. Or include multiple periods before and after, possibly weighted. I recommend an ARIMA model. Depending on what you want, a hierarchical model may be helpful. Hyndman & Athanasopoulos, Forecasting: Principles and Practice is a very good textbook. You could try regressing your data on previous explanatory variables, then running an ARIMA on residuals ("regression with ARIMA errors"). The auto.arima() function in the forecast package does this. "The ARIMAX model muddle" by Hyndman is useful reading. You can normalize or not. Try both, with a holdout data set, and see which one works better.
