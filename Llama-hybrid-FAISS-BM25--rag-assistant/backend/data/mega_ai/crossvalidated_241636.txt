I recommend using a 3D convoluted neural network . Traditional 2D convoluted neural networks excel at identifying objects in images, and 3D convolution is used for identifying objects or movements also across multiple frames (i.e., time). TensorFlow offers this capability. The one problem with 3D convolution in general is that it requires a lot of memory, so you'll probably need to do this on a cluster, like Apache Spark. I like Amazon Web Service's (AWS) EMR capability; it installs Spark for you and only requires a few button clicks. Still, EMR doesn't come with TensorFlow out of the box, so you would have to install TensorFlow yourself. Regardless of the approach you take, you're going to need to dedicate a lot of your time. Based on experience, I would say 100-200 hours of installations and troubleshooting, probably a lot more if you don't have strong Linux/AWS skills.
