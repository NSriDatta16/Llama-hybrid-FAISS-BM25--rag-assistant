Count repeating "objects" in a picture

This is my first data-science project and I would love to get some guidance to know how to get started. My problem is the following: I want to count objects that are in a picture. This picture has a special characteristic, it's going to be "objects" over a white background. For example: seeds coffee beans painted black dots etc. The input for example would be: The output: Objects: 9 I've been doing some research already and I found many places that they recommend the use of an R-CNN to locate and classify my "items" in the picture. This sounds like a good idea but the problem I see here is that I do not know what I'm going to have in the picture. I know there are going to be "repeated items" of the same type and class but it could be anything. As I don't know what I'm going to have in the picture I don't know what to use to train my model. How should I proceed?
