That depends on how you set up your data. If you have a binary variable that gives you 1's and 0's for correct and incorrect responses, and use these for estimation (e.g., with logistic regression) then you have $n=200$ observations. If you don't use those 0's and 1's, but just use condition means (e.g., 34/100), then $n=2$. This should be clearly visible from your data set. By the way: almost every statistical software package reports the number of observations that have been used to obtain estimates. You can use that.
