As you can read in the answers to the question Ben James posted in the commnets people have concerns about placing commit hash values into files with git. Wouldn't it be possible to use a scripted solution outside of git ? When you need to deploy a new build out of git you could create a tag, check that out and before you put together your release tar.gz or whatever you add the name of the tag to each source file. Guess there are different ways you could automate this maybe with git-archive or whatever. Another thing that I was wondering about is that you could perhaps get away without any such tagging at all given that git organizes files based on their SHA1 hash value. So you could figure out which commit a given file belongs to based on its SHA1. Have a look at cat-file
