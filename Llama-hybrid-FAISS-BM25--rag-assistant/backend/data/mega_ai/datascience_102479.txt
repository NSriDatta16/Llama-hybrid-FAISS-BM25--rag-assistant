Assess the goodness of a ML generative model (text)

Take a RNN network fed with Shakespeare and generating Shakespeare-like text. Once a model seems mathematically fine, as can be assessed by observing its loss and accuracy over training epochs, how can one assess and refine the goodness of the result ? Only human eyes can judge of the readable character of a text, its creativity, its grammatical correctness etc. QUESTION : Which systematic approach can be used to refine a generative model (text) ?
