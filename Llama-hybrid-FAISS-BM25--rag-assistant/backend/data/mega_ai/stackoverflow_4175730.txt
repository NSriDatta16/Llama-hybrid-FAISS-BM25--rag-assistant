JSON on the SERVER It's not a bad idea at all to store JSON on the server, especially if you go with a noSQL solution like MongoDB or CouchDB. Both use JSON as their native format(MongoDB actually uses BSON but it's quite similar). noSQL Approach: Assuming CouchDB as the storage engine Baked in replication and concurrency handling Very simple Rest API, talk to the data base with HTTP. Store data as JSON natively and not in blobs or text fields Powerful View/Query engine that will allow you to continue to grow the complexity of your documents Offline Mode. You can talk to CouchDb directly using javascript and have the entire app continue to run on the client if the internet isn't available. Security Make sure you're parsing the JSON documents with the browers JSON.parse or a Javascript library that is safe(json2.js). Conclusion I think the reason I'd suggest going with noSQL here, CouchDB in particular, is that it's going to handle all of the hard stuff for you. Replication is going to be a snap to setup. You won't have to worry about concurrency, etc. That said, I don't know what kind of App you're building. I don't know what your relationship is going to be to the clients and how easy it'll be to get them to put CouchDB on their machines. Links CouchDB @ Apache CouchOne CouchDB the definitive guide MongoDB Update: After looking at the app I don't think CouchDB will be a good client side option as you're not going to require folks to install a database engine to play soduku. That said, I still think it'd be a great server side option. If you wanted to sync the server CouchDb instance with the client you could use something like BrowserCouch which is a JavaScript implementation of CouchDB for local-storage.
