Image from WebView dragged onto IKImageView

I have WebView where I load content of webarchive. In the same view I have IKImageView outlet. Image drag n drop from web view onto image view doesn't work for me. What is weird, it works when I drag photo e.g. from iPhoto onto the same image view. Also, I can drag image from my web view onto NSScrollView (which creates a link to the image) and I can drag the same photo onto a new Mail message (created an image as expected). IKImageView has "Supports Drag and Drop" enabled in the IB. What am I missing here?
