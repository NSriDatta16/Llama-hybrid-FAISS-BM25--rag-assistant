Best .NET Framework 2.0 book for C#, Libraries?

I am an senior-slash-"advanced" C#/.NET developer, currently using 3.5 Framework with WPF/WCF and Silverlight (WPF/E). I have come up right through 1.0 and 2.0 and so am well versed with the evolution of .NET. My next project could be "back" into 2.0 Framework, but with enough complexity (and time pressure) so as to call on "expert" skills, not just "advanced" ones. Thus I am looking for a book with comprehensive coverage of the 2.0 Framework, primarily the organization and use of the libraries (by which, yes, I really just mean "the Framework"...) available in that rev. I want to have a complete, organized reference on hand for what tools are available in the box, so to speak, to choose the right ones at each step and not re-invent any wheels. I own and love "CLR via C#", but this isn't a question about the CLR, it's about libraries (Framwork) primarily, and also interfacing techniques to .NET-supported related products. If I "subtract out" my existing 3.0/3.5 knowledge/experience, I might say that I've only ever thoroughly investigated and used some 50-75% of the 2.0 Framework - so what I'd like to see is an authoritative guide to the full 100%. Doesn't need rigorous details or comprehensive examples, but rather a full assessment of scale and scope to be able to design and implement effective solutions in .net 2.0 "the right way".
