You have basically two options: I: Use UISwipeGestureRecognizer Since I never worked used it, there is not much I can tell you about this way. Just see the official documentation for further information. You should know, that it was introduced with iOS 3.2, so there is no support for iPhones which are not running iOS 4.0, so especially firstGen iPhones will be excluded. II: Overwrite touchesBegan/Moved/Ended Read this post for further information, this should be exactly what you need. Of course, this solution does not only work for UITableViews but for every class that inherits from UIResponder (and consequently for every UIView).
