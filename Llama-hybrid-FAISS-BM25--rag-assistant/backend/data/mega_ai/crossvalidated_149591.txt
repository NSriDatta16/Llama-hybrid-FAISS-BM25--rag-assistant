This is a stochastic process. Depending on your model and assumptions, it might be a Markov chain. Stochastic Processes was one of the hardest classes I took in college and I don't remember much of it. But at least the term should be enough to get you started searching. You're trying to model the probability of the photon reaching Earth? Then, if you do have a Markov chain, you have an absorbing Markov chain in which the absorbing states are reaching Earth and getting lost in space.
