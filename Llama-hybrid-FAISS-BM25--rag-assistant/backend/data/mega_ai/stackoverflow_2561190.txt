My advice would be to map work/resources to features , not to implementation. There are a lot of reasons for this, but here are the ones I think are key: You'll communicate better with business types because your organization and work maps to their functionality. Many, and perhaps most, technical components will play some role in multiple features. It's much easier, IMO, to have many hands operating on one source file than to have one hand operating across multiple business functions/features. A good SCM will help with problems arising from the former. This doesn't eliminate, negate or trivialize the need for good internal communication, though. Tech teams must communicate effectively where cross-cutting concerns are identified.
