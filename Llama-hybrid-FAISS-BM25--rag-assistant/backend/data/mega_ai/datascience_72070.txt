Predicting if a search keyword is lower volume based only on high volume keywords

My friend was asked this question in an interview for analytics and I cannot figure out the answer so I would like to see how could this data science problem be solved. Here's the problem: Let's say the keyword "Superman" has a search volume of 250k per month. Other related search terms can be "Superman Logo" (55k), "Batman vs Superman" (60k), "Superman returns" (50k) etc. using which users search for a certain topic in Google in a country (say US). However, there may be thousands of keywords with the word "Superman" in it, and we don't always have exact data for many of these keywords with low volume (less than 1000). In order to find the volume of these topics we use predictions based on the data that we already have for high volume keywords. For example, we may say that the term "Future Superman" will not be searched by a lot of people and its volume can be medium (close to 300). Similarly, terms "Superman image" and "Superman jacket" will have medium volume and terms that people rarely search will have low volume like "Long Sleeve Superman Shirt" (100) and then there are terms like "cheap superman shirt" or "Superman college" which will have very low volume. Can you think of an approach on how you can classify keywords into "Medium", "Low" and "Very Low" by using some logic when we only know the high volume keywords? Your answer should be descriptive and backed by reason. (Hint- your approach may be to classify certain words which if present will make the keyword "low" volume or "very low" volume. Or your approach can be based on number of words in a keyword, spellings, where exactly a term appears in a phrase and other common human psychology that works during a search).
