How to drag and drop from one HTML5 canvas to another

I'm trying to figure out how to drag and drop an image from one canvas to another canvas. Assuming the canvases are next to each other, would it be possible to seamlessly drag something across the border? If not, is it a better idea to drag a div over the canvas, get its ID, and place it by responding to the mouseup location on the canvas?
