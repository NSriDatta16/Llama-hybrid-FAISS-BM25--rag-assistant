Loren's brute force solution is appealing as because it would allow easy "Intelligence adjustments" by adding more iterations. Also the adjustment factors for the iteration could be part of the intelligence as some value will make it converge faster. Also for the basic system (no drag, wind, etc) there is a closed form solution that can be derived from a basic physics text. I would make the first guess be that and then do one or more iteration per turn. You might want to try and come up with an empirical correction correlation to improve the first shot (something that will make the first shot distributions average be closer to correct)
