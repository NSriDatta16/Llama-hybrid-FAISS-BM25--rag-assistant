You are misusing the idea of "test" dataset in machine learning. A test dataset should only be used once. You are re-using the test dataset and changing the modeling choices based on that re-use. This is an example of data leakage which will lower the generalization performance. Additionally, the number of samples for the P group (3 and 21 respectively) are too small draw any meaningful conclusions. A small change with that few samples will greatly change the results, as evidence in those two reports. There needs to be much larger sample size to meaningfully apply machine learning techniques.
