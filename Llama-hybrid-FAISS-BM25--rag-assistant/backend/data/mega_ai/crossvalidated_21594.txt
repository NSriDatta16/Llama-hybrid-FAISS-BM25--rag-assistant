A fairly interesting question! At the Winter Simulation conference last month, in Phoenix, Zdravko Botev gave a talk on this very problem with a paper written by Pierre Lecuyer and Bruno Tuffin. It was applied to a graph model but the idea is there, indeed. (The program and abstracts of WSC 2011 seem to have vanished from the Web, how inconvenient!) In connection with the earlier question, aiming an MCMC at the optimal $q^\star(x)$ is possible. Since the normalising constant $Z$ is missing, a second MCMC should be directed at approximating $Z$, resulting in a ratio of integrals for which bridge sampling and other variance reduction methods should be useful.
