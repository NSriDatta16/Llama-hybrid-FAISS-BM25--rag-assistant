It looks like your dealerform model has_many items but your fields_for is submitting a singular item, so when it tries to initialize your dealerform in the create action it's trying to assign dealerform.item but there's no such method. If a dealerform has many items you may want to check out this example http://media.pragprog.com/titles/fr_arr/multiple_models_one_form.pdf for how to manage the has_many in a single form.
