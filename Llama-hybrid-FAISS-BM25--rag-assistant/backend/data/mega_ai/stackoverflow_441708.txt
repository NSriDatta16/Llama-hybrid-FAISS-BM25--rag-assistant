I would recommend not having any spot on the site commentable, but instead allow specific elements to be commented on. For instance, if its a blog, you could use each paragraph as an element that could be commented on. If its a code repository, then comments could be added to individual lines of code. Have a look at how The Django Book does commenting on paragraphs .
