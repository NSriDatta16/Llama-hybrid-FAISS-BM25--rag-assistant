Measure changes between the first and last point in a series of data

I'm unable to figure out what the common practice is for measuring changes across a selection of points in a time series, not just the difference of the first and last points. For instance, let us assume the following set of points: Month 1: 10 sales Month 2: 50 sales Month 3: 45 sales Month 4: 55 sales Month 5: 5 sales Currently I'm trying to track the difference each month as I go along, which results in 5. This is because between each month, I add the cumulative difference. Month 1 and 2 differ by +40, month 2 and 3 differ by -5, etc. Essentially, this means my result doesn't take into account any sudden spikes or dips within the numbers. Ideally I'm looking for some sort of method which gives me a good indication of whether the trend has been mostly up or down, but hopefully not be too influenced by one-off spikes, as shown below: Month 1: 10 sales Month 2: 12 sales Month 3: 90 sales Month 4: 11 sales Month 5: 9 sales
