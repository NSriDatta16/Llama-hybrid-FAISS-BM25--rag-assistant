Infragistics WebScheduleInfo Sample code

I am working with Infragistics35.WebUI.WebSchedule.v8.2. I am not seeing any good documentation on this on the Infragistics Web site. Does anyone have any sample code I could see? I am trying to create a week view of the calendar. One that "Admins" can edit and the rest of the users can only view. I would love to have a different dblclick event fire based on role, so that a read only version of the activity would show for non admins. Is that possible? I'm just using an access db on the site in the App_Data directory. I really just needed (I thought) an out of the box solution. Cheers.
