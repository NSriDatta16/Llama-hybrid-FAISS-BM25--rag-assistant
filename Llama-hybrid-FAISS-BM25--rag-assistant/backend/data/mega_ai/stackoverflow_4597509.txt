jquery drag-and-drop refresh div contents

I'm using jquery UI drag-and-drop. It is possible to refresh the div contents when a draggable div element been dropped? Please see my example code in the jsFddle . For example, I want the shopping div content could refresh automatically(the content could written by PHP) when dropped. What should I do? Thanks in advance!
