Welcome to the site. 2x2 tables do not have a direction of relationships. In any case, statistics do not reveal the direction of relationships, thought and logic and substantive knowledge does. That is, you (the researcher) figures out which direction (if any) the relationship might go in and then you use statistics to examine that relationship. Since you have 2x2 tables, you would probably want logistic regression as a tool to do that examination. You would pick a dependent variable and an independent variable and then do the regression. If you tell us more about your particular case, we may be able to suggest more precise solutions.
