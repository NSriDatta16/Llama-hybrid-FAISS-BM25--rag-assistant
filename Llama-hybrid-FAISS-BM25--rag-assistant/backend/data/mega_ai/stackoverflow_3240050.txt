A simple set "Event" of objects with a start & end time (Using Joda perhaps?) and description should be a good start. Drop them into a Timeline container that sorts them by start time, then running through the events should give you the data you want in any manner you require. Sometimes solutions are so straight-forward that writing a generic library for them will actually detract from your solution--it would just mask your storage structure, stick you with a non-optimal format and not really hide much code at all.
