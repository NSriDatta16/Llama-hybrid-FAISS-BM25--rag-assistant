This is exactly why I switched from Stata to R and Frank's rms package (called Design back then) a few years ago. Anyway, this somewhat hack-ish code will at least get you started. The syntax is a little outdated and there may be better ways to code this (haven't used Stata in a while), but here it goes EDIT: Re-written after my morning coffee... *** use automobile data sysuse auto *** create restricted cubic spline basis functions for mpg, with four knots mkspline mpgsp = mpg, cubic nknots(4) *** create the interactions gen formpg1=foreign*mpgsp1 gen formpg2=foreign*mpgsp2 gen formpg3=foreign*mpgsp3 *** Regressing price on foreign and mpg allowing for non-linear interactions xi: reg price i.foreign mpgsp* formpg* To test the total interaction test formpg1 formpg2 formpg3 Omit the first term for the test of any non-linear interaction terms, e.g. test formpg2 formpg3 To get the global 4 d.f. test for T , which in this example is foreign, that Frank mentioned in his example above test _Iforeign_1 formpg1 formpg2 formpg3 Just change reg to logit for logistic regression. To graph the result, you need to form the linear predictor, e.g. using predictnl , which I never managed to get right. See a recent presentation by Patrick Royston at http://www.stata.com/meeting/germany12/abstracts/desug12_royston.pdf for some ideas. Hope this helps.
