JLabel mouse events for Drag and Drop

I want to enable the drag and drop feature over a JLabel by overriding mouse events over it , but when I define the drag and drop in mousePressed event ,the mouseReleased does not take effect on that JLabel. Am I doing something wrong ? Thumbnails[I_Loop].setText("1"); Thumbnails[I_Loop].setTransferHandler(new TransferHandler("text")); Thumbnails[I_Loop].addMouseListener( new MouseAdapter() { public void mouseReleased(MouseEvent me) { System.out.println("here mouse released"); } public void mousePressed(MouseEvent me) { System.out.println("here mouse pressed"); JComponent comp = (JComponent) me.getSource(); TransferHandler handler = comp.getTransferHandler(); handler.exportAsDrag(comp, me, TransferHandler.COPY); }); *Thumbnails is array of JLabel When running the program , the drag and drop works but the statement "here mouse released" does not get printed. However, When I remove the code responsible for DND from the mousePressed() method, "here mouse released" is printed. What is the wrong in this code?
