You throw your iPhone in the air? Just a heads up if you're planning on putting this on the App Store - Apple rejected/removed an app that measured the speed an iPhone fell at while being dropped. The reason they gave was because it would encourage users to do things with their iPhone that would potentially damage it. Your app would likely befall the same fate.
