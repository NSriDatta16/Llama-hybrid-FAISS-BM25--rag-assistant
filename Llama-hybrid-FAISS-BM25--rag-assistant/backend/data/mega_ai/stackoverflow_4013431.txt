Can I forget about IE6?

I'm a consultant working on several websites and it has been asked that I make sure my work is compatible with IE6. Since Microsoft advised not to use it anymore and that an average of 6% of the users are using IE6: can I advise my client to forget about IE6 ? Edit: The website is consumer oriented on the internet. I don't think IE6 is a strong requirement for my client just an old habit that's why I ask myself if it's a good thing to advise against it.
