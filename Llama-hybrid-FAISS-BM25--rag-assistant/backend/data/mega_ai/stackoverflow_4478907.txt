Registers are the fastest. An accumulator is also a register in which intermediate arithmetic and logic results are stored (info from Wikipedia ). A stack will be slower since it's a region of memory, and memory will always be slower than registers. However, you will always have more memory available than registers since CPU storage is very costly. Bottom line: they're all useful and their speed is inversely proportional to their available storage.
