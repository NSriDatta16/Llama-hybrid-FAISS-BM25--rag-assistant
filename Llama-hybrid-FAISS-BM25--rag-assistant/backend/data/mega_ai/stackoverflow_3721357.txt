How to dump a Python dictionary to JSON when keys are non-trivial objects?

import datetime, json x = {'alpha': {datetime.date.today(): 'abcde'}} print json.dumps(x) The above code fails with a TypeError since keys of JSON objects need to be strings. The json.dumps function has a parameter called default that is called when the value of a JSON object raises a TypeError , but there seems to be no way to do this for the key . What is the most elegant way to work around this?
