Your results suggest there is an association between the presence of code and a post's vote category. Because you / a chi-squared test treats your variables as unordered categories, it is not generally meaningful to ask about "the direction of the correlation". The confusion is due to the fact that net number of votes is not actually an unordered (nominal) categorical variable. If you have access to the actually net vote count for each post, you can correlate a vector of 0's (no code) and 1's (with code) with a vector of net votes. Then you could specify the strength and direction of the association. You could also refer to the raw mean difference in votes as an intuitive measure of how the distributions differ. Regarding causality, statistical techniques (such as the chi-squared test) don't generally help you with that. (It may help you to read this excellent CV thread: Statistics and causal inference? ) To identify if adding code has a causal impact on net votes, you need a true experiment (i.e., randomly assign posts to have code or not). In lieu of that, you can try to search for an instrumental variable (also see: How do instrumental variables address selection bias? ) that would give you some leverage, but wanting a good instrument doesn't mean it's easy to findâ€”or even that one exists.
