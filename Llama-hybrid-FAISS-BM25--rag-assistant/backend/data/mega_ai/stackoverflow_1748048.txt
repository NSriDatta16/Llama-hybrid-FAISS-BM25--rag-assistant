Good Question. I think MVC and SOA will and must co-exist. MVC is the most sucessful architecture for User to system communication. SOA is an architecture for effective system-system communication. In most organisation, there is a place for both. Therefore I believe they will co-exist. In terms of how they interact with each other, my personal opinion is - MVC will remain (once the SOA hype is gone) as the core architectural pattern with both model and controller exposing service interfaces where appropriate.
