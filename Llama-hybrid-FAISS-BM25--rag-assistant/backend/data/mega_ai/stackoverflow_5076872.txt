How to use a custom protocol for my data transfer?

Friends, I am in a real need of information. I want to develop a protocol with some fields in it.After some study over the net I came to the conclusion that I can use HDRINCL to let the kernel know that the headers are defined in the program. But everwhere I saw that they say All the fields in the header of IP and TCP should be defined. Is it that I can use HDRINCL for my protocol to be used ?? Also one more doubt, suppose I want the IP functionality to be use, like fragmentation, by my protocol. The how to make a call the them ?? can I do so ?
