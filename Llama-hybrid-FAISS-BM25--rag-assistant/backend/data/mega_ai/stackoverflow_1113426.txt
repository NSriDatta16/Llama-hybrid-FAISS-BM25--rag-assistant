The source control system is separate from your IDE. You can use it from the command line, or from a graphical client as well as from your IDE. What you should know about a source control system is this: you save your increment changes to the SCM (source code management), and each save receives an unique id/revision you can retrieve any revision on any time, therefore changes are never lost this gives you the liberty to delete unused code, debug info, or to refactor existing functionalities and most importantly, it gives these functionalities to all members of a team, so that the team can work at the same time on the same code base, from their own development machines You could start with svn, as it's very popular (especially for open source projects) with widespread support. You can gen the command line client from here: http://subversion.tigris.org/ This is a nice graphical interface (windows): http://tortoisesvn.net/ This is a free book to help you start with svn: http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ If you need to setup a server on your development machine, this tutorial should help: http://blogs.vertigosoftware.com/teamsystem/archive/2006/01/16/Setting_up_a_Subversion_Server_under_Windows.aspx
