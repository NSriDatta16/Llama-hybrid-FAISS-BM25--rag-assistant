You should really try to avoid doing something like that unless it's absolutely necessary for the functionality of the web application. Be aware that: Not all requests can come from a client running on windows. Not all requests can come from a client that supports JavaScript. The user-agent header may not be present in the request. What is in the user-agent header may be missleading. A well designed web application should provide complete content and functionality regardless of what's in the user-agent header of the request or if the client supports javascript or any other clientside extension.
