I think in many cases the DTO model is not that important as the domain model, so I'm very pragmatic in this issue. We are writing DTO very close to what the client actually needs, because it is the only consumer. (There are processes calling the server, they are using different DTO's.) There could even be different DTO's for different views to the data. That's the power of the DTO's. To be clear: it should be driven by what the client needs, not client-specific . For instance, use general data types, not view-specific data types. Not every change (eg. UI design change) on a view should result in a change of DTO's. This is a general rule of maintainability, nothing special.
