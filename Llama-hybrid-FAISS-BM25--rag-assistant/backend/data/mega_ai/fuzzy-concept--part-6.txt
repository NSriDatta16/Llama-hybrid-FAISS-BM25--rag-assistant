o membership and 1 full membership." "Truth" in this mathematical context usually means simply that "something is the case", or that "something is applicable". Fuzzy set theory makes it possible to analyze a distribution of statements for their truth-content or degree of validity, identify data patterns, make inferences and predictions, and model how processes operate. Petr Hájek claimed that "fuzzy logic is not just some "applied logic", but may bring "new light to classical logical problems", and therefore might be well classified as a distinct branch of "philosophical logic" similar to e.g. modal logics. Fuzzy logic does not abolish the "hard and soft science" distinction, but modifies it, by redefining what scientific rigour means in many fields of research. Machinery and analytics Fuzzy logic offers computationally-oriented systems of concepts and methods, to formalize types of reasoning which are ordinarily approximate only, and not exact. In principle, this allows us to give a definite, precise answer to the question, "To what extent is something the case?", or, "To what extent is something applicable?". Via a series of switches, this kind of reasoning can be built into electronic devices. That was already happening before fuzzy logic was invented, but using fuzzy logic in modelling has become an important aid in design, which creates many new technical possibilities. Fuzzy reasoning (i.e., reasoning with graded concepts) turns out to have many practical uses. It is nowadays widely used in: The programming of vehicle and transport electronics, household appliances, video games, language filters, robotics, driverless vehicles and spacecraft. Fuzzy logic washing machines are gaining popularity. All kinds of control systems that regulate access, traffic, movement, balance, conditions, temperature, pressure, routers etc. Electronic equipment used for pattern recognition, surveying and monitoring (including radars, satellites, alarm systems and surveillance systems). Cybernetics research, artificial intelligence, virtual intelligence, machine learning, database design and soft computing research. "Fuzzy risk scores" are used by project managers and portfolio managers to express financial risk assessments. Fuzzy logic has been applied to the problem of predicting cement strength. It looks like fuzzy logic will eventually be applied in almost every aspect of life, even if people are not aware of it, and in that sense fuzzy logic is an astonishingly successful invention. The scientific and engineering literature on the subject is constantly increasing. Community Originally, a lot of applied research on fuzzy logic systems was done by Japanese pioneers inventing new machinery, electronic equipment and appliances (see also Fuzzy control system). The idea became so popular in Japan, that the English word entered Japanese language (ファジィ概念). "Fuzzy theory" (ファジー理論) is a recognized field in Japanese scientific research. Since that time, the movement has spread worldwide; nearly every country nowadays has its own fuzzy systems association, although some are larger and more developed than others. In some cases, the local body is a branch of an international one. In other cases, the fuzzy systems program falls under artificial intelligence or soft computing. There are also some emerging networks of researchers which do not yet have their own website. The following list is only provisional and illustrative — many more groups could possibly be added: The main international body is the International Fuzzy Systems Association (IFSA). The Computational Intelligence Society of the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc. (IEEE) has an international membership and deals with fuzzy logic, neural networks and evolutionary computing. It publishes the journal IEEE Transactions on Fuzzy Systems and holds international conferences. At the end of 2024, there were 238 chapters of IEEE/CIS across the world.
