There are many different distance measures. For starters, there's always the correlation. You can look at the mean square error . In R, you can see the algorithm for time series in Rob Hyndman's ftsa package (see the error function). See Liao (2005) for a nice short survey of time series similarity measures, including euclidean distance, root mean square distance, mikowski distance, pearson's correlation, dynamic time warping distance, kullback-liebler disance, symmetric Chernoff information divergence, and cross-correlation.
