How can I use assert_select in a Rails functional test to check for multiple elements of the same type, differing only by text?

I have a Rails view that outputs HTML similar to this: Keywords EN Accepted Foo Rejected Bar SV Accepted Föö Rejected Bär I'd like to use assert_select to ensure that I have tags for each language: languages.each do |language| assert_select 'body > h2', :text => language.upcase end But this fails: expected but was . is not true. /usr/local/lib/ruby/gems/1.8/gems/actionpack-2.1.2/lib/action_controller/assertions/selector_assertions.rb:299:in `assert_select' ~/foo/test/functional/api/keywords_controller_test.rb:123:in `test_html' I know that I can use assert_match %q{ #{language.upcase} } in my block, but that feels so crufty when assert_select exists. Any ideas?
