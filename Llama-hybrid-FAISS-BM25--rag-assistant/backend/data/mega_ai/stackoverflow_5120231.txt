When a module developer creates a module, it's up to them to make sure that each and every phrase that could be translated is marked for translation. In Magento this means Strings in template files are passed through the ->__ method Labels, parameters, and other strings in XML fiels are marked with translate attribute As an individual developer, if you're not developing applications/modules intended for translation it's easy to fall into the habit of not doing the above. Also, the areas of Magento's XML configuration system that can (vs. can't) be translated aren't well documented. It's easy to miss a string or two, and localization (along with everything else) is almost never tested. All of which is a long way of saying, contact your vendor and file a bug. If you want to play capitalism, since you've already hard-coded the translations, fix the core problem yourself and offer to sell the solution back to the onepage people.
