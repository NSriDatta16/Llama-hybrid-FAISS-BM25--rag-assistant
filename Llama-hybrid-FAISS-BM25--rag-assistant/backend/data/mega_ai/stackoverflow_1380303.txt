Organization of folders on VS Solution

Well, I'm a little worried about where to put the user controls and the forms (children and parents), the helpers classes and so on. So Im using RepositoryPattern for DataAccess and my Forms was added in the ViewLayer with any organization. I want yours opinions about using some Architecture for deal with this, or just create some folders as the follow and take in consideration some app namespaces (example : CompanyName.View.Controls for UserControls components) : ViewLayer : | |-> Controls |-> Dependencies |-> Diagram |-> Forms |-> Resources
