I just did the following and it works fine: Add a Panel to the Form Set the Panel Size to 100x100 Set AutoScroll to true Drag a Label into the Panel Set the Label Size to 50x200 Then run the project and the ScrollBar is visible and it can be dragged up and down. The only reason that the Panel wouldn't scroll if it is set to Enabled = false; .
