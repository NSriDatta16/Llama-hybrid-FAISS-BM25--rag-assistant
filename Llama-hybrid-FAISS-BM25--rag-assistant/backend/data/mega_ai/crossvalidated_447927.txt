Given you've already come across the Bayesian approaches (Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, or BART), why don't you use those? In R the relevant packages would be 'dbarts' or 'BART'. 'dbarts' has a companion package 'bartCause' which adds wrappers for getting relevant causal estimands out of the model after estimation, although I'm not sure how good it as with the CATEs. My colleagues and I are also working on a package for this, which will interface with the 'BART' package, and provide a lot of the functionality you're looking for - it's still in development, but you can find it at https://github.com/bonStats/tidytreatment if you're interested.
