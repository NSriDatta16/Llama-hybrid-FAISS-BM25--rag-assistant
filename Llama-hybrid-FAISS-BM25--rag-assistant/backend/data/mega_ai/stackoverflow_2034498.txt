If you want ways to debug production code, there are a few things you can monitor: Capture window.onerror events. Create a JSON object to log important events on the page. If you're worried your site might be slow, use "new Date.getTime()" before/after a slow operation to get the time it took to run. I don't know of ready-made tools for doing this. Generally people use an img tag to send a GET request back to their server, and then analyze the logs. Here's an example for logging JavaScript errors: window.onerror = function(errorMsg, url, lineNumber) { var url = '/js_err?msg=' + uriEncodeComponent(errorMsg) + '&url=' + uriEncodeComponent(url) + '&line=' + uriEncodeComponent(line); var i = new Image(); i.src = url; // Sends GET request to /js_err with info // Add some checks so that if above code throws an error, you won't // ping your server in an infinite loop } Then you can look at requests to /js_err in your logs to see what the top error messages are, and combine with the user agent of the request to see what browsers the errors occur in.
