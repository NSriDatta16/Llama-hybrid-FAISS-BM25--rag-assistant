Fit a GARCH (1,1) - model with covariates in R

I have some experiences with time series modelling, in the form of simple ARIMA models and so on. Now I have some data that exhibits volatility clustering, and I would like to try to start with fitting a GARCH (1,1) model on the data. I have a data series and a number of variables I think influence it. So in basic regression terms, it looks like: $$ y_t = \alpha + \beta_1 x_{t1} + \beta_2 x_{t2} + \epsilon_t . $$ But I am at a complete loss at how to implement this into a GARCH (1,1) - model? I've looked at the rugarch -package and the fGarch -package in R , but I haven't been able to do anything meaningful besides the examples one can find on the internet.
