NHibernate Reusable QueryOver

To keep my queries self-contained and potentially reusable, I tended to do this in NH2: public class FeaturedCarFinder : DetachedCriteria { public FeaturedCarFinder(int maxResults) : base(typeof(Car)) { Add(Restrictions.Eq("IsFeatured", true)); SetMaxResults(maxResults); SetProjection(BuildProjections()); SetResultTransformer(typeof(CarViewModelMessage)); } } I'd like to use QueryOver now that I've moved to NH3, but I'm not sure how to do the above using QueryOver?
