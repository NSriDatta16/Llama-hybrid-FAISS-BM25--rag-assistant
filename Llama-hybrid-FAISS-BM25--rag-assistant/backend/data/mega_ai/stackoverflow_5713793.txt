Implementing ActionBar tabs with v4 Fragments API

My app is currently using the Fragments/v4 compatibility package to support Android versions all the way down to 1.6. This means all my Fragments inherit from the compatibility package's version of Fragment . I'm currently trying to rework parts of the app to take advantage of Honeycomb features, like ActionBar . I already use my own action-bar-like implementation on pre-3.0 devices, and the Honeycomb Action Bar otherwise. This bit isn't an issue. The problem I have is trying to implement tabs using the ActionBar. ActionBar.TabListener expects the native Fragment and FragmentTransaction classes to work - so trying to use my Fragment classes (which inherit from the compatibility library) doesn't compile. So, does anyone have any ideas how I can use fragments that use the compatibility package version of Fragment with ActionBar tabs? tldr: how can I use ActionBar tabs with fragments that inherit from the v4 compatibility library?
