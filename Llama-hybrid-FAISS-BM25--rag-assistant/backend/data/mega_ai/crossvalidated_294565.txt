Which Machine Learning Algorithm to Look into?

I have tried googling and couldn't find much of relevance so I have come here to ask. In essence, I want to know which machine algorithm can be used to (well, to some extent) detect repeating patterns in say a scatter plot of data (as seen below): So I have highlighted with black outlined boxes what I would expect the algorithm to detect - two or more very similar patterns. Are there any algorithms that are able to do such a thing? It would be nice if there was a ready to go Python module so I can readily apply the algorithm to my data, short on time!
