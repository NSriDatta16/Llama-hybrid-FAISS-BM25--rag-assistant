The obliqueRF packages in R can do discriminative node models based on "ridge regression, partial least squares regression, logistic regression, linear support vector machines, or random coefficients." That might be a good place to start, as you could probably use the built-in SVM model to partially achieve your goal. Furthermore, you can take a look at the package source, and modify it to suit your needs.
