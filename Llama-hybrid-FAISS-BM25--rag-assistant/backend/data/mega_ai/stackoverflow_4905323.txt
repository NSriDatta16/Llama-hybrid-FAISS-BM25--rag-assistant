A double linked list to store the matched Alerts. Makes it easy to retrieve the first and last AlertID. You might will neeed to extend the double linked list to have a count field. Depending on your performance requirements you could group the Alerts from a list with a hash on the identifiers. And if that isn't fast enough implement a more complex tree structure that groups by the identifying fields. The best thing I can suggest is get it working in the most simple way possible, 800 per second is nothing. If you then have performance issues, then optimize. So much fun writing stuff like that using test driven development, beats the hell out of your average crud code!
