By "multi-process" do you mean multi-threaded? If we had two threads that do this routine i = 1; while(true) { printf(i++); if(i > 4) i = 1; } Normally we'd expect the output to be something like 112233441122334411223344 But actually we'd be seeing something like 11232344112233441231423 This is because each thread would get to use the CPU at different rates. (There's a whole lot of complicated behind the scheduling schedule, and I'm too weak to tell you the technical stuffs behind it.) Suffice to say, the scheduling from the average person's point of view is pretty random. This is an example of race condition mentioned in other comments.
