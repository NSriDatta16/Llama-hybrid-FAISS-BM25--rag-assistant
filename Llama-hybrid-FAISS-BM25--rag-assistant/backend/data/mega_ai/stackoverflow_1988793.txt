The PHPUnit Docs explain the arguments the command line test runner expects. In your case, you're providing Tests , which means PHPUnit looks for a class Tests in a file Tests.php . With this knowledge, it's easy to see that the best way to organise your tests will be to write one test class per file, with the filenames equal to TestClassName.php . However, if for some reason you don't want to do that, you can provide an extra argument to tell the test runner which file the test class is declared in: php "C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\phpunit" XTest Tests.php php "C:\Program Files (x86)\PHP\phpunit" YTest Tests.php
