If it is a multivariate time series, consider storing it as a zoo object by using the package of the same name. This makes indexing, merging, subseting a lot easier --- see the zoo vignettes. But as you asked about lattice plots -- and this can also be done. In this example, we construct a simple 'long' data.frame with a date column, as well as a value column 'val' and a variable id column 'var': > set.seed(42) > D Given that dataset, plotting per your description is done by xyplot from the lattice package by asking for a plot of 'value given data grouped by variable' where we turn on lines in each panel: > library(lattice) > xyplot(val ~ date | var, data=D, panel=panel.lines)
