Multinomial logistic regression with unobserved classes?

Suppose that there are 10 treatments, each of them applied to groups of $n_i=10$ patients (i.e. 100 patients in total). Three types of outcomes are measured on each group, defining categories $C_1, C_2, C_3, C_4$ . I want to perform multinomial logistic regression on this kind of data, which can be easily done in R using the command multinom . However, I did not observe category $C_4$ in my data. Question : How can I solve this problem? Do I need to remove category $C_4$ ?
