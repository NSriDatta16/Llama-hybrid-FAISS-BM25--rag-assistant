Does the Java URIResolver concept exist in C# and .NET?

In the Java XML transformation package, there is a concept known as a URIResolver , which is "An object that implements this interface that can be called by the processor to turn a URI used in document(), xsl:import, or xsl:include into a Source object." So, if your XSL has an import like this This allows you to take URI and map it to the Source of your choice - maybe it comes from a database, or maybe you want to map the URI to another URI. This can be useful, since you can't use an xsl:variable in the xsl:import href . Here is some sample Java code that creates a transformer and does a transform. URIResolver uriResolver = new MyURIResolver(); // sample TransformerFactory transformerFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); transformerFactory.setURIResolver(uriResolver); Transformer transformer = transformerFactory.newTransformer(); transformer.setURIResolver(uriResolver); transformer.transform(xml, result); Note, there are two places in the code where the URIResolver is used: TransformerFactory setURIResolver - "Set an object that is used by default during the transformation to resolve URIs used in document(), xsl:import, or xsl:include." Transformer setURIResolver - "Set an object that will be used to resolve URIs used in document()." Question : Is there a similar concept to the Java URIResolver in C# and .NET?
