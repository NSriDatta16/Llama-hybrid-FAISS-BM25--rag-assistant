It makes no difference wheter you use NUMBER(1) or NUMBER(10) . The storage requirements are the same and depend on the data that you store in it. The only possible difference in performance is between NUMBER() and NUMBER(N) because the latter will have to check the size while storing. But that is so negligible that it is probably not even measurable.
