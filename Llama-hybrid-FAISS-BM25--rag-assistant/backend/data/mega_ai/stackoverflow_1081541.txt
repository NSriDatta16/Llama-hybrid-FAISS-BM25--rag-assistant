How much a programmer should know about system admin?

How much should a programmer should know about system admin? I mean, obviously the more the better. But for the sake of argument, what is the average a programmer should know? I have seen my friend ( a programmer) does database schema design, database backup, database tuning, data migration etc. Sometimes I wonder whether he is a programmer or a system admin.
