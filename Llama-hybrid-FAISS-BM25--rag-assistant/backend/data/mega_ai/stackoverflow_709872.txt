How can I use any() on a multidimensional array?

I'm testing an arbitrarily-large, arbitrarily-dimensioned array of logicals, and I'd like to find out if any one or more of them are true. any() only works on a single dimension at a time, as does sum() . I know that I could test the number of dimensions and repeat any() until I get a single answer, but I'd like a quicker, and frankly, more-elegant, approach. Ideas? I'm running 2009a (R17, in the old parlance, I think).
