Find nearest points in a vector

Given a sorted vector with a number of values, as in the following example: std::vector f; f.pushback(10); f.pushback(100); f.pushback(1000); f.pushback(10000); I'm looking for the most elegant way to retrieve for any double d the two values that are immediately adjacent to it. For example, given the value "45", I'd like this to return "10" and "100". I was looking at lower_bound and upper_bound, but they don't do what I want. Can you help? EDIT: I've decided to post my own anser, as it is somewhat a composite of all the helpful answers that I got in this thread. I've voted up those answers which I thought were most helpful. Thanks everyone, Dave
