You can have non-zero $P(A|B)$ even if $P(B)$ is zero. This is called a vacuous truth . It will just make Bayes formula undetermined $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)} = \frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{ P(B|A) P(A) +P(B|\neg A) P(\neg A) } = \frac{0}{0}$$ If $P(B)$ is $0$ then $P(B|A) P(A) =P(B,A)$ is necessarily $0$ as well (since $P(B) = P(B,A) + P(B, \neg A)$ , and you get an undetermined division of 0 by 0. If you like you could still write the formula in the form without division $$P(A|B)P(B) = P(B|A)P(A)$$ Here you see why it is undetermined. If $P(B) = 0$ then the value of $P(A|B)$ can be any value while the left side remains zero. So, in that case, you can not determine $P(A|B)$ by knowing the other three variables in this equation of four variables. The multiplication with $0$ can not be inversed because multiplication with zero is non-injective and can not be inverted (and you could see the Bayesian rule as the formula describing this inversion). Why P(B) needs to be greater in Bayes Theorem? Because Bayes Theorem will be equivalent to division by 0 (or inversing multiplication by 0) which is indeterminate.
