What is a 1D Convolutional Layer in Deep Learning?

I have a good general understanding of the role and mechanism of convolutional layers in Deep Learning for image processing in case of 2D or 3D implementations - they "simply" try to catch 2D patterns in images (in 3 channels in case of 3D). But recently I bumped into 1D convolutional layers in the context of Natural Language Processing, which is a kind of surprise for me, because in my understanding the 2D convolution is especially used to catch 2D patterns that are impossible to reveal in 1D (vector) form of image pixels. What is the logic behind 1D convolution?
