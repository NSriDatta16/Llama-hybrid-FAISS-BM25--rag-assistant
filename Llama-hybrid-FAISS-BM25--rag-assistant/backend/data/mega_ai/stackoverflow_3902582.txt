Where can I browse common schemas?

It is hackish and myopic to write a new XML schema for a common data situation without considering existing standard schemas. It would be silly, for instance, to write a schema for recording internet bookmarks without considering XBEL . Yet while a quick search yeilds hundreds of examples of how to write your own DTD, RNC, XSD, etc, I haven't seen a site where you can browse hundreds of standard schemas for particular problem spaces, e.g. product catalogs for e-commerce, office inventories, or lesson plans for teachers. Where can I browse often-used schemas? EDIT: This question was originally about where to browse standard DTDs. Then it came to my attention that DTDs are dead - I've now changed my request from 'DTD' to 'schema', which I take to mean a "validatable specification for an XML-based markup language" EDIT: Links like these, only more comprehensive: 1. Wikipedia's list of Schemas 2. Altova's Schema Library 3. Liquid Technologies' XML Standards Library
