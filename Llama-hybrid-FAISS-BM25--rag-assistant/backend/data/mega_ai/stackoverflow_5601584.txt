Query Azure Table Storage without LINQ

Is there a way to query Azure table Storage without linq? I want to use >=, operattors on strings which of course linq will not allow me to do so. For. eg: I cannot execute below expression in linq as my PartitionKey is a string. (PartitionKey ge 'A') and (PartitionKey le 'R')
