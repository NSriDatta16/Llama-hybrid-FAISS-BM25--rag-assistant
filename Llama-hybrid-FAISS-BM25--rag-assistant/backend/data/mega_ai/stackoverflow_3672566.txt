I believe the provisioning for localized error descriptions has to happen at the framework level. In other words, the Foundation framework developers have provided more useful messages and had the localization folks translate them, etc. Judging by your description, the CoreFoundation layer hasn't received as much attention in this regard. Are there Foundation APIs that you could use here instead?
