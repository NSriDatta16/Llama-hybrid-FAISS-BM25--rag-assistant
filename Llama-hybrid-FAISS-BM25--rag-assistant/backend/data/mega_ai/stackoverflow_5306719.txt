Text Mining to extract animal types from text

I need to do an experiment and I am new in NLP. I have read books that explain the theoritical issues but when it comes to practical I found it hard to find a guide. so please who knows anything in NLP especially the practical issues tell me and point me to the right path because I feel I am lost (useful books, useful tools and useful websites) what I am trying to do is to take a text and find specific words for example animals such as dogs, cats,...etc in it then I need to extract this word and 2 words on each side. For example I was watching TV with my lovely cat last night. the extracted text will be (my lovely cat last night) This will be my training example to the machine tool Q1: there will be around 100 training examples similar to what I explained above. I used tocknizer to extracts words but how can I extract specific words(for our example all types of animals) with 2 words on each side. do I need to use tags for example or what is your idea? Q2: If I have these training examples how can I prepare appropriate datasets that I can give it to the machine tool to train it? what should I write in this dataset to specify the animal and should I need to give other features? and how can I arrange it in a dataset . many words from you might help me a lot please do not hesitate to tell what you know
