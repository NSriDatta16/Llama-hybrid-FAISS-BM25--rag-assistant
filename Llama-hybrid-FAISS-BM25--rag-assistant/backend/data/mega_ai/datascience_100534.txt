So in the example that you have given it looks like a linear regression can just be mad between "a" and "b", but if the entire tuple is being predicted, assuming varying values of "c" and "d", you could attempt to simply use "a" as the independent value and the values you want to predict as "b", "c" ,"d". Then you could attempt to create a linear regression based on this, but you would have experiment with results to see if this or another model would work. The only thing I would have to ask is, "Do we know in advance if "a" is going to keep on increasing at the same increment"? EDIT So I found an article using stock price data that could be relevant to your example. This article uses a LSTM model to predict the price of an asset and, when it comes to sequences of numbers that change patterns frequently, I can't think of a better example than the financial markets. Here is a more general introduction to a LSTM models . Give it a try and let me know what you think. Second Edit I found the following links. The first one is an actual library that implements LSTM and other neural networks. The second one is of a gui tool that implements it as well with the third one being the code used for LSTM in this gui project. The fourth link is more of an explanation of the code in the third link. https://github.com/zhongkaifu/Seq2SeqSharp https://github.com/bhrnjica/anndotnet https://github.com/bhrnjica/anndotnet/blob/master/src/core/nnetwork.core/network/Recurrence.cs https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5165357/In-Depth-LSTM-Implementation-using-CNTK-on-NET-Pla
