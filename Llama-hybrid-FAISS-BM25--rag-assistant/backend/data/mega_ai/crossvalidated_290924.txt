With plm(..., model = "within") you get the within model (or fixed effects model) and it estimates same coefficients for all entities. If you want different coefficients for the entities, you can use pvcm() to fit a OLS model per individual. Building upon the example from the help page ( ?pvcm ): library(plm) data("Produc", package = "plm") form |t|) ## log(pcap) -0.02614965 0.02900158 -0.9017 0.3675 ## log(pc) 0.29200693 0.02511967 11.6246
