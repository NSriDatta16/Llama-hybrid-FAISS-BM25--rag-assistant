I'm new to statistics and I know its kinda late but I'll try to answer in case its helpful for someone. I THINK its referring to the assumptions you make when you derive the Poisson distribution. So I'd recommend looking up how to derive the Poisson distribution. The textbook: mathematical statistics with applications 7th edition is pretty good. But I'll try to give a poorly constructed brief explanation here haha. So.. the way you derive the Poisson distribution is by modeling it after the Binomial distribution. Therefore it needs to satisfy the following conditions (to be a Binomial distribution): Consists of a fixed number (n) of identical trials Each trial has 2 outcomes P(success) = p = same for every trial Trials = independent Random variable Y = # of successes out of n trials So what they did to get to a Poisson distribution was said given some interval, lets split the given interval (time period/space) into n sub-intervals such that each sub-interval is only big enough for an event to occur once. So that way each sub-interval (trial) has only 2 outcomes: either an event happens or doesn't. They then claim that probability of an event occurring in a sub-interval is p for every trial, and the occurrence of an event is independent sub-interval to sub-interval. They then define lambda as lambda = n*p, and then say hey lets make a ton of sub-intervals (n) relative to p and everything. So they then take the limit as n goes to infinite of the probability distribution of the Binomial distribution (nCy * p^y * (1-p)^(n-y)). They then substitute p = lambda/n and eventually get to the Poisson distribution and they're done. So to answer your questions: Its just the probability of an event happening in one of those sub-intervals previously mentioned. So.. uhh as the number of sub-intervals (n) increase, the length of each sub-interval decreases (cause you're splitting your fixed time period into more parts), and therefore because the length of a sub-interval decreases, the chances of an event occurring in these shorter sub-intervals also decreases proportionately. Like idk.. if you're walking down the street for an hour, you see a person on average once every 15min usually, your initial interval is the hour, but as you split it more and more (n number of sub-intervals increases) the chances of you seeing someone decreases. Like if you split it into 60 minutes or 60 sub-intervals then you're less likely to see someone in a minute compared to seeing someone in an hour. The reason this is important is because when you're calculating the limit as n approaches infinite of the binomial distribution, if p didn't decrease proportionately as n increased then lambda = n*p would just hit infinite or something and your final probability distribution wouldn't be very useful probably. The sub-intervals have to be small because remember you're modeling the Binomial distribution and your sub-intervals are practically your trials. Also recall that a Binomial distribution only has 2 outcomes. Your sub-intervals are defined to be small enough that only one of two things happen: either an event occurs once or it does not occur at all. If your sub-intervals were not small, then it becomes possible that more than 2 things could happen: no events occur, one event occurs, two events occur, etc. So yeah they're small cause they're modeling the Binomial distribution. I hope that helps.. if someone who is more knowledgeable about statistics and the Poisson distribution can confirm what I said is correct, that'd be great. Someone should also edit the wikipedia page to explain cause if you didn't know how the Poisson distribution was derived then I have no idea how you could understand why the assumptions are made.
