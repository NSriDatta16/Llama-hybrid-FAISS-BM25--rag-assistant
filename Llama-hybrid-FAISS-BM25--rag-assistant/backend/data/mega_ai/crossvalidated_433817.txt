I would do it in 2 steps: You recreate your "raw" data. (This takes critical assumptions!) You take this "raw data" and bin it however you want. Step 2 should be easy and you should readily find guides for how to do binned histograms so I will try to give some hints for how to approach point 1: Distribute the total income to the 10 deciles of figure_1 to obtain the average income of the respective decile. Now you need to assume a distribution. For example fully homogeneous or you try to mimic the histograms overall trend by finding a simple function that somewhat fits it. Also for the first and last bin, you have to take additional assumptions. In case of your first bin, maybe find a reference to the minimum wage. Use these assumption to create your raw data: Python Code: import numpy as np deciles = list of average wages in each decile from small to large raw_wages = [] for i, average_wage in enumerate(deciles): if i != 0 & i != len(deciles): lower_limit = np.mean(deciles[i-1],deciles[i]) upper_limit = np.mean(deciles[i],deciles[i+1]) for wage in np.arange(lower_limit, upper_limit, difference/n): raw_wages.append(wage) For the first and last bin, be creative! I hope this helped!
