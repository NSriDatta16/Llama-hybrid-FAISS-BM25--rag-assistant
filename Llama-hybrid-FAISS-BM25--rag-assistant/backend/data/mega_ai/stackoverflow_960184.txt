If all you want is something real simple that the average user wont notice then use a series of XOR and shift operators. The problem with not using an array to store the 4 billion or so INTs is that you need a function that does a one to one random map across a domain of 4 billion INTs. You can mix a number of XOR and shift operators to create your own but it wont be hard to crack. Even if there was a well known one to one map it would also fail. Without a salt someone could just generate a simple rainbow table to break it. The problem with a salt in two way communication is that you have to securely communicate it. Salts have to be secret and once you know what they are they are pointless. If your looking to setup a secure channel of communication take a look at Off-the-Record Messaging Protocol version 2 . It will give you an example of how complex communication encryption can become. I'd suggest you find something well known that someone else has already created and tested. Even if you do use something someone else has created if you use it incorrectly it will fail.
