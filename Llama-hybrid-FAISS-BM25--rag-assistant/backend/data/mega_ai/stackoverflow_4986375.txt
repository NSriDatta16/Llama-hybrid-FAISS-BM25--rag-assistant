I personally think you should be fine diving in without C. Yes, Objective-C is a superset of C, but that doesn't that all Objective-C coding will require C knowledge. The situation is similar for C++. I say if you have a firm knowledge of at least one programming language and know the basics of C's constructs and syntax you should be fine to start the other stuff. You don't need to be able to write strong C applications before you get started with Obj-C, but it will help you a lot once you can. If you find you need to do something that requires deeper C-knowledge, then you can hit the C manual a bit harder, but it probably isn't necessary until you get to that point. You should be able to develop your experience of the two languages pretty simultaneously instead of having to learn C for a month before you can even touch Objective-C. :D Here's what the Objective-C books want you to know about C: typing system. Pointers, arrays, structs functions. general design and organization of programs. Since you're a ruby programmer, most of this should come fairly easily. The biggest shock is going to be moving from a high-level dynamic language to a low-level static language, so be prepared for some big changes, buts its nothing you won't be able to handle.
