I'm going to try and rephrase your first paragraph to make sure we're on the same page. I have a random sample of farmers (n) of the general population N. In n some observations apply a given technique to improve agricultural productivity whereas others don't. If they use this technique, they can choose to apply it on any given amount of area on their farm. I would like to test whether a given policy change influenced their choice to apply this technique and the subsequent amount of area where this technique is applied, once the choice was positive. We observe $n$ individuals, each of which has a farm with area $a_1, \cdots, a_n$ Then training is given to $m individuals, some of which choose to apply the new technique to a fraction $p_i$ of their farm. Ok? Here's the thing: if training is given to individuals at random, then you merely have another random sample of the population and no sampling bias issues should matter. On the other hand, if the $m$ farmers were selected according to some criteria (possibly researchers wanted the farmers most likely to apply the technique), you definitely have a problem. But then, the first-stage equation estimated by heckman in Stata would show insignificant coefficients and second-stage estimates would remain close to those of pure OLS. The best practice is to publish coefficients from different estimating techniques when in doubt. (Relevant analogy: a die with faces $D=\{1,2,3,4,5,6\}$ is a fixed set of integers. A die throw is a random variable, i.e. a function from $2^D \to [0,1]$ taking each subset of $D$ to a probability. Likewise, a population (with its measurements, assumed to have no noise, etc.) is a fixed set of vectors $\{v_1, \cdots, v_N\}$ -- but a random sample is a set of random variables , like $N$ dice thrown over the range of available individuals in the population. (I'm overlooking details about sampling with or without repetition.) It's important that these random variables are iid, otherwise basic OLS theory goes out the window.)
