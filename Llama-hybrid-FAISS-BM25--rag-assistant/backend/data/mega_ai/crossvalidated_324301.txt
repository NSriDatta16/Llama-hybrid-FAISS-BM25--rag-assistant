There are at least few ways how you could calculate the moving average, but basically for $i$-th point, the moving average with width $2h+1$ is defined in terms of moving sum $$ z_i = x_{i - h} + \dots + x_{i - 1} + x_i + x_{i +1} + \dots + x_{i + h} $$ and the next point is $z_{i+1} = z_i - x_{i-h} + x_{i+h+1}$, then you convert it to average by dividing by the width. What is problematic is the border cases $x_1$ and $x_n$ and there are several approaches how you can deal with them, for example take $z_1 = x_1$, $z_2 = x_1 + x_2$, $\dots$, or take $z_1 = x_1 + x_2 + \dots + x_h$, $z_2 = z_1 + x_{h+1}$, $\dots$, etc. Notice that in both of the above cases you can easily de-anonymize the values by taking differences between the $z_{i+1}$ and $z_i$ values, when you de-anonymize the border cases, then you can proceed to get the rest of the values. So if you publish the full series, then it does not provide any anonymization. It is an example of security by obscurity , a bad practice. There are probably adversarial ways to break this privacy, if one is sufficiently determined. I think in this case no one is. If you are saying that your data does not need any protection, then why would you bother with pseudo-anonymization? If it needs it, then it needs something that works. You probably would like to read more about differential privacy . TLDR; why won't you simply add a random noise to your data? The more noise you add, the more secure it is, the less, the more precise it is.
