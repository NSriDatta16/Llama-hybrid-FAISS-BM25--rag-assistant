I use this method on occasion and find it to be fairly accurate. The problem is that in large applications with a fairly hefty amount of debugging logs, it can be a pain to search through the logs for this information. So I use external tools (I program in Java primarily, and use JProbe) which allow me to see average and total times for my methods, how much time is spent exclusively by a particular method (as opposed to the cumulative time spent by the method and any method it calls), as well as memory and resource allocations. These tools can assist you in measuring the performance of entire applications, and if you are doing a significant amount of development in an area where performance is important, you may want to research the tools available and learn how to use one.
