Making comments into an answer: The Kolmogorov axioms are formal properties, calibration is not part of the axioms. The logistic regression model you mention is based on the binomial distribution. Estimated probabilities you can calculate from the model is binomial probabilities, so you only need to check if the binomial distribution is consistent with Kolmogorov!
