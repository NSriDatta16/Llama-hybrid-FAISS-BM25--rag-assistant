The reason the subsequent read speed is much higher than expected after writing a file, is that the file is cached by the OS in the disk system cache when it is written i.e. in-memory. The subsequent file read is in effect being read from memory, rather than disk. Please see this code project article which provides a solution for bypassing the OS disk cache by leveraging the FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING flag: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/files/unbuffered.aspx This solution can be used in your context to avoid OS disk caching, and so obtain "real" disk speeds.
