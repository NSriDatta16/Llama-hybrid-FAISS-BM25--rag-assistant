You could treat the test score as an interval between subjects predictor in a full model of that and the within effects. You really should be doing multi-level modelling at this point and I'd strongly encourage you look at some tutorials on that for SPSS. There is an alternative, that is not as good but might be simpler to understand. Let's say your primary question is whether the repeated measures effect is dependent on (interacts with) a linear effect of the test score. Calculate the repeated measures effect score for each participant and then perform a regression on the resulting effect scores. In general, once you have each subject with a single score you're interested in then you could analyze the continuous test score predictor how you'd handle any continuous variable.
