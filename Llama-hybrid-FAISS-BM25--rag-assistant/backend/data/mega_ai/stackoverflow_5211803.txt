Normalize your database . In your case, this would mean having a table Team (team_id, name, whatever else), a table Member (member_id, first_name, last_name), and a table MemberToTeam (member_id, team_id). In other words, move the member1ID and member2ID into their own table. Following this practice, apart from "improving" your database schema in the general sense, means that the query that bothers you will become trivial to write. If you know the member_id : SELECT team_id FROM MemberToTeam WHERE member_id = 1 If you search by first or last name: SELECT mtt.team_id FROM Member m LEFT JOIN MemberToTeam mtt ON m.member_id = mtt.member_id WHERE m.first_name LIKE '%your search string here%' OR m.lastname LIKE '%your search string here%'
