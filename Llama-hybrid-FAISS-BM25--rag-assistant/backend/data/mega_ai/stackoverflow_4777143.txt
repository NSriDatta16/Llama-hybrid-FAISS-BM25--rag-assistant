Initializing arrays with unknown size in HLSL

I have a small fragment shader that operates on a number of values in an array, however the size of the array is stored in a constant. The array is declared as follows: float4 colors[(blurRadius*2+1)*(blurRadius*2+1)]; and then I proceed to assign them values using a for loop for(int i = -blurRadius; i however, when run the code comes back with the following compiler error: error X4000: variable 'colors' used without having been completely initialized How do I completely initialize an array whose size I don't know in HLSL?
