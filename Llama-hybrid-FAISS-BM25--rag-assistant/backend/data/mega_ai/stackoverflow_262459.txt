Google will detect the decrease in links to the old domain and that will hurt it. Include some new interesting content on the new domain. This will encourage Google to crawl this domain. The 301 redirects will be forgotten, in time. Perhaps several months. Note that they redirected one set of URLs to another set, not from one domain to another. Get some links to some new pages within the site, not just the homepage, as these URLs will not be in the old redirected set. Set up Google Webmaster Tools and submit an XML sitemap. Thoroughly check everything in Webmaster Tools about once per week. Good luck.
