iPhone dev question: "No provisioned iPhone OS is connected" error, I don't know what else to try for troubleshooting

I am trying to compile and install my first application onto my iPhone after setting up a profile and certificate. At this point I am getting the "No provisioned iPhone OS is connected" error when I Build & Go. I am using iPhone OS 3.1.3, and Xcode 3.2.2 on 10.6.3. • I have verified that my iPhone is connected to my development machine (it is seen on the computer by both iTunes and Xcode Organizer (in Organizer, it has the green dot next to it)). • I have rebooted the iPhone and restarted Xcode multiple times. • I have verified that the Bundle Identifier in my appname.plist is set to com.. (with the appropriate values between the angle brackets). I have looked the error message up on the web, and so far have not found a hint that has gotten me over the hump.... Thanks for any and all assistance! Regards, Steve O'Sullivan
