Unfortunately, it it not that simple. Knowing only the marginal probabilities $P(A)$ and $P(B)$ is insufficient to apply Bayes theorem. What you also need to know is the conditional probabilities $P(A\mid B)$ and $P(A\mid \neg B)$, since Bayes theorem is $$ P(B\mid A) = \frac{P(A\mid B)\,P(B)}{ P(A\mid B) \,P(B) + P(A\mid \neg B) \,P(\neg B)} $$ In your question you mention base rate, in fact Bayes theorem can be applied to cases where you want to correct probabilities for a base rate. This answer describes in detail how results of diagnostic test can be corrected for base rate using Bayes theorem (nice examples are also given on Wikipedia in article Base rate fallacy ). Notice that such usage of Bayes theorem has nothing to do with updating subjective prior probabilities given the data as in Bayesian statistics. Applying Bayes theorem is not the same as using Bayesian statistics. I recently given answer to similar question as yours where I describe in detail that is the difference and how to solve problems similar as yours. In such case you need a prior , i.e. a distribution describing your out-of-data knowledge about some phenomenon (assumed distribution of parameter $\theta$); likelihood , i.e. a distribution describing conditional probability of observing the data you have given parameter $\theta$: $$ \underbrace{p(\theta \mid X)}_\text{posterior} \propto \underbrace{p(X \mid \theta)}_\text{likelihood} \; \underbrace{p(\theta)}_\text{prior} $$ So it is used in different context, but check the answer I refer to for more details.
