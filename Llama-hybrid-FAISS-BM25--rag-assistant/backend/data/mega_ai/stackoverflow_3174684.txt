I don't suggest using either "Setup Projects" ( aka Visual Studio Deployment Projects ) or Managed Custom Actions ( in your context you are referring to InstalUtil custom actions ). For managed custom actions I use Windows Installer XML - DTF ( Deployment Tools Framework ). This builds and packages your CA to look and feel to MSI like a C++ CA which means you can then consume it using InstallShield, WiX, Wise and so on. I also don't suggest using CA's as fake dialogs. If you want a fancier UI write an external UI handler ( not a simple task ). I suspect your real problem though is that VDRPOJ doesn't expose this very well, that WiX is lot's of writing in XML. InstallShield gives you a drag drop IDE for working on custom dialogs. But then that would be one of the many reasons it isn't free.
