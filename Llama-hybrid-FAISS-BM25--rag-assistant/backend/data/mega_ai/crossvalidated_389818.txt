Logistic regression when only TRUE values are observed, but a control sample exists

I'm involved with a creel survey. We have reason to believe that anglers are keeping the larger fish they catch, or at least that a relationship exists between the size of caught fish and the probability of retention. We have the potential for two datasets: A creel sample consisting of the lengths of angler-kept fish (obtained by interviewing anglers) A "control" sample consisting of the lengths of fish that our crew catches using similar methods. Let's make a couple of assumptions: The creel sample is unbiased and representative of the fish that anglers keep The control sample is unbiased and representative of the fish that are subject to capture by anglers. It seems to me that a logistic relationship "should" exist between fish size and retention probability. Instead of breaking lengths into bins and treating this as a categorical problem, I'd love to be able to use something like logistic regression as a simple way of modeling the relationship. The obvious problem is that we only have kept=TRUE fish in the creel sample. Is there a way of incorporating the control sample data that will end up with a valid (and interpretable) logistic regression? If I treat the control sample as having an associated response variable kept=FALSE, will the slope coefficient at least be meaningful?
