UIButton event 'Touch Up Inside' not working. 'Touch Down' works fine

I've got a UIButton in a UIView, which is in a UIViewController that I've allocated and inited from a .xib file. When hooking an IBAction up to the 'Touch Down' event of a UIButton it triggers correctly. But if I hook it up to the 'Touch Up Inside' event it doesn't respond. Other events don't work either. 'Touch Drag Enter', 'Touch Drag Exit', 'Touch Up Outside' etc. Only Touch Down. Does anyone have any idea why this might be? Rich
