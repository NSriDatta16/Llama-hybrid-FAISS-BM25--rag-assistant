But should your application always write to all backends? If not, you could use (as usual) another layer of indirection, e.g. storage = Storage() storage.use(TextBackend, XMLBackend, YamlBackend) storage.write(data) Or something like this, with Storage being a dispatcher , which would just loop over the backends and call the appropriate serializer. This is of course, very coarse.
