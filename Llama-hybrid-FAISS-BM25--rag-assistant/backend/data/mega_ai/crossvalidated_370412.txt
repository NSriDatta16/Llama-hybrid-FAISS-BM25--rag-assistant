Differing variance equations

I see both of these equations on Wikipedia and Cross Validated being referred to as "variance": $\mathrm{Var}(x) = \mathrm{E}\left[ \left( x - \mathrm{E}[x] \right)^2 \right]$ $\frac{1}{n} \sum_i \left(x_i - \bar{x} \right)^2 \quad \text{ where } \quad \bar{x} = \frac{1}{n} \sum x_i$ Does the $\mathrm{E}$ simply imply that the equation in brackets needs to be averaged over all iterations, hence why we place the $\frac{1}{n}$ at the front of the equation? I just need to be walked through how the top equation allows us to arrive at the bottom equation and both of these are referred to as variance. Also, is there a term you could use to refer specifically to $\sum_{i=1}^n(x_i-\bar{x})^2$ when not multiplied by $\frac{1}{n}$ ? Just sum of squares?
