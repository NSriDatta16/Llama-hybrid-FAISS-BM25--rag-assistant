How to make sense of Bayesian updating when an event is necessary

In thinking about Bayesian updating the following situation occurred to me, suppose you have a die and hypothesize that it's fair since you've gathered no evidence about this die. If you toss it and obtain a 1, then in some sense you've gained incremental--if weak--evidence that the die is biased towards 1. On the other hand, some outcome must occur. So in some sense, obtaining any event's outcome should have produced no evidence at all for bias. How would a Bayesian explain these competing intuitions about the scenario?
