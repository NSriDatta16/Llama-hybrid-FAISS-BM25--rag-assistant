General CS question about constants

I'm programming using C#, after programming on C. So I'm using a lot of constants such as "DEFAULT_USER_ID", "REMOTE_ADDRESS" and such... It seems to me that it's pretty "old fashioned" to use such constants and maybe there is some other more elegant way for using some constant data between objects. Any ideas on how this could be done elegantly? Thanks.
