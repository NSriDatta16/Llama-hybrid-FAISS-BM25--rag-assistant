Since you asked for patterns, I am assuming you understand the kind of logic you want to write on server side, but not sure about how to organize your code. You should look at strategy pattern ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strategy_pattern ) once. Since in this problem based on various locations on the screen, you need to change the way server validates the data, strategy pattern is a good fit for the problem.
