Josh said: josh: From the OP "What is the appropriate test to determine if the time series has increase or decreased based on the data? ". This I believe asks for a determination if the mean of the residuals has shifted not the parameters of some ARIMA Model. In my opinion you are recommending the wrong software/solution procedure but that's just my opinion. â€“ IrishStat Oct 28 '11 at 19:08 Suppose one starts with an AR(1) Model: $$Y_t = \gamma + \phi*Y_{t-1} + E_t$$ Where ${E_t}$ is, say, a Gaussian Noise (mean zero and variance $\sigma^2$ The mean of this series. The mean of the series is $\frac{\gamma}{1-phi}$ So, if for some time the parameters $\gamma$ and $\phi$ does not change, then so does the overall mean of the series. However, it any of these changes, necessarily the mean of the series will change. So, under piecewise stationarity, we are looking for changes of these parameters! If structural models are assumed, Auto-PARM is the procedure to use.
