MySQL Join Three Tables and Average

I've been puzzling over how to structure a special query, and the best I can figure out is that it would have to be some kind of complex subquery system. I'm not entirely sure, though. I have three tables, teams , matches , and scored . The teams table contains a list of team numbers and corresponding team names. The matches table contains a list recorded match results (one row per team per match), with the corresponding team number. The scored table contains a list of all of the information about each score the team made, and the corresponding match result id. ┌────────────┐ | TEAMS | ├────────────┤ │ teamnumber | │ teamname | └────────────┘ ┌───────────────┐ | MATCHES | ├───────────────┤ │ teamnumber | │ matchresultid | └───────────────┘ ┌───────────────┐ | SCORED | ├───────────────┤ │ matchscoredid | │ matchresultid | └───────────────┘ Given a teamnumber, I need to get the average number of rows in scored per matchresultid . How would I do that?
