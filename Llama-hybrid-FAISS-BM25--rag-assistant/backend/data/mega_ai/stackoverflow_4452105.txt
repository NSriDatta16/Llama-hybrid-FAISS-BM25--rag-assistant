In WordPress 3.1, the available post formats will be a fixed list. This is to encourage a set of standards among theme developers and it makes your format export-ready. There was a lot of discussion as to whether or not the list of post formats would be extensible. In the end, the core dev team decided to stick with a fixed list for 3.1. Once everyone is up to speed using them (hopefully by 3.2) the list will be opened up and you can add your own. Remember, post formats are used for styling posts. They are not post types - you'd still use the custom post type feature introduced in WordPress 2.8 to handle custom content. For a good example of how post formats can be used, check out Brian Gardner's blog . Each post is still a post, but he selects a specific post format based on the content of that post. If all he's doing is placing an image, he selects image . If it's a short format post, he selects aside . If it's a regular post, he'd select standard .
