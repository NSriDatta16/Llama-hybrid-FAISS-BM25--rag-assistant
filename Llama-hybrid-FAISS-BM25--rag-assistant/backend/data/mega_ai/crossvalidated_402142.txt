Can draws from a Bayesian model be used in a Kolmorogov Smirnov test to assess group differences, even though we use the data for estimation?

Suppose we have a Bayesian model where: \begin{equation} X_{iz} \sim N(\mu_z, \sigma^2_z) \\ \mu_z \sim N(0, 1) \\ \sigma^2_1 \sim Gamma(1,1) \\ \sigma^2_2 \sim Gamma(3,1) \\ \forall \ z \in \{1,2\} \ \ , i \in \{1, \ldots, N\} \end{equation} Suppose we obtained posterior estimates of all the parameters, and then sampled new values of $X_z$ by drawing sets of $\mu_z,\sigma^2_1,\sigma^2_2$ , and then plugging them into the normal distribution. Then, suppose this results in $100$ draws for the new values of of $X_1$ and $X_2$ , each ( $X_1$ length 100, $X_2$ length 100). Can I then plug the two vectors of the newly generated values into a Kolmogorov Smirnov Test, by doing something like the following? ks.test(X_1, X_2) I understand the K-S test relies on the two curves being independent, and generally if you obtain the parameters for a distribution from the data, and then compare the data, this is invalid . However, it does seem by drawing new values, there is independence based on the bayesian structure. Is this test valid?
