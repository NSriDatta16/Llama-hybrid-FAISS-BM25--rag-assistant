Machine learning on Percent as dependent variable

I am working on a problem where I am tasked to predict users into 'High users' and 'Low users'. Dependent variable provided is in percent of orders (%) which is calculated as (#orders placed/#sales visit). I want to model user characteristics to "% of orders" to be able predict which users should be targeted. I converted continuous variable to categorical after looking at distribution and below categories shows decent equal distribution in all 3 classes. "High" >=70% "Medium" 40-70% "Low" Questions: Can I remove Medium category to make 'High and Low" extremes as my aim is to predict weather user falls in High or Low category There might be users with less sales visits but high % of orders and vice versa. For Example, ----# Sales Visits-#orders-% orders-Target--- --user A--100-80-80-High--- --user B--1000-800-80-High--- is bucketing both above cases as "High" makes sense? Considering I have good sample population, Can I restrict my analysis on upper 2 quartiles on "#of visits" to overcome concern mentioned in #2? Thanks in advance
