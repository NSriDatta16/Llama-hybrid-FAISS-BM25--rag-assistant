You tagged the question as "C" too, then, speaking strictly about C, your initialization should fail as per section 6.7.8 "Initialization" of the ISO C99 standard. The most relevant in this case seems to be constraint #4 which says: All the expressions in an initializer for an object that has static storage duration shall be constant expressions or string literals. So, the answer to your question is that the code is not compliant to the C standard. You would probably want to remove the "C" tag if you were only interested to the C++ standard.
