Repeated Bayesian inference to track a time-varying parameter online

I have trouble finding the name of the problem (and algorithms to solve it) where one needs to repeatedly estimate the value of a continuous, time-varying parameter online based on incoming observations, without knowing the dynamics of the parameter changes, (which could even be random). This seems like a trivial Bayesian inference problem, but I get lost in the literature. If the observation model is linear and the parameter normal-distributed, what would be an algorithm that computes the maximum a posteriori probability estimate? I thought this would be the Kalman filter without system dynamics, but I am not sure since this would still involve a process noise, which I don't know how to define.
