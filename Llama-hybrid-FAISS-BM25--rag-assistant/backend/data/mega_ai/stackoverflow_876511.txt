Sharepoint Lists.GetListItems sorting

I am making a call to Lists.GetListItems web method of sharepoint through my c# code. Is it possible to get sorted list from the sharepoint? Or do I have to sort it after retrieval in my c# code? I was not able to find any option in query or queryOptions. Thanks.
