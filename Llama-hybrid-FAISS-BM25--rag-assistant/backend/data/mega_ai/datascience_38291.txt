Why is the logistic regression decision boundary linear in X?

The logistic regression model, \begin{equation} \operatorname{p}(X) = \frac{\operatorname{e}^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}}{1 + \operatorname{e}^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 X}} \end{equation} is said to create a decision boundary linear in $X$. As far as I understand, only the logit is linear in $X$. Is this the reason the decision boundary is linear in X? If so, why? And if this is not the case, what is the reason for this phenomenon? I am confused about this because the decision boundary can be expressed as: \begin{equation} \operatorname{p}(X) = a, a \in [0,\, 1] \end{equation} And $\operatorname{p}(X)$ is not linear in $X$.
