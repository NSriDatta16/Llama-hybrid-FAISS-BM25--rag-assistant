Jackrabbit / JCR organisation of text content data

i was thinking about, how to organize "normal" text content (i.e a String, HTML Code ...) in Jackrabbit. Are there any recommended structures for plain text content (like for files)? Should i store each text content as a binary (like i do with files) Node(nt:folder)--> Node(nt:file) --> Node(jcr:content with a jcr:data property which holds the binary) Or is it better to have something like Node(nt:folder)--> Node(nt:unstructured with a jcr:message property which holds the string) My third idea was to create a separate name space for text content Node(nt:folder)--> Node(my:text with a jcr:message property which holds the string) Node(nt:folder)--> Node(my:html with a jcr:message property which holds the string) ... What do you thing is the best solution? It would be great to discuss this.
