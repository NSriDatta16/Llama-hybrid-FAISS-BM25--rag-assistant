How should interactions be modeled in mixed-models?

It is confusing because I get so many different sources claiming different ideas. I am going to try to make it simple. Several individuals organised in 3 groups. We measure multiple variables at two time points, but of course, we are interested in how the health intervention influence at the end. Here I present several possibilities. lme(variable ~ time:group, random = ~ time | subject) lme(variable ~ time:group + group, random = ~ time | subject) lme(variable ~ time:group + time, random = ~ time | subject) lme(variable ~ time:group + group + time, random = ~ time | subject) Which one would you choose? And why? Which are the differences, strictly speaking, about the adjusting? My interest lies in capturing the significant statistical difference across groups and time.
