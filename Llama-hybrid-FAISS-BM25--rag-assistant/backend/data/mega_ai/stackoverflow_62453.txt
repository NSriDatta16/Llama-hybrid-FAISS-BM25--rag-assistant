There are four possible problems here; The namespaces in your code are dividing your classes too finely. if you have, for example; using MyCompany.Drawing.Vector.Points; using MyCompany.Drawing.Vector.Shapes; using MyCompany.Drawing.Vector.Transformations; consider collapsing them to the single MyCompany.Drawing.Vector namespace. You probably aren't gaining by dividing too much. Visual Studio Code Analysis/FxCop has a rule for this, checking the number of classes in a namespace. Too few and it will warn you. You are putting too many tests into the same class. If you are referencing System.Data , System.Drawing , and System.IO in the same class, consider writing more atomic tests -- some which access databases, some which draw images, and some which access the file system. Then divide each type across three test classes. You are writing tests which do too much. If you are referencing a lot of namespaces, your tests may be coupling too many features together. This kind of coupling can often be buggy, so try to break big, wide-ranging functions into smaller parts, and test these in seperate files. Many are redundant. Are they all used, or are they just copy-pasted from other files. Right-click on the code editor and choose from the 'Organise Using' options to remove unused statements.
