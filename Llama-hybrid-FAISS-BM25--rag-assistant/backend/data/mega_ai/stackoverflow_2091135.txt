The actual amount of data that can be sent in a single packet depends on what the Maximum Transmission Unit ( MTU ) is for the protocol you're using. Read the Wikipedia article for more information. This is generally something you don't have to worry about, though - if you send a TCP packet that's too big, the operating system will fragment it (turn it into multiple packets) for you and it will be reassembled at the host. By the way, Python's socket library uses the operating system's sockets, so it's nothing particular to Python.
