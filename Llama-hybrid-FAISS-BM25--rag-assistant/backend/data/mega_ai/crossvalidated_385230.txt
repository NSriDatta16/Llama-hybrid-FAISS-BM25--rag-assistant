If I understand your question properly, what you need is not a confidence interval for $p$ but a prediction-interval for $X$ . Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_m$ be the number of parts you needed to use to repair a car in the last $m$ time. We know $X_i$ must take a value in $\{1,2, \dots, n\}$ . For example, you may have data like $3, 1, 40, 23, \dots, 11$ . Since some parts in a car always broken together, Binomial assumption may not suitable in this case. However, we may assume each $X_i$ is independent to each other and is identically distributed. I guess your main interest is to know a prediction interval $[a,b] \subset [1, n]$ which have a coverage guarantee (let say 95%) such that $$ \mathbb{P}(X \in [a,b]) \geq 0.95 $$ where $X$ is a 'new' random number you will encounter in the next car repairment. One possible way is to use the exchangeability assumption to build a prediction interval which is often called conformal prediction . Let me explain one simplest way to build the prediction interval : Split data into two sets randomly. Let say $D_1 = \{X_{1,i}\}$ and $D_2 = \{X_{2,i}\}$ are the two sets. Calculate sample mean by only using $D_1$ . Let $\bar{X}_1$ be the calculated sample mean. By using data in $D_2$ , calculate upper and lower 0.025 quantiles of $\{X_{2,i} - \bar{X}_1\}$ . Let $q_l$ and $q_u$ the calculated quantiles. Then, it can be shown that the interval $[\bar{X}_1 + q_l, \bar{X}_1 + q_2]$ is a prediction interval with 95% coverage. This is not an optimal one but is vaild. For technical detail and optimal interval, please see https://arxiv.org/pdf/1111.1418.pdf .
