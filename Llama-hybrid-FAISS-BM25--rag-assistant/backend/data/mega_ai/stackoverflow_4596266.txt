You can use double-braces: testCollision(getObject(), new HashSet (){{ add(obj1); add(obj2);}}; or: Set set = new HashSet (){{ add("hello"); add("goodbye"); }}; This is called double-brace initialization, and it's one of the lesser known features of Java. What it does is cause the compiler to create an anonymous inner class that does the creation and manipulation for you (So, for example, if your class was final, you couldn't use it.) Now, having said that - I'd encourage you only to use it in cases where you really need the brevity. It's almost always better to be more explicit, so that it's easier to understand your code.
