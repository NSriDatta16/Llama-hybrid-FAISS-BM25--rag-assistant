Bachelor of Information Technology. Speaking as an Australian whose Bachelor degree involved programming but wasn't labelled "Information Technology", I would strongly recommend getting an IT degree if you want to work in IT (which Data Science would be classified as). I've spent multiple years trying to find work in IT with no success, which is why I've gone back to university to get a Masters Degree that actually says "IT" in its name.
