I prefer to equivalently view the AFT model in terms of a generalized linear model like logistic regression or Poisson regression. In these models there is no "error term." There is simply a likelihood and a parameterization of the mean that is estimated through maximum likelihood. Most documentation describe an AFT model in terms of a log scale parameter and an "error term." While this is technically correct, I do not find it easy to think about or work with. The intercept in, say, a Weibull AFT model represents the log of the scale parameter of the Weibull distribution, $\text{log}(\lambda)$ , for the reference class in your model ( Weibull - Wikipedia ). This parameter might just as easily be referred to as a shape parameter instead of a scale parameter. AFT models are typically parameterized in terms of shape and scale parameters instead of mean and scale. The good news is that with skewed distributions we are most often interested in comparing percentiles between groups (like medians). Estimates of these percentiles and their standard errors are easily requested from the procedure. (There is no need to directly interpret the intercept term.) If you construct a Wald interval for a percentile I suggest using a log link function.
