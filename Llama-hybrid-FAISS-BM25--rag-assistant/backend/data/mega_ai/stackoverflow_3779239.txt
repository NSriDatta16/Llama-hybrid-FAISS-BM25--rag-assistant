How do I filter through data in Cassandra?

I've been using mySQL for an app for some time, and the more data I collect, the slower it gets. So I have been looking into NOSQL options. One of the things I have in mySQL is a View created from a bunch of joins. The app shows all the important info in a grid, and the user can select ranges, do searches, etc. On this data set. Standard Query stuff. Looking at Cassandra everything is already sorted based on the parameters I provide in my storage-conf.xml. So I would have a certain string as my key in the SuperColumn, and keep a bunch of the data in Columns below that. But I can only sort by one Column, and I can't do any real searching within the columns without pulling all the SuperColumns, and looping through the data, right? I don't want to duplicate data across different ColumnFamilies, so I want to make sure Cassandra is appropriate for me. In Facebook, Digg, Twitter, they have plenty of searching functions, so maybe I am just not seeing the solution. Is there a way with Cassandra for me to search for or filter specific data values in a SuperColumn, or its associated Column(s)? If not, is there another NOSQL option? In the example below, it seems I can only query for phatduckk, friend1,John, etc. But what if I wanted to find anyone in the ColumnFamily that lived in city == "Beverley Hills"? Can it be done without returning all records? If so, could I do a search for city == "Beverley Hills" AND state == "CA"? It doesn't seem like I can do either, but I want to make sure and see what my options are. AddressBook = { // this is a ColumnFamily of type Super phatduckk: { // this is the key to this row inside the Super CF friend1: {street: "8th street", zip: "90210", city: "Beverley Hills", state: "CA"}, John: {street: "Howard street", zip: "94404", city: "FC", state: "CA"}, Kim: {street: "X street", zip: "87876", city: "Balls", state: "VA"}, Tod: {street: "Jerry street", zip: "54556", city: "Cartoon", state: "CO"}, Bob: {street: "Q Blvd", zip: "24252", city: "Nowhere", state: "MN"}, }, // end row ieure: { joey: {street: "A ave", zip: "55485", city: "Hell", state: "NV"}, William: {street: "Armpit Dr", zip: "93301", city: "Bakersfield", state: "CA"}, }, }
