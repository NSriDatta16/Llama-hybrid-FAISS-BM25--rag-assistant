Is there a stats tool for this analysis I run in excel?

I am trying to find a statistical or machine learning tool that replicates this analysis I am doing manually in excel. Each row in my data set is a user. User | sites visits | pages viewed | items added to cart | Purchased (1 or 0) I set up a pivot table so Purchased is in the columns field. I have it set to % of row. Purchased Didn't Purchase Total 80% 20% 100% I then add all the other variables as filters in the Pivot Table. I start by filtering out the people who didn't view 1 page and see how that impacts that % of people who purchased. I then filter out the people who didn't view 2 pages, etc. I then start filtering out other variables to see how the interactions work together. I am looking for a combination of inputs that leads to an 80% purchase rate. So maybe it's 2 visits, 6 pageviews, and 2 add to carts. Is there a tool that automates this type of analysis?
