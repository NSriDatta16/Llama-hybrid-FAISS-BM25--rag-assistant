You're correct, you are not getting only one model, but the performance of many. This is what happens every time we do cross-validation in usual (non time-series related) problems. In short, this is cross-validation . The figure you posted depicts the usual way to do cross-validation in time series. The principle is that you should always evaluate your model with future data. You could also do that without superposition of intervals, but then you'd have weaker estimates.
