As stated in your linked question, there cannot be a rule of thumb. It only depends on the problem, i.e the distributions of your target and your features. And that is also not the question you have to ask. The only thing you should be interested is, does this svm overfit the training data or not. And therefore you have to use techniques like cross validation, or simply resereve some data as a testsample and check the result there. There is no way around!
