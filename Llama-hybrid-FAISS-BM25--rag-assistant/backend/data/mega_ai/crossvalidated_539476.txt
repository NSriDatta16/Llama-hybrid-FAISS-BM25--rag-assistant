You have to know that you have four parameters $\theta=(p,\overline{p}, a, b)$ where $P=\begin{pmatrix} a & 1-a\\ b & 1-b \end{pmatrix}$ is the transition matrix of the Markov chain $x_t$ . When you suppose that $x_t$ have no memory, this mean that the probability of going from 1 to 0 is the same as the one of going from 0 to 0. So the transition matrix is no more a $2\times2$ matrix but should be like $P=\begin{pmatrix} a & 1-a\\ a & 1-a \end{pmatrix}$ or just $P=\begin{pmatrix} P(x_t=0)=a & P(x_t=1)=1-a \end{pmatrix}$ . With this kind of model, if you used the $4$ previous parameters, you will over-parametrize the model and it will lead to an non identifiability.
