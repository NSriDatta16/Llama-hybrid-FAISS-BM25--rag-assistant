urllib2 is part of the standard library, pycurl isn't (so it requires a separate step of download/install/package etc). That alone, quite apart from any difference in intrinsic quality, is guaranteed to make urllib2 more popular (and can be a pretty good pragmatical reason to pick it -- convenience !-).
