Optimal Combination Forecasts

Can someone give me an intuitive explanation of how Optimal Combination Forecasts work for hierarchical time series? I've been reading Rob Hyndman's paper and understand that the resolved forecasts can be written as $\widetilde{Y}_h = SP\hat{Y}_n(h)$. This is pretty simple and intuitive when considering a top-down method. But how exactly does optimal combination work with and without weights? I don't see how $P = (S'\Sigma_h^{\dagger}S)^{-1}S'\Sigma_h^{\dagger}$ resolves the forecasts so they sum to the proper amount at higher levels.
