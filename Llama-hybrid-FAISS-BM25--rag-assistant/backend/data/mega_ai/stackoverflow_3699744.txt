dot notation equivalent for JOIN

string[] names = { "Burke", "Connor", "Frank", "Albert", "George", "Harris", "David" }; peoples[] people = { new peoples("Connor",20), new peoples("John",22), new peoples("Merry",33), new peoples("Frank",65), new peoples("Frank",34), new peoples("George",19) }; var query = from n in names join p in people on n equals p.Name into matching select new { Name = n, Count = matching.Count() }; Please tell me dot notation of this query. Thanks.
