Looking at the IL code, what the With block does is basically: Friend Class Class3 Friend Sub New() Dim c1 As New Class1 Dim temp as Class1 = c1 temp.One = "foobar" temp.Two = 23009 temp.Three = 3987231665 temp.Four = 2874090071765301873 temp.Five = 3.1415973801462975 temp.Six = "a"c temp = Nothing End Sub End Class But what's important is what the JIT compiler makes of this. The language compiler doesn't do much optimisation, that is mainly left for the JIT compiler. Most likely it will see that the variable c1 isn't used for anything other than creating another variable, and optimise away the storage of c1 completely. Either way, if it does still create another variable, that is a very cheap operation. If there is any performance difference it's very small, and it can fall either way.
