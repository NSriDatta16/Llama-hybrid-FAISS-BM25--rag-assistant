Those are the storage methods. The retrieval methods are separate. (See below.) Etags are a way to optimize network traffic. See Wikipedia for a good intro. I think that Three20 both stores the image file on disk, and the decoded image itself in memory. Certainly, any in-memory caches would be cleared if the app re-started, but remember that under iOS 4, that probably happens less often that you think. To get data out of the cache, try one of: /** * Gets the data for a URL from the cache if it exists and is newer than a minimum timestamp. * * @return nil if hthe URL is not cached or if the cache entry is older than the minimum. */ - (NSData*)dataForURL:(NSString*)URL expires:(NSTimeInterval)expirationAge timestamp:(NSDate**)timestamp; - (NSData*)dataForKey:(NSString*)key expires:(NSTimeInterval)expirationAge timestamp:(NSDate**)timestamp; /** * Gets an image from the in-memory image cache. * * @return nil if the URL is not cached. */ - (id)imageForURL:(NSString*)URL; - (id)imageForURL:(NSString*)URL fromDisk:(BOOL)fromDisk; I would advise reading through the source, though. If memory serves, TTURLCache isn't all that big a class.
