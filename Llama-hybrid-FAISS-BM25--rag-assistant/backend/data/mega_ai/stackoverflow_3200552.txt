I would design this with each set of monthly predictions handled as a group of rows. To support historical data add a "date created" field. So something like (this is T-SQL syntax, I gave up on Access a long time ago): CREATE TABLE dbo.TaskEstimates ( DateCreated datetime NOT NULL, EstimateYearMonth datetime NOT NULL, HoursRequired decimal NOT NULL, CONSTRAINT PK_TaskEstimates PRIMARY KEY CLUSTERED ( DateCreated ASC, EstimateMonth ASC ) ); The DateCreated field would be the same for all members of an estimate set entered today, for example. The EstimateYearMonth field contains just the year and month (day = 1, time portion = 0:00:00.000). Combinations of aggregate functions and grouping criteria then allow retrieval of any combination of data you need. In addition to, or instead of the DateCreated field you could also use a GroupID that is incremented for each set. So the first set all has GroupID == 1, the next set == 2, and so on. This might be easier for historical selection if you're asked counted-query questions instead of dated-query questions; e.g. "give me the 3rd cycle estimates" instead of "give me the estimates done in June". BTW, I normally use datetime for all date and time related data, instead of separating it into year, month, etc. so I only need to normalize a few selection criteria instead of fiddling around with type conversions for each row.
