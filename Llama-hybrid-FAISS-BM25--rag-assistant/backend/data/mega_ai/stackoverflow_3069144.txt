Finding distance travelled by robot using Optical Flow

I'm working on a project right now in which we are developing an autonomous robot. I have to basically find out the distance travelled by the robot between any 2 intervals. I'm using OpenCV, and using the Optical Flow functions of OpenCV, I'm able to find out the velocity/distance of each pixel in 2 different images. Using this information, I want to be able to find out the distance travelled by the robot in the interval between those 2 images. I thought of a way in which we could develop an input output mapping between the distance travelled by pixels and the distance travelled by the bot (using some tests). In this way, using neural networks, we would be able to find the relationship. However, the optical flow would depend on the distance of the camera from the pixel, which would cause problems. Is there any way to solve this problem?
