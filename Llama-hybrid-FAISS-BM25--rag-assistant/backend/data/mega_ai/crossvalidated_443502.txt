If you always guess at random, then sometimes you will perform above chance and sometimes bellow chance, although at average, in the long run, you will converge to random performance. If you always flip the results when it is convenient, then it would look like you learned something about the problem, although you are still just making random predictions. It's head I win, tail you lose situation. You can flip your predictions, but you would have to do it fairly. So you will have to decide to flip them before you know which way is better for your test set, for example, based on an additional nested CV loop. It is very easy to get significant bellow chance predictions without learning anything about the data, thus just flipping the projections will lead to spurious results. Imagine you want to predict Y based on X, in your dataset, there is a 0 correlation between Y and X, now you split it randomly to a training set and test set. If in training set the correlation between X and Y is positive, then in the test set it will be negative and vice versa (since int he whole dataset it is exactly 0). Therefore, you will always be predicting the relationship in the opposite direction. However, you didn't learn anything about the data, and the true relationship is 0.
