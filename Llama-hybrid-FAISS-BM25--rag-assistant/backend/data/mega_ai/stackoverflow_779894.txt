Take a look at IsolatedStorage . This is an API for providing you with per-application storage, it's built into .NET and is supported in Mono. The API provides you with file IO on files that are stored in a location managed by the framework: in Mono it'll be a ~/.isolatedstorage directory, in Windows it'll be somewhere in the user's Documents and Settings. With this API, you can maintain your settings file without having to worry about operating system specifics or permissions.
