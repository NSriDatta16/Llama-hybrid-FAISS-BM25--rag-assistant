What is the order when doing feature engineering? (imputation, encoding, etc.)

I am self learning machine learning right now, and I am confused with what should I do first. Should I impute the missing value before encoding the categorical variable? Also, I am learning from Kaggle, and it always split to train, test set before doing any feature engineering stuff. What is the reason behind it? Can I doing it for the entire dataset? When should I perform cross validation? Before splitting the data? I also hope to know the reason behind all the decision because I donâ€™t want to just memorize it. It was difficult to learn by myself for this extremely complex topic.
