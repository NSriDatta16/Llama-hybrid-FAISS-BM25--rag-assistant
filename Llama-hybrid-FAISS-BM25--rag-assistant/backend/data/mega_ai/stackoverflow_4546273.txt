Do null values save storage space?

Possible Duplicate: Space used by nulls in database What's more efficient in terms of storage space? A nullable int column full of nulls. An int column full of zeroes. I know a nullable column takes up 1 extra bit of information to store its null state, but do null values save the database from allocating 32 bits for an int that is null? (null semantics and the meaning of null are not important for this question)
