disable validation of errorprovider when click cancel button

is there a way to disable the validation of errorprovider elegantly when click cancel button to dismiss a winform? The validation always happens when the textbox lose focus, and i don't wanna it to validate when the user click cancel button, it is just a little bit silly to validate when the user clicking cancel.
