Web Service error which disappears on reboot or re-registering asp.net

We have a web service (c#/.net 3.5/asp.net 2) which after a couple of weeks of use gives a message "System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapException: Server was unable to process request. ---> System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not find file 'c:\windows\Temp\xxxxxx.dll'" where the filename xxxxxx.dll is a random string which changes on each call of the web service. This error is seen on several machines. We have found that by re-registering asp.net everything works as before or if not we have to reboot the server. I have seen links where temporary file storage is the problem as a result of dynamic compilation. Since the web service never changes, I am not sure how this can be related. Any ideas? JD
