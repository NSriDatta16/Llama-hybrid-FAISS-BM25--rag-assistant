Choosing estimator based on Precision-Recall Curve

I hope you will help with this one. Below you see my Precision-Recall curves after performing 10-fold Stratified Cross Validation on my dataset. Note that my dataset is imbalanced that's why I'm checking the performance with this curve. Given that I am interested in an estimator with high precision, which one should I choose in this case? Should the precision-recall curve be used as a guidance for choosing a classifier? Or the average precision is what I should just check? The average precisions are: Random Forest: 0.807 Gradient Boosting: 0.647 Logistic Regression: 0.601
