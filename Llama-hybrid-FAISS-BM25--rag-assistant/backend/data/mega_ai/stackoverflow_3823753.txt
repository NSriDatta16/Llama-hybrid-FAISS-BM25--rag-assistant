As other people have noted ISO 9001 is not about the tool. Working at an institution that is ISO 9001 compliant signals they (the institution itself) are "mature". The word mature, in this context, indicating that the organization strictly adheres to processes that have been audited and found to be ISO 9001 compliant. Processes that involve Git or Mercurial will not affect your ability to become ISO 9001 compliant in any way (unless you don't follow the processes). At least, that's my understanding of it all.
