Parse a formatted string into arrays of arrays

+2-1+18*+7-21+3*-4-5+6x29 The above string is an example of the kind of string I'm trying to split into either a key => value array or something similar. The string is used to represent the layout of various classes on a three column page of an intranet site, which is editable by the user via drag and drop. This string is stored in a cookie to be used on the next visit. The numbers represent the id of a class and - , + and x represent the state of the class (minimised, expanded or hidden), the * represents a column break. I can split this into the columns easily using explode which gives and array with 3 $key => $value associations. eg. $column_layout = array( [0] => '+2-1+18' , [1] => '+7-21+3' , [2] => '-4-5+6x29' ) I then need to split this into the various classes from there, keeping the status and id together. As the different classes and statuses will change from user to user and how many there are for each column, I need to be able to do this all automatically. $column1 = array( array( '+' , 2 ), array( '-' , 1 ), array( '+' , 18 ) ); $column2 = array(...
