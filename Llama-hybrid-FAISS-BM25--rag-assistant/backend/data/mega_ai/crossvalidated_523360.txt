Predicting in Neural Network with Softmax or Logistic activation output

So I'm wanting to make a neural network from scratch for predicting classifications and labels. The activation layer for the output in these networks would be softmax for classification and logistic for labels. However, whenever you are predicting a new value you will get some probability values for the output, so how do you determine the label or class based off these probabilities? Do you choose the largest or sample? For example, consider three possible classes -> [1,2,3] lets say my output from my softmax layer was [0.25, 0.15, 0.6] (a probability distribution), is the actual predicted value class 3 as it has the highest value?or would you sample? For labeling, lets say we have three different labels, so the output from the logistic layer is [0.23, 0.65, 0.9], how would you determine the final labels? Would it just be if it was greater than 0.5? so the predicted value would be [0,1,1]? or would you sample?
