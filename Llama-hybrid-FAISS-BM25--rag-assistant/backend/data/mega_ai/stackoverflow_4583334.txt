Devel::Cover with options for test coverage

In a project I am working on the directory layout that does not have a lib directory so we have /X.pm /X/Y.pm ... /t/test.t when I run $ PERL5OPT=-MDevel::Cover make test $ cover I get report only for the files in t/ how can I tell Devel::Cover to report about all the files in the current directory except those in t? I thought I can do it by this: cover -t +inc . -inc t but I get: Unknown option: inc Invalid command line options at /home/gabor/perl5/lib/perl5/x86_64-linux-thread-multi/Devel/Cover/Report/Html_minimal.pm line 677. from the documentation it is unclear to me how can I supply these options.
