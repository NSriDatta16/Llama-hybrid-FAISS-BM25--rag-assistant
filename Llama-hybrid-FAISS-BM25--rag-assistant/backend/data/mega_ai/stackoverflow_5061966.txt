Changing the fragment is intended to move from section to section within a specific page. When you click one of your links it just changes the fragment, the page itself is left untouched. Since the page doesn't change, there is no page load event and thus the onload handler is not called. You need an onhashchange handler instead of an onload handler. Beware though that not all browsers support onhashchange so you'll have to muck about with a hand rolled version for some browsers. If you're doing a lot of this sort of thing then you might want to look at Sammy or a similar library to take care of the details for you.
