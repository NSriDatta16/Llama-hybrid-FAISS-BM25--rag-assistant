Creating App Store Distribution Certificate - What to enter in Common Name field?

When creating the app store distribution certificate in the certificate assistant, do I enter my name in the Common Name field, or the company name? This page says, "In the Common Name field enter your Company/Organization/Department name" while the add certificate area of the portal it says "In the Common Name field, enter your name"
