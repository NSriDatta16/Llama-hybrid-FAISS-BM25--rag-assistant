How long do the magento session files need to be kept?

I have a customer who's magento session files are quickly growing out of control. We are purging them once a week, but it seems that it may need to be more frequent. 1) What do these files do? How are they connected to the users online experience (e.g. if I delete them and the user is still on the site, how will they be affected) 2) How soon can I delete them? How long do the files really need to remain on the server? Chris
