finding global minima of a random forest estimator

I have a random forest regression model with 1000 trees, having 16 parameters (using python scikit-learn). The estimator can predict a target value with cross validated r2 score of 0.87 +/- 0.03. I would like to find the global (or at least close to global) maximum of the random forest, in order to identify the best values of the 16 parameters that yield this optimum. What is the best algorithm to reach the maximum of a random forest estimator? Is there a python implementation of this algorithm?
