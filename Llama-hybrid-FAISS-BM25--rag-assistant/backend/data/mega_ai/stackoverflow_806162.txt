Do you have a specific user-agents list that present this behaviour? Maybe Apache conf could solve this problem? (or create a new problem for you to solve :-) ). Watch out for the cookie frenzy - the more you add cookies (moreover, on the main domain), the more your clients will have to send it along their requests. Souders talked about it too, but it's always good to check your clients browsers sent/received ratio for requests.
