"class A succeeds class B" means in Scala reference?

In the Scala 2.8 reference, section 5.3.3 page 69 (77 in the pdf) the following paragraph appear: Assume a trait D defines some aspect of an instance x of type C (i.e. D is a base class of C ). Then the actual supertype of D in x is the compound type consisting of all the base classes in L(C) that succeed D . What does the notation L(C) means (in the original text it's a calligraphic capital \ell like symbol)? What does the phrase "classes... that succeed D " means? I'm not familiar with the notation.
