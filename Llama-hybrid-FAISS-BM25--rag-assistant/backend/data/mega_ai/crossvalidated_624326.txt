It's a great disappointment not to have access to the data to test these guesses. Wanting to respect the science is as or more important than catering to fetishes or phobias about the form of the data. I assume A1. Hatch rate $H$ is the proportion of turtle eggs that hatch, so it's bounded by 0 and 1 and to make biological sense the predicted or fitted values should be so bounded. A2. Infection rate $I$ is another proportion. It is not reported to go above about 0.6, but if in principle it could go up to 1 you want a model fit such that as in A1 predicted or fitted values should remain sensibly bounded. By eye, one straight line for each species wouldn't seem outrageous, but there is a danger that they stray into negative predictions. I suggest S1. Exponential curves of the form $H = a_j \exp(b_j I)$ for each species $j$ would ensure positive predictions and could be fitted by using a generalized linear model with log link, continuous predictor $I$ and species as an indicator variable. Nothing need be transformed. Here is a sketch: As drawn with parameter guesses to try to match your data, the curves have only slight curvature, which might make the straight-line fits appear competitive. S2. The left skewness of $H$ is a fact but should not determine the form of the model. It's not an assumption of regression or generalized linear models that the marginal distribution of the outcome is, or should be, normal. S3. The transformation with power 3.16 is a mighty strong transformation (stronger than cubing) and doesn't have a biological rationale. It doesn't work well any way beyond pulling in some lower values. To get a sense of why, consider this plot, which shows that over the interval where most of the data lie, the transformation is close to a straight line function and so can't affect the distribution shape much. As said, its effect is secondary. It's not obvious that we should mess with the data points with low $H$ as they are just as important as the others. S4. You should worry most about a functional fit that makes sense, not most about the residuals.
