Are there libraries similar to cleverhans for different types of classifiers?

I am seeking adversarial examples for classifiers (e.g. random forest, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron) that I've already trained (through scikit-learn). But I can't seem to find any existing libraries for this purpose. This could be a fun project for me to start, but before beginning to explore my naïveté, is there any literature/code on this topic that I should be considering?
