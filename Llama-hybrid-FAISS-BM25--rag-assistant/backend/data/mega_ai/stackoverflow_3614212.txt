jQuery, get html of a whole element

I wish to get the entire html of a selected element not just it's contents. .html() uses javascripts innerHTML() method according to the documentation. HTML: Some Content Some Content Using $('#divs:first').html(); will return just the paragraph element. I want to get the html for the whole element, like so: Some Content I can't use .parent because this will return html of both child divs.
