For me it depends on the situation. If it is a very small project I'd be tempted to just rewrite it from scratch...however you don't often have that luxury. Failing that, I'd go for chipping away at it piece by piece. I'd write unit tests to verify the existing functionality and slowly use TDD to transform the code into an elegant and well designed system. Depending on how long this process is going to take it will probably start to look like the StranglerApplication you mentioned above. BigBang is very risky as you have no easy way of verifying that the updated system does the same thing as the old one. Divide and Conquer is less risky than BigBang...but if its a large enough system it can wind up being just as problematic as BigBang.
