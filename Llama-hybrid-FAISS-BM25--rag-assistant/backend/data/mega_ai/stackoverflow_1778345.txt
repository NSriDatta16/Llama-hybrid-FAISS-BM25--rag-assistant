The UIBarButtonItem does not inherit from the UIResponder so you can not get touchesBegan / touchedEnded etc events directly. If you set the UISegmentedControl to be momentary ( yourSegControl.momentary = YES ) you can select a button more than once. Is this helpful for your situation? Otherwise, you should probably subclass the UISegmentedControl (which inherits from the UIResponder) and handle the extra touches yourself (don't forget to call super in any touch method you override).
