Your approach of using the overall distribution is simple but sounds statistically correct. It is a good start. There are variations to it, such as simply declaring everything in the lower/upper x% as outliers; using interquartile ranges like in boxplots to identify outliers, or even using Gaussian mixture models to identify clusters within the distribution. The choice of the method highly depends on what you understand under the 'patterns of registrations' and 'behavior'. If you can quantify it, then you can compute a distance or similarity matrix and use the matrix within some clustering algorithm. For example, organize the data as the number of registrations per user (columns) per each hour (rows) of the week. Then, a matrix of pairwise correlations between each pair of columns will be a similarity matrix. Alternatively, compute pairwise Euclidean distances which can be arranged in a distance matrix. More methods including model-based approaches can be found in this book by Maharaj et al. (2019) .
