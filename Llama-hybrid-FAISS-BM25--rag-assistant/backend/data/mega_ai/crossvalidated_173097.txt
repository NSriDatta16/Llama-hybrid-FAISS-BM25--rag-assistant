As you noted it yourself, the choice of 0.05 as the threshold was purely arbitrary. The reason why it became the default choice in many sciences is because it is convenient. Towards the end of his career, Fisher (1971) also argued that "It is usual and convenient for experimenters to take 5% as a standard level of significance, in the sense that they are prepared to ignore all results which fail to reach this standard, and, by this means, to eliminate from further discussion the greater part of fluctuations which chance causes have introduced into their experimental results (p.13)" However, technically speaking, every researcher is free to choose the threshold themselves. There is no reason why you cannot choose 0.06 or 0.10 as the threshold if that makes sense for your research question. The only problem comes when you try to publish the results- most editors and reviewers will not be happy about it and your paper will almost certainly not get published. In this sense, in the real world you can get away with not using 0.05 only if you choose a smaller level (e.g. 0.01). Recently, there have been such calls for setting a smaller threshold (0.005 or 0.001; Johnson, 2013), supposedly to improve the replicability of research findings. However, this also comes at a price because of the loss in statistical power and the (much) larger sample sizes that would be needed. So, to answer your question, I do not think that there is a good way of finding the optimal threshold (probably because there isn't one). In an ideal world, different thresholds would be used for different types of research problems, but as mentioned previously, this wouldn't work in reality. I agree with HEITZ that researchers would gain a lot if they move to other ways of making statistical inference, such as effect size estimation or Bayesian inference. References: Fisher, R. A.
