Does Ruby or Rails have a method to capitalize the first character only?

Or it seems like I have to write my own method? (to keep the DHA untouched): ruby-1.9.2-p180 :001 > s = 'omega-3 (DHA)' => "omega-3 (DHA)" ruby-1.9.2-p180 :002 > s.capitalize => "Omega-3 (dha)" ruby-1.9.2-p180 :003 > s.titleize => "Omega 3 (Dha)" ruby-1.9.2-p180 :005 > s[0].upcase + s[1..-1] => "Omega-3 (DHA)"
