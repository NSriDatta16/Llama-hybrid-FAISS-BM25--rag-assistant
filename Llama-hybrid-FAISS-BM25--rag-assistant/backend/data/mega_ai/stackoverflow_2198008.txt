You could do something like this: >>> s = '0200A8C0' >>> octets = [s[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)] >>> ip = [int(i, 16) for i in reversed(octets)] >>> ip_formatted = '.'.join(str(i) for i in ip) >>> print ip_formatted 192.168.0.2 The octet splitting could probably be done more elegantly, but I can't think of a simpler way off the top of my head. EDIT: Or on one line: >>> s = '0200A8C0' >>> print '.'.join(str(int(i, 16)) for i in reversed([s[i:i+2] for i in range(0, len(s), 2)])) 192.168.0.2
