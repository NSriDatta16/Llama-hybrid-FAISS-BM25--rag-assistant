I agree with your solution and @whuber's elegant solution, here is my rational to arrive at the same solution by simply counting all options first, then taking the ratio at the end to compute the probability: Let's assume the set of possible choices is: $ O = \{1,2,3,4,5,6,7\} $ We can imagine 7 people picking numbers from this set $ O $ generates a sequence of these 7 numbers, for example 2547551 would be one of many options. All possible ways of arranging 7 numbers in a sequence where repetition is allowed is: $ 7^7 $ . We allow repetition here because the problem states that people choose independently, so one person's choice is not going to affect other person's choice. The only way that no 2 person pick the same option would be all sequences where no repetition is allowed. One possible option would be 1234567. Number of possible arrangements of 7 numbers with no repetition is 7! So the probability that no 2 people picked the same number is: $ \frac{7!}{7^7} $ You can also run a simulation and arrive at the same solution if you have doubts. I used Python. Generated all possible permutations of these 7 numbers, counted them, assigned the result to a. Counted the options where no number in a sequence was repeated, assigned the result to b. Computed b/a Here is the Python program and its output in case anyone interested: import itertools O = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7] a = 0 b = 0 all_combinations = itertools.product(O, repeat=len(O)) for sequence in all_combinations: a +=1 if len(set(''.join(map(str,sequence)))) == len(O): b += 1 print(f"Number of all possible ways of arranging 7 numbers with repetition = {a}") print(f"Number of all possible ways of arranging 7 numbers without repetition = {b}") print(f"Probability of having no 2 people selecting the same option = {b/a}") >>> Number of all possible ways of arranging 7 numbers with repetition = 823543 >>> Number of all possible ways of arranging 7 numbers without repetition = 5040 >>> Probability of having no 2 people selecting the same option = 0.006119899021666143
