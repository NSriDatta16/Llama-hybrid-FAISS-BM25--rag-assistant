Qualifications for PhD Programs

Yann LeCun mentioned in his AMA that he considers having a PhD very important in order to get a job at a top company. I have a masters in statistics and my undergrad was in economics and applied math, but I am now looking into ML PhD programs. Most programs say there are no absolutely necessary CS courses; however I tend to think most accepted students have at least a very strong CS background. I am currently working as a data scientist/statistician but my company will pay for courses. Should I take some intro software engineering courses at my local University to make myself a stronger candidate? What other advice you have for someone applying to PhD programs from outside the CS field? edit: I have taken a few MOOCs (Machine Learning, Recommender Systems, NLP) and code R/python on a daily basis. I have a lot of coding experience with statistical languages and implement ML algorithms daily. I am more concerned with things that I can put on applications.
