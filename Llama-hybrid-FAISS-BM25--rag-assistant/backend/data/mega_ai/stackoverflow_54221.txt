How would I allow a user to stream video to a web application for storage?

I'd like to add some functionality to a site that would allow users to record video using their webcam and easily store it online. I don't even know if this is possible right now, but I think flash has access to local webcams running through the browser. Do you have any suggestions or resources to get me started on this? I'm primarily a java developer so If I could do it in an applet that would be great, but It may be easier to accomplish this using flash or some other technology. This would mean streaming the video back to the webserver and storing it there. Uploading a file is easy enough, but I'd rather the user not have to deal with that if it's possible. Just to be clear. I'm not talking about uploading a video. I'm talking about allowing the user to click "record" in a web application and having the video streamed to the server and stored when the user clicks "stop".
