After some study, I've found that... The problem is indeed caused by the TH and TD items being set by jQuery to "display: block" items for animation. There is as of yet no way to make jQuery behave differently. Enclosing the TH and TD items in DIV tags does not work, some Google searching turns up the suggestion that HTML becomes invalid when using DIV tags within a TABLE structure. Enclosing the content of TH and TD items in DIV tags does not work, the content starts to float after animation and does not stay within the TH and TD items. The same article reveals that animating the opening closing of table rows is possible using TBODY sections within the table. I succeeded in what I wanted though, and here's how: I cut the table into several sub-tables consisting of the column groups I want to show and hide I enclosed these sub-tables in DIV tags and floated them next to each other. I used jQuery to show/hide these DIV's. I hope that this helps anybody, and if a more elegant solution is found, please leave a message.
