Winform doesn't recognize Dataset created in VC# designer

I have created a dataset with the C# designer following this tutorial http://www.devx.com/dotnet/Article/28678/1954 ; When I drag and drop a datable on a form and run the program it says it says the type name XMLDB doesn't exist in the type XMLDB.XMLDB on line this.XMLDB = new XMLDB.XMLDB(); Why ? How to fix it ?
