The way to tell a bot not to follow a link is precisely to add rel=nofollow to your tag. Assuming you are also logging locally before forwarding to the external url you could also check the user agent string. In fact, if you are going to ask people to pay based on number of referrals it might be an idea to log IP address and user agent against each paid for click in case your stats are ever questioned.
