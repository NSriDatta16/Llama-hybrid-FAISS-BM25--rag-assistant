Why are natural splines almost always cubic?

By natural spline, I mean a regression spline that's linear at the boundary (i.e. the regions where X is smaller than the smallest knot or larger than the largest knot). I know that for smoothing splines, the function that minimizes the relevant objective function is a shrunken version of a natural cubic spline with knots at each of the observations. But for a natural spline estimated by least squares (or perhaps lasso/ridge regression) with a smaller number of knots... should the spline necessarily be cubic? Or (if the goal is prediction of a target variable in a machine learning context), should the degree be chosen by cross-validation instead of always using cubic?
