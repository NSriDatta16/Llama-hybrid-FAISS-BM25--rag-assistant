Is it a bad practice to have a package with only one class in it? Not necessarily. Packages are using to group together logically related entities. It doesn't prevent you from having just one such entity in a package. Would it make more sense just to move the single class to a util package that would contain other random useful classes? Not to me, for two reasons: Util has a specific meaning. Moving an arbitrary entity to util for reasons of loneliness would be a borderline case of util-abuse. This is premature organization. With Java the IDE support is rich enough to reorganize easily and effectively using a few clicks. Wait a while to see how your project evolves and then take a call.
