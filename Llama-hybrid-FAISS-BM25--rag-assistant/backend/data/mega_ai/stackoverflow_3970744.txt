There was really no good answer so I've made up an extension that you can install on Google Chrome to achieve this behavior. It simply converts all the static text from "User Defined Value" into actual external links. You can Install it from the Google Extensions page: https://chrome.google.com/extensions/detail/dbbnhpimjhganelkoickiabfampiiagl Hope this helps someone.
