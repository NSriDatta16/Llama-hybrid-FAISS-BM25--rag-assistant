You've got a namespace collision going on here. I imagine you're trying to access the asp.net membership provider with your call to Membership.CreateUser but it can't find that because it's just looking in your LocalGarageFinder.Membership namespace. If you can't change your namespace to something a bit easier to work with, you can prefix your call to the membership provider with its full namespace. This will change your call to: MembershipUser newUser = System.Web.Security.Membership.CreateUser(Username.Text, Password.Text, Email.Text, passwordQuestion, SecurityAnswer.Text, true, out createStatus);
