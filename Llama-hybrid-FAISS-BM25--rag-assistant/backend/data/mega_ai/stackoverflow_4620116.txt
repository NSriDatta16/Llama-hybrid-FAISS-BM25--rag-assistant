The convention is that a programmer in a given organization will start package names with their organization's domain name, as a unique identifier -- in reverse order. This prevents namespace clashes between code from different organizations (within the organization you're on your own). So if I work for a company called Supercompany, and their domain is supercompany.com, all of my package names will start with com.supercompany . And since a lot of code is written for companies, a lot of packages start with com. However, there are plenty of packages that start with "net" or "org" or other such top-level domains. Myself, I work for a university, so my package names generally start with "edu". The brief answer, then, is that most package names start with "com" because most domain names end with "com".
