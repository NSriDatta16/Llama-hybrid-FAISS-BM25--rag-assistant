Best way to display data with outliers?

I am fairly new to data analysis and visualization, and I'm trying to figure out the best model to show some data regarding page load time (in seconds). The current view is a line graph where the x-axis is the page, and the y-axis is the load time. This graph is visually misleading though, because in my mind, the psychological expectation of a line graph is to convey something over time. Because there are a couple of outliers in the data where the page load time is much longer than the average, someone looking at the graph might be turned off because their eyes jump to the outliers, so it looks like our pages take forever to load. In actuality, about 95% of the pages take fewer than two seconds to load, and 5% of the pages take longer. So what's the best method to display this data? I want people to understand that on average, our page load time is great , and there are very few exceptions. I feel like depicting a bell curve might help to show that the majority of the pages fall within x-standard deviations of the mean, but A) I'm not sure how to do that in Excel, and B) I'm not sure that's the best option.
