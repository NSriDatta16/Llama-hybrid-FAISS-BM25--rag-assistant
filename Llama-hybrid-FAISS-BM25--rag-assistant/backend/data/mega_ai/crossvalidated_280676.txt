Different Result on Stratified k-fold Cross Validation

Now I am doing SVM to classify observation from Microarray Dataset and the result is accuracy. I use stratified 10-fold cross validation and run those program on R (I use my own script because caret Package cannot work on my R) Here I have some questions, 1. Why the result of accuracy is mostly different in each run?, 2. Should I divide the data into 10 fold first, and use that data in each time I run the program? I think the accuracy is different in each run because every time, when I run the program, they will divide the data into 10 fold, and the fold's member also different. Is it true?
