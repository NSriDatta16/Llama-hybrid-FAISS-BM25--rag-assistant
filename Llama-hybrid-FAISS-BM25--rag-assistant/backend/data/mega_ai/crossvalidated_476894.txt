$R^2 = 1 - \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^N (y_i - \bar{y})^2}$ $y_i$ is the $i^{th}$ observation of $y$ . $\hat{y_i}$ is predicted value of the the $i^{th}$ observation of $y$ . $\bar{y}$ is the mean value of all $y_i$ . $N$ is the number of observationf of $y$ . You're saying that $\bar{y}$ is tiny and that makes your denominator small. A small denominator could, conceivable, cause some issues when you divide on a computer, but short of that, a small denominator means an even smaller numerator, since the model will fit the data better than always guessing the average value of the response variable. $^{\dagger}$ . Consequently, your fraction will still be in $(0,1)$ , meaning that your $R^2$ is in $(0,1)$ like $R^2$ is supposed to be. $^{\dagger}$ I am assuming you're doing a linear regression, OLS-style model. If you're not, there might be bigger issues to discuss about using $R^2$ . You also can wreck this idea if you do OLS without an intercept, but, almost always, that is a poor strategy. EDIT In R , $R^2$ can be calculated like this. R2
