It is not obvious what should be considered $R^2$ in a GLM. For instance, in their discussion about just logistic regression, UCLA gives eight possibilities , all of which mimic the usual $R^2$ in some desirable way. If you do a Poisson regression or some other GLM, there are additional possibilities, and it is not obvious what you should calculate . My preference would be to use a comparison of your model performance to the performance of a baseline model, but it is not clear on what criteria the models should be evaluated. Log-likelihood makes a lot of sense to me, but so does square loss (at least if we call the value $R^2$ ). The use is not clear. Yes, at first, $R^2$ seems like a way of assigning a letter grade like in school where $R^2=0.95$ is an $A$ that makes us happy while $R^2=0.41$ is an $F$ that makes us sad. However, assessments out of context are fraught with problems. The answer linked here does an outstanding job, I believe, of discussing this and even does it in the context of $R^2$ and not some other measure of performance. Therefore, an $R^2$ -style statistic has the potential to confuse matters by leading someone to dismiss a model with $R^2=0.41$ as being an $F$ -quality model when it might be among the best scores anyone has ever achieved. It would be an in-sample assessment of performance that can be made very high by fitting to the training data at the expense of generalizability. While an adjusted $R^2$ has a reasonable motivation in the OLS linear model setting , it is not even clear what should be compared, let alone how to calculate unbiased estimators. If you just calculate the squared correlation between the predicted and true values, you can wind up seeing a perfect fit according to this correlation despite the fitted values being awful. I give simulations here where this happens (squared correlation is $1$ , graph shows terrible predictions), and there can be examples that are less extreme. Keeping in mind the above, an $R^2$ value for a GLM seems to be a rather advanced idea. If someone had a reason for wanting such a value, they must know statistics in some detail, and such a person likely has the ability to program a function to do the exact calculation they want.
