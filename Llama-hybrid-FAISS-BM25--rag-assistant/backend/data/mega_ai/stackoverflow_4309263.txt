Unable to build to iPad after renewing provisioning profile

I recently renewed a provisioning profile for an iPad app I am working on and now I am unable to build the app to the iPad. First I renewed the profile in ADC, downloaded it and then dragged it to xCode. I then deleted the expired profile. Now when I attempt to build I get "Error from Debugger: The program being debugged is not being run." and I can't figure out why. The app was working fine before I had to renew the profile. Also, I have already deleted completely from the iPad and tried to rebuild.
