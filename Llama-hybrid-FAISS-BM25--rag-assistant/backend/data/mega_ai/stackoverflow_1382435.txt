Problem solved. When following the django book, it is suggested to create apps within a project directory and to refer to these apps in the INSTALLED APPS statement with a path that begins from the directory containing the project, for example, 'siteproject.books'. I was not able to give django access to apps without appending that directory name to the file path, so, for example, I was not able to simply use 'books', but needed to use 'siteproject.books' in the INSTALLED APPS statement and this was the case with sorl.thumbnail, which needed to be referred to as siteproject.sorl.thumbnail. Other attempts to include 'sorl.thumbnail' would yield a very ugly un-formatted and confusing purple-colored error page (yes, the sorl directory was in $PYTHONPATH, so who knows why these attempts didn't work...). Unfortunately, Django was yielding the 'undefined tag' error, which is a generalized error that it gives in many situations. It doesn't really mean anything and isn't useful for locating problems. The problem was solved when I opened the files in the sorl directory and edited the python files. I found import statements that imported objects from the sorl directory and I appended the 'siteproject.*' to those paths and everything began to work.
