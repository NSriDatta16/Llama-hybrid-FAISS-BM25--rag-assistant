I think there is no a direct solution without using some renderer modification. I propose a solution that works when the href is a valid JSF page and you want the transformation of the outcome be made before is evaluated by the navigation handler. First, a bean for outcome transformation: @ManagedBean @ApplicationScoped public class OutcomeTransformer { public String getNewOutcome(String outcome){ if(outcome.equals("/page.xhtml")){ return "/directory/"+outcome; }else if(outcome.equals("/anotherPage.xhtml")){ return "/anotherDirectory/"+outcome; }else{ return outcome; } } } Seccond, use a composite component for wrapping the link. The outcome of the h:link is transformed by the bean. And finally, here is a using page. Of course, you can use a expression directly in the h:link but with the composite component all the logic of the transformation is in only one place.
