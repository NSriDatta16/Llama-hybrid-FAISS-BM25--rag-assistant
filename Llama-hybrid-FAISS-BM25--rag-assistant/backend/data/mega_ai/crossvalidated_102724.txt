Before your two numbered questions can be addressed: Somehow PC1 has a standard deviation listed as 3.4, but all the values are shown as lying between .287 and .290. There must be an error somewhere; this combination of results is not possible. Perhaps you have graphed only of few of many points used in the PCA? EDIT: I say "not possible" because a standard deviation (here, 3.4) can be no greater than the variable's range (here, .003). And at an intuitive level the SD represents, informally, something like a "typical" deviation from the mean, whereas typical in this graph would be about .0005. You asked about eigenvalues: they summarize entire variables, whereas what's plotted on your graph are scores for individual points.
