You can have a public constructor if you do not define in a constructor in the sub-class. example abstract class Animal { String name; public void Animal(String name) { this.name = name; } } class Cat extends Animal{ public String sayMayName() { return this.name; } } myCat = new Cat("tester"); name = myCat.sayMyName(); if no constructor is defined the parent class constructor will be called, if it is not public it will not work. This I think is more elegantly done with a factory pattern, but I used it in practice in PHP and it works fine.
