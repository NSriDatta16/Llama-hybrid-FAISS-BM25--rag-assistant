Shuffling variables between a vector and the variable's original alignement

in the following paragraph: "The instruction set requires that loads and stores from local memory are 128bit aligned. The registers are 128 bits wide, with instructions treating these 128 bits as a vector of sixteen 8-bit, eight 16-bit, four 32-bit or two 64-bit values, depending upon the operation. Therefore, stack push and pop operations must shuffle variables between the first vector slot of a register and the variableâ€™s original alignment" Can someone please explain to me what shuffling variables means ?
