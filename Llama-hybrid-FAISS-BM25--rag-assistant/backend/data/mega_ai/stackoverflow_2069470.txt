I would suggest RewriteRule ^folder1/(.*)?(.*) $1?organisation=folder1&$2 [NC] RewriteRule ^folder1/(.*) $1?organisation=folder1 [NC] I suspect someone who is a bit niftier with RegExs could combine these into one rule tho Also make sure you have mod rewrite turned on by having RewriteEngine on above the rewrite rules in your .htaccess
