No, the 'runtime attach' is an Express only feature, see SQL Server 2005 Express Edition User Instances. On a non-express SQL instance you you ask your DBA to attach the database properly. He knows how to do it, via: sp_attach_db . Attaching a database has many implications on security, storage allocation, I/O patterns etc and applications should not attach databases themselves. Use an Express edition if you want the 'runtime attach' like behavior.
