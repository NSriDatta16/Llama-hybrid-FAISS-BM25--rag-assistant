I'm trying to extract each a href link on an html page for evaluation w/ nokogiri and xpath

I'm trying to extract each a href link on an html page for evaluation w/ nokogiri and xpath. What I have so far seems to be pulling the page titles out only. I'm not interested in the link title, but rather just the URL that is being pointed to. Here's what I have: doc = Nokogiri::HTML(open("http://www.cnn.com")) doc.xpath('//a').each do |node| puts node.text end Can anyone guide me on how to correct this so that I'm pulling the actual href instead of the text itself?
