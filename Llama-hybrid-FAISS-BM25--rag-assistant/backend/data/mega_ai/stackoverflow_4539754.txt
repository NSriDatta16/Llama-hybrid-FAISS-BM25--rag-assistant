Distributed ASP.Net State Service

I'm wondering if there exist any distributed ASP.Net State Service alternative. Session can be stored in InProc, StateService or SQL. You can also write custom storage providers. For load balancing (without any form of sticky IP) only SQL/Custom will work. Are there any alternative ASP.Net State Services that is distributed? I'm thinking so each server can synchronize with the others. Edit: In response to answers: I am looking for Session() storage. Distributed cache is not a problem, Velocity will do fine for distributed caching. :) Edit2: In response to Oded: State server has the problem of single point of failure. SQL server may not be directly accessible because of the model chosen (i.e. 3-layer), it is only accessible through the middle layer.
