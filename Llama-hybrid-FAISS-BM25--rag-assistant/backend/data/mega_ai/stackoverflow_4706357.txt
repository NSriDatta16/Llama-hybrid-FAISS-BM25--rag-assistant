How to open, modify and save a file with javascript and ActiveX?

I tried different methods to open and show a file on client without to send the file to a server. Opening: I tried to access the file with javascript from a , but the security restriction seems to not allow that. I tried also with the same problem. Last i tried with new ActiveXObject('Scripting.FileSystemObject'); , but I get always an error that automationserver could not create the Object. For saving I tried to use execCommand('SaveAs',true) from TextRange and DocumentFragment. From DocumentFragment I'm able to save a file but it contains only . From TextRange is no save dialog shown. What could I do?
