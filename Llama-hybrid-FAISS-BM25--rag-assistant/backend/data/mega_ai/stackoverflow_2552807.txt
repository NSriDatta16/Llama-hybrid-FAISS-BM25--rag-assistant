How can I differentiate between the .net WebBrowser component and an actual browser?

OK, so we have an online downloads store accessed via our software. Recently we've had requests to allow downloads via normal browsers and it's fairly easy just to slap a download page on. The problem is that it would be confusing to people having two download links, one for the software and one for their web browser, so we want to differentiate between the two and only show the relevant download link. From what I've gathered, the .net WebBrowser component is the same as IE and uses the same User Agent, so we can't use that unless we subclass the WebBrowser in the software to make it use a specific User Agent. It's the more sensible option, but we'd have to roll out another updated version, which is less than ideal. Are there any other ways to tell if someone's accessing a site via the .net component? My only other alternative is to copy the store to a different address with the different download links and send people there. Again this is doable, but not ideal.
