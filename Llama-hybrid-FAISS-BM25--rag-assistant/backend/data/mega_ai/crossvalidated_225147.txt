So there are two considerations you need to make when inspecting the estimated parameters. First, does my GARCH process possess a strictly stationary distribution, given the parameter estimates and secondly, will the GARCH process be non-negative (since it is a variance), with these same parameters? Strict stationarity is a minimum requirement for the maximum likelihood estimator to be consistent, that is, the estimation procedure returning the "true" parameters on average. When restricting the parameters to be positive a sufficient (but not necessary) condition is, as you also point out, that the sum of the $\alpha$'s and $\beta$'s is less than 1. This rule doesn't apply if the parameters are allowed to be negative. Non-negativity : There is no easily checkable rules (to my knowledge) that ensure non-negativity for the general GARCh(p,q) process. But Nelson & Cao (1992) give easy checkable conditions for GARCH(1,q) and (somewhat) manageable conditions for GARCH(2,q). For example the conditions for the GARCH(2,1), $$\sigma_t^2 = \omega + \alpha_1 y_{t-1}^2+\beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2 +\beta_2 \sigma_{t-2}^2$$ are \begin{aligned}\omega & \geq0\\ \alpha_1 & \geq0\\ \beta_1 & \geq0\\ \beta_1+\beta_2 & These conditions only ensure that the $\sigma^2$-process is non-negative, but says nothing about stationarity of $\sigma_t^2$ or $y_t$.
