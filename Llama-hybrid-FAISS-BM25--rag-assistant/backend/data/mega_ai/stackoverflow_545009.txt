Many teams switching to Agile/XP use code coverage as an indirect way of gauging the ROI of their test automation efforts. I think of it as an experiment - there's an hypothesis that "if we start writing unit tests, our code coverage will improve" - and it makes sense to collect the corresponding observation automatically, via CI, report it in a graph etc. You use the results to detect rough spots: if the trend toward more coverage levels off at some point, for instance, you might stop to ask what's going on. Perhaps the team has trouble writing tests that are relevant.
