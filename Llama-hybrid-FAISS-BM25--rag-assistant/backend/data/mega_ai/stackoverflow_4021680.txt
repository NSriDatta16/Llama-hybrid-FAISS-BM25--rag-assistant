You're not really comparing like for like Tools here. The equivalent tool to SQL*Plus in SQL Server is the SQLCMD Utility . In particular you will be interested in the -i switch as this allows you to provide a .sql file as input. Edit: In response to your comment, you could look to use the system stored procedure xp_cmdshell to launch a prompt form within a T-SQL batch that allows you to use SQLCMD. Not the most elegant solution in my opinion but it should work.
