To get the routed URL for the page you are currently visiting , use Request.Url , as Pavel notes. If you need to get the routed URL for a different page (such as when creating a hyperlink to another page), use the Page.GetRouteUrl method. Here's a code snippet showing the use of Page.GetRouteUrl . It's from my article, URL Routing in ASP.NET 4 : lnkCategory.NavigateUrl = Page.GetRouteUrl("View Category", new { CategoryName = "Beverages" }); In the above snippet, "View Category" is the name of the routing rule I want to use. CategoryName is one of the routing parameters and I want to use the value "Beverages". The above call to Page.GetRouteUrl returns the string "/Categories/Beverages". (Of course, the exact string is returns depends on the routing rule "View Category" and the parameter values, but hopefully you get the idea.)
