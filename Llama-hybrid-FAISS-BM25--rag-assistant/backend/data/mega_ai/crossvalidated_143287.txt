Non-Stationary: Larger-than-unit root

I keep reading everywhere that a time series is non-stationary (e.g. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_root or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process ) if there's a unit-root. But isn't a larger-than-one root also means the series is non-stationary? Why don't people say that roots larger than unit imply non-stationarity instead? Intuitive explanation of unit root is a much more general question and indeed the top answer has one sentence in the long essay addresses this question. For those who's only interested in the answer to my question and did not want to read the whole thing (which is epic by the way): "Economists are perhaps the greatest analysts of time series and employers of the AR process technology. Their series of data typically do not accelerate out of sight. They are concerned, therefore, only whether there is a characteristic direction whose value may be as large as 1 in size: a "unit root."
