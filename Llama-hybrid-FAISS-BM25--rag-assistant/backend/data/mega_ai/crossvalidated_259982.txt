The frequency argument depends on how your data is structured. For instance, you mention that your data is separated on an hourly basis. If you wanted to account for every observation in the time series, then your frequency would be an hourly frequency, i.e. 61320, since that is the number of hours in a year. Therefore, if you are defining by an hourly frequency, your ts() function would be set up as follows: Hourly tsfunction However, if you wanted to structure your data on a daily, monthly, or annual basis as you mentioned (and is a more standard way of doing so), you can accordingly set the function as follows: Daily tsfunction The number of intervals per day (as it is measured on an hourly basis) is 24, so R is taking every 24 observations to create a daily time series. Monthly tsfunction However, with the number of hours per month being 720 (assuming 30 days per month), then R is selecting the observation for every 720 entries, hence frequency=720. Annual There are 8760 hours in a year (365*24), so accordingly frequency is 8760: tsfunction As another answer mentioned, please be more specific on what you mean by "seasons".
