I'd just create an alias to the collection and add restrictions. var parentsWithKidName = session.CreateCriteria () .CreateAlias("Children", "c", JoinType.InnerJoin) .Add(Restrictions.Eq("c.Name", childName)) .SetResultTransformer(Transformers.DistinctRootEntity()) .List (); This would result in select p.* from parent p inner join child c on /* however it's mapped? */ where c.Name = ? The distinct root entity transformer will process the result set and remove duplicated parents. They still come across the wire though.
