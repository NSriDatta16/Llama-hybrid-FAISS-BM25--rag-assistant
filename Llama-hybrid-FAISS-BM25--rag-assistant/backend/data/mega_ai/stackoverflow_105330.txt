Automated way to detect tests that can't fail, checked in to get by minmum code coverage?

I have a dev, that will get around our code coverage by writing tests that never fail. The code is just atrocious, but the tests never catch it because they assert(true). I code review, but I can't do everyones work for them, all the time. How do you get people like this motivated to make good software? Is there a build plugin for detecting tests that can't fail? C#, mbUnit tests.
