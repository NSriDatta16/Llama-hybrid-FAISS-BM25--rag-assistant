Creating an image without storing it as a local file

Here's my situation - I want to create a resized jpeg image from a user uploaded image, and then send it to S3 for storage, but am looking to avoid writing the resized jpeg to the disk and then reloading it for the S3 request. Is there a way to do this completely in memory, with the image data JPEG formatted, saved in a variable?
