What you appear to be trying to do is to create a configurable product. To do this, and have the customer able to select the correct size in the catalog, is to add a "Configurable Product" typed item, and add the "Simple Product" type items underneath it (one for each size). When you make the configurable product viewable in the catalog, Magento will automatically provide the sizing options and manage the technical aspects of buying the products in each size. If you don't want to make so many products, you're looking more at a Product Option on a product, which is not added as an attribute. Instead, add it to your product in the edit form, and again Magento will manage selection / storing of this option. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
