Hypothesis testing - is my distribution non random?

Say I have $n$ pairs of time series data. For each pair, I calculate a measurement which looks at the overlapping fraction of each time series pair, resulting in $n$ overlap values. EDIT : I define "overlap" of the time series as follows. For each time series pair, divide one signal by the other (the signals are the same length), resulting in a new signal $d$. Then, given some threshold $x$, look for each instant in time that satisfies $1-x I would like to determine if the distribution of the overlap values is non-random, i.e. if my time series pairs were somehow randomized, would the distribution of these "random" overlaps be different from the distribution of the "real" overlaps I have already calculated. Any help would be much appreciated.
