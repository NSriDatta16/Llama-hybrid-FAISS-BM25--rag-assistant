Is there any conceptual relationship between 'kernel' in SVM and 'kernel' in convolution neural net?

In SVM, we have kernel function that maps an input raw data space into a higher dimensional feature space In CNN, we also have a 'kernel' mask that travels the input raw data space (image as a matrix) and map it to another space. Given the fact that both these to methods are called 'kernel', I am wondering what is the connection between them from a mathematical perspective. My guess is that it might have something to do with functional analysis.
