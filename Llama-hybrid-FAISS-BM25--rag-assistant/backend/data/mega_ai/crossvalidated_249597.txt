If you follow the standard textbooks, the definition of the Bayes factor relies directly on the likelihood function, as e.g. in my book : Definition 5.1 The Bayes factor is the ratio of the posterior probabilities of the null and the alternative hypotheses over the ratio of the prior probabilities of the null and the alternative hypotheses, i.e., $$ \mathfrak{B}^\pi_{01}(\mathbf{x}) = {P(\theta \in \Theta_ 0\mid \mathbf{x}) \over P(\theta \in \Theta_1\mid \mathbf{x})} \bigg/ {\pi(\theta \in \Theta_ 0) \over \pi(\theta \in \Theta_ 1)}. $$ where $\Theta_ 0$ corresponds to the parameter set under the null hypothesis and $\Theta_ 1$ to the parameter set under the alternative hypothesis. It can be more easily rewritten as the ratio of marginal likelihoods $$\mathfrak{B}^\pi_{01}(\mathbf{x}) = \dfrac{\int_{\Theta_0} f(\mathbf{x}|\theta) \pi_0(\theta)\, \text{d}\theta}{\int_{\Theta_1} f(\mathbf{x}|\theta) \pi_1(\theta)\, \text{d}\theta}$$which requires the definition of two priors, one on $\Theta_0$ and one on $\Theta_1$ as usually $\Theta_0$ is of measure zero under $\pi_1$. In your setting, the null set is$$\Theta_0=\{(\mu_1,\mu_2);\ \mu_1=\mu_2\}$$which is the diagonal of $\Theta_1$; the likelihood is$$f(\mathbf{x}|\theta)=\prod_{i=1}^{n_1} f^1(x_i|\mu_1)\,\prod_{j=1}^{n_2} f^2(y_j|\mu_2)$$if there are no nuisance parameters in the distributions of either sample; [as already indicated in a previous answer] Hence, this formulation applies to your cases 1., 2., and 4. However, there is no generic solution when $f$ and $g$ are unknown distributions. Building a genuine non-parametric Bayesian resolution in this case would prove a challenge. "...should I use kind of bootstrap likelihood? Also which or what bootstrap likelihood for what parameter then?" If the distributions $f$ and $g$ are unknown, using such a substitute will have a major impact on the numerical value of the marginal likelihoods, and hence on the decision backed by the Bayes factor, if any. The Bayes factor will reflect and be determined by the tail behaviour of the approximations, not of the original likelihoods.
