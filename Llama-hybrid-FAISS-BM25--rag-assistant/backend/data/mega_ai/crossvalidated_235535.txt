The cost parameter ($C$) in an SVM places an upper bound on the norm of the weights. It is a regularisation parameter, where lower means more regularised and greater means less regularised. Low $C$ means the norm of the weights has to be very small, leading to a simpler model. High $C$ is the opposite. $C=0$ would imply that the norm of the weights must be zero and that there is no model at all, and so svm throws an error. You have a 0 in your gridsearch. tune.out
