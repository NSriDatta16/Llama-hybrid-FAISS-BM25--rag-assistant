Test for changing mean

I want to test whether a time series is better described as IID normal or as IID normal in two segments separated by a change point, with the mean and variance different in the two segments. If I have N observations and no prior information about where the breakpoint occurs, I can fit separate Gaussians for a changepoint at observation 2, 3, ..., N. The likelihood of this model will be higher than the model with a single Gaussian. How much higher should it be to prefer the model with a change point?
