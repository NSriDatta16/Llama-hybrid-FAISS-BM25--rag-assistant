For some reason, your divs holding the images, the ones with the class=panel, have inline styles when I look at them in the inspector in Chrome. style="float: none; position: absolute; left: 0px;" Removing that from all of those particular divs stopped them from piling up on top of each other -- but, they didn't fit all in a row anymore. I also noticed that you have .theme-twentycarousels .stepcarousel .panel at two places in your stylesheet. Not sure if that's causing any problems.
