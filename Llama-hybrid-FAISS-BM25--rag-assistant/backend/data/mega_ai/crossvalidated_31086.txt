Did you apply the StringToWordVector in Weka? If so, then you did more than just punctuation and stop-words removal. StringToWordVector outputs only the doc-term matrix of the input text files, so once the above mentioned preprocessing is done Weka will create 1 term for each unique word. 35k terms sounds logical for 40k texts. The preprocessing in R seems to have been only the punctuation and stop-words removal. So 40k documents results in 1M words, but not unique words. Are your text files approximately 25 words on average? If this is not the case, then there is something else going on indeed.
