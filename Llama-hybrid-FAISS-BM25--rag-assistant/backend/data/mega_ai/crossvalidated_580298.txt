Logistic regression: binary dependent variable ~ continuous independent variable. Is it valid to assign "more than" values?

I have a dataset of about 3,500 employees with two variables: whether they left or stayed; and how many days they worked at the same location. I want to build a logistic regression model to see whether staying in one place for a long time can explain leaving/staying. The problem is that I only have about a year's worth of data. This means that for 85% of the employees the number of days is "at least 400" but it could be 4,000, too, as far as we know. In other words in my dataset they have only ever been in one location. Most of these employees are stayers but about 300 are leavers. In this data environment, is it valid to build a logistic regression model by assigning 400 days to any employee who only ever had one location? (Or should I turn the number of days into categories, and go for Chi-squared?)
