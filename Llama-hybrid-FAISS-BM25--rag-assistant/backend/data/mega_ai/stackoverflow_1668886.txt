What is the correct way to convert from a for loop to a while loop?

I have a for loop of the form: for (int i = from; i And I want to convert it to a while loop (mostly because I want to play with the value of i inside the loop to go backwards and forwards and my co-worker thinks that doing this in a for loop is prone to problems. I tend to agree with him). So I wrote something like this: int i = from; while (i Which prompted some some loud comments. My reasoning is that you don't know what the code inside the loop does - it may (and does) have multiple continue commands. As a response he wrote this: int i = from - 1; while (++i Granted its less lines, but I still think my code is more elegant - what do you think?
