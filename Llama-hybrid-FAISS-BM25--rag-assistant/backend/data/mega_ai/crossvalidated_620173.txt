Is Logistic Regression a classification or prediction model?

In this forum, there are opposite opinions (1) , (2) on the uses of logistic regression. Ones say, it is a classification model and others say it is a prediction model. Therefore, the question that I have is: Is Logistic Regression a classification or prediction model? One can say that a prediction model is one that you obtain an equation to predict values. On the other hand, classification model is that one that having a set and some technique rules you differentiate the set in two or more subset. Lets say, on molecule set that after appliying the techniques rules the molecules are differentiated into mutagenic and non mutagenic molecules. In the case of logistic regression, you obtain an equation but the output is a binomial classification. Therefore, the question is valid.
