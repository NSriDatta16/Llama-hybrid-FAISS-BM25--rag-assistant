Silverlight Vs WPF First of all, WPF is not exactly Silverlight. They essentially require different run times. Silverlight Runtime is a subset of .NET, and needs to be installed by the client, to view your SL applications over a browser. Presently SL runtime is available for Windows and Mac. Moonlight is still not full fledged, and is evolving, for Linux. WPF, on the other hand, is purely on top of .NET runtime, and is available only for Windows. You can use XAML to develop user experiences in Silverlight and WPF, and as long as you stick to the Silverlight subset, you can compile your XAML in WPF as well. Desktop Widgets Now, your thought about building cross platform 'desktop' widgets - Do you want to host a Silverlight application in a desktop window? Silverlight 3.0 provides support for hosting silverlight controls out of the browser. Otherwise, see my blog entry on hosting Silverlight using a browser shell. http://amazedsaint.blogspot.com/2008/12/thinking-outside-silverlight-sandbox.html . This post is revolved around Hosting the HTML Page with Silverlight in a Winforms/Webkit desktop application using a web browser control, and communicate to and fro using HTML DOM Embedding a light weight web server with in the Host application, and handle requests to perform such operations But remember - it is not WPF. Hope this clarifies.
