Having an object in a list know statistical information about that list

For the sake of argument I have Person Objects public class Person { public int Age { get; set; } public string Name { get; set; } } I need to have a List or something similar where each person can tell if they are older or younger than the average age. (Ideally I want to say top 10% and bottom 10%) but I will settle for over under median. Is there a way to do this? List people = new List (); //Fill People foreach(var person in people) { if (person.TopTenPercent) { Console.WriteLine(person.Name); } } Thanks Mark
