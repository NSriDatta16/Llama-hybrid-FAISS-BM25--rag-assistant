It's just like any other tool in Flash really, if you have a use for it, use it. We used it on the homepage of Strange & Dawson because we wanted a robot arm... so it's a natural fit. Do this animation without using IK would have been a nightmare or at least involved preset animations. IK let us control the arm dynamically to have a more organic behaviour. That said, it's still pretty buggy so it can be a struggle coding against armature but have some fun with it and see what uses your imagination can come up with!
