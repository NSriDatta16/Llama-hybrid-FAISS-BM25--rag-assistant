try Facebook's Prophet model. I think this will be best suitable out of many time series Models(AR/MA/ARCH/GARCH/ARIMA/ETS/ARTX etc). http://machinelearningstories.blogspot.in/2017/05/facebooks-phophet-model-for-forecasting.html https://facebookincubator.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html refer Facebookincubator for detailed information.
