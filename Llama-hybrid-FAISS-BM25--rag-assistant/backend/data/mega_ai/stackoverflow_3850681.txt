CSS float left and right in paragraph with span?

Until now, when I had one line with example previous --- page width --- next I used a container div with 2 children, styled float:left & float:right I am think it could be done from one paragraph line with span's maybe something like: previous next I tried CSS with: span.s-left { text-align: left; } span.s-right { text-align: right; } but that doesn't do it..
