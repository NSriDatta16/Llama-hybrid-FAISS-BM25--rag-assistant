As I understand them, SVMs have built-in regularization because they tend to penalize large weights of predictors which amounts to favor simpler models. They're often used with recursive feature elimination (in neuroimaging paradigms, at least). About R specifically, there's the kernlab package, by Alex Smola who co-authored Learning with Kernels (2002, MIT Press), which implements SVM (in addition to e1071 ). However, if you are after a dedicated framework, I would warmly recommend the caret package.
