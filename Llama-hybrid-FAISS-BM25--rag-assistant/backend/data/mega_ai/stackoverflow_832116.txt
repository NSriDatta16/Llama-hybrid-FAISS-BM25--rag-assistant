Regular Expression (C# flavor) to fetch first after heading tag

I'm nearly done with a trackback system for my website, but have one last niggling regular expression I just can't get right. What I'm after is an excerpt of the referring page, where I'm defining the most relevant excerpt as: The first paragraph (marked by tags) that follows either an , or in the HTML Source of the page. For instance, I can successfully fetch the tag for the HTML as follows: Regex reTITLE = new Regex( @"(? )([\s\S]*)(?= )", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase ); Match match = reTITLE.Match( strHTMLSource ); if (match.Success) { strReferringPageTitle = match.Value.Trim( ); } My question -- what Regular Expression can I use to fetch the string described in the first part of my post? PS: I love StackOverflow and this community -- great job, Joel & Co.!
