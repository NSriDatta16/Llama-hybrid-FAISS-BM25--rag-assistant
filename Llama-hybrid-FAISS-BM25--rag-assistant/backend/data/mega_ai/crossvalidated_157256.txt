Normally you would expect $\operatorname{log}(GDP)$ to be integrated of order one and $\Delta \operatorname{log}(GDP)$ (the growth rate of $GDP$) to be stationary. The long-run average growth rate will be a couple of percent (rather than zero) per year so it is reasonable to include a drift term when testing for a unit root in $\operatorname{log}(GDP)$. This is the same as to say that $\operatorname{log}(GDP)$ has a linear time trend, or that $GDP$ is growing exponentially. Meanwhile, if you allow for a linear trend in the augmented Dickey-Fuller test specification, that means you allow for a linear trend in the growth rate of $GDP$, or a quadratic trend in $\operatorname{log}(GDP)$. That would be difficult to interpret from the subject-matter perspective. Would you expect the growth rate to have a linear trend? I doubt that. I doubt it makes sense testing for a unit root in the level of $GDP$, as the level is growing or diminishing exponentially, if we follow the ideas in the first paragraph. So if you conduct the test on $\operatorname{log}(GDP)$, perhaps your results will match the expected findings. If they do not, then you have to make a choice: (1) believe the scheme above and blame the short sample period, a structural change or yet something else for a "weird" test result, or (2) ditch the scheme (say that it is it that is "weird") and follow the test result.
