So this is regression with a categorical dependent variable, or binary logistic regression. We want to know how changes in X are associated with the probability of Y. For example, we want to know how changes in age (X) are related to the probability of developing TB (Y). Thus, any observations made after data collected to examine the relationship between age (X) and TB (Y), BMI (X) and TB (Y), income (X) and TB (Y) (etc.) changes the intent of the initial research question. Rather, conceptually we are now looking at how changes in X after developing TB (or not developing TB), contribute to the probability of Y (TB health). Beyond this, Bayesian approaches allow us to update the regression model with new data ( bayesian prior ), however I don't think this is applicable here.
