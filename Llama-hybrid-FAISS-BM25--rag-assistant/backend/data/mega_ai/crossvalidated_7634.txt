One option is to take a single tree and make it small (e.g. 3-5 features). This will show a classification process that is easy to interpret. If you want something closer to a "score", then try using a linear classifier (such as Naive Bayes or SVM). Again, use few (3-5) features and discretize them into levels if you want. They will compute something like $$Score = w_1 \cdot f_1 + w_2 \cdot f_2 + ... ,$$ where $f_i$ are feature values (1, 2, or 3 in your example) and $w_i$ is the weight for that feature (i.e. how many points you get for that feature). The disadvantage of all this is that you need to use few features and small classifiers for them to be easy to interpret. But they may not work as well as your big classifier.
