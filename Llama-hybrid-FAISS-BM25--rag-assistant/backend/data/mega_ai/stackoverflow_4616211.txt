Parallel pipeline in C#

I want to create a parallel pipeline in C#. I have declaered an Interface named IOperation: public interface IOperation { BlockingCollection BlockingCollection(IEnumerable input); } Now i want to write a class, which executes multiple of these operations parallel. I bagan with this: public class Pipeline : IPipeline { private List > operations = new List >(); private List > buffers = new List >(); public void Register(IOperation operation) { operations.Add(operation); } public void Execute() { } } But i don't find any solution to save the operations and the buffers between the operations, because they all have different generic types. Does anyone have an idea?
