(Empirical) Bayesian approach : As @whuber mentions, I think the most natural approach is a Bayesian approach, or possibly even an empirical Bayesian approach. In particular, let's call the true entity scores $e_j$ for $j=1,\dotsc,m$. To estimate these you have data $X_{j1},\dotsc, X_{jn_j}$ for each $j$. Note that $n_j$ is different in each case. Now assume you have a prior $g$ for the $e_j$, i.e. $e_j \sim g$, then rather than estimating $e_j$ by the sample mean $\hat{e_j} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n_j}X_{ij}} {n_j}$, you could take the posterior mean: $$\tilde{e_j} = \mathbb E[e_j | X_{j1}, \dotsc, X_{jn_j}]$$ This approach would even work if you don't want to put a prior $g$ on these scores; instead you could learn the prior $g$ from your data. This is called Empirical Bayes. Bradley Efron recently wrote a paper on how to do this "almost" nonparametrically ("almost" because he does not do actual nonparametrics, but considers flexible exponential families with many parameters). For a simpler approach, David Robinson has a very nice blog post , where he elaborates on this idea based on the example on determining the best batters (i.e. rank based on average hits the players gets). Ad-hoc frequentist approach: Another approach which in my opinion is a lot more ad-hoc, but has the advantage of being simpler and possibly easier to explain, is to use the lower bound of a ($1-\alpha$) confidence interval of the parameter for the ranking of these entity scores. For example, if $\hat{\sigma}_j$ is the standard deviation estimate based on the $n_j$ samples for the $j$-th entity score, then you could rank based on: $$ \bar{e_j} = \hat{e_j} - \frac{\hat{\sigma}_j}{\sqrt{n_j}}z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$$ Here $z_{1-\frac{\alpha}{2}}$ is the $1-\frac{\alpha}{2}$ quantile of a standard Normal distribution (could use more elaborate schemes of course). This has the advantage of accounting for sample size directly and being simple to compute; but again I think it is quite ad-hoc. [There was a quite famous blog post by someone using such an approach for his internet company; I cannot find it right now unfortunately. Maybe someone that reads this can also point me to that post.]
