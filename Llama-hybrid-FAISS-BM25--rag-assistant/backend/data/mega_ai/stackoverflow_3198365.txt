Can't get a phone number in my Android App

My Android app needs to retrieve information about a contact (namely, phone number and name.) I wrote some code using getContentResolver().query() In the results, I am seeing that the name is being returned, and other information like when I last contacted that person, but not the phone number. What am I doing wrong? The code: Log.w("MyApp", "requesting " + phonesUri.toString()); Cursor contactCursor = context.getContentResolver().query(person, null, null, null, null); contactCursor.moveToFirst(); for (int i = 0; i which outputs this: W/MyApp (21477): requesting content://contacts/people/169/phones W/MyApp (21477): times_contacted: 6 W/MyApp (21477): custom_ringtone: null W/MyApp (21477): primary_organization: null W/MyApp (21477): phonetic_name: W/MyApp (21477): status: null W/MyApp (21477): label: null W/MyApp (21477): number: null W/MyApp (21477): type: null W/MyApp (21477): mode: null W/MyApp (21477): last_time_contacted: 1278113641980 W/MyApp (21477): display_name: (name removed for privacy) W/MyApp (21477): im_handle: null W/MyApp (21477): _id: 169 W/MyApp (21477): number_key: null W/MyApp (21477): starred: 0 W/MyApp (21477): primary_email: null W/MyApp (21477): name: (name removed for privacy) W/MyApp (21477): primary_phone: null W/MyApp (21477): im_account: null W/MyApp (21477): notes: W/MyApp (21477): im_protocol: null W/MyApp (21477): send_to_voicemail: 0
