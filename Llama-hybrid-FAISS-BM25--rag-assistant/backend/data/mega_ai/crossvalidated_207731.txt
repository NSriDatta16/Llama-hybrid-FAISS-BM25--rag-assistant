Sampling of a Gaussian posterior

Sorry for my simple doubt, but I'm quite newbie and don't clearly get how to sample the posterior Bayesian distribution. My likelihood and prior are normal and I know how to calculate the posterior. How do I sample now? Can someone explain it in the simplest way? EDIT: Bayes theorem states: $$ p(θ|y)=\frac{p(y|θ)p(θ)}{p(y)} $$ When I am sampling, what example do I sample for the posterior? I read that the rnorm command (in R) can easily sample; I gather the syntax would be: rnorm(n samples, mean, std) . Is this kind of sampling as valid as MCMC? What is it executing there exactly? Is sampling from a normal posterior equal to sampling from an isolated normal distribution?
