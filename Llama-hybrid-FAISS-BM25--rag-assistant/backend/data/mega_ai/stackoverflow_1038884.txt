If the users are on a domain then I would have the sysadmin push .NET 3.5 out using Group Policies / Windows Update or whatever other strategy is being used to manage the desktops. It does sound like an environment issue. If the organization is large enough to have a system administrator then it should be that person's responsibility to provide an environment for the application to run. If the organization doesn't have a person in this role then I do believe you're back to your manual solution. Also, doing it manually doesn't necessarily break 'all the advantages of ClickOnce'... The advantages for ClickOnce is that you can modify the client, republish and the client machines will automatically upgrade... I suppose the other option is to write a script that gets and installs .NET 3.5 and then installs the application, I haven't done this before... I'm reasonably sure it would work... Actually, you could deploy a startup script via Group Policies that gets .NET 3.5 as well, that would be very simple.
