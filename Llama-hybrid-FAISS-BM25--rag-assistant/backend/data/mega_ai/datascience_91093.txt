Recent comprehensive text-books on machine learning?

I would like to ask what are the current recommendations for professional and comprehensive, current books on machine learning. The two quite classic comprehensive text-books are: Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective (Murphy, 2012) The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction (By Springer Statistics, 2009) But they are somewhat dated, so I wonder if there are more recent choices? You may also recommend books that focus on sub-sections of ML, or anything that is recent and of note.
