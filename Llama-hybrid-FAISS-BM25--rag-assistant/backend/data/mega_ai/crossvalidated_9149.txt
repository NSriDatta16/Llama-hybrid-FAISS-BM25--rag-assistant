Well, this particular tool is popular in my industry (though it is not industry-specific by design): http://www.umetrics.com/simca It allows you to do latent variable type multivariate analysis (PCA and PLS), and it includes all the attendant interpretative plots / calculations and interrogation tools like contribution plots, variable importance plots, Q2 calculations etc. It is often used on high-dimensional (and often highly correlated/collinear) industrial datasets where OLS/MLR type methods are unsuitable (e.g. info from a boatload of sensors, log info, etc.). It operates in a fully GUI environment, and the user does not have to write a single line of code. Unfortunately it is not free, and cannot be extended via programming.
