1 Stationary time series, 1 non stationary: do I need to transform BOTH, OR can I use VAR with 1 transformed and 1 stationary variable?

I am doing a time series forecast using VAR. I have 2 time series, "orders" and "calls" The orders time series is stationary The calls time series is non-stationary Let's say I use the transformation method and use log to make the "calls" time series stationary. Do I need to also transform the other series (orders) even though it is already stationary to fit the VAR model ? Can I make forecast predictions with VAR using 1 non transformed and 1 transformed variable ? Thanks!
