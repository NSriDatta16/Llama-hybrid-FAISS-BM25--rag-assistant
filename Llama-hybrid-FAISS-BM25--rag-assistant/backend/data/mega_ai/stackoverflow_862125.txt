STA guarantees that your object is only accessed from a single, specific thread -- no protection against shared variable is required. I remember that for VB6, there was a special mode (I do not recall how it was named): You could allow COM+ to spawn up multiple STAs, each using a dedicated object. The variables of these objects, however, were treated as thread-local storage -- so although there are multiple instances of your COM class being accessed from multiple threads, no sharing of variables is taking place. Is it possible that you are using this feature?
