I'm one of those archaic dudes who do GUI layout by hand. I'm also not afraid of the infamous GridBagLayout ! I keep things simple for myself by emulating the coding standard used by Visual Age, years ago: I use a lot of JPanels to organize parts of the GUI, and each one gets its own makeXXX() method to create it, lay it out and return it to a a parent panel or the constructor. That way, each makeXXX only has to concentrate on a small part of the whole works. Some components need to be accessible by various instance methods; I declare those as instance fields. The other stuff, that's just decoration or layout, need not be exposed outside the makeXXX methods. That's mostly it. Works for me.
