Yes, your friend is absolutely correct. Well, he's more correct than your original approach. What you should do is go a step further and create a class whose only job is to query or update to the database and return results. That class is responsible for organizing queries (which are all prepared statements ); your "admin" class knows nothing about how to connect to or query the database, only how to use this class, which we'll call "data_layer". Pass an instance of the data_layer class to the admin class in the constructor, et voil√†! You have made a layered program. Congratulations! You're taking your first steps toward a larger world.
