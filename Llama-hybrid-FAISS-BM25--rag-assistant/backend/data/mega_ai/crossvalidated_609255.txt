Need help in understanding how to carryout Discrete Event Simulation for forecasting using the utilities package in R

I am using the utilities package in R to conduct the DES for a forecasting project. My problem involves forecasting the service requirement for patients. On average five patients get admitted to the ward daily and there are 46 beds in a ward. In order to do this simulation I have set K=46 (since I believe K = users/total facility capacity). I have set n=20, the number of patients and lambda=5 (avg no. of patients). The revival time is 30 minutes. SOME CODE IS RE-USED FROM SUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL OF THE PACKAGE The use time of the facility: use_time where mu=1440 minutes (avg time the facility service remains in use. The arrival time: ARRIVE Hence the code for QUEUE function: QUEUE lambda My question is: the time I see at the bottom of the plot is in minutes? Or should this be in hours? Second, are the parameters set correctly? I am new to this hence I am not sure if I am on the right track.
