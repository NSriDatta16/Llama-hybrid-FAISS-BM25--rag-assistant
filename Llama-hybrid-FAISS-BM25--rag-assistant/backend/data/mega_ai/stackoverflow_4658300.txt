jQuery Sortable without jQuery UI

I am in need of "Sortable Drag & Drop" functionality and I'm using jQuery. I can't really use jQuery UI, because for this project it would be an overhead (I'd need to add many KB of JS and CSS only to use small part of functionality). Is there any plugin that you could recommend or maybe a simple implementation path, that I can follow? The solution must be as lightweight as possible, preferably based on jQuery/Sizzle or pure JavaScript.
