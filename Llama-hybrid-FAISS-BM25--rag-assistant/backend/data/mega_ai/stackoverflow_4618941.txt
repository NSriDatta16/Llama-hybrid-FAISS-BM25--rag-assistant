Just because your site is using jQuery doesn't mean every single thing you do has to integrate into it. Just use PersistJS as is. We're using it in a project and it works great. The guys from appendTo just released their amplify component library, designed to integrate with jQuery sites. One of the components is amplify.store which may be what you're looking for. One of the benefits of amplify.store over PersistJS is that it allows you to add your own custom storage mechanisms.
