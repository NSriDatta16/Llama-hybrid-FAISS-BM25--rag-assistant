Logistic regression returns the probability of the outcome conditioned on the covariates (or the features, as it is sometimes said in ML). In this example, the logistic regression returns the probability of "Up" given the covariates. When the author does glm.pred 0.5, "Up", "Down") , what they are doing implicitly is saying that if the model returns a probability greater than 50%, then assume that the "Up" event will occur. Thus, your prediction will be "Up". If the probability is less than or equal to 0.5, predict "Down".
