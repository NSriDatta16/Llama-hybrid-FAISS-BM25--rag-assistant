Machine learning models with probability distribution output

Given a feature vector $x$ I want to predict a continuous value $y$. However, I don't want to predict a single value for $y$, but rather the distribution of $y$'s given a particular set of feature values. What is the best way of doing this? Assume I have a labeled training set of $x,y$ pairs to work from.
