What is the difference between loss function and MLE?

I am trying to learn Machine Learning and I am not exactly sure what these terms entail. I know the likelihood is a function in terms of the parameters to be learned and we want to maximize it, but I also know we fit a model using a loss function... Can someone give examples of each under different modes (e.g. what is the MLE in a Discrete Naive Bayes or in Logistic Regression), also how they are related to the loss functions?
