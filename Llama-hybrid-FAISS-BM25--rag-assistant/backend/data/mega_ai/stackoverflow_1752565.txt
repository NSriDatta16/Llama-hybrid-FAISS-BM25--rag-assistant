#pragma midl_echo instructs MIDL to insert an arbitrary piece of text into the generated header file. You can use it like this: #pragma midl_echo("struct StructDef;") It appears that the cpp_quote attribute provides similar functionality. Alternatively, if you have Cygwin installed, you may find it simpler (or just preferable) to post-process the header file with sed in a custom build step. That would work as well.
