PostgreSQL - tree organization

I'm working on a project wich requires a tree of categories, organized as id, parent, title table. Which are the best ways to retrieve category and its subcategories(and a full tree, if root categories have parent=0) in Postgres? I'm looking for a pure database solution, but if there is a way for Ruby and PHP - it will be great too. The main goal is speed of select clauses, 'cause data in this table is not critical for update/insert/delete speed. UPD: there will be also path searching, i mean path from current vertex(category) to root category.
