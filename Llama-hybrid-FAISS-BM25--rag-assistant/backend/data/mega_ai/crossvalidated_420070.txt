Just want to give an (extreme) example: if we have a hit rate of (1/10000) in one sample, and a hit rate of (1/2) in another example, then $\sum \frac{hit_i}{total_i} \neq \frac{\sum hit_i}{\sum total_i}$ . In the first case (mean of means), we have an "average" hit rate of 0.5001/2 while in the second case (mean of total) we have 3/10003, and these two numbers are not the same. Whether one is more appropriate or correct depends on your use case.
