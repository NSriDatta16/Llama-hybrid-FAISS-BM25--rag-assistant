Afaik it's not possible to play videos from the internal app storage, see Can a videoview play a video stored on internal storage? I faced similar issue and already searched about it. http://www.anddev.org/multimedia-problems-f28/videoview-cannot-play-video-from-internal-storage-t16636.html http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/browse_thread/thread/a01d415c8e48e0d3 Workaround is to copy the video to sdcard temporarily and play it from there.
