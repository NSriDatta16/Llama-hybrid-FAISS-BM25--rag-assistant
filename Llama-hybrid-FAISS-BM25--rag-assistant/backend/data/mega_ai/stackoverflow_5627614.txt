Anything is possible of course, but you have some fundamental issues to overcome to have a seamless SSH experience. The biggest issue is not installing SSH - that is cake. The issue you have to face is how to use it across instances when you have a load balancer in front. For a single instance, you should have no issues running an SSH server. All clients will connect easily. Once you have multiple servers running SSH, you get into an issue if the connection to an instance is severed and you reconnect to a different instance. It is nice to run multiple instances for SLA reasons, so this is a common issue. Now, RDP (which is a stateful connection) works in Windows Azure because of a socket-based router that forwards traffic to the single instance you wish to communicate with. You might be able to do something similar for SSH. Beyond the communication issue (assuming you work out SSH with load-balancing), you need to think about persistence. When you FTP something into Windows Azure, unless you are using a drive (XDrive), it is persisted only locally. You would need to think about moving those files off the VM and into permanent storage like blob storage. So, long story short. Yes, you can do it, but it will be some work to do right.
