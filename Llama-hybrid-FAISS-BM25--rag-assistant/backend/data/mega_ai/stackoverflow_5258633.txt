Most elegant way to add a different object from vector in Java

I have a Vector containing x . What is the most elegant way to get the values of the list as an Object[] and add an y element to the end of it? x and y are not of the same class or so. The obvious solution would be to make a new Object[] with the size of the Vector + 1. Then iterate over it and add each x , and then add y at the end. Also, Object[] objectArray = vector.toArray(); Would make the objectArray shrink by 1.
