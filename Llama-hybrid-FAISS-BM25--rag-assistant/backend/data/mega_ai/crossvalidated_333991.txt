Adding/removing variables to PCA

If I have a PCA that I ran on some set of variables, how (if at all) will it relate to the PCA results if I add or remove one variable? Will the PCA components change in some well-defined way, or is there no relationship that is guaranteed between the old and new eigenvalues & eigenvectors?
