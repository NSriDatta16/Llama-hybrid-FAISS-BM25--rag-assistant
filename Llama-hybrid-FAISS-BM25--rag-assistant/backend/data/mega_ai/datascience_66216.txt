GridSearch without CV

I create a Random Forest and Gradient Boosting Regressor by using GridSearch CV . For the Gradient Boosting Regressor, it takes too long for me. But I need to know which are the best parameters for the models. So I am thinking if there is a GridSearch without CV because the OOB score is sufficient to evaluate the models. I hope I could explain what I mean.
