More vegetation comes to mind, such as trees or "undergrowth", depending on how much grass coverage you have. You could play with differently-grown trees at different locations. Perhaps some trees grow faster nearer water, while trees high up a mountain side are shrunken and rugged? You might want to think about more weather phenomena, such as wind (bending grass, affecting tree growth, etc). You can also think about what it would take to modify the terrain, for instance simulating an explosion blowing a hole somewhere, or an earthquake cracking the surface open. Sounds like fun!
