Comparing a single point in two time series

I have two time series of males and females traveling from point A in between 1979 to 2001. The question is, is there a significant difference in the number of male and female travelers in year, say, 2000? How can I answer this question? Also, would it be different if I had the data divided by destination, i.e females and males traveling from A to B, from A to C, etc.?
