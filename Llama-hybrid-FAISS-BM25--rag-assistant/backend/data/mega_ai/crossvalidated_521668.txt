Based on the follow-up in the comments, I would suggest that the appropriate strategy to analyze the data to answer this research question is to use latent variable model to obtain a single measure form the Likert responses. In brief, you will want to run a model that (1) estimates a single score for each individual from the survey item responses, and (2) compares the average of those latent scores. This can be accomplished by a multi-group confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). A very good reference for how to do this in R is Latent Variable Modeling Using R by Beaujean. I have taught from this book, and students have shared that it is a great reference and is very accessible. It does require a basic understanding of how R works. Happy to share more if requested.
