Two envelope problem revisited

I was thinking of this problem. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_envelopes_problem I believe the solution and I think I understand it, but if I take the following approach I'm completely confused. Problem 1: I will offer you the following game. You pay me \$10 and I will flip a fair coin. Heads I give you \$5 and Tails I give you \$20. The expectation is \$12.5 so you will always play the game. Problem 2: I will give you an envelope with \$10, the envelope is open and you can check. I then show you another envelope, closed this time and tell you: This envelope either has \$5 or $20 in it with equal probability. Do you want to swap? I feel this is exactly the same as problem 1, you forgo \$10 for a \$5 or a \$20, so again you will always switch. Problem 3: I do the same as above but close the envelopes. So you don't know there are $10 but some amount X. I tell you the other envelope has double or half. Now if you follow the same logic you want to switch. This is the envelope paradox. What changed when I closed the envelope?? EDIT: Some have argued that problem 3 is not the envelope problem and I'm going to try and provide below why I think it is by analysing how each views the game. Also, it gives a better set up for the game. Providing some clarification for Problem 3: From the perspective of the person organising the game: I hold 2 envelopes. In one I put \$10 close it and give it to the player. I then tell him, I have one more envelope that has either double or half the amount of the envelope I just gave you. Do you want to switch? I then proceed to flip a fair coin and Heads I put \$5 in and Tails I put \$20. And hand him the envelope. I then ask him. The envelope you just gave me has twice or half the amount of the envelope you are holding. Do you want to switch? From the perspective of the player: I am given an envelope and told there is another envelope that has double or half the amount with equal probability. Do I want to switch. I think sure I have $X$ , hence $\frac{1}{2}(\frac{1}{2}X + 2X) > X$ so I want to switch. I get the envelope and all of a sudden I am facing the exact same situation. I want to switch again as the other envelope has either double or half the amount.
