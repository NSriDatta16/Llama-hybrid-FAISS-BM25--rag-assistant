javascript popup window remember last size and position

I am opening pop-up window through JavaScript with resize option for end user. End user may resize pop-up window or change its default position by dragging it. I have requirement of remembering last position and size of pop-up window when user closes the window. At present I can keep last size of the pop-up window in onbeforeunload event using cookie. But still could not find last position of the window. Am I missing something very obvious, or what I am doing is the correct way to do it.
