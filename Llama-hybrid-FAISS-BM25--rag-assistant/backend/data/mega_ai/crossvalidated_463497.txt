You have two major sets of issues here: how to set up the analysis for a single type of observation, and how to deal with having multiple correlated observations. Let's look at those one at a time. Modeling one type of observation To start let's say for simplicity that there is only 1 type of echocardiographic measurement (Call it Echo1) taken at the beginning (Echo1_0) and at the end (Echo1_end), and that you want to evaluate the effect of treatment on that measurement while you account for covariates like age and gender. Age and gender aren't "random effects" in the technical sense; "random effects" represent inter-individual differences (typically unknown, just modeled by some distribution) beyond those accounted for by simple specified variables like those. With 1 measurement at the beginning of the study and 1 at the end, the analysis might work well on paired differences, as @Dave2e suggests in another answer. (A more complicated design might require more sophisticated repeated-measures analysis.) So for each individual you calculate the post-pre difference (PPD = Echo1_end - Echo1_0), and use that as your outcome variable. That way, the Time variable is removed from the analysis. If you want to take other covariates into account you need to go beyond a simple ANOVA. You could write a linear model like the following: lm(PPD ~ treatment + gender + age, data = df.tot) to give you an estimate of the effect of treatment on PPD while allowing for additive effects of gender and age on the PPD. The usual rule of thumb is about 15 observations per coefficient that you are estimating, so you would need on the order of 50 patients to do this reliably. You seem to be worried about meeting requirement of normality for this type of test, but the issue isn't normality of observations per se, it's the normality of the deviations from the values estimated from the model. That can be checked and I suspect either won't be much of a problem or can be resolved by some transformations of the measurements (e.g., fractional changes rather than absolute differences). There might be something to be gained by modeling the individual Echo1 measurements, both Echo1_0 and Echo1_end separately. Then you would have to use a treatment*Time term in your model, as the simple additive treatment + Time would assume that the Echo1 values differed between treatment and control groups by the same amount at both Time_0 and Time_end, and that the (Time_end - Time_0) differences were the same for both treatment and control groups. That's clearly not what you expect from your study. To include covariates in that modeling, you would have to decide whether you just wanted to know their association with Echo1_0 values (just additive terms in the model) or also with changes with time or treatment effects (requiring interaction terms). To regain some of the advantages of paired analysis you could include a random effect for subject ( 1|subject ) that allows and corrects for differences in estimated baseline values in a mixed model. Modeling multiple types of observations The principles above apply to any single type of observation, but having 16 observations leads to both some potential complications and advantages. If you did separate models for each of your 16 types of observations, you would have to correct for multiple comparisons . Running 16 separate tests at p One way to proceed is to use your knowledge of the subject matter to combine some measurement types into single outcome measures. For example, it seems that results on speed and displacement might be closely related and could be combined in some way. Or you could find some way to combine all of the measurements within each of the passive, peak, and plateau parts of the cycle so that you are down to testing only 3 effective outcomes, one for each part of the cycle. Check with published reports in the literature to get clues on how others have modeled these types of echocardiogram measurements. Using your knowledge of the subject matter has advantages in terms of explaining to a wide audience of your peers just what you have done. Another would be to let the data tell you which measurements tend to track together, to model changes in principal components of the set of outcome measurements as you mention in a comment. I don't have any experience with that. I think that you would need to do PCA on the entire set of observations to get the eigenvectors, then see how the projections onto some of the most prominent eigenvectors change between Time_0 and Time_end. Note that this is different from what you usually read with respect to PCA regression, in which PCA is used to diminish the dimension of the predictor space. Here you want to diminish the dimension of the outcome space. The second approach is related to partial least squares (PLS) regression . Again, many examples and implementations of PLS tend to emphasize reduction of the predictor space (and I don't have personal experience with PLS), but it was designed to deal with both predictor and outcome spaces so you might find that to be a way to proceed.
