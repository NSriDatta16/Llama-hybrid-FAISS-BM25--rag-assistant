Table Names: I like this convention: [type] [subject] [name] where type is 'dim' or 'fact' (or 'facts' for aggregates) where subject is the subject area within the warehouse ('comm' for common, 'fw' for firewall, 'ids', etc) where name is ideally a single word name, or abbreviations of dimensions in the case of an aggregate table ex: dim_comm_org for the organizational dimension ex: fact_scan for the scan fact table ex: facts_scan_org_sev_daily - fact scan summary table grouped at the org, sev & day level Column Names: don't prefix with the entire table name - that's way too long do prefix with just a meaningful part of it - this helps tremendously when writing or reading queries. Warehouse vs OLTP Naming: the two are very different. Warehouse table & column names often end up in metadata, on reports, being read by both developers and users. Not so much with OLTP. I think table prefixes are still useful in OLTP - but there I think it's best if it's something meaningful about that subset of the model rather than a fact/dimension distinction.
