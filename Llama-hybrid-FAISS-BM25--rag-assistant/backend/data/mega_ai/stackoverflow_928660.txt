It sounds like you're paying too much attention to the choice of tools you're going to use, before you know what you're going to do. What I would suggest is: Decide what you want to do. If you're going to authenticate logins against a user list of some sort, state exactly what you want to do. Once you know what you want to do, decide how you are going to do it. Have a look at other solutions, such as HTTP Basic authentication, or using cookies, or some other method, and decide which method is best for your needs.

Again, evaluation of other existing solutions will help you in this decision. Implement your solution, following your plan in (2).
