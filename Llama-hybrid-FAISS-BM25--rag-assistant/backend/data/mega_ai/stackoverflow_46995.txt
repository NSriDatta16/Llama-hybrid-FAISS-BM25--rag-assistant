Custom (hand-written) storage engine / Potentially very high performance in required uses cases http://www.hdfgroup.org/ If you have enormous data sets, instead of rolling your own, you might use HDF, the Hierarchical Data Format. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_Data_Format : HDF supports several different data models, including multidimensional arrays, raster images, and tables. It's also hierarchical like a file system, but the data is stored in one magic binary file. HDF5 is a suite that makes possible the management of extremely large and complex data collections. Think petabytes of NASA/JPL remote sensing data.
