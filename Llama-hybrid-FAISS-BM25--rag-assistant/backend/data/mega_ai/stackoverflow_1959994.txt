Following up on Neil Williams' answer: Authors may specify a number of mutually exclusive style sheets called alternate style sheets.... User agents should allow users to select from alternate style sheets. (emphasis added) Also: To make a style sheet preferred, set the rel attribute to "stylesheet" and name the style sheet with the title attribute. This is from http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/present/styles.html#h-14.3.1
