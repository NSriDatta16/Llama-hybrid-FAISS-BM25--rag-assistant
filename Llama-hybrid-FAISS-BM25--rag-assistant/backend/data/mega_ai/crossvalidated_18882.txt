How do I calculate projected figures for the next year based on past performance?

I'm a SQL/C++ developer who recently has been asked to generate a report from our database to predict some future performance based on historical data; the problem is that I don't have much experience of this sort of data modelling. I initially thought I could take an average of each month's results and use that but after reading articles on the web about statistical models, estimation, forecasting etc. I felt that might not be sufficient. Plus, most of the formulas are over my head as I've never learnt statistics. What process would you recommend as the best way (for me) to calculate these predictions? Preferable something I can translate in to SQL or use in a spreadsheet (Excel)? Update to link in comment The link jthetzel provides to the document "Statistical flaws in Excel" by Hans Pottel (www.coventry.ac.uk/ec/~nhunt/pottel.pdf) no longer exists. I managed to find the document here .
