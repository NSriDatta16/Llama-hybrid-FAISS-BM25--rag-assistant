If I'm using your site, "average" doesn't matter. All I care about is MY experience, and so you either need to make the site adaptive, design for a pretty low speed (iPhone 2G gets you 70-80 kbps if you're lucky, to take one common case), or be very clear about the requirements so I can decide whether or not my connection-of-the-moment will work or not. What you don't want to subject your users to is unpredictably choppy, intermittent video and audio.
