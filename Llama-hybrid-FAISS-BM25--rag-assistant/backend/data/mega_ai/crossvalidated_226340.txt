EDIT: You can see a better discussion here: Understanding which features were most important for logistic regression TL;DR: You can calculate and compare the marginal effects, but this is an interpretive process. It sounds to me like you're asking about the marginal effect of X on Y, and there's been a lot written about the relative weighting of marginal effects. In the case of an ordinary linear model you can usually just check the size of the $\beta$ coefficient and interpret as a 1-unit change in $X$ leading to a $\beta$ change in $Y$. Calculating these effects for a logit is more difficult, but hardly impossible. See http://www.appstate.edu/~whiteheadjc/service/logit/intro.htm for a description of how to calculate these effects. A murkier question is how to weight the marginal effects given the different distribution types of $X$ variables. For example, in your code, X1 is distributed uniformly, but X2 is not. When interpreting marginal effects, "a one unit increase in $X$" now has different substantive meanings. Throttling up X1 from 0 to 1 means something different than for X2. One possible solution is to standardize your $\beta$ by dividing by the standard deviations in your $X$ data, but this still hides information about the distributions of your $X$ and what kind of marginal increases are either likely or possible.
