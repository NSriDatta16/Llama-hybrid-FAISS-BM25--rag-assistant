The question seems to conflate functional improvement with some type of statistical improvement. I would like to compute the percentage of patients that got a significant improvement in their holding breath duration... moving from 67 to 70 doesn't look like a huge advance, while patient 2 doubled their duration. My objective is to have a result like "X% of the patients showed a significant increase in their holding breath performance". That sounds like you want something that would be significant for an individual. The particular measure that you propose, however: I thought of computing the average FI* and its standard deviation and then marking the patients with $FI_i as "not improved". would simply identify individuals whose measure of improvement was in some low quantile among the results of your study sample. If training was very successful, many of those in a low quantile of improvement could nevertheless have a magnitude of improvement that is functionally important for them. You need to apply your understanding of the subject matter to decide first on a measure of functional importance. If one ever had to hold breath under water to survive, the achieved number of seconds or the increase in the number of seconds of breath-holding following training might be more functionally important than the post/pre ratio of breath-holding times that you propose. A plot of the empirical distribution function of improvement scores would then describe your results nicely. A reader could decide for herself what a functionally significant improvement score would be and determine what fraction of individuals did better than that. One caution: as others have noted, anything that you find with this particular design could not demonstrate that your "teaching" had anything to do with improved performance. It might just be that people tend to do better when they try a second time. Without a control group, for example individuals who had a second test without the training, you can't say anything about the effect of the "teaching." *I'm reluctant to call the post/pre ratio a "fold increase" (FI) due to a different definition for that phrase used in a Wikipedia entry . Furthermore, ratios often have skewed distributions that might not be well represented by the standard deviation in the original scale.
