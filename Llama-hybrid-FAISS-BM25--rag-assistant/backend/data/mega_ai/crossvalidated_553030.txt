Calculate AIC of an AR process knowing the coefs and n?

In a paper I'm reading, the authors determine the order of an AR process via AIC. Fine. But they do so from the AR coefficients and length of the process and not from the time series itself. The formula given is $$aic_p = n \times ln(\sigma) + 2.0 \times p$$ where $p$ is the order (lag), $n$ is the length of the time series and " $\sigma$ is calculated from the AR coefficients." Any insight into how this last part is actually done? Imagine I have three AR models I'm considering with coefficients as: ARmat And $n=300$ . Can I get the AIC for AR(1), AR(2), and AR(3)?
