Regarding Mercurial Security + recursive checkins of subrepositories

this is going to be a long post...sorry upfront. I'm trying to wrap my head around how to hold together "Repositories for each project branch", and what the impact of that would be on a team. Right now, it appears that Can recursively checkin code of nested checkins although hg status doesn't give much info on file changes within nested repos It appears that I -- and every team member who wants to work on the same project -- has to hand edit their subrepositoies' .hgrc files in order to make the checkin as painless and automated as possible. Can recursively checkin, but recursively checkout is not supported. Is that a correct analysis of Hg's capabilities? I'm really hoping not, as that's a lot more stick-shift coding (ie command prompt fiddling all over the place), than the average dev team I've seen could handle, while remaining productive. As I've understood it, refactoring a single assembly would probably grind the team to a halt as they stop to edit the .hgrc files to add location, user and password. No? And I really want to double check that Hg can't recursively pull? Sounds like such an omission, that I feel I must have missed something. Thanks! PS: For the brave or foolish, (and in case it helps), the notes I've been keeping as I work around the problem of projects that reference library modules that reference other library modules, is as follows (note the ????
