Edit: Anurag's answer is better than mine. ul = $('#my-ul'); // your parent ul element ul.children().each(function(i,li){ul.prepend(li)}) If you call .prepend() on an object containing more than one element, the element being appended will be cloned for the additional target elements after the first, so be sure you're only selecting a single element.
