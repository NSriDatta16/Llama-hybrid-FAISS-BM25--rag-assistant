MonoTouch wraps most but not all of the iPhone SDK. So, yes there are things you can't do (yet), but they're relatively few and far between. Many .Net folks find that they are more productive (at least initially) using MonoTouch, since they can leverage their existing skills. On the other hand, there's nothing like working in the native language of the land, it just takes a little longer. You will have to learn some Objective-C since most documentation out there in the world uses it (and/or C-level CoreFoundation APIs). Objective-C's dynamic nature will feel foreign at first, but you may find it quite liberating once you grok it fully. Having used many languages in my career, I find Objective-C (and the Cocoa APIs) one of the most pleasant development experiences out there.
