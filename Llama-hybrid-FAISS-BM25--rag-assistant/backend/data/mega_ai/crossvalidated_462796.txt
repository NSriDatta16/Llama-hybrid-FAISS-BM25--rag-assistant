I would highly recommend this video by the youtube channel 3blue1brown, as it is the best intuitive and visual explanation for Bayes Theorem: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZGCoVF3YvM The creator Grant makes many videos on a variety of different topics in Mathematics from calculus, to linear algebra, to even neural networks, and he has a fantastic ability to explain concepts in a way that helps you understand it, rather than just learning it to be able to use it. As a side note, he also has a follow up video on Bayes Theorem that will perhaps help relate it to your previous understanding of it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_85TaXbeIo
