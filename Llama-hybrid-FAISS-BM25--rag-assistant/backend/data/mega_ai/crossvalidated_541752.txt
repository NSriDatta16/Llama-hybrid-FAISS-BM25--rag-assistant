Time Series Regression

I am looking to identify when a significant change occurs across a series of growth rings (annuli) of fish pectoral fins. I am trying to identify when the annuli width decreases (state of maturity). I will have the widths of each growth ring (um) across the structure. After I determine the state of maturity I want to compare the trace elemental compositions before and after. I have ablated a line to quantify 13 trace elements across the fin ray from the core to the outer edge, ensuring a consistent and distinguishable signature corresponding with each growth band. I am considering using an interrupted time series regression to compare before and after maturity. Does this sound like a good way to go? Third image shows
