Is it possible to require PyQt from setuptools setup.py?

I'm building a small app that uses PyQt and tought it'd be nice to declare that dependency in setup.py. However, according to this blog (first hit on google for pyqt setuptools) says it can't be done, and the last paragraph here doens't try to do it either. Ideas? Perhaps I should switch to PySide which is on PyPi ? Update: The obvious install_requires = [ 'pyqt >= 0.7' ] in setup.py gives me: D:\3rd\BuildBotIcon\my-buildboticon\python>setup.py test running test install_dir . Checking .pth file support in .
