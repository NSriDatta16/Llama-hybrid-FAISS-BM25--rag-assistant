Alternative to Amazon S3 for the data center?

I'm looking to for a service that is similar to Amazon S3, a simple service to store and retrieve arbitrary data (and meta-data), but one that runs locally in your own data center. Strictly speaking, I'm not sure whether you would call this a CDN or a lightweight CMS. It must be horizontally scalable (both for storage and bandwidth) and fault tolerable. It must also support REST, preferably WS too, with a pluggable authentication and authorization system. Something built with Java EE would be preferable for more convenient integration and extensibility, but this is just a personal preference, and it not a requirement. Suggestions?
