How do I organize .NET solutions, projects, and system folders for multiple applications?

We are having a lot of trouble organizing our solutions in a good way. We have multiple applications. They are similar applications so a lot of reuse is done. Different apps include different capability depending on what our different customers will pay for. So, how do we go about organizing things? MSDN says to organize in the following way: SolutionFolder\ Proj1Folder\ Proj2Folder\ Proj3Folder\ ... (Note: By solution folder, I mean an actual folder on the system, not a visual studio solution folder.) But no details are mentioned regarding multiple solutions that reuse projects. It wouldn't make sense to create a second solution folder and reference projects under the first solution folder. My first thought is to completely isolate the solutions and then reference the projects as needed. Does that make sense? See below: Solutions\ Solution1.sln Solution2.sln Solution3.sln Projects\ AFeatures\ AProject1\ AProject2\ AProject3\ BFeatures\ BProject1\ BProject2\ CFeatures\ CProject1\ CProject2\ In the example above, I've grouped the projects based on certain features. Solution1 may include features A and C, Solution2 may include features B and C, and Solution3 may include A and B. Things get more complicated because each feature can have sub-features that won't be in all solutions. In other words, there may be common AFeatures but then a more specific A-1Features, A-2Features, etc. On top of this, we'd also like to group our projects base on n-tier architecture. So, I imagine we'd add BusinessServices, DataServices, and UserServices folders in the midst too. But, does it make sense to put the n-tier folder above or below the features structure? This is where my brain starts to spin. On a similar note, we'd like to have our interfaces in different projects that the implementation. This may not be that big of a deal. I imagine we'd have a AInterfacesProject1 and AProject at the same directory level so they're close together. I'd appreciate anybody's comments on my examples. And, if you've had experience with my same problem, I'd be curious as how you organized it.
