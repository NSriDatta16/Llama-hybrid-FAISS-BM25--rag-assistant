Now(2010.06.26) Accelerate framework included on iOS4, so vDSP/BLAS functions are available. This utilizes hardware feature (CPU or SIMD) to accelerate floating point operations, so superior speed (2~4.5x average, 8x maximum) and less energy(0.25x maximum) consuming can be gained by using this. Thanks people for other answers.
