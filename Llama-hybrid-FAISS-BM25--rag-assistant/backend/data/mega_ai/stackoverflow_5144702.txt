To elaborate on Logan's answer: Only (function and object) declarations can appear in the "external" or file context. While FN_TYPE INTERRUPT_TABLE[] = { handle_trap, ... }; is a definition with initialization, the following has one definition and one assignment operation: FN_TYPE INTERRUPT_TABLE[]; INTERRUPT_TABLE[0] = handle_trap; This assignment can't appear at the top level and is interpreted as a redefinition of INTERRUPT_TABLE . However, this doesn't match up with the error message you got back. For what it's worth, this simple program compiles successfully: typedef void (*FN_TYPE) (); extern FN_TYPE INTERRUPT_TABLE[]; void handle_trap() { } int main() { INTERRUPT_TABLE[0] = handle_trap; }
