You could think of this kind of like a community analysis. You have a bunch of different "sites" (i.e. bands) which each have a unique collection of "species" (i.e. clothing, song type, etc.). When you look at it like this then it becomes quite easy to try and pick out trends in the data by using dimensional compression techniques. There are some quite good and easy to use packages in R to produce these quickly and easily and give you some easily interpreted plots - see the vegan package and it's metaMDS and vegdist functions. There are also quite a few helpful tutorials kicking around the internet to carry out these kinds of analyses.
