Statistical analysis book query

I know there are many questions that ask for book recommendations but I'm wondering is there any text that teaches entirely through the analysis of real data sets. Doesn't matter if it's time series, panel, cross sectional etc. In my experience an awful lot of what you learn theoretically is based on well behaved idealised data, and once you sit down to a real data set you're suddenly on your own trawling through sites like this looking for answers. Something like the two Josh Angrist books on econometrics but written more in the style of a textbook.
