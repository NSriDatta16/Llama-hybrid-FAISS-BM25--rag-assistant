Individual level prediction of a personâ€™s probability of voting without their vote history

Is it possible to create individual level predictions of a voter's probability of voting when you do not know their vote history? In the data set provided in my homework assignment, I am given data on a number of people. Some have a known voting history and some have missing values within the variable (these are the people the people without known voting histories). The voting history is labeled voted with binary values (0,1) and the unknown vote histories show up as missing values (in stata: . ). I am also provided with other variables in the data set such as sex, age, income level, labor force, and race. I have tried replacing the missing values and running a logistic regression against all of the other independent variables such as sex, race, age, income, level and it has not worked. UPDATE: What I have tried thus far: I have also tried to create a new variable with just the missing variables in an attempt to isolate the people who have no vote history to make the problem easier but that also has not worked.
