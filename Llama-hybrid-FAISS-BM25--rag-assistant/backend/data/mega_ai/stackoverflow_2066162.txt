How can I get the button that caused the submit from the form submit event?

I'm trying to find the value of the submit button that triggered the form to submit $("form").submit(function() { }); I could possibly fire a $("input[type=submit]").click() event for each button and set some variable, but that seems less elegant than some how pulling the button off of the the form on submit.
