Although you could easily find a tutorial how to handle file uploads with php, and there are functions (manual) to handle CSVs, I will post some code because just a few days ago I worked on a project, including a bit of code you could use... HTML: " method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data"> Select file Submit PHP: if ( isset($_POST["submit"]) ) { if ( isset($_FILES["file"])) { //if there was an error uploading the file if ($_FILES["file"]["error"] > 0) { echo "Return Code: " . $_FILES["file"]["error"] . " "; } else { //Print file details echo "Upload: " . $_FILES["file"]["name"] . " "; echo "Type: " . $_FILES["file"]["type"] . " "; echo "Size: " . ($_FILES["file"]["size"] / 1024) . " Kb "; echo "Temp file: " . $_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"] . " "; //if file already exists if (file_exists("upload/" . $_FILES["file"]["name"])) { echo $_FILES["file"]["name"] . " already exists. "; } else { //Store file in directory "upload" with the name of "uploaded_file.txt" $storagename = "uploaded_file.txt"; move_uploaded_file($_FILES["file"]["tmp_name"], "upload/" . $storagename); echo "Stored in: " . "upload/" . $_FILES["file"]["name"] . " "; } } } else { echo "No file selected "; } } I know there must be an easier way to do this, but I read the CSV file and store the single cells of every record in an two dimensional array. if ( isset($storagename) && $file = fopen( "upload/" . $storagename , r ) ) { echo "File opened. "; $firstline = fgets ($file, 4096 ); //Gets the number of fields, in CSV-files the names of the fields are mostly given in the first line $num = strlen($firstline) - strlen(str_replace(";", "", $firstline)); //save the different fields of the firstline in an array called fields $fields = array(); $fields = explode( ";", $firstline, ($num+1) ); $line = array(); $i = 0; //CSV: one line is one record and the cells/fields are seperated by ";" //so $dsatz is an two dimensional array saving the records like this: $dsatz[number of record][number of cell] while ( $line[$i] = fgets ($file, 4096) ) { $dsatz[$i] = array(); $dsatz[$i] = explode( ";", $line[$i], ($num+1) ); $i++; } echo " "; echo " "; for ( $k = 0; $k != ($num+1); $k++ ) { echo " " . $fields[$k] . " "; } echo " "; foreach ($dsatz as $key => $number) { //new table row for every record echo " "; foreach ($number as $k => $content) { //new table cell for every field of the record echo " " . $content . " "; } } echo " "; } So I hope this will help, it is just a small snippet of code and I have not tested it, because I used it slightly different. The comments should explain everything.
