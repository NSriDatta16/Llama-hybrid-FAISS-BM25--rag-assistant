How do I find the date a video (.AVI .MP4) was actually recorded?

properties> date created... I thought this meant the date the video was created, but finally realized that date changes every time I move, reorganize, even open a file. often, the date modified is earlier than date created. the date a jpeg was taken is readily available. Is there any way to get the same information from an AVI or MP4 FILE?
