Even though your samples are not evenly spaced, your trendline can still have a constant "run". For example, you could choose 1 week intervals. In that case take the average number of subscribers for Jan 1,2, & 5 and plot a point on Jan 7. Next take the average for Jan 10 & 13, and plot a point on Jan 14. etc.. If you have a lot of historical data, use 1 month intervals, or maybe quarterly would better suit your data.
