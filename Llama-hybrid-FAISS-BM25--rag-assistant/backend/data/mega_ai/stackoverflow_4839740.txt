If it's a single retrieval, why bother with sessions? Have the website serve the XML file as direct response to the request with the user credentials by the application. If you need to use sessions for some reason, you need to search the reply to the POST request for the session id and deliver the session id with your request for the XML data. The session id is likely in the cookies, it can also be in the hyperlinks of the page (depends on how you setup your login).
