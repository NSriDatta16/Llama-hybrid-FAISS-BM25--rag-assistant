Maybe you can unlock the cells from the code just before modifying them, and then lock them down again after? Not very elegant I know. Maybe you could also hide the sheet from the user. I'm sure there is no perfect protection, because ultimately the user can turn VBA/Macros off. Question is how much you want to protect the data.
