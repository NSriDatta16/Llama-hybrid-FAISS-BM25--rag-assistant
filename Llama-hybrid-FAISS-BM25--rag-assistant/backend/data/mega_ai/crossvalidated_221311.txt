Referring to scikit-learn documentation (Python based package for machine learning), r2_score and explained_variance_score are popular choices. Unlike distance measures like mean_squared_error or mean_absolute_error, these metrics give an indication of how good or bad the prediction is (closer to 1 => better predictions). [By the way, if using distance measures, I would recommend RMSE (root mean square error) instead of just MSE (mean square error) so that the magnitude can be compared with the predictions] Alternatively, you could also compute correlation coefficient between regressor predicted values and the true target variable values using Pearson's correlation coefficient (for linear models) or better go for Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (as this doesn't assume linear models and is less sensitive to outliers). Learning curves suggested in John Yetter 's reply is also a good method but the above mentioned metrics might be easier to assess the performance.
