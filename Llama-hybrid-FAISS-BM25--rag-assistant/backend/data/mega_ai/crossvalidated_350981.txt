It is easier to see it by geometry than by algebra: The leverages $h_i$ are diagonal elements of hat matrix $H$, which is an orthogonal projector. Being an orthogonal projector is a geometric property which is independent of coordinate systems. Centering the variables gives just a reparametrization of the same model. Reparametrization of a linear model is just a change of basis. Note that this argument depends on the model having an intercept. Without an intercept, centering will change the model.
