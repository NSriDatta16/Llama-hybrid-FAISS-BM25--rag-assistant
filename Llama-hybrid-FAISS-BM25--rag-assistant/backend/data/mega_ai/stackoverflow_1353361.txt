Problems replicating drag-and-drop with mouse events

I want to replicate the standard startDrag/stopDrag events with my own routine to alter things a bit, and I run into some kind of event propagation or bubbling problem. Here is my code: The problem with this code is that as you drag the object to the right, you will see in the trace that occasionally some random localX values arrive there, resulting in the object jerking from side to side. I don't understand how to fix that part, I do think it's the label which bubbles the mousemove event, but I don't understand how to stop it from doing that. Any suggestions are greatly appreciated!
