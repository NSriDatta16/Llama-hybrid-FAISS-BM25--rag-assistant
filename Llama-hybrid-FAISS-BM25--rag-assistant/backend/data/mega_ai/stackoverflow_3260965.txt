Using arguments passed into a function iphone SDK

Wondering what I am doing wrong here. I am trying to pass an integer to my custom class and when I output the argument in the function is is some random number instead of what I pass. Here is my method call in RootViewController.m: int orgID = organObj.organID; NSLog(@"OrganID from RVC: %d", orgID); // this outputs the correct number [Procedure getDatabase:[appDelegate getDBPath] WithOrganID:[NSNumber numberWithInt:orgID]]; Here is the implementation of my method: + (void) getDatabase:(NSString *)dbPath WithOrganID:(NSNumber *)organID { NSLog(@"OrganID from procedure.m: %d", organID); // this outputs some random number } It's probably something trivial but I can't figure it out. Thanks in advance.
