Time Series & Stationarity

I know that Seasonality and Trend violate the principle of stationarity , so before modelling the time series with many statistical models like AR, MA and ARMA it's important to remove those components to make time series stationary. When we remove Trend and Stationarity it just remains an Irregular component that we cannot predict because it's unpredictable by nature. My question is, how can we build a model with an irregular term ?
