This is going to be very protocol implementation dependent. In general, I don't think most client implementations prefetch, but most savvy storage admins use large blocksizes (32+kb see the rsize/wsize mount options), which effectively results in the same thing. Network file systems are typically going to be cached via the systems buffer cache as well, so you'll definitely not be translating read() calls directly to network IO. My advice would be to be to write your program naively (or a simple test case) and get comfortable reading the network stats via nfsstat, etc, and then optimize from there. There's far too many variables to get the answer any other way. I'm no expert, but from what I can tell NFS4 has more WAN optimizations than the older protocols (nfs2,3,cifs) so I'd definitely factor it into your mix. That said, most remote filesystem protocols aren't really designed for high latency access which is why we end up with systems like S3, which are.
