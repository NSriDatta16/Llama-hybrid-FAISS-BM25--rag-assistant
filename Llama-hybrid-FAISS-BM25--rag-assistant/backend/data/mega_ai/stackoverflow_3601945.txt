If what you need is help translating the paragraph into actual requirements (the comments are right- write your own code and then post for help if/when it doesn't work) here's how I would go about translating that: It says you need a class, so write that down on a piece of paper. Draw a line under it. Then it says it needs a data member (often "requirement-ese" for a field or property, to collect the sum of a seriese of ints. So write that down directly below the line you just drew. Something like 'sumOfInts' or something like that. You can come back to it later. Next you need a data member to hold the double average, so write that down, too: Average . That completes the required data members, so draw a new line. Next, you've had one method defined to calculate the average. So write that down: something like: `CalculateAverage(int sum, int items). I just pointed to a tricky part you'll need to consider: you don't just want the sums, you want to know how many items there are. Now you should have something like this Class: Average ------------------ Sum (Int) Average (Double) ------------------ CalculateAverage(Int, Int) (Returns double) Congratulations, you've just created your first UML Class specificaiton (ish). With that written down, you should be able to start tackling the actual coding portion of the assigment. Once you've got code written, if it doesn't work, post a new question listing your specific difficulties, and we'll be happy to assist.
