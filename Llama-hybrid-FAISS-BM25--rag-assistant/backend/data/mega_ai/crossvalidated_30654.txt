Calculating probability of project tasks, and most likely ending date?

Say I have a project (you know the typical one you can represent using a Gantt Chart ) If I where to assign a particula probability to each of the tasks in the Gantt... say for example: Task1 (2 days, i am 75% sure of that) Task2 (4 days, i am 50% sure of that) for it to start, Task 1 most be finished Task3 (8 days, i am 25% sure of that) for it to start, Task 2 most be finished How can I calculate how likely it is that I will finish this 14 day project? ( In case you are wondering why I am asking this, I am a software developer, and I am constantly creating project plans and I would like to learn more on this subject so that I can project estimation better )
