I may not understand the problem correctly -- however, if you find some time to (re)visit Kimball’s “The Data Warehouse Toolkit”, you will find that all it takes for a basic DW is a plain-vanilla SQL database, in other words you could build a decent DW with MySQL using MyISAM for the storage engine. The question is only in desired granularity of information – what you want to keep and for how long. If your reports are mostly periodic, and you implement a report storage or cache, than you don’t need to store pre-calculated aggregations (no need for cubes). In other words, Kimball star with cached reporting can provide decent performance in many cases. You could also look at the community edition of “Pentaho BI Suite” (open source) to get a quick start with ETL, analytics and reporting -- and experiment a bit to evaluate the performance before diving into custom development. Although this may not be what you were expecting, it may be worth considering.
