Multilevel models including random slopes: how to calculate variance

In a linear mixed model, you take the covariance between data into account by adding a random intercept per cluster. For example, you measure the effect of a drug campaign over time on students, and add a random intercept per school and a random intercept per student within a school: $Y_{ijk}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}*Time+b_k+b_{jk}+\epsilon_{ijk}$ With Y the outcome variable "how much does he knows with drugs. We assume that the random intercepts are normally distributed with mean and variance: $b_k \sim N(0, \sigma_3^2)$, $b_{jk} \sim N(0, \sigma_2^2)$ and $\epsilon_{ijk} \sim N(0, \sigma_1^2)$ With these variances of random intercepts we can calculate the variance of the treatment effect on the different levels, for example on the school level. But what if I want to model that the campaign has not the same average increase over time in every school? I add a random slope per school: $Y_{ijk}=\beta_{0}+\beta_{1}*Time+b_{0k}+b_{1k}*Time+b_{jk}+\epsilon_{ijk}$ Is in this model the variation of $b_{0k}$ still meaningful? Is my intuition correct that the variation between different schools increases over time, as the random slopes drive the schools further apart? And as a second question, without random slope we also know that the covariance between students within the same school is given by: $Cov_{school}=\frac{sigma_3^2}{sigma_1^2+sigma_2^2+sigma_3^2}$ What is this covariance if a random intercept is included? Thank you in advance! UPDATE: included a plot of the data I am working with, level 1 are the 8 repeated measurements at each measurement occasion, level 2 are the difference measurement occasions, level 3 are the patients.
