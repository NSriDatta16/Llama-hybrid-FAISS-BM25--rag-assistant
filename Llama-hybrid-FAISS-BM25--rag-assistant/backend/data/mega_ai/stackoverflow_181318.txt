Firstly, lets clarify some terminology. A Digital Signature is intended to be equivilent to a handwritten signature (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature for a better description and overview). When a digital signature is applied to a document you get a higher level of assurance of the authenticity of the document (you have a better idea if the document was forged or not). The answers from Adam and Robert both refer to methods for verifying document integrity (that the document is unchanged). While a digital signature also provides this, a checksum (hash) does not provide authenticity. So it's important that we establish the needs of your "Signature file". I will assume that you are talking about Digital Signatures, rather than checksums as the other answers address checksums. You will want to compose a PKCS#7 detached signature (jargon - a standard format signature that does not contain the data, so it can be stored seperately). To acheive this I recommend you use a standard library such as OpenSSL (which is portable). For more information on PKCS#7 see http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2129 For more information on OpenSSL see http://www.openssl.org/
