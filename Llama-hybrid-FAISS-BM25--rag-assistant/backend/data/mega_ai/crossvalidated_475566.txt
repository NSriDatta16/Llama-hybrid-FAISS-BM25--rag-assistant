Sampling distribution of the mean of the discrete-power law distribution

For a certain problem I wish to generate random integers $k$ so that their distribution follows $p_k \sim k^{-\alpha}$ for $k \geq k_{\text{min}}$ , $k_{\text{min}} > 0$ . I am following the procedure given in this review (page 699). Now the problem is this: I want many samples of a certain size, say size $10000$ . For $\alpha = 2.2$ and $k_{\text{min}} = 2$ , the theoretical value of the mean is $\langle k\rangle \approx 9.36$ . Thus, when I generate my samples, and take sample averages, I expect that these averages should be close to $9.36$ . However, when I plot the sampling distribution for the mean (i.e. the distribution of these sample averages), I get highly skewed distribution as shown below (total $1000$ samples were generated): As is clear, most samples give average below the theoretical mean while some have very high values compared to the theoretical mean. One may argue that this is expected anyway because of the nature of the power-laws. But my question is, if I want to say that my results correspond to mean value $9.36$ would that be right, if I obtain them using each of these samples? If not, can I generate the samples so that the distribution of the sample averages would be symmetric around the theoretical mean? I can think of the following option: For a sample of $n$ points, generate $n-1$ points from the power-law, and add $n^{\text{th}}$ point manually so that the sample average would come out right. However, I am not sure if I would be really drawing from the power-law distribution then. Any help is highly appreciated.
