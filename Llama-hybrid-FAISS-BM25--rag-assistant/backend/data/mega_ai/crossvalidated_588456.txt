How to reconcile number of factors found with parallel factor analysis and network plotting in exploratory factor analysis?

I am trying to apply exploratory factor analysis and I got the following output when using parallel factor analysis ( fa.parallel of the R package psych ): Call: psych::fa.parallel(x = df, fa = "pc", n.iter = 500, ylabel = "Eigenvalues", quant = 0.5) Parallel analysis suggests that the number of factors = NA and the number of components = 3 When using the Very Simple Structure approach (function VSS ) I get: Very Simple Structure Call: vss(x = x, n = n, rotate = rotate, diagonal = diagonal, fm = fm, n.obs = n.obs, plot = plot, title = title, use = use, cor = cor) VSS complexity 1 achieves a maximimum of 0.92 with 1 factors VSS complexity 2 achieves a maximimum of 0.97 with 3 factors The Velicer MAP achieves a minimum of 0.04 with 6 factors Thus, I reckon that the exploratory factor analysis should be conducted with 3-6 variables. With 3 factors, I get (with fa.diagram ): With 6 factors: But using the Triangulated Maximally Filtered Graph generated by the package EGAnet, I get 5 factors: Which is then reflected by the fa.diagram. The question is: what factor to choose? Would the latter be the best? After all, it is within 3 and 6... Is there a better justification? Thank you
