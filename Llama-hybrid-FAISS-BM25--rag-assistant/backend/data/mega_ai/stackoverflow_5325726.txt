Discover titles/paragraphs in word docs

I'm trying to discover paragraphs/titles in word documents. I use Apache POI to do this. An example that I use is: fs = new POIFSFileSystem(new FileInputStream(filesname)); HWPFDocument doc = new HWPFDocument(fs); WordExtractor we = new WordExtractor(doc); ArrayList titles = new ArrayList(); try { for (int i = 0; i This works for all bold, italic or underlined text. But what I want is to discover the font that is used most often. And then to discover variations compared to that font style. Anyone an Idea?
