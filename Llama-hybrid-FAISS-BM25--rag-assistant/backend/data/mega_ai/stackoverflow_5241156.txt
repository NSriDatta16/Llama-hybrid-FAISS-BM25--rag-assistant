In PHP, how do you scrape a DOMDocument for a certain text pattern, then get the parent element of that matching text's text node?

I've built a simple web scraping utility with PHP and cURL, and have been using code like this to grab certain elements of the scraped page by ID, or by Tag Name where no ID is present on the desired element: $dom = new DOMDocument(); @$dom->loadHTML($response); $table = $dom->getElementsByTagName('table')->item(4); $response = $dom->saveXML($table); Now I've run into a dilemma where I need to go one step further and find the parent element of a certain string or regex pattern of text, because the the site from which I need to collect data doesn't any IDs or classes in the HTML elements I need to extract data from, and various pages may have data organized in different ways, so I can't always rely on the data being in table #X. The only sure-fire way to get the data I'm after off this site is to look for it by its text format, which is always going to be a numeric list starting with "1. " They don't use ordered lists either, or it would be much simpler. It's just a simple table cell with numeric lines separated by a simple . So I was thinking, if I could find the "1. " then it's parent element would be the table cell which, after finding it, then I would need to extract its content and perhaps the content of any other adjacent table cells in that table row. There are no other instances of "1. " that I could find in the page or the HTML code, so this approach seems reasonable, if not a bit hacky, but I digress. So, what's the best way to approach something like this?
