Text Generation

I want to generate „human like“ text/posts based on a dataset of posts from a forum. The dataset contains roughly 25k words. I currently have the Markoc chain implemented, but i want to improve the text generated by using reccurent neural networks. My problem is that most of the solutions available are written in python, but i need to implement it in either JavaScript or PHP. Does anyone know how to do that or where to find a food solution? Thanks in advance
