How to Model Constrained Outcome in Multivariate Regression Context

I have a problem in which the ratio of two different outcomes as a function of time $\frac{Y_{1t}}{Y_{2t}}$ is unknown constant $c$ . I would like to estimate regression models of the following type: $$ Y_{1t} = \beta_{11} \ln{t} +\epsilon_{1t} $$ and $$ Y_{2t} = \beta_{21} \ln{t} +\epsilon_{2t} $$ I am not wedded to an untransformed $\frac{Y_{1t}}{Y_{2t}} = c$ and would be happy to work with, for instance, $\ln{Y_{1t}} - \ln{Y_{2t}} = k$ . It has been surprisingly hard to find any resources for what must be a quite common problem in multivariate time series. $Y_{jt}$ can be assumed stationary and I have no particular error structure in mind for this problem. I am interested in both estimation and inference (from a frequentist perspective) if anyone has seen this problem before.
