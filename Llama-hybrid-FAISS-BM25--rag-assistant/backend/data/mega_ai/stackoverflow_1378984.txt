C# with SQL database schema question

Is it acceptable to dynamically generate the total of the contents of a field using up to 10k records instead of storing the total in a table? I have some reasons to prefer on-demand generation of a total, but how bad is the performance price on an average home PC? (There would be some joins -ORM managed- involved in figuring the total.) Let me know if I'm leaving out any info important to deciding the answer. EDIT: This is a stand-alone program on a user's PC.
