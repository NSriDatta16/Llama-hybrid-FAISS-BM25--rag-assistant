What's the difference between ' and #' in Lisp?

It seems both (mapcar 'car '((foo bar) (foo1 bar1))) and (mapcar #'car '((foo bar) (foo1 bar1))) work as the same. And I also know ' means (quote symbol) and #' means (function function-name). But what's the underlying difference? Why these 2 both work in previous mapcar ?
