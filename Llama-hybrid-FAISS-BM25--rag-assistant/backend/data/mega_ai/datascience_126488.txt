How to improve the influence of one element of the input on the latent code in an autoencoder?

I am trying to apply an autoencoder for feature extraction with the input like I=[x1,x2,x3,...,xn] . Representing the latent code after encoding as L , I want to improve the influence of one element of the input, such as x1 , on L . My intention is that when x2,x3,...,xn remain constant, a small change in x1 can lead to a huge change in the code L . So what kind of autoencoder structure should be adopted to achieve this purpose? Thanks.
