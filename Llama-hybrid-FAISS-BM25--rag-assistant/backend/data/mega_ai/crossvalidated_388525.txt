I do not see a resolution without the call to the Normal cdf, either on a table or via a computer code: the equation determining $\sigma$ being $$\mathbb{P}_{\sigma,\mu}(7.75\le X\le 8.25)=\Phi(1.25/\sigma)-\Phi(0.75/\sigma)=0.12$$ the value $\sigma=1.1$ brings the coverage pretty close to 0.12, since it is $0.1197748$ . (I do not understand the connection in the title with the infinite lower bound.)
