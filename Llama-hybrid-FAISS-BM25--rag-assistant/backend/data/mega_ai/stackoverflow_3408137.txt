C# Compiler says function is not defined, when it is

I just need another pair of eyes... I don't see anything wrong with the following. In fact, I swear I had something just like this not long ago, and it worked. In my Collections.dll: namespace Collections { public class CSuperAutoPool { public static CSuperAutoPool ActivateByType(Type typeToBeActivated, params object[] activatedArguments) { //... } } } In another DLL, I have referenced the collections DLL project, and use it in this function: namespace Organization { public class CBaseEntity : CSuperAutoPool { protected static CBaseEntity Create() { //... CBaseEntity created = (CBaseEntity)CSuperAutoPool.ActivateByType(callingType); //Error here. //... } } } Error: 'Collections.CSuperAutoPool' does not contain a definition for 'ActivateByType' I have used ActivateByType, within CSuperAutoPool, in a different function, and that one does not have errors. The Collections DLL compiles without errors. In the same DLL where the Organization namespace exists, have used various other aspects of the CSuperAutoPool class in other ways, without compiler errors.
