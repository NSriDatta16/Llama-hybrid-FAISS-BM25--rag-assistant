How to do large time series data sharpening/zooming for easier visualization using pandas?

I need to visualize very large time series data. I want to do something similar to one shown here: Zoomdata (that's where I got the term 'data sharpening'). Data example: every minute temperature data from thermostat. I want to do web based viz and I think it should be pretty easy if I can get right kind of data from backend. Thus the question is, is it possible to do data sharpening using pandas or any other tools on large data?
