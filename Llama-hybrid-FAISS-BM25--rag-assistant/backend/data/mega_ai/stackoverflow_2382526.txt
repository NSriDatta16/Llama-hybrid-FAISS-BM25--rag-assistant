Having no Flex experience all I can offer is some psuedo code which resembles how I implemented a similar effect in JavaScript, but hopefully it will get you started. Essentially what you'll want to do is during your drag event measure the current coordinates of the object you're dragging to see if they intersect the original container and when they fall outside of its bounds call the logic to update the icon in order to indicate it will be removed. Then, on the drop event, check the coordinates once more and delete the item if needed.
