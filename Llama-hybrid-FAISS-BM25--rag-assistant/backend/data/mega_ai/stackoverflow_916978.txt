Python equivalent of maplist?

What's the best Python equivalent of Common Lisp's maplist function? From the maplist documentation : maplist is like mapcar except that function is applied to successive sublists of the lists. function is first applied to the lists themselves, and then to the cdr of each list, and then to the cdr of the cdr of each list, and so on. Example (pseudoy-code, not tested): >>> def p(x): return x >>> maplist(p, [1,2,3]) [[1, 2, 3], [2, 3], [3]] Note : the arguments passed to p in the example above would be the lists [1, 2, 3] , [2, 3] , [3] ; i.e., p is not applied to the elements of those lists. E.g.: >>> maplist(lambda l: list(reversed(l)), [1,2,3]) [[3, 2, 1], [3, 2], [3]]
