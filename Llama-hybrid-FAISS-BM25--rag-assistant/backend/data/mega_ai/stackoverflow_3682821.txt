difference between varchar(500) vs varchar(max) in sql server

I want to know what are pros and cons while using varchar(500) vs varchar(max) in terms of performance, memory and anything else to consider? Will both use same amount of storage space? Is the answer differ in case of sql server 2000/2005/2008?
