You can approximate the users heading assuming they have been moving in a straight line between gps updates. I would first set the desired accuracy to the highest. You will need it since a small change in position will result in a large change in angle. Now call the coordinate of the first location L1 , and the coordinate of the next location L2 . Your heading vector , h = L2 - L1 now if h = (lon, lat) To get the heading you need use some trig: x = arctan ( lon / lat ) I would consider taking averages / smoothing the result somehow.
