Slider overflow

I have popup-like border in my page. There is slider inside the popup. The slider has range from 0 to 100, but when I slide it to the right edge I get somewhere near to vlaue 93. Slider is full but its maximum is 100. It seems that slider overflowed the parent container. I tried to use all combinations of margins and static widths, but without success. Can anyone tell me what I am supposed to set, to get it work? Here is fragment of code: ... With this code (value of slider set to 93) is slider full. What's wrong?
