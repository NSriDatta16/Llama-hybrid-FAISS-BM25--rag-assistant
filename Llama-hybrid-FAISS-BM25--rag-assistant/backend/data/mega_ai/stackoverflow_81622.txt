Look, I understand full well what I'm doing with the assignment trick. You are telling me that the size of a bitfield type is rounded up to the cloest byte count, which is one option I listed in the initial question. But you didn't back it up with references. In particular, I have tried various compilers which give me sizeof(int) instead of sizeof(char) EVEN if I apply this to a bitfield with only has a single bit. I wouldn't even mind if multiple compilers randomly get to choose their own interpretation of this construct. Certainly bitfield storage allocation is quite implementation-defined. However, I really do want to know whether the construct is GUARANTEED to work and yield SOME value.
