First of all, singletons are usually a bad design and this looks exactly like a situation where you should not need a singleton. See Singletons are Pathological Liars by Mi≈°ko Hevery and other articles on his blog. (I hope this does not look arrogant, getting rid of the singleton will probably make your design better and coding easier.) Second, if I understand your question correctly, you could pass the singleton a selector that should be called after the singleton receives the data. The API in the singleton class could look like this: - (void) download: (NSURLRequest*) request andTell: (id) delegate to: (SEL) doThis; Then after you finish loading the data you would do: [delegate performSelector:doThis withObject:receivedData]; Does this answer the question?
