Collaborative filtering using a linear model

Consider I have a set of movies and a set of users ($A$,$B$,$C$,$D$) and a matrix with related scores (I can have gaps in this matrix). Consider a linear regression model where a specific user A's rating is meant to be a weighted average of other users ratings: $$R_A = a + w_B R_B + w_C R_C+ w_D R_D$$ where $R_A$ is a rating of user A and so on, $w_B$ is the weight parameter for rating $R_B$ and $a$ is a normalization factor. The following is the table I have got: Users m1 m2 m3 m4 m5 m6 m7 m8 A 3 4 5 1 B 5 5 5 1 C 2 5 5 3 4 D 4 5 4 4 2 Question : How can I derive a parameter estimation method and use it to obtain the four weights $w_B$, $w_C$, $w_D$?
