There is no way, all ML models is not about phenomen understanding, it's interpolation methods with hope "that it works". Start with such questions confidence, robustnes to noise there is no answers. So to derive something please use various applied and fundamental science: Use control (and make assumption about dynamics) Use convex optimization (with some extra condition on function) Use math statistics (with preliminary assumptions on distributions) Use signal processing (with some assumptions that signal is band limited) Scientist use some prelimiary assumptions (called axioms) to derive something. There is no way to give any confidence without some preliminary assumption, so problem in not in DL mehtod, but it's problem in any method which try to interpolate without ANY preliminary assumption-there is no way to derive via algebra something intellegently without an assumption. NN and various ML methods are for fast prototyping to create "something" which seems works "someway" checked with cross-validation. Even more deeper the regression fitting E[Y|X] or it's estimate can be absolutely incorrect problem to solve (maybe p.d.f. in point Y=E[Y|X] has minimum, not maximum), and there are a lot of such subtle things. Also let me remind two unsolvable problems in AI/ML, which can be for some reasons be forgotten, behind beauty slogans: (1) It's interpolation methods, not extrapolation - it has no ability to deal with new problems (2) nobody knows how any model will behave on data which is not from the same distribution (man in costume of banana for pedestrian localization)
