Here's how my investigations went: I first extended the KMLViewer sample to support the additional elements I needed. The sample is not well suited to this: it is not organized the way a SAX-style parser should be, and the simplistic state machine really needs an overhaul if you want to add more stuff to it. Next I tried the Simple KML library. It was easy to use, but it took 3500 milliseconds to parse the KML file I needed to parse, which was at least 3000 milliseconds longer than I would find acceptable. Also, Simple KML didn't support all the elements and attributes I needed, so I would have needed to extend it if I wanted to use it. So, I finally just used TBXML , which was easy to use and which parsed the file in less than 100 milliseconds.
