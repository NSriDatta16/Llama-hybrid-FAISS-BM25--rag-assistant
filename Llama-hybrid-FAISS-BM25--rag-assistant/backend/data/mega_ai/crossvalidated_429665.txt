Getting sense from loadings plot of scaled eigenvectors

I wanted to confirm my intution about the meaning of "loadings" I have made out of eigenvalue/eigenvector decomposition, but I still fail to do that. Note that I made 3 pairs of highly correlated variables, expecting 3 'significant' principal components, and it works as expected. However, when I build the loadings I get a plot that does not show me three distinct correlation peaks. Why don't I get a clear picture showing variable clustering in terms of correlation with the scaled components (let them call factors loosely)? Can I do different analysis to have what I want ( prcomp / factanal )? set.seed(1) x1 = rnorm(1000) x2 = x1 + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.2) x3 = rnorm(1000) x4 = x3 + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.2) x5 = rnorm(1000) x6 = x5 + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.2) dt Update (2019-10-07) I have obtained a much cleaner picture here after rotation. My question transforms now to: whether I can take (for example) modulus of these loading coefficients to be able to treat the figures as correlation coefficients of variables with factors? I cannot describe neither to colleagues nor to myself what the negative relation means. I try to do topic modelling, where variables are word frequencies, by the way. So said, I would love to say that this topic (factor) is dominated by Russia (0.7), politics (0.71), and another topic by Economy (0.72), Oil (0.69). ## PCA + Varimax set.seed(1) x1 = rnorm(1000) x2 = x1 + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.2) x3 = rnorm(1000) x4 = x3 + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.2) x5 = rnorm(1000) x6 = x5 + rnorm(1000, 0, 0.2) dt $rotation[,1] loading_2 rotation[,2] loading_3 $loadings[,1] loading_2 loadings[,2] loading_3
