This doesn't work for everything, but if you're using your own headers (in a modular program, for example), you can include the library name in the header. That's especially convenient in Visual Studio, where you can #pragma comment(lib, "thismodule.lib") in the library header and the code including the library never has to worry. On other platforms/compilers, you may find similar commands. Any good 3rd party library should have instructions on what to include, though.
