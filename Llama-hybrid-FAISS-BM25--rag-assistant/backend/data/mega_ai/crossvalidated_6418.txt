Rating system taking account of number of votes

I need an idea for a new rating system.. the problem in the ordinary one (just average votes) is that it does not count how many votes... For example consider these 2 cases: 3 people voted 5/5 500 people voted 4/5 The ordinary voting systems just take the average, leading to the first one to be better.. However, I want the second one to get a higher rating, because many people have voted for the second... Any help?
