If you don't care about the shifts, just strip them, load (defun apply-bspace () (interactive) (let ((result (search-forward "[BACKSPACE]"))) (backward-delete-char 12) (when result (apply-bspace)))) and hit M-x apply-bspace while viewing your file. It's Elisp, not python, but it fits your initial requirement of " something I can download for free to a PC ". Edit: Shift is trickier if you want to apply it to numbers too (so that [SHIFT]2 => @ , [SHIFT]3 => # , etc). The naive way that works on letters is (defun apply-shift () (interactive) (let ((result (search-forward "[SHIFT]"))) (backward-delete-char 7) (upcase-region (point) (+ 1 (point))) (when result (apply-shift))))
