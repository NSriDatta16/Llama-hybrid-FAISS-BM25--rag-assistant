Drag'n Drop Image editor Javascript

I'm developing a web app and I like to make an editor just like this one polyvore I've seen here is a similar (almost the same) question, and the answer is good, but I searched, and tried what the answer says, and I can't fine a good library for it. What can I use? What libraries are there? Note: I need to do it with javascript.
