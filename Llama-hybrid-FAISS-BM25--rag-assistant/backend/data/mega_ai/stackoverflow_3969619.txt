Why? I don't know, the previous paragraph about some "actual id" doesn't make any sense. Can you clarify? Showing the structure of your TitleEntry table might also help. What is hibernate_sequence anyway (can't find a decent explanation on Hibernate website)? The default name of a sequence or table used by Hibernate (see 5.1.5. Enhanced identifier generators ). Given than SQL Server doesn't support sequence, I'd bet on the later. You should check the generated DDL to find what has been done exactly (and show the relevant part). But I'm surprised that Hibernate didn't default to IDENTITY (what version of Hibernate are you using exactly?). How can I fix it? I don't know what you want to fix but if you want full control, don't use an AUTO strategy ( IDENTITY is usual with SQL Server).
