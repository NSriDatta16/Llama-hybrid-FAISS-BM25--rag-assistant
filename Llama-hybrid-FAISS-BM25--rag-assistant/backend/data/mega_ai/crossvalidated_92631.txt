Basically, you are asking for an interpretation of Occam's razor in therms of probability; quoting from wikipedia, Occam's razor: is a principle of parsimony, economy, or succinctness used in problem-solving. It states that among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected. I can direct you to this paper[0] . There, the authors generalize and quantify the original formulation's "assumptions" concept as the degree to which a proposition is unnecessarily accommodating to possible observable data In a nutshell, given an equal fit, simpler prior have higher posteriors. Again, quoting from wikipedia; all assumptions introduce possibilities for error; if an assumption does not improve the accuracy of a theory, its only effect is to increase the probability that the overall theory is wrong. In essence, given an equal fit of the observed data, simpler models are preferred over models which would have accommodated a wide range of other possible data because they have a higher probability of being true .
