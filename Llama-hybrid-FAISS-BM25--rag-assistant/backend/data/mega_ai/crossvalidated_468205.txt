Logistic regression is not originally developed by machine learning community but statistics community. There are a lot of probabilistic views behind it. You may search the following terms to get more information: odds , log odds , generalized linear model , binomial link function . But for machine learning, the goal is slightly different that we only want to get a higher accuracy (minimize the loss function), but not talking about these assumptions and how data is generated. You are asking very good questions. So, for machine learning, it is common to use other 'sigmoid function' and loss function to do the classification. See this question for details What are the impacts of choosing different loss functions in classification to approximate 0-1 loss
