Force WPF to Commit Changes on Focused Element

I'm working with VS2010, WPF and EF. I've placed controls on my window by dragging an entity out of the Data Sources toolwindow. I used the "details" setting so my entity is represented by several labels and textboxes. I've also added a button with the following code: _context.SaveChanges(); When I'm editing data, the changes in whichever textbox has focus are not committed back to the DB. Everything else commits just fine. If I shift focus to another element prior to hitting the save button, it commits as well. I've experienced the same thing with the DataGrid. I know I'm missing something simple, but I can figure it out. Any ideas on what I'm missing? Thanks!
