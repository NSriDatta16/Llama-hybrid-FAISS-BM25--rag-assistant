In logistic regression we have that: $$ \ln\left({\frac{p}{1-p}}\right) = \mathbf{Xb} $$ where $\mathbf{Xb}$ is the linear predictor, $\mathbf{X}$ being the model matrix of explanatory variables and $\mathbf{b}$ the vector of coefficients. $\ln\left({\frac{p}{1-p}}\right)$ is the logit function (log of the odds). Therefore every component of $\mathbf{X}$ (eg, an individual explanatory variable) is proportional to the log odds and so any change in one of them has a linear effect on it.
