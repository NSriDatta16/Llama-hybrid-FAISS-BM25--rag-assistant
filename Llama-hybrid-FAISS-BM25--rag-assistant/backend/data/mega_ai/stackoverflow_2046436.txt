Rails - Shared Database Tables between two apps

Weâ€™ll be releasing shortly a companion Rails application to our existing Rails app. We will be running the companion app alongside our existing app on the same servers. My question concerns the databases. My hosting provider generally would configure a 2nd distinct database for the new application - secondappname_production. However, there are a series of shared tables between the applications. These shared tables are also maintained by a series of cron jobs. I would love to avoid duplicating these tables (and thus the cron jobs) if at all possible. Is there a way that I can put these shared tables in perhaps a shared database that both Rails apps can leverage? Any suggestions as to how to configure that or documentation pointers? Thanks so much! EDIT: To clarify why I don't want to run both apps out of the same DB: Both apps have models of the same name (yet different attributes of the models, etc.), so I would prefer to not run both out of the same DB....
