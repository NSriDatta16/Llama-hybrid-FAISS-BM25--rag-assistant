A couple of examples I find interesting are Tripit , a site for organizing your travel plans. Although there is a link to Sign-up for the service the easiest and quickest way is to forward a confirmation email from a travel service (orbitz, travelocity, united.com, hertz.com etc), doing this will automatically sign you up and get you going (once you log in to the site it will ask for more info). Another quick and easy registration is Marco Arment's Instapaper . All you need is to fill in your email address or username.
