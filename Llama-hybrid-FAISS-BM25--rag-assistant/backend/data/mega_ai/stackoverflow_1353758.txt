To refine the answer from Zed, and to answer your comment: INSERT INTO dues_storage SELECT d.*, CURRENT_DATE() FROM dues d WHERE id = 5; Be VERY CAREFUL doing this. It does work, but it assumes the order of columns in the two tables is identical; it does not match by column name, and does try to coerce values to fit, which can cause unexpected results. Now, if your development structure assures the column orders are identical bar the last column, it's a convenient and straightforward way to do it, but the caveat is important.
