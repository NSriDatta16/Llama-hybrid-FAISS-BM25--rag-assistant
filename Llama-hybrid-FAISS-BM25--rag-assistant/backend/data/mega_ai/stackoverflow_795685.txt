A Simulator for a non-deterministic Push-Down Automaton

Well, I need to make simulator for non-deterministic Push-Down Automaton. Everything is okey, I know I need to do recursion or something similar. But I do not know how to make that function which would simulate automaton. I got everything else under control, automaton generator, stack ... I am doing it in java, so this is maybe only issue that man can bump on, and I did it. So if anyone have done something similar, I could use advices. This is my current organisation of code: Classes: class transit: list -contains non deterministic transitions state input sign stack sign class generator it generate automaton from file clas NPA public boolean start() - this function I am having trouble with Of course problem of separate stacks, and input for every branch. I tried to solve it with collection of objects NPA and try to start every object, but it doesn work.
