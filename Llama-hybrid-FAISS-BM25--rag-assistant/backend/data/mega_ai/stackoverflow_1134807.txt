I'm not a fan of offloading tasks to the client that should be handled on the server. The real solution is to calculate the image-size when it is added to your database, then generating the tag correctly with width and height attributes before sending it to the client. Any overhead incurred in the initial calculation (and pulling the values from the database afterwards) would be minuscule compared to the process of uploading it to the database in the first place -- not to mention each subsequent retrieval of it later. The result is a semantically meaningful HTML-tag that works with jQuery in all browsers you care about, so why avoid it?
