Adding assertions Coded UI tests

I am working on testing a add on on MS Word using Coded UI tests in Visual Studio. I am at a point where I need to verify that after signing in, the user sees a new pop up window. I am not sure how to verify this. I try dragging the cross hair icon over on the pop up window, but am not sure which assertion to add.
