ImportError: No module named BeautifulSoup

I have installed BeautifulSoup using easy_install and I'm trying to run the following script: from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup import re doc = [' Page title ', ' This is paragraph one .', ' This is paragraph two .', ' '] soup = BeautifulSoup(''.join(doc)) print soup.prettify() But I get this error: Traceback (most recent call last): File "C:\Python27\reading and writing xml file from web1.py", line 49, in from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup ImportError: No module named BeautifulSoup
