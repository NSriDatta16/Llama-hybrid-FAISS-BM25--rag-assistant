Unfortunately there is no standard way to tackle this, at least nothing we found out after doing quite some research. What you can do is: (1) Register your own JSF-ExceptionHandler in faces-config.xml and make it handle whatever exceptions you want to, redirect to error- / login-page afterwards. Not completely trivial, but definitely possible - that's how we do it. (2) Have a look at (and use) Seam-Catch , they are using the same mechanism (but in a more elegant CDI-conform way), we didn't use it because it wasn't ready two months ago.
