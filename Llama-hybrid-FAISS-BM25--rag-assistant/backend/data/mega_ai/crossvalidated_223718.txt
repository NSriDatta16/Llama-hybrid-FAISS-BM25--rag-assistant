Seasonal plot for time series with multiple seasonalities

My data is like the following, half hourly multi-seasonal time series from 2011 to 2016. HH_ID Date_ID Demand Year_ID MM_ID day 201101010000 20110101 35090 2011 201101 Monday 201101010030 20110101 35612 2011 201101 Monday 201101010100 20110101 35245 2011 201101 Monday 201101010130 20110101 34161 2011 201101 Monday ... ... ... ... .... demand.ts1 I would like to use season plot or whatever to plot it and explore its seasonality. The current one I got is quite ugly. Is there any recommendation how to get a better plot? I also randomly manually chose a week from each year, plotted them. The question is how to let xlim to show the day (Mon,Tues...), rather than the index of data? Thanks.
