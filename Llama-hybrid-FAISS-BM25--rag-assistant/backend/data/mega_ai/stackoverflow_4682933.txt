Make sure you have the theme dll in your project (DevExpress.Web.ASPxThemes.v10.2.dll), also you noted that you updated to 10.2, make sure you don't have straggler dlls from 9.3.4 in your bin directory. Maybe even delete the temp files in your ASP.NET temp folder (C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\Temporary ASP.NET Files).
