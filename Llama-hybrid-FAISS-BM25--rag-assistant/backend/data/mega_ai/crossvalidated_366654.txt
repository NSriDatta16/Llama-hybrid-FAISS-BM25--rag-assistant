First, you have the wrong log-likelihood. You might want to go back and check that part. Second, this likelihood, when thought of as a function in $\theta$, is only nonzero whenever $\theta$ is less than all of the data points. This means $\theta \le x_i$ for all $i$, which is equivalent to $$ \theta \le \min_i\{x_i\}. $$ Also keep in mind $\theta$ is positive. These points are critical when considering the derivative, because you may not be able to find a root for the derivative on this interval. In other words, you might not be able to just set it equal to zero and solve for $\theta$. If that's the case, try drawing a picture of the likelihood with $\theta$ on the independent axis, paying special attention to the bounds.
