The generalization of the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests is the semiparametric proportional odds ordinal logistic model. While maintaining excellent power it will allow for any number of covariates. For clustered data random effects are easy to add to this model. See the Bayesian modeling package brms and frequentist R packages mixor and ordinal . If you have longitudinal data random effects are unlikely to find the resulting serial correlation pattern and you might consider instead a Markov model as detailed here . An introduction to the proportional odds model is in the Nonparametrics chapter of BBR .
