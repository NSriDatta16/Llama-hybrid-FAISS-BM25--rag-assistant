Best approach to a line plot (or other type) whose lines consist of an average of 2 Y values

I am wondering the best approach to plot what I want. I have 4 dataframes of data (2 types of data with 2 replicates for each type). To tis point, I've just been choosing he best replicate of each type and plotting that. However, I think to be more accurate, I should include both replicates in each line. What is the best way to do this? Box plots? Error bars? Here is an example of the graph I have been creating. Thanks.
