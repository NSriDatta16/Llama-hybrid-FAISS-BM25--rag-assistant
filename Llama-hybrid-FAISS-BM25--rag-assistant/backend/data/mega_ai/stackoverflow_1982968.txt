Regarding your question, "Is M-q used differently in c-mode?", describe-key (bound to C-h k) is your friend. While visiting the buffer with the C file, type C-h k M-q and it will tell you exactly what function M-q is bound to. In this case, it is c-fill-paragraph , which ultimately uses paragraph-start , the variable you found in that other question. I found that this regular expression used as paragraph-start will wrap lines and treat each @param as a new paragraph: "^[ ]*\\(//+\\|\\**\\)[ ]*\\([ ]*$\\|@param\\)\\|^\f" However, it will not indent the wrappedlines as you want. It will make your example look like this: /** * Description * * @param[in,out] var1 : * @param[in,out] var2 : */ I hope it still works better for you. Let me know if you figure out the indenting.
