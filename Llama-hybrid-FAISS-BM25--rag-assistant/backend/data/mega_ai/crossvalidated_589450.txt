In what follows, I assume that the rate is bounded by 0 and 1. This would map the rate to the log odds space, wherein the argument (rate / (1-rate)) would not be constrained to the unit interval. This would permit using linear regression as opposed to Beta regression or logistic regression (though this benefit really only makes sense in the case where you don't have access to statistical software in my opinion).
