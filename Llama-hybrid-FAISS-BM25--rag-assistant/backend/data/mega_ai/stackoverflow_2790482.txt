iPad Simulator WebView/Google Maps API Issue

I've only recently updated XCode to 3.2.2 and started to play with the iPad simulator. I am having an issue with a WebView. I am using it to load a url with a Google Maps API implementation. The map loads and displays properly but when I try and click and drag on it to pan the map around instead of the map being panned the whole webview is scrolled vertically, revealing the dark grey background. When I release it it bounces back into place. Also when I hold the option key down to pinch the map it does not respond. If I load the map.google.com page the map pans just fine and is responsive, but not my one. No special code here, just the usual NSUrlRequest. It works fine in the iPhone simulator, but not the iPad simulator. User Interaction Enabled is also checked. Any thoughts on why this is happening?
