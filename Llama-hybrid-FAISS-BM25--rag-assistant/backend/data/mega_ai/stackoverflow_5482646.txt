How to disable an iframe in javascript?

How can an iframe be disabled using Javascript, such that the user is unable to interact with the iframe's contents (i.e. scrolling, selecting, dragging, etc)? For example, a Google map in an iframe can normally be dragged and zoomed. How would these actions be prevented?
