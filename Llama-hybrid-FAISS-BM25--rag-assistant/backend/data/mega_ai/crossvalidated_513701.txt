Factor Analysis - multiple answers from same respondents

i am conducting an Exploratory Factor Analysis. I asked 100 subjects to rate the credibility of 4 marketing tactics. I examined 8 tactics in total and 4 tactics were allocated randomly to every subject to answer. Now I want to conduct a factor analysis to find the number and nature of constructs underlying the eight items. Is it even ok to have multiple answers by the same respondents? (I have 100 x 4 answers -> translate to 400 rows of data in my SPSS output) Because one assumption of FA is, that "the answers are independent to each other", isn't it? If it is ok, do I use the dataset with 400 rows or do I have to reduce the dataset with mean averages of some kind? What would be the advantage? Thank you so much, I really need the help for my finals!
