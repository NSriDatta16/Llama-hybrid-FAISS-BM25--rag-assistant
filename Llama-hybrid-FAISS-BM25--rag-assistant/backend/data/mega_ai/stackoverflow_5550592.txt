How to simplify WWW or No WWW in one elegant Apache Rewrite?

Dear folks, The (www.)? part in the below code doesnt work properly I feel: RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^(www\.)?mywebsite.com$ RewriteRule ^$ /de/home [L] The above code now works together with this: #### http:// >> http://www. RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^(www\.|$) [NC] RewriteRule ^ http://www.%{HTTP_HOST}%{REQUEST_URI} [R=301,L] I feel it could be made simpler by extending the first code block sothat it captures both http:// and http://www. towards /de/home How do adapt the first code block sothat it is versatile and captures any version with or without www to load under water /de/home? Thanks very much
