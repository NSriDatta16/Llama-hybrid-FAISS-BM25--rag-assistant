Time Series Analysis and ARIMA

Why it is important to convert any time series problem data to stationary before applying ARIMA .can anyone please tell me intuition behind it ? ( I know if i dont convert it to stationary it will follow same trend but i want to understand how making stationary series is suitable for ARIMA )
