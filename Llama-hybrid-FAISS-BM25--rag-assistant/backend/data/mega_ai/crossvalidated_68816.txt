The reason is that ARIMA is auto-projective which uses the most recent data to compute essentially a weighted average of past values. When forecasting, the 1 step ahead is used to predict the second step etc. .This then leads to long term forecasts that approach an asymptote. When fitting , the actual history is used to predict the next point. What you should do is to build an integrated model that includes deterministic structure like day-of-the-week, changes in the day-of-the-week coefficients, monthly/weekly effects taking into account any events like holidays and include any needed level shifts or local time trends that can be detected and seamlessly incorporated. Additionally particular days of the month and particular weeks of the month may come into play. This is done by hour and by daily sums. Furthermore use the daily sums history and its forecasts as a possible predictor variable for each of the 24 hourly models. Make sure that you verify that the parameters of each of your 25 models are invariant over time and that the error variance for each of your 25 models doesn't change over time. Finally you may need to incorporate a parent-to-child or child-to-parent strategy to reconcile any differences. We have been very successful using these procedures and you should also be succesful.
