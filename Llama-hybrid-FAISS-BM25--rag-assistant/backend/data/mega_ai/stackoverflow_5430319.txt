It is, simply, an arbitrary decision, from C. In C, all types (except from void ) are used to carry a value. void , by definition, does not hold any value. The language designers therefore decided it would not be possible to instantiate it. C++ takes after C, and the decision remained. Otherwise it would have been necessary to define a storage size (probably the same as bool ). In C++ it is indeed annoying, especially because of the special casing necessary for template classes / functions, but no-one deemed it worthy of modification since it's possible to specialize the templates for void and thus it's not blocking.
