Binary Classification problem for imbalanced dataset

I am new to machine learning and need help. I have a dataset with two classes(0,1) where is 0 is Profitable and 1 is Unprofitable. Ratio of 0:1 in train set is 150/52 Taking positive as "1"(Unprofitable) and negative as 0(Profitable) ,False Negative cost is 4900 and False Positive cost is 4000. Objective is to maximize f(profit) = 4000*(No of True Negative-No of False Positive)-(4900*No of False Negative) such that is atleast > 1775$(base profit without any model) With EDA I figured Years At employer, Debt/Income Ratio and Age to be most important predictors. With XGBoost having scale_pos_weight =3 I get excellent results on training set but fails badly (overfits) on test set. No matter how much I try I am not able to improve Profits for test set beyond 1375\$ (as mentioned above needs to be at least > 1775$) Even rpart with loss function does not help much... Can anyone please provide any input? However If I take an alternative approach (i.e take only observations with Years at employer and then apply glm or rpart results are really great on both train and test set, but is this approach even right ? (I did this because EDA shows that all unprofitable customers were with "years at employer
