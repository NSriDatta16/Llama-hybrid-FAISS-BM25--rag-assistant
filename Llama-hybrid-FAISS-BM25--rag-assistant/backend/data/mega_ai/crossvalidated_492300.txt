There are many ways to combine the 3 models. If you have the response variable and predictions for a good number of observations, you can combine them in a way that better predicts the response variable. One can average them, build a weighted average from a logistic regression, or a tree based approach. Those are called ensembles and are quite common. I know of some evidence that those simple techniques can work quite well, but the possibilities are endless and can get quite messy when it comes to ensembles.
