Strategy pattern question - PHP

I have a class Person and I would like using the Strategy pattern to add a storage behavior. Something like this interface Storage{ public function store(); } class LocalStorage implements Storage(){ public function store(){ .. // save in a file .. } } class Person{ private $behaviourStorage; private $name; private $age; public function __construct(Storage $objStorage,$name,$age) { $this->behaviourStorage = $objStorage; } public function Store(){ $this->behaviourStorage->store(); } } $objPerson = new Person(new LocalStorage(),'John',32); My question is, how can I use the storage behavior to save the information of the object person ? How do I pass the object to the LocalStorage so it knows what to save ? Maybe this is not the right design pattern after all but the intent is clear : implement different storage behaviours for the person object.
