You can suscribe Parent Events with AddHandler But you do it on Parent_changed events. Note that Parent is nothing until control is added to other control or Form. Private Sub GantCtl_ParentChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles Me.ParentChanged Dim mParent = DirectCast(Parent, Form) AddHandler mParent.KeyDown, AddressOf Parent_KeyDown AddHandler mParent.MouseWheel, AddressOf Parent_MouseWheel AddHandler mParent.Resize, AddressOf parent_Resize End Sub
