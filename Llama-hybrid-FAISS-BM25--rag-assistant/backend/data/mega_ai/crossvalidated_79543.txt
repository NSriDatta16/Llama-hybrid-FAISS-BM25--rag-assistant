i think ,you are questioning purpose of PCA by considering single case i.e. when your data set is having binary values. Now assume that your data set is having real values instead of binary values then i m sure PCA will do its task perfectly i.e. reducing the dimensionality, and thus the size In your case, if PCA is increasing size of data set then don't use it.
