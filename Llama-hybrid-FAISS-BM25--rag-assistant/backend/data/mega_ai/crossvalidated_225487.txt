Running many multiple regressions at once in R

I want to run time series regressions (Fama-French three factor with my new factor). I have following tables. Table01 Date Port_01 Port_02 --------- Port_18 01/1965 0.85 0.97 1.86 02/1965 8.96 7.2 0.98 03/1965 8.98 7.9 8.86 Table 02 Date Market SMB HML WXO 01/1965 0.85 0.97 0.86 0.87 02/1965 8.96 7.2 0.98 0.79 03/1965 8.98 7.9 8.86 0.86 Table 01 is my Y variable and Table 02 is my independent variables. I want to regress 18 portfolios on factors on Table 02. I want the intercepts to be stored in a vector (N x 1). and residuals to be stored in a matrix (T x N), check the image. I know how to run regression individually. But It there must be a better way to do. Please help me. Thanks in advance.
