What is the essential difference between neural network and linear regression

A neural network is a several linear transormations $L_1,\ldots, L_m$ that are sequentialy appilied to feature vector $X$ . A compositon of linear transformations is a linear transformation. So after all we get $L X$ where $L$ is a composition of $L_1,\ldots, L_m$ . The question is: if eventually we have that neural network is just applying a liner transformation to a feature vector what is the essential difference betwen neural networks and linear regression
