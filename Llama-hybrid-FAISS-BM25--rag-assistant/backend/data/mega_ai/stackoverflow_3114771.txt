For a very brief answer, the benefits of these casts is that they perform specific functions making the code descriptive. The C-style cast is all-powerful and allows you to get away with all kinds of mistakes. Those used to C might complain that the casts are a pain to write out. That's actually considered a good thing by others: it discourages programmers from sprinkling casts all over their code which is a very obvious sign of problematic code. Finally, they're easy to find with a text search.
