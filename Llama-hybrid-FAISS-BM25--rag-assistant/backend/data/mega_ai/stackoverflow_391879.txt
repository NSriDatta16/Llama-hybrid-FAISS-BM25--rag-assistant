Organising my Python project

I'm starting a Python project and expect to have 20 or more classes in it. As is good practice I want to put them in a separate file each. However, the project directory quickly becomes swamped with files (or will when I do this). If I put a file to import in a folder I can no longer import it. How do I import a file from another folder and will I need to reference to the class it contains differently now that it's in a folder? Thanks in advance
