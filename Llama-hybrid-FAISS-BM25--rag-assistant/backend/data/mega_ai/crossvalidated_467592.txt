Math behind Differencing: Is White Noise Stationary?

I'm just starting to learn the math behind stationarity and differencing, so I apologize if this is a silly question. Lets say I have a non-stationary time series process (pure random walk) defined by: $Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_{t}$ Where $\varepsilon_{t} = \text{white noise}$ If I look to make this process stationary through differencing, I subtract $Y_{t-1} from both sides and can write it as: $Z_t = \varepsilon_{t}$ , where $Z_t = Y_t - Y_{t-1}$ If $Z_t$ is now stationary, then I believe the white-noise $\varepsilon_t$ was stationary the whole time. Is white noise stationary in this context (pure random walk)?
