Local linear trend-exponential smoothing duality with non-Gaussian likelihood?

Say we have the following state space/structural time series model: $$ y_t \mid \mu, \sigma \sim \text{Normal(} \mu = \mu_t, \sigma^2_\varepsilon) \\ \mu_{t+1} = \mu_t + \eta_t $$ where $$ \eta_t \sim \text{Normal}(0,\sigma^2_\eta) $$ It is proven in Muth (1960) that the model outlined above is equivalent to simple exponential smoothing, with smoothing weight given by $\frac{\sigma^2_\eta}{\sigma^2_\varepsilon}$ . Muth proves this by minimizing the sum of squared errors (SSE) and re-expressing the above process as an infinite sum of previous observed values. Now suppose we modify the model above to a non-normal likelihood, say a Gamma (using mean-dispersion parameterization here): $$ y_t \mid \mu, \phi \sim \text{Gamma}(\mu = \exp(\mu_t), \phi) \\ \mu_{t+1} = \mu_t + \eta_t $$ Is there any proof of the properties of the above process (or similar non-normal exponential family distribution) when we don't have a normal likelihood anymore? Does it still approximate an exponentially smoothed forecast, perhaps in log space? Is this unreasonable to expect? My gut says that this property only holds true under normal likelihood due to the proof relying on minimizing the sum of squared errors.
