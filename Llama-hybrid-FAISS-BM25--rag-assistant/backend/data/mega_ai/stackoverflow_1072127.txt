I suspect it might be that you have assigned the view to the files owner. Open IB. In the window that has. File's Owner First Responser View Right click on the "view" object. If it only has one option "new referencing outlet" then it means you havent wired the view into the files owner. Simply grab that little o beside this and drag it upto the files owner. Once over files owner a new menu should popup and you can should be able to select "view" Save this and see if is now working. Lastly check that the "File's Owner" has been set to your class, you can simply select the File's Owner and inspect this. In one of the drop downs you will be able to select the class. IB is cool. Dont give up... Saves upto 70% of you setup code (as stated at WWDC by Apple) so stick with it. John.
