How to compare the means of two dependent groups when the groups are not paired?

I have performed a behavioral experiment on bees from one single hive. I let them fly under two different conditions and now I want to compare the average flight speed in the two conditions. The number of bees are different in the two conditions. In condition 1, I have 17 bees, and in condition 2, I have 19 bees. I don't know if the same individuals were flying in both conditions, because I didn't mark the individuals. However, it is most likely that at least a few of the bees were flying in both conditions. Moreover, the same bee might have been flying more than once in each condition. Because of this, I guess I have to treat my data as dependent (repeated measures), right? Now, my question is what test I should use to see if the two group means differ from each other? Since the two groups are dependent, I can't perform an independent samples t-test, but since my data is not paired, I can't perform a paired samples t-test either... Any kind of advice would be much appreciated! Thank you in advance, Therese Edit 1: The hives are estimated to consist of about 200 bees, but I can't say for sure how many bees this hive consisted of. Edit 2: First of all, thank you for your comments, Placidia. The two conditions were performed randomly over a couple of days, so I assume that the bees don't learn anything from the different conditions. However, I am wondering about the finite sample correction that you mentioned. In another similar experiment, I sampled 40 bees for each condition (but for each condition, I sampled the bees during two time periods, in the morning and in the afternoon, and did this over 2 days. In other words, I sampled 10 bees at a time). Do I have to make an adjustment for finite sample in that case? In yet another experiment, I sampled 17 bees from a wild population. Does that mean that the sample is infinite, and that I don't have to adjust for a finite sample? Thank you again, I really appreciate your help!
