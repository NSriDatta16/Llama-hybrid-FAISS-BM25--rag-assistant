Are "artificial neural network" and "neural network" the same thing?

I am writing an essay about artificial neural network, and I am asked to provide academic sources in this essay. When I search for "artificial neural network" on the Internet, I find many papers that are related to "neural network", but not explicitly related to "artificial neural network". It seems that "artificial neural network" and "neural network" are the same thing. Are they the same thing? If they are, is there any academic source that points out that? If there is, where is it?
