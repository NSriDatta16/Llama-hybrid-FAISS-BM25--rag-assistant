Foreign key constraints with on delete cascade are supported, but you need to enable them. I just added the following to my SQLOpenHelper , which seems to do the trick. @Override public void onOpen(SQLiteDatabase db) { super.onOpen(db); if (!db.isReadOnly()) { // Enable foreign key constraints db.execSQL("PRAGMA foreign_keys=ON;"); } } I declared my referencing column as follows. mailbox_id INTEGER REFERENCES mailboxes ON DELETE CASCADE
