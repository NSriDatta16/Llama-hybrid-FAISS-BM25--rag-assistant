Query JSON inside MySql Column

Is any way to query specific values from a JSON stored in varchar or string row in MySql? A little bit as using MongoDB (Or couch or raven) with out old friend MySql. I know that even if I get to queries this values, I still will be missing all the features of NoSql solutions, but I just need to store schemaless information in MySQL. PS: what if the data is stored as XML instead of JSON? UPDATE: I want to add something for future reference: If you are looking for a way to have schemaless storage in a shared hosting, the easiest way is to sign up for a montodb hosted solution, or couchdb hosted solution (https://cloudant.com/#!/solutions/cloud for example).
