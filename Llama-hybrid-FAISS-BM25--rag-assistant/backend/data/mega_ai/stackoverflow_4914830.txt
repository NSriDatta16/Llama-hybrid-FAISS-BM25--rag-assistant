Adding collection retrieval methods into the model

Hey, I'm looking for a bit of advice here, I have a simple model with the usual save, delete and find methods, but wanted to create a getAll method aswell, it feels wrong putting it in the model as its not related to the actual model. Which way should I design this? My current model looks like this: Any help would be much appreciated, Thanks
