Is working with all customers a sample or population?

A company wants to run a promotional campaign to encourage usage of a credit card that the customer already has. The company wants to send this promotion to all credit card customers. It wants to split the group into a Control and Treatment. The Control group will not receive the promotion and the Treatment group will. What the company wants to know is whether the spending behaviour of the Control group is different from Treatment group. My question is if I am working with the entire customer base of this company, do the significance tests (t-test, ANOVA (if have have more groups)) actually make sense to perform? I tried searching for an answer to this, but so far I don't think I found anything. I found a few things on superpopulation but I'm not sure if it applies to this scenario. I also cannot really think of what would be a larger population in this case. Could the larger population be those who are not our customers? If anyone has any references regarding how to make this distinction between a sample and a population, that would be great.
