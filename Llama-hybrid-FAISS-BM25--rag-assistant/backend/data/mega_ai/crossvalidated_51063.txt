Why not for each merchant compute a success rate for every product he sells $S_{ij}$. ($i$ indexes products and $j$ indexes merchants) Average this and compute a merchant average baseline success rate($S_j$). Now compute differences ($\delta S_{ij}=S_{ij} - S_j$). Each of this $\delta S_{ij}$ indicates how much better or worse every product does with respect to that merchants baseline success rate. If you sum up this $\delta S_{ij}$ over all merchants j you'd obtain some sort of score of the attractiveness of every product $S_i$? The merchant skill metric would be a dual of this. One problem is this doesn't weigh in the confidence level motivated by large data. i.e. 2 successes out of 4 pitches ought to (perhaps) matter less than 1000 successes out of 2000 pitches? You'd have to find some way to adjust for that in case it matters. Alternatively: Assume every merchant has a skill value $M_j$ and every product has a product attractiveness $A_i$. You could model the success rate of product $i$ sold by merchant $j$ ($S_{ij}$) as some function of $M_j$ and $A_i$ with possible cross terms. If you fit this you might be able to score using the coefficents. If you consider $S_{ij} = M_j \times A_i + \epsilon_{ij}$ you get one simple model. The matrix of success elements is possibly sparse (since not all merchants sell all products). If it were indeed fully populated you must estimate 200 coefficients from 100x100 success rate numbers such that you minimize $\epsilon_{ij}$ in some sort of least squares sense. Possible flaws: I don't see an easy way to interpret relative scores. e.g. If two Products have an attractiveness of $A_{i1}$ and $A_{i2}$ how much better is one than the other? A simple ratio? A log likelihood? etc. Perhaps there is some interpretation but I cannot see it yet. From a strictly ordering perspective it shouldn't matter. PS How sparse is your matrix? Knowing that you have millions of pitches maybe not too sparse? Or is it? i.e. Out of a maximum possible 10,000 merchant-product combinations how many are filled (i.e. have at least one pitch)? PS1 Uniqueness. I cannot prove whether your $M_j$ and $A_i$ values will be unique or even close to. If there are multiple solutions it'll be an interesting situation. Maybe there are stronger math results about this?
