Maximum likelihood estimation is perhaps the most popular method. Even if you noise is not Normally distributed, you will still obtain the Quasi-MLE which is consistent for the parameter of interest. You can check the Hamilton's Time Series Analysis to see how the likelihood function is specified. Another method mentioned in the links provided by Ram is Yule-Walker method which is based on the method of moments estimation (GMM). The idea is to match moments such as mean, variance and autocovariances.
