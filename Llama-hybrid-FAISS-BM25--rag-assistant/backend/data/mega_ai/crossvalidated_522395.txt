First, your formula can be written in several different ways: $$ \left| \frac{A}{B}-1\right|=\left|\frac{A-B}{B} \right|=\frac{\left|A-B \right|}{|B|}$$ with the last being the form for one definition of (absolute) relative difference . Second, that form places a particular importance on Condition B as the reference. If that's the case your formula might make some sense. But if Condition A is really the reference you might want to replace the denominator by |A|. If neither is a reference, you might be better off using the maximum of A and B or their average for a measure of relative difference. Third, your use of this measure on the averages as the outcome for each participant might be getting in the way of a statistical approach to test your hypothesis. In general, the closer you get to the original observations, the better. The multiple trials for each participant suggests that you might be better off with going back to individual data rows for each trial. Each data row then represents a single trial with the reaction time, the Condition, the ID of the participant, and any other covariate values you might have. If you think that these are relative differences rather than absolute differences you might want to work with a log scale for reaction times, or use a generalized linear model with a log link between the predictors and the outcome. The two Conditions are a fixed effect, with one chosen as the reference. The random intercepts take into account participant differences in the reference-condition reaction times, and the random slopes would represent the further participant differences between the two conditions. The magnitude of the variance among those random slopes seems to be what you are interested in.* For an introduction to testing significance of random effects, you could start with this page . Finally, I'm a bit worried by the way you have approached this. You started out with an hypothesis about a particular directionality of difference between the two Conditions, and only came up with this outcome measure after you found that hypothesis to be unsupported. That's not generally good practice, as hypothesis testing fundamentally assumes hypotheses that were formulated without looking at the data. *Generally one would expect a distribution of differences between 2 conditions among individuals just at random. I expect that you have some variability of a particularly large magnitude in mind, or perhaps a difference that in turn is associated with some covariate for each individual.
