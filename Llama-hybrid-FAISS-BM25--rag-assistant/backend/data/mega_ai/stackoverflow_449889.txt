Tcl/Tk is the best GUI language/toolkit combo ever It may lack specific widgets and be less good-looking than the new kids on the block, but its model is elegant and so easy to use that one can build working GUIs faster by typing commands interactively than by using a visual interface builder. Its expressive power is unbeatable: other solutions (Gtk, Java, .NET, MFC...) typically require ten to one hundred LOC to get the same result as a Tcl/Tk one-liner. All without even sacrificing readability or stability. pack [label .l -text "Hello world!"] [button .b -text "Quit" -command exit]
