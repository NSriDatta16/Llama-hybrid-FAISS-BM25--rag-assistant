I have been goggling fora solution on how to display a TIFF image in a SSRS report but I couldn't find any and since SSRS doesn's support TIFF, I thought converting the TIFF to one of the suppported format will do the trick. And it did. I don't know if there are similar implementation like this out there, but I am just posting so others could benefit as well. Note this only applies if you have a TIFF image saved on database. Public Shared Function ToImage(ByVal imageBytes As Byte()) As Byte() Dim ms As System.IO.MemoryStream = New System.IO.MemoryStream(imageBytes) Dim os As System.IO.MemoryStream = New System.IO.MemoryStream() Dim img As System.Drawing.Image = System.Drawing.Image.FromStream(ms) img.Save(os, System.Drawing.Imaging.ImageFormat.Jpeg) Return os.ToArray() End Function Hereâ€™s how you can use the code: 1. In the Report Properties, Select Refereneces, click add and browse System.Drawing, Version=2.0.0.0 2. Select the Code Property, Copy paste the function above 3. Click Ok 4. Drop an Image control from the toolbox 4.1. Right-Click the image and select Image Properties 4.2. Set the Image Source to Database 4.3. In the Use this field, Click expression and paste the code below =Code.ToImage(Fields!FormImage.Value) 4.4. Set the appropriate Mime to Jpeg Regards, Fulbert
