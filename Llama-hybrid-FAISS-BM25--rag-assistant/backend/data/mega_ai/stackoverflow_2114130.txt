turn off screen updating in a dos batch file

I am writing a program in C++ that launches commands from the DOS operating system using the system() command. So far so good I think. But how can I turn off the screen updating in the console window that pops up so I can't see the thousands of messages that are resulting. Or, alternatively, how can I dump those messages in some other place....ie is there a more elegant way to deal with this rather than just turning off the screen? thanks.
