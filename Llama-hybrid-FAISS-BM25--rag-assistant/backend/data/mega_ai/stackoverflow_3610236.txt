How to avoid Silverlight ugly fonts?

I'd like to show some client that Silverlight can be used as a technology for BL apps. They were shocked that some firm waste the money for so crappy looking technology (it's about MS)... I just presented a screen with a few TextBoxes and some other controls...

Is it possible that after four versions of Silverlight Microsoft doesn't know how to render some text looking readable? Or maybe I just don't know how to prepare TextBox with sharp and clear Tahoma font. Any ideas? Magnified sample from client's TextBox is below:
