You have many options to choose from, with trade-offs. Some options may not be "good" depending on what you want to achieve: Use function parameters and return values to move data bits around. Use reference/out parameters to collect data. Use callback functions/delegates. Use events (if supported by language). Use one common instance where all interesting information is gathered. Let class1 implement stable interface, which can be used by class3. Use central storage like common memory, file, database etc. Check design patterns. Check idioms in platform.
