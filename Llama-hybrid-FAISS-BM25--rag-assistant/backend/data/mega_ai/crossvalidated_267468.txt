For a terrific if mathematical explanation of the Law of Large Numbers, see the blog entry of Terry Tao . It contains in particular the following analogy: "Imagine a table in which the rows are all the possible points in the sample space (this is a continuum of rows, but never mind this), and the columns are the number $n$ of trials, and there is a check mark whenever the empirical mean $\overline{X}_n$ deviates significantly from the actual mean ${\Bbb E}[X]$. The weak law asserts that the density of check marks in each column goes to zero as one moves off to the right. The strong law asserts that almost all of the rows have only finitely many checkmarks." In my opinion, the fundamental reason for the (strong) law of large numbers to hold is the Borel-Cantelli lemma : Given a sequence $E_1, E_2, E_3, \ldots$ of events satisfying$$ \sum_{n=1}^\infty {\Bbb P}(E_n) Note also that the law of large numbers holds outside iid cases, as for instance, ergodic Markov chains which satisfy the LLN although they are neither independent [being Markov] nor iid [depending on the starting value].
