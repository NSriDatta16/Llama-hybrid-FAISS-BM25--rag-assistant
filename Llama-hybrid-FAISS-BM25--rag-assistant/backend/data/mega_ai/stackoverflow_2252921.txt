In addition to the excellent links that Mitch provided, I very strongly encourage you to get a copy of Juval Lowy's excellent " Programming WCF Services - 2nd Edition ." It is generally considered the "bible" of WCF and is one of my all time favorite technical books. If you really want to learn WCF, you can't do a lot better than reading even just the first few chapters of this book.
