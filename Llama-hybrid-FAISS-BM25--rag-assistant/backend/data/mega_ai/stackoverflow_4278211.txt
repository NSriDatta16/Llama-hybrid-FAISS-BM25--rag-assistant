Validating XML fragment against complexType in schema in PHP

I have an XML fragment that I would like to test against a complexType in a schema. The problem is the schema is hugely complex and the fragment I would like to test relates specifically to a single complex type. Is there a way to validate the element against the schema without having to wrap it in a massive mocked-up document that validates against the whole schema?
