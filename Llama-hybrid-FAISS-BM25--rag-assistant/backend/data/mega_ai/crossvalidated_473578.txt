You are on the right track. A multinomial distribution makes sense here. By default, the submodel for a multinomial response variable will be a multinomial logistic regression model (e.g. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multinomial_logistic_regression ) with baseline coding such that the parameters for the first level of the categorical response are fixed to 0. Hence the values of 0 for "Re1.(Intercept).1" (which stands for "response variable 1"."intercept"."level 1") for all states (rows "St"). When you don't include any predictors/regressors/independent variables in this model (i.e. it is an intercept-only model), more directly interpretable parameters can be obtained by using an identity link function, changing your code slightly: family=multinomial("identity"). The parameters are then simply the probability of each level. The state-dependent density of the response variables is given in the "dens" slot of the (fitted) model object, which is "Array of dimension sum(ntimes) nresp nstates providing the densities of the observed responses for each state." (see ?"depmix-class"). So e.g. fm@dens[,,1] will give you the likelihood of the observations assuming the chain is in state 1. Hope this helps!
