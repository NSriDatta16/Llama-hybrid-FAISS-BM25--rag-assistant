Determine if Python script is being executed locally or as CGI

Let's say I have a basic Python script, test.py : #!/usr/bin/python print "Content-type: text/html\n\n" print " Hello world! " How would one determine if the script is being executed locally, e.g.: python test.py Or being called via a web browser, e.g. visiting: http://example.com/test.py This doesn't seem to be addressed in the documentation for the cgi module . I thought there might be a difference in the result of cgi.FieldStorage() but there doesn't seem to be one. The only way I can think to do it is as follows: #!/usr/bin/python import os print "Content-type: text/html\n\n" print " Hello world! " if 'REQUEST_METHOD' in os.environ : print "This is a webpage" else : print "This is not a webpage" Is this the best and/or most ideal method? Why/why not?
