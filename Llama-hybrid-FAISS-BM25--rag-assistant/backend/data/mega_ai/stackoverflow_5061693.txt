How move/reorder cells from TableView1 to TableView2

I have several UITableViews, with different datasources in a iPad screen. I need to copy/move a cell from the first tableView to the second, similar how is done with ListBox in other languages. Now, I can reorder the cells, but the movement is restricted to the tableView. I want to drag the cell in tableView1 & drop in tableView2. P.D. I'm open to use any other control to archive this. I take a look at AQGridView & DTGridView , however the layout is based in columns with different #items. If I can emulate columns with this controls or other then I can accept the workaround. UPDATE: I hope this links could help: Observing pinch multi-touch gestures in a UITableView This is the most close answer: Drag and drop between two tables in ipad I know how get a image from a view, I can detect the drag with a Gesture Recognizers , so I have all the setup in place but have not expertise in graphic development, so don't know how put this in motion...
