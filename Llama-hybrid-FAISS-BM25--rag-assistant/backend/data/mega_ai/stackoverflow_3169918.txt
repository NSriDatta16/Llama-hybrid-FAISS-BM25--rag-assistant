If you want to write a decoder, the first thing you should probably look at is the spec for the format you want to decode. The ogg/vorbis spec can be found here: http://xiph.org/vorbis/doc/Vorbis_I_spec.html . Also, it could be of help to take a look (or maybe port) some other open source library that already does this (I'm not aware of any written in Actionscript), such as this, in Java: http://www.jcraft.com/jorbis/ (I don't know this library, I've just found it googling "ogg vorbis open source". At any rate, you'll have to put some work to get it working and I don't mean this to discourage you, but I'm not sure Actionscript is fast enough for real time audio decoding.
