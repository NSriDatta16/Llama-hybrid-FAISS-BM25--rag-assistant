How to make php script run another php script

I'm trying to do exactly the same thing as in my previous Python question, but in PHP. See my previous (answered) question PHP script from previous question does something and then runs another PHP script on the same server, does something and then quits (while second script still continues its work). How do I achieve this? Please note that PHP script is also a web page at the same time (so maybe we can use it like in previous question where answer to my question was snippet that made python just open url instead of running subprocess... although I don't have a clue if that's useful information, maybe it's different in PHP, I'm not too experienced in PHP)... and that I want to make each scripts independent - so if first php script will finish I would like second php script to continue working even though first one ended . What do you think is most elegant way to do this? Would echoing iframe work or should I do this differently?
