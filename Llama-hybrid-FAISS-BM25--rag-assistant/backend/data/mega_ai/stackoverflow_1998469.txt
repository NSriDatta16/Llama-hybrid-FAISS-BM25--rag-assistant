only assumptions : According to this article from Hibernate documentation: [query cache] creates two new cache regions: one holding cached query result sets (org.hibernate.cache.StandardQueryCache), the other holding timestamps of the most recent updates to queryable tables (org.hibernate.cache.UpdateTimestampsCache). I assume this means that whenever the timestamp of the queryable table is newer than the result-set - it will cause hibernate to approach the DB in the the next call for that query, and that what keep the query cache safe in some aspect. But 2 sentences later in the same paragraph of the documentation it says: The query cache should always be used in conjunction with the second-level cache. again, my assumption is that this is the only way hibernate can be aware of changes to the database that are done out of this specific user's session
