metadata for subprojects within an svn repository

Basically I'm looking for a way to find things more easily within a large/complex SVN repository. (I frequently work on small tool applications, and will be shortly moving them into a common SVN repository. So I'm thinking of the case where may be dozens or even hundreds of little tool applications in one place. I've got a dozen or two and already I lose track sometimes of where I used some particular feature or library or build technique, or even which tool does what.) Has anyone made a lot of use with metadata in an svn repository? What's worked and what hasn't? I'm talking not only of how to store metadata, but what you do with it, like generating an HTML index. For storage, the way I see it there are 3 basic possibilities: put your metadata in a plain file that is checked into the svn repository. (e.g. some xml file with a special file convention e.g. svn-metadata.xml) This will then be versioned, but it makes it independent of svn. use svn properties to store metadata. (works ok, and is versioned, but then you are tied to svn. Plus side is that you can tie metadata specifically to individual files.) store metadata in an external location like a database or a wiki. (integrates more directly that storage location's features, but wouldn't be versioned, and is tied to that kind of storage.) I'm thinking of maybe using RDF + RSS as metadata in a plain file, and then writing something that periodically scans the SVN repositories for metadata, indexes it in a database, and generates an easy-to-use web app to make it easier to find.
