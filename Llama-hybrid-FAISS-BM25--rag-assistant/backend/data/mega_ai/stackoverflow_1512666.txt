How to ensure your sql transaction are safe?

Maybe this question is misleading but if you can answer it then do so. I remember posting many SQL questions and once in a while someone would say my transaction isnt safe. I can never remember the case. What are they? IIRC its when i do reads at the beginning of a table then write later and apparently other transactions can write even tho your not finished? I dont remember how to correct them either, in that case i am suppose to do dummy writers? But i am positive this paragraph is COMPLETELY wrong so hence the question. Are are cases where you transactions may be unsafe and what can i do as good practice to make them safe? I mostly use SQLite and sometimes use mysql
