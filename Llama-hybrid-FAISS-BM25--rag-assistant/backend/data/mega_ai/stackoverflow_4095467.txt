I've apparently found the answer, here in the Apple Developer site. Put a -apple-dashboard-region: style on the div that you want to have receive drag events instead of dragging the widget, e.g.: #canvas { -apple-dashboard-region: dashboard-region(control rectangle 4px 4px 4px 4px); } EDIT - this works - I can now capture onMouseMove() events when when the mouse button is pressed. One thing I can't (yet) do is the equivalent of IE's setCapture() , where mouse movement events continue to be passed to the application even when the drag extends beyond the area of the widget.
