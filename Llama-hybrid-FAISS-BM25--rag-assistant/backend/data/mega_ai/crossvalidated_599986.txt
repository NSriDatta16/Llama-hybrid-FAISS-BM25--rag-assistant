Your plot shows that large predictions are on average too high (most residuals are negative) and small predictions are on average too small. So the assumption of linearity is proved false. In such a case, to build a good quality model with a linear regression, you first need a non-linear transformation of the Y value. Is there any reason to expect that the underlying process is multiplicative rather than additive? If so, trying to predict $log(Y)$ is reasonable. More rarely, e.g. $\sqrt{Y}$ might be appropriate.
