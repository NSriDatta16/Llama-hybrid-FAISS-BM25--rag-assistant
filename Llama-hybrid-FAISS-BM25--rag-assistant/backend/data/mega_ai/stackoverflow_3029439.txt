unsigned integers are only positive. From 3.9.1 paragraph 3 of the 2003 C++ standard: The range of nonnegative values of a signed integer type is a subrange of the corresponding unsigned integer type, and the value representation of each corresponding signed/unsigned type shall be the same. The main purpose of the unsigned integer types is to support modulo arithmetic. From 3.9.1 paragraph 4: Unsigned integers, declared unsigned, shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer. You are free, of course, to treat them as negative if you wish, you'll just have to keep track of that yourself somehow (perhaps with a Boolean flag).
