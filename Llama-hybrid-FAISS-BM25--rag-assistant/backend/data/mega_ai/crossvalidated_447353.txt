Bayesian inference on the maximum of a function

Suppose, $$Y\mid X, \beta_1, \beta_2 \sim N(\beta_1X + \beta_2X^2, \sigma^2)$$ With $\sigma^2$ known and priors on $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ that are a mixture of 50% point mass on zero, and 50% a diffuse normal centered at zero and large variance. This prior comes from real physical understanding of the problem, and we do not want to change the prior, that's the whole purpose of the question. I want to make inference regarding the value of $X^*$ that maximizes the expected value of $Y$ . We know that $X^*$ is just a (sometimes set-valued) function (a transformation) of the parameters $\beta_1, \beta_2$ . For instance, if the function is concave, the maximum is a point, and given by, $$ X^* = -\frac{\beta_1}{2\beta_2} $$ If the function is constant, that is, $\beta_1 = \beta_2 =0$ , then the maximum is a set, $X^* = (-\infty, +\infty)$ , and so on. What is the posterior distribution of $X^*$ ? Or how can we get the posterior distribution of $X^*$ from the posterior of $\beta_1$ and $\beta_2$ ? Or, an even simpler question, what is the implied prior on $X^*$ ? And finally, how would you implement this in standard software such as Stan? I failed miserably on this...
