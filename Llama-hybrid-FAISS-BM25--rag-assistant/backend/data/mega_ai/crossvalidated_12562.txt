Equivalence between least squares and MLE in Gaussian model

I am new to Machine Learning, and am trying to learn it on my own. Recently I was reading through some lecture notes and had a basic question. Slide 13 says that "Least Square Estimate is same as Maximum Likelihood Estimate under a Gaussian model". It seems like it is something simple, but I am unable to see this. Can someone please explain what is going on here? I am interested in seeing the Math. I will later try to see the probabilistic viewpoint of Ridge and Lasso regression also, so if there are any suggestions that will help me, that will be much appreciated also.
