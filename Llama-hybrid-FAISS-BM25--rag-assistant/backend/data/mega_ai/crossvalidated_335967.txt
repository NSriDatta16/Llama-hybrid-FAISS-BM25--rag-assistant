Deseasonalizing a time series with multiple seasonalities based on a linear model

I have 3 seasonal components in my data. I wanted to estimate each of them. The result is the following: times Now I want to take the results and deseasonalize the data. How can I use my results and apply it to the data and deseasonalize the data with it? Another question is, what is the best reference to take for the linear model. In this case I took Monday, Friday and hour00. But the results would be different if I take different references to build the linear model on. So what is the best reference to take?
