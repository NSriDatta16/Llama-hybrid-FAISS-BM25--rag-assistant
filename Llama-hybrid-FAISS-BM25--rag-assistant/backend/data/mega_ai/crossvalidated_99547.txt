I've only used random forests a couple of times with much fewer variables. Intuitively it seems to me that with 10,000 variables and a training set of only 100, you could run into trouble with noise variables. However, random forest seem to be incredibly robust and this paper, for example, suggests that the approach shouldn't be thrown off by unrelated variables as long as you have strong ones. http://jmlr.org/papers/volume13/biau12a/biau12a.pdf
