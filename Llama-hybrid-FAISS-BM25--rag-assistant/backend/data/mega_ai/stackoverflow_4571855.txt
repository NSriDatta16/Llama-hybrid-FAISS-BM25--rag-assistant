To capture touches, you simply need to implement whichever of the following methods you require within a view controller - using a UIButton for this is (at best) somewhat perverse and will end up limiting the type of functionality you can provide. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event For more information on these events, see the UIResponder class reference . In terms of your second point - I've personally noticed a small "dead zone" towards the bottom of the display (the home button being the "bottom") - I think this is just the nature of the display, but I must confess I've never really looked into it in any detail.
