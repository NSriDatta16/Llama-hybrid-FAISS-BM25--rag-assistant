Override jQuery style value

To resolve a jQuery slideDown/Up problem, I had to change one line in the jQuery file. I changed line 5738 from this.elem.style.display = "block"; to this.elem.style.display = "inline-block"; The block attribute messed up my lists when using slideDown/Up/Toggle. slideDown changes my list from display:inline to display:block during execution, and then back to display: inline again. It would be much better if it was inline (or inline-block) all the way. Is there a way to override the value stated above from my html page, or do I have to stick with my modified jQuery file? It would be nice if I could override the style attribute only when I perform $('.gallery_container li:gt(4)').slideToggle(); Here's the code: http://90.230.237.71/gandhi.html
