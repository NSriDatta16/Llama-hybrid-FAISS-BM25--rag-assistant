Firstly, since Burst Timing (sec) is a numerical variable and Compression Test and Gel Fill are categorical (pass/fail), then Burst Timing as the dependent variable will need to be modelled by linear regression, and the latter two by logistic regression. If you already have data for Weld Temperature, Load Cell Temperature, and Enclose Temperature, then it makes little sense to also include the variables that are used to derive the former, i.e. Ambient Temperature, Chiller Temperature, etc. This will simply result in multicollinearity whereby the standard errors of these variables will be inflated, which in turn will affect the accuracy of significance tests. Modelling using multiple dependent variables (as you are proposing) is possible if all those variables can be suitably encapsulated into one. However, this would rely on sound judgement and thus it is highly recommended to firstly build three separate regressions before attempting to model in this way - particularly as one dependent variable is numerical while the other two are categorical.
