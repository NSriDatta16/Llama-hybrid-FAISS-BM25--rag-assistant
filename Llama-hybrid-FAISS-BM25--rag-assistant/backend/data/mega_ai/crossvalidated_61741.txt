The three formulas Three formulas for the kurtosis are generally used by different programs. I will state all three formulas ($g_{2}$, $G_{2}$ and $b_{2}$) and programs that use them. The first formula and the typical definition used in many textbooks is (this is the second formula in the link you've provided) $$ g_{2}=\frac{m_{4}}{m_{2}^{2}} $$ where $m_{r}$ denotes the sample moments : $$ m_{r}=\frac{1}{n}\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})^{r} $$ Sometimes, a correction term of -3 is added to this formula so that a normal distribution has a kurtosis of 0. The kurtosis formula with a term of -3 is called excess kurtosis (the first formula in the link you've provided). The second formula is (used by SAS, SPSS and MS Excel; this is the third formula in the link you've provided) $$ G_{2} = \frac{k_{4}}{k_{2}^{2}}= \frac{n-1}{(n-2)(n-3)}\left[(n+1)g_{2}+6\right] $$ where $g_{2}$ is the kurtosis as defined in the first formula. The third formula is (used by MINITAB and BMDP) $$ b_{2}=\frac{m_{4}}{s^{4}}-3=\left(\frac{n-1}{n}\right)^{2}\frac{m_{4}}{m_{2}^{2}}-3 $$ where $s^2$ is the unbiased sample variance : $$ s^2=\frac{1}{n-1}\sum(x_{i}-\bar{x})^2 $$ In R the kurtosis can be calculated using the kurtosis function from the e1071 package (link here ). The option type determines which one of the three formulas is used for the calculations (1=$g_{2}-3$, 2=$G_{2}$, 3=$b_{2}$). These two papers discuss and compare all three formulas: first , second . Summary of the differences between the formulas Using $g_{2}$, a normal distribution has a kurtosis value of 3 whereas in the formulas involving a correction term -3 (i.e. $G_{2}$ and $b_{2}$), a normal distribution has an excess kurtosis of 0. $G_{2}$ is the only formula yielding unbiased estimates for normal samples (i.e. the expectation of $G_{2}$ under normality is zero, or $\mathbb{E}(G_{2})=0$). For large samples, the difference between the formulas are negligible and the choice does not matter much. For small samples from a normal distribution, the relation of the three formulas in terms of the mean squared errors (MSE) is: $\operatorname{mse}(g_{2}) For small samples from non-normal distributions , the relation of the three formulas in terms of bias is: $\operatorname{bias}(G_{2}) For large samples ($n>200$) from non-normal distributions , the relation of the three formulas in terms of bias is: $\operatorname{bias}(G_{2}) See also the Wikipedia page and the MathWorld page about kurtosis.
