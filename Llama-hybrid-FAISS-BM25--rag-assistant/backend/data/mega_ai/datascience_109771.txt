Fraud detection with machine learning with partialy labeled data

I am facing difficulties handling an issue with my dataset. The purpose of my analysis is to find an electricity thief given a dataset. The first dataset: contains the list of all customers (unlabeled, because we don’t know who might be committing fraud). Besides some features, we have a determined amount of months of consummation (same length). The second dataset: consists of previously caught thieves. (Note: a fraudster can be caught many times) . ID F1 F2 January2020 February2020 …. December2022 1 52 … 45 85 ... 35 2 78 … 85 75 ... 39 … … … …. …. …. …. 484419 74 … 82 74 …… 87 ID month year 1 january 2020 2 February 2021 1 August 2021 … … … 464 apri2021 Problem: At the first hand I thought that the problem can be handled as a time series or sequence classification or anomaly classification. But then I realized that the dataset is unlabeled with only few people labeled as Fraudsters. Could anyone give me a suggestion about how to handle this issue and if possible some references where I can find some examples?
