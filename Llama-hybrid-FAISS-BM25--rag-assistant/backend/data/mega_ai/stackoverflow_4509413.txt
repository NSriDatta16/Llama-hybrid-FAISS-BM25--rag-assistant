I suggest you to start from handwritten digits recognition for the following reasons: The task is well-defined There's a very good database of handwritten digits mentioned above ( MNIST ) There're lots of implemented algorithms tested on this problem One of the most successful approach for this problem is convolutional neural networks which even were used in commercial applications. There're few implementations available including C++, CUDA, Matlab, Python. Unfortunately I don't know any Java implementations.
