One way to get an unbiased accuracy estimate is to combine your entire dataset, run random forest (incorporating bagging, as most algorithms do anyway), and report the random forest out-of-bag (OOB) accuracy (see oob_score_ if using sklearn) as an estimate of the true accuracy (as suggested by Breiman see sec 3.1 ) . You can do this so that your training set doesn't overlap with your testing set. This OOB can be used as an estimate of accuracy.
