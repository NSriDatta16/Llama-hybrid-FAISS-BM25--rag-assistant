You've dismissed writing an HttpHandler based on an assumption of pre-optimization. I would revisit this and definitely write a simple HttpHandler and test it out. You might find that your Page method solution might even be slower, especially if you get the ASP preprocessor involved. HttpHandlers are pretty close to the metal - it's a miniscule amount of overhead for IIS to hand the request to ASP.Net. It would be a more elegant solution than what you're proposing, and probably more scalable and I'm willing to bet - faster.
