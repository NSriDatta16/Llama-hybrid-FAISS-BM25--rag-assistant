This sounds very dodgy to me. You would have to: Have a high enough resolution such that optimization of the gif doesn't cause you to loose accuracy You would have to use edge and corner detection to re-plot the time series / line from the gif. This is inherently inaccurate You would have to now relative price/time for the gif dimensions. If this changes between gifs then forget it. Reading the values on the side/bottom would be a nightmare. In short, find another source of data would be my recommendation. Image analysis on a gif to produce financial information isn't exactly a FIX update
