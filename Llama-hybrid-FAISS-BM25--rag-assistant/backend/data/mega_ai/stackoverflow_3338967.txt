Hiding the keyboard when UITextField loses focus

I've seen some threads about how to dismiss the Keyboard when a UITextField loses focus, but it did not work for me and I don't know how. The "touchesBegan:withEvent:" in the following code, never gets called. Why? - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [[event allTouches] anyObject]; if ([self.textFieldOnFocus isFirstResponder] && [touch view] != self.textFieldOnFocus) { [textFieldOnFocus resignFirstResponder]; } [super touchesBegan:touches withEvent:event]; } P.S.: This code has been inserted in the view controller which has a UITableView. The UITextField is in a cell from this table. So, my opinion is: this method is not being called, cause the touch occurs on the UITableView from my ViewController. So, I think, that to I should have to subclass the UITableView, to use this method as I have seen on other Threads, but it may have a easier way. Could you please help me? Thanks a lot!
