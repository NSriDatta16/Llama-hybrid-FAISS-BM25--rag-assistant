How many sides and what are the probabilities of each side for an unfair die?

Problem I would like to run an inference that predicts from a series of die rolls, how many sides the die has, and what is the probability of landing on each side. Example For example, imagine a die has a finite $N$ number of sides with arbitrary labels with corresponding probabilities $P=\{p_1,...,p_N\}$ which are not necessarily equal. For a limited number of rolls, you would only be able to see $M\leq N$ number of sides with corresponding occurrences $Y=\{y_1,...,y_M\}$ . The goal is to then to infer $N$ and $P$ from the observation. Initial thoughts My first guess was to model the observations with a multinomial distribution using an MCMC calculate the posterior on both $N$ and $P$ , putting a prior on $N$ following part II of this question . It's not particularly clear to me how to then measure $P$ using an MCMC (or alternative method) as the number of parameters changes. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
