This is an optimisation problem, not so much a statistical problem. in R you can use the package lpSolve or lpSolveAPI. Also have a look at the optimization task view on CRAN. But if you are not stuck on R, you could use the solver in Excel or in libreoffice. For reasonable amounts of data these are quicker to set up and work really fast. If you need more speed in excel, then you can also use opensolver. Looking at the time series data you have, I would just look to bring this back to hours. There is no point in optimizing per second or even minute. But I might be mistaken in that. I don't know enough about your data and needs.
