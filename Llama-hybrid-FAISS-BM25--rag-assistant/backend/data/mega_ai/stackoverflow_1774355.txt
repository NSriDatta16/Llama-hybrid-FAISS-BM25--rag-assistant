as3 rotational drag / acceleration

Sprite.rotation+=10; Sprite.rotation*=0.97; because in as3 the system goes from 180 to -180 I don't know how to apply a drag to a constantly rotating object if it moves either direction. Do I have to convert to radians somehow and then do something? I am pretty bad with math.
