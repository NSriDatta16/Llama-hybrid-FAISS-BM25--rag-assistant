Differences between cumulative link models (ordinal) and multinom (nnet) for fitting multinomial data

I'm trying to understand cumulative link models and how they differ from multinom models in R. Here's a simple example of a multinom model and plot output using the nnet package: library(ordinal) library(nnet) library(sjPlot) hous1.mu The ' ordinal ' package in R states on page 17: It is possible to fit multinomial models (i.e. with nominal effects) as the following example shows: But, when I use the example code, the plot fits look wildly different than the multinom output: hous1.clm Even though the likelihood between the two models is the same: all.equal(logLik(hous1.mu), logLik(hous1.clm)) Can anyone point me in the right direction as to what clm models are doing in this instance? My reading of the ordinal package is that I can use clm with a nominal variable, but this gives a different plot fit. Ultimately I would like to use clmm to model a nominal variable with random effects as: i) there's no straightforward way of doing this other than MCMCglmm, and ii) ordinal plays nicely with sjPlot, but... I'd first like to understand why clmm differs from multinom.
