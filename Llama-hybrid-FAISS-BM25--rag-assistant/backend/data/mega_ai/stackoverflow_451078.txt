Generating a lot of static html

I have a process that will need to generate a lot of static html from a set of data. The html is relatively complex and I want the maintenance to be fairly simple so I don't want to embed much if any html in program code. At my company the blessed tool set is .net or php. My initial thought was to embed the asp.net compiler into the batch program and feed a generated page object the data it would need before rendering. The rendered output along with data would then be saved to disk. Does this sound feasible and should it be done? Another suggestion was to write a batch php script that wrote its output to the files. This sounds simpler but the skill set of the developers that will maintain the program aren't so strong in php. What other more simpler and elegant ways are there to render a reasonable amount of somewhat complicated html ahead of time?
