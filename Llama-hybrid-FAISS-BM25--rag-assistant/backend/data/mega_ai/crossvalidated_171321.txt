As an addition to @DavidArenburg 's great answer I'll show you the difference in outputs between regression and classification trees library(partykit) # data airquality = data.frame(airquality) # create a numeric binary variable as dependent variable airquality$OzoneClass = 0 airquality$OzoneClass[airquality$Ozone>=34] =1 # regression tree with scale dependent variable airq 77: 0.519 (n = 27, err = 6.7) # | [5] Temp > 82: 0.973 (n = 37, err = 1.0) # # Number of inner nodes: 2 # Number of terminal nodes: 3 # create a categorical binary variable as dependent variable airquality$OzoneClass = 0 airquality$OzoneClass[airquality$Ozone>=34] =1 airquality$OzoneClass = as.factor(airquality$OzoneClass) # classification tree airq 77: 1 (n = 27, err = 48.1%) # | [5] Temp > 82: 1 (n = 37, err = 2.7%) # # Number of inner nodes: 2 # Number of terminal nodes: 3 Note how (a) the values of the trees change from an average value of 0s and 1s (regression tree) to the most likely class 0/1 (classification tree) and (b) the err values from a number (error) become a percentage (missclassification).
