Custom paging algorithm to calculate pages to display

I'm working on a custom data pager for a custom google maps control. The control needs to work out what range of pages to display. For example, if the user is on page 6 then the control must display pages 1 through to 10. If the user is on page 37, then the control must display pages 30 throught to 40. The variables I have available are: X - Total results (points on the map) Y - The current page size. i.e. the amount of points per page. Z - The current page being displayed Q - The number of page numbers to display (a const of 10) I have come up with: Starting Index = Z - ( Z % Q ) Ending Index = Z - ( Z % Q ) + Q This, however, doesn't work for when the current page is less than 10. It also doesn't figure out whether there is a max page reached, i.e. we always display a full range of 10. However, if we display the range 30-40 the final page could actually be 38. If anyone can come up with a more elegant algorithm it would be appreciated.
