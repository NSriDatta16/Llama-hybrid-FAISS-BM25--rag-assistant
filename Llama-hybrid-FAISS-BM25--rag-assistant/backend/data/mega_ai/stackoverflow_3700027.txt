What is the best way to organise a project for URLs?

I am working on a web portal (PHP/MYSQL) which have 3 sections photos, videos, articles. Each section has its own submission form using which user will submit photos, videos or articles corresponding to their accounts. So, that URLS which I thought should be like http://example.com/ http://example.com/about/ http://example.com/contact/ http://example.com/help/ http://example.com/photos/ http://example.com/photos/browse/ http://example.com/photos/submit/ http://example.com/photos/edit/ etc. Same as for videos and articles sections. Now I am confused here to what to use. Should I use .htaccess to create such type of URLs? Or I should use folders with index.php in it for /photos/ or /photos/browse/ like this. All folders will have index.php so they will be accessed by folder names and URL will look like this http://example.com/photos/browse/ Or I should go traditionally and use photos.php and browse-photos.php . But this method not looks good and organized. I can achieve this by htaccess easily but some peoples says that it will slow down your site, because it will process htaccess every time a URL will be requested. I have one more question, how the sites like digg, flickr does this URL formation. These are pretty big site with millions of page-views a day, so are they not using htaccess? Please guide me! Thanks.
