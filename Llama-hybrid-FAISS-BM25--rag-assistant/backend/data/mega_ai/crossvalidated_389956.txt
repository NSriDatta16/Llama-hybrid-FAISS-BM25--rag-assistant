1) some useful models cannot be naturally represented as a Bayesian Network, for instance the two classes of probabilities(regularity and special symmetric ones) that don't have any P-Map. Directed models can be simplified based on undirected models(more flexibility in the model parameters). 2) A factor describes the "compatabilities" between different values of the variables in its scope.
