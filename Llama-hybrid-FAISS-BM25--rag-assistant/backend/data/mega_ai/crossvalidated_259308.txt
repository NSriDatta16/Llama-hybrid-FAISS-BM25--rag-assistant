How can I make a mean sequential estimation?

I am an agronomist trying to estimate the average weight of fruit in a orchard. My first option is to grab 1000 fruit and get their weight mean. But as you can see, if i can get this with less fruits, I will save time (and fruits). Is there any way to get a stopping rule based on the prior update (every time that I record a new single fruit weight)? Thank you
