I would assume that in normal text, tabs are very rare except as the first character(s) on a line -- think indented paragraphs or source code. I think if you find embedded tabs (i.e. ones that don't follow commas), you can assume that the tabs are being used as the delimiters and be correct most of the time. This is just a hunch, not verified with any research. I'd of course give the user the option to override the auto-calculated mode.
