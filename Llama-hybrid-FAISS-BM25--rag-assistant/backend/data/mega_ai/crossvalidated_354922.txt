Try using an xts() object to deal with the data. You can merge the different time series, regardless of the mismatching times/dates. Then, you can use na.locf() to roll-forward (not interpolate) the quarterly values down to a daily granularity, while also taking care of any pesky #N/A values in your dataset. This way, you have daily values for the quarterly data, which are simply the most-recently-reported values. Then, you can use standard lm() to run a regression directly on the xts object. Quite handy, actually.
