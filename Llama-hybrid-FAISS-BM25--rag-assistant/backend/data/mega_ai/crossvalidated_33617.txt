You normally apply the MA filter in the border by extending the time series (extrapolating), ie, creating some "phantom" values; but there are lots of ways of doing that. In our case, for $n=3$, we'd compute $\bar{y_1} = \frac{1}{3}(y_0 + y_1+y_2)$ and equating that with the given formula, we deduce the value of $y_0$ that has been used: $$\frac{1}{3}(y_0 + y_1+y_2) = \frac{1}{3}(\frac{5}{2}y_1 + y_2 - \frac{1}{2} y_3) \Rightarrow y_0 = y_1 - \frac{y_3 - y_1}{2}$$ which makes sense (it can be interpreted as $y_1$ minus an estimate of the derivative), but there could be other alternatives. Analogously, for $n=5$ we have $y_{-1} + y_0 + y_1 + y_2 + y_3 = 3 y_1 + 2 y_2 + y_3 - y_4$ and $y_0 + y_1 + y_2 + y_3 + y_4 = 2 y_1 + \frac{3}{2} y_2 + y_3 - \frac{1}{2}y_4$ Solving this we get $y_0 = y_1 - \frac{y_4-y_2}{2}$ $y_{-1}= y_0$ From this we could guess a general formula
