Determining how long a touch has been stationary

I'm trying to introduce a delay between a "touch began" event and an action such as playing a sound. After the threshold has passed, if the user's finger stays relatively stationary, then I hope to increase the volume gradually until the finger is lifted or dragged out of the rectangular area of effect. If it drags out I might play a different sound. I'm starting off with the delay but I don't know how to determine the length of time a finger is held in a position.
