This is more of a semantic than a statistical question. But based on wikidiff we can say that talking about a coin flip: The odds for each outcome are 50/50 whereas the likelihood of getting tails is 50%. That is odds are the ratios of all outcomes and likelihood is the probability of a given outcome. Your sentence: "In logistic regression, we use odds to convert a probability-based model to a likelihood-based model." does not make sense to me. Can you give a source and context for this statement?
