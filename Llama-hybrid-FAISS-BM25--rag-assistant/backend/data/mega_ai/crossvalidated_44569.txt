Logistic vs linear regression

Let's say I run a linear regression model with a binary dependent variable. If I ran logistic regression on the same data would the results be comparable or exactly similar? By results I mean both the beta values and the value of dependent variable. If not why? Also what can I say about linear regression being a subset of Logistic regression or vice versa?
