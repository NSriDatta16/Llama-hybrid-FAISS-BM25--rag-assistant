Whether or not you should split them up into different exceptions probably depends most on whether or not you think it is likely that anyone will ever want to distinguish the two exceptions in different catch blocks. Not knowing exactly how this will be used, this seems like the kind of error that should be brought to the developer's attention, where rewriting code to point to the correct file or implement the correct interface is the proper action, rather than implementing a try-catch and give the user friendly error messages. As such, I'd just throw an ArgumentException .
