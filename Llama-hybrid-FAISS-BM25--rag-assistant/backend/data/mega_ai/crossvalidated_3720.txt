The Arellano-Bond estimator has been designed for precisely this type of problems. You will find a short non-technical paper with a examples here . In a nutshell, it combines the information embedded in the large number of cross-section to make up for the small number of points in each series. This estimator is widely used and implemented: it is avalaible in the default gretl package , but also in stata via the XTABOND2 package and in R too, via the plm package (you should easily find a large number of paper using it). EDIT: Given that spatial correlation may indeed be informative (see Andy's post), i would advice to add a variable: $s_{it} = u_{it} - \bar{u}_{-it}$ where $u_{it}$ is (eventually the $\log()$ of) the unemployment rate of region $i$ at time $t$ and $\bar{u}_{-it}$ its average value among $k$ geographical neighbors of region $i$ (excluding region $i$). I would advise trying different values of $k$ until small changes in $k$ do not affect the estimation end-result/conclusions. Then, for efficient and consistent estimation of $\beta_s$ (the coefficient associated with the variable $s$) i would use OLS for the main effect and allow for a random component to the error terms to account for inter-regional heterogenity in $\beta_s$; thereby leveraging the fact that the R package plm allows to combine gmm (i.e. Arellano-Bond) and random effect coefficients. Concerning Andy W's remark: you could read these two documents for a non technical summary. The full paper version is here . Note the reliance on both a large number of cross section and time dimension. PS: Thanks @Srikant. I think i get it now :)
