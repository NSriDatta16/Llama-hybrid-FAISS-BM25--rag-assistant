Regularization is used to reduce variance in the model in order to avoid overfitting. If you do not use regularization, your coefficients will take extreme values in order to perfectly fit your datapoints, but will completely fail to make accurate predictions for new data. I believe that is why you want your coefficients to take more moderate values. I am fairly new to machine learning, but I have these two references from when I started learning:^ https://towardsdatascience.com/regularization-an-important-concept-in-machine-learning-5891628907ea https://towardsdatascience.com/regularization-in-machine-learning-76441ddcf99a Hope it helped!
