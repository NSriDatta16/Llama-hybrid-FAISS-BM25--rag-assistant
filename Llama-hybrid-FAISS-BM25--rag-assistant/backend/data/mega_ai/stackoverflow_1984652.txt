I'm not sure if this is excactly what you are looking for but seeing as there aren't too many answers to your question I'll throw it out there. Ragel is a finite state machine compiler which will output C/C++/Java and more. It's not visual per se (you can't design the state machine graphically, you use code) but it is able to use GraphViz to visualise the state machine.
