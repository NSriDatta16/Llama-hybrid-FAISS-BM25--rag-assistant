Please don't take offense to this, but to preface your question by explaining your unfamiliarity with web programming, and then criticize the performance of what appears to you to be a 'simple' operation is a bit short-sighted. I would encourage you to learn a bit more about the common problems a CMS solves, and the general theory and practice of how dynamic web pages and HTTP work. It's far from a simple I/O operation. Also, for practical use, I would highly encourage anyone running a CMS to find a caching solution. Caching is intended to solve a lot of the 'speed' problems that arise in web technology. It should be part of any common web stack.
