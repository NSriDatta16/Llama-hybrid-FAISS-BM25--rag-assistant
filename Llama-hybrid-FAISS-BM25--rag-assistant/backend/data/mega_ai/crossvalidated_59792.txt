Part Four of Damodar Gujarati and Dawn Porter's Basic Econometrics (5th ed) contains five chapters on time-series econometrics - a very popular book! It contains lots of exercises, regression outputs, interpretations, and best of all, you can download the data from the book's website and replicate the results for yourself. Another good book is Stock and Watson's Introduction to Econometrics . Starting with Hamilton was admirable, but I'd say read through both of the time-series sections in the two books that I just mentioned and then move on to something like Walter Enders' Applied Econometric Time Series or Terrence C Mill's The Modelling of Financial Time Series . After this (and probably after some review of mathematical economics) then you should be able to sit down and read Hamilton comfortably. Note: Box & Jenkins' 1970 classic Time series analysis: Forecasting and control is obviously more concentrated (i.e. narrower in content) than the "modern textbooks" that I mentioned, but I'd say that anyone who wants to get a real good understanding of time-series shouldn't leave this off their reading list.
