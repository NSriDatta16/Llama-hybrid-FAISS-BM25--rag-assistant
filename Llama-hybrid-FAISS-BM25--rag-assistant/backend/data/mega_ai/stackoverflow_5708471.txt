UIWebView only calls didFailLoadWithError once

I have a native iPhone app that just loads a website using UIWebView . I implemented the UIWebViewDelegate function didFailLoadWithError to display an error message when the user attempts to use the app without an Internet connection. The alert box shows up the first time I build and run the app, but does not appear thereafter. If I click the home button, then tap my app again, I just see a blank UIWebView. It's as if it's not trying to load the page again, so it never triggers didFailLoadWithError . This is just a simple app without saving and reloading of state, so shouldn't reloading the app re-run all my code, including the attempted loading of the website? - (void)viewDidLoad { NSString* urlString = [NSString stringWithString:@"http://www.site.com"]; NSURL* url = [NSURL URLWithString:urlString]; NSURLRequest* request = [NSURLRequest requestWithURL:url]; [self.webView loadRequest:request]; [super viewDidLoad]; } #pragma mark UIWebView delegate - (void)webView:(UIWebView *)webView didFailLoadWithError:(NSError *)error { //[myActivityIndicatorView stopAnimating]; NSLog([NSString stringWithFormat: @"%d", [error code]]); if ([error code] != USER_STOPPED_LOAD) { UIAlertView *alert = [[UIAlertView alloc] initWithTitle:@"Connection Error!" message:@"You must be connected to the Internet to use Site." delegate:nil cancelButtonTitle:@"OK" otherButtonTitles: nil]; [alert show]; [alert release]; } }
