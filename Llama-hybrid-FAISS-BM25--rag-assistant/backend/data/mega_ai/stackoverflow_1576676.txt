If you have two text boxes labelled hours and minutes then you need to deal with case where the user types into both of them. 3 into h and 35 into m => pretty clear. 3 hours 35 mins nothing into h and 95 into m => 1 hour 35 mins (probably update the display to show that) but what about 2 into h and then 95 into m => does that mean 3 h 35 or 1 hour 35 I've used too many annoying UIs where changing a field zaps other entries to be confident that I can devise an unastonishing set of behaviours. Hence I would go for a single box into which we can type 3h or 1h 35m or 95m and have a separate read-only display of the interpretation. There seems to be an opportunity for a nice widget to allow a mouse driven entry, in the same way as a calendar widget allows date entry. A little clock with dragable hands?
