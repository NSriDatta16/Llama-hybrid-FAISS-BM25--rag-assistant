Neural Networks is the algorithm that tries to mimic the brain. It is designed similar to neurons of the brain(neurons are the cells in the brain). Each neurons in the brain act as a computational unit which receives input through input wires, then performs computation and output them through output wire. Neural Networks have different layers namely input layer, hidden layer and output layer. Input layer is where we pass out input such as features of the example. Hidden layers are used to extract the implicit information of the features (i.e) the input and calculate the activation values. It is difficult to say what exactly each hidden layer is doing. Whenever we train the neural network, all its learning are stored in the weights(also called parameters). So after training whenever we use a test set, it will predict as it has previously learned all stored all its learning in the weights. (Weights are calculated by back-propagation)
