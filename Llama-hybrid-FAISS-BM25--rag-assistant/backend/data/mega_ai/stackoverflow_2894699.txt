What is the best way to organize directories within a large grails application?

What is the best way to organize directories within a large grails application? In a typical Spring application, we'd have myproject/domain/ and myproject/web/controllers and myproject/services Since grails puts these artifacts in their own directories... and then just uses the same base project package for everything, what is the best practice? Use the same sub package name for domain objects, controllers, services too? Ken
