jquery resizable cursor help

I have setup a div that is resizable: $("mydiv").resizable(); Now when you go to resize it to the right the cursor goes off the the actual resize part. So if the cursor hits the side of the screen you have to let go of the mouse and go back and start resizing it again if you want to make it bigger. I know that with the draggable's there is an option for cursorAt that will tell the cursor to stay on that div. I looked at jquery ui.com but didnt see a cursorAt for the resizable. Is there a way to keep the mouse cursor on the resizable part while resizing?
