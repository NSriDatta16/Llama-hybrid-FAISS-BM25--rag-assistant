Clustering communication patterns to detect multiple identities

I have a data set of communication patterns between chatting agents. Each agent can have multiple profiles or identities. I am interested in developing a way to investigate the similarity between various profiles. The problem is that there is no real indicator whether two profiles belong to the same agent. The set of features describes the frequency of messages through the hours of the day, days of the week, months, and years. The aim is to learn the significant features that indicate similar profiles that belong to one agent. The proposed approach: considering each data item to be the communication pattern of one agent over a year. This way, the data set would have many data items that represent the communication patterns of the same agent across different years. We apply clustering with a number of clusters equal to the number of agents--not profiles. Ideally, if the clustering algorithm clusters the data points that belong to one agent in one cluster then we have a features model that we could use to detect profiles of the same agent. Of course this proposal assumes that the agent would have the same pattern in the different profiles, which is not expected to be the case. But among the data set of the all agents, this way may give a correct prediction with a certain level of accuracy. Does this approach sound reasonable? Is there a better way to tackle this issue? Thank you!
