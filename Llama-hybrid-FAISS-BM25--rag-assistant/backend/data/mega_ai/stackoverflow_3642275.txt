File based storage system

Anyone know of a commercially available file based storage system that meets the following requirements: Should not require installation Should provide APIs to read and write onto the storage system, preferably .net APIs Paid/Free (either way it should be supported) Should be fast and efficient Basically I am looking for something with database like functionality with the least footprint.
