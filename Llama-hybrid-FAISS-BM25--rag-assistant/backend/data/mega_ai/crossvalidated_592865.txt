Prooving the convergence rate of noisy estimators (machine Learning)

I want to estimate a quantity and have two choices for estimators (they both sample from the same distribution). I suspect one of them is nosier and has a slower convergence rate. I want to mathematically proove this, but I don't know where to start. Is there standard reference in statistics that I can consult for example proofs of convergence rates in ML/statistics?
