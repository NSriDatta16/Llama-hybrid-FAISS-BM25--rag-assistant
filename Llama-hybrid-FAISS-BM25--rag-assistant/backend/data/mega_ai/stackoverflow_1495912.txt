Also, make sure that you are not running out of memory during your tests. Run perfmon and monitor Memory > Available Bytes and PhysicalDisk > Disk Read Bytes/sec for the physical drive you are reading. Monitoring process' I/O is a good idea too. Keep in mind that the latter combines all I/O (network included). You should expect 50 MB/s for sequential reads from a single average SATA drive. A couple of good striped serial SCSI drive will give you about 220 MB/s. If you are seeing available memory going to near zero, that would be your problem. If it stays flat after you did the first round of reading than it has something to do with your app.
