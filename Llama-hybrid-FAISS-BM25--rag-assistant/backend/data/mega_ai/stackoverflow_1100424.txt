There are a few ways to echo HTML in PHP. 1. In between PHP tags 2. In an echo if(condition){ echo "HTML here"; } With echos, if you wish to use double quotes in your HTML you must use single quote echos like so: echo ' '; Or you can escape them like so: echo " "; 3. Heredocs 4. Nowdocs (as of PHP 5.3.0) Template engines are used for using PHP in documents that contain mostly HTML. In fact, PHP's original purpose was to be a templating language. That's why with PHP you can use things like short tags to echo variables (e.g. ). There are other template engines (such as Smarty, Twig, etc.) that make the syntax even more concise (e.g. {{someVariable}} ). The primary benefit of using a template engine is keeping the design ( presentation logic ) separate from the coding ( business logic ). It also makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain in the long run. If you have any more questions feel free to leave a comment. Further reading is available on these things in the PHP documentation . NOTE: PHP short tags and ?> are discouraged because they are only available if enabled with short_open_tag php.ini configuration file directive, or if PHP was configured with the --enable-short-tags option. They are available, regardless of settings from 5.4 onwards .
