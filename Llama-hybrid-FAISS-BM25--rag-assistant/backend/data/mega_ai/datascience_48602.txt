Efficient self study plan

I am hoping for a bit of guidance from experienced practitioners / academics. I want to work through the Bishop ML book, but have minimal background. What is the fastest way to get the pre-requisites (specific books would be appreciated)? From searching around I found this potential self-study path: Statistical Inference - Casella / Berger Probability Theory and Examples - Durrett Linear Algebra - Hoffman / Kunze I checked these books out from the library, but they will take me over a year to work through thoroughly, so it does not seem to be practical. I have searched around on the internet, but most of the advice doesn't list any specific books, just what subjects I should learn. About me Graduated in an unrelated discipline many years ago Willing to dedicate many hours to this (I am doing this to build a background for a degree in machine learning) I can code pretty well due to my job
