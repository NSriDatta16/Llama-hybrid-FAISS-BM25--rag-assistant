If the custom scripts don't get more complex than the ones that you show above, I would agree with Sylvestre: Create your own parser, make a tree and do the logic yourself. You can generate a .Net expression tree or just go through the Syntax tree yourself and make the operations within your own code (Antlr below will help you generate such code). Then you are in complete control of your references, you are always within C#, so you don't need to worry about memory management (any more than you would normally do) etc. IMO Antlr is the best tool for doing this in C# . You get examples from the site for little languages, like your scenario. But... if this is really just a beginning and at the end you need almost full power of a proper scripting language, you would need to go into embedding a scripting language to your system. With your numbers, you will have a problem with performance, memory management and probably references as you noted. There are several approaches, but I cannot really give one recommendation for your scenario: I've never done it in such a scale.
