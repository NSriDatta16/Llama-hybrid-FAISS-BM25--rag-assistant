This is a bit of a cop-out, but do you really want to chop up a paragraph? Wouldn't it improve readability to simply break at the first that wanders off viewport? Ok, so just to be clear, it sounds like you are testing the position of a span which is moved character by character through a text? If that is correct, and the issue you have is with breaking up words, why don't you simply jump from white space to white space (optionally including hyphens) rather than from character to character? Keep 1 previous location and break at it when the current one is off viewport. I guess before too much else is done, are we sure that we can't make that span truly dimensionless? span.marker { border: 0px; padding: 0px; margin: 0px; width:0px: overflow:hidden; height:0px; }
