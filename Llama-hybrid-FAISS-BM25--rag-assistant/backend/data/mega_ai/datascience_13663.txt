Neural Networks - Loss and Accuracy correlation

I'm a bit confused by the coexistence of Loss and Accuracy metrics in Neural Networks. Both are supposed to render the "exactness" of the comparison of $y$ and $\hat{y}$ , aren't they? So isn't the application of the two redundant in the training epochs? Moreover, why aren't they correlate?
