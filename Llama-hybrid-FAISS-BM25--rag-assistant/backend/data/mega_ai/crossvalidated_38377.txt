Technically speaking, the classical statistics (the one which talks about significance, as opposed to e.g. Bayesian Statistics) requires the populations to be infinite regardless it may or may not make sense in the real world. In your case, (whether you take bootstrap or straightforward approach) you are in fact taking into consideration infinite number of parallel realizations of your company based upon eighter normal model or the explicit bootstrap realizations. The significance tells you, that among this population a given relationship exists (with the given type I error). It is a leap of thought, the one that is commonly done in this field. [See: e.g. Bostad W.M. - Introduction to Bayesian statistics (2007), p. 5] On a side, note that any classical statistical test assumes also that the variables come from i.i.d. distributions (independent and identically distributed). This may be problem in organization where exist many interpersonal mechanisms and interactions which effectively change (may it be unify or diversify) the way people answer your question(aire). So you should be aware, that however small, your sample may still be overreplicated.
