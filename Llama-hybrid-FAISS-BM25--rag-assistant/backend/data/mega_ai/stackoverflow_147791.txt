If you match all whitespaces the similarity is better: difflib.SequenceMatcher(lambda x: x in " \t\n", doc1, doc2).ratio() However, difflib is not ideal to such a problem because these are two nearly identical documents, but typos and such produce differences for difflib where a human wouldn't see many. Try reading up on tf-idf , Bayesian probability , Vector space Models and w-shingling I have written a an implementation of tf-idf applying it to a vector space and using the dot product as a distance measure to classify documents.
