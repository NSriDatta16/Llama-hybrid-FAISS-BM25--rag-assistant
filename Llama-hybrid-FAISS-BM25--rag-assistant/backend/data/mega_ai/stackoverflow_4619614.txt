I am currently on Windows, so I am not 100% sure if this is going to work on Unix, but it should give you an idea: In a directory that is pointed at by the %PATH% environment variable, I created the file sqlplus_edit.bat with the following content: vi.exe c:\path\to\Jagan\Documents\PLSQL\%1 Then, in SQL*Plus : define _editor=sqlplus_edit This worked for me.
