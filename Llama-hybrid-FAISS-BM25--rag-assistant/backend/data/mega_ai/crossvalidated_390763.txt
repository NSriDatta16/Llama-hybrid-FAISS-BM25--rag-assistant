I cannot comment. Hence posting as an answer. If you are not using Deep Learning, Is it mandatory for you to use overlapping sliding window? This technique is generally used in Deep Learning Sequence models where you convert your time series data into 'n' small sequences making them as 'n' training examples. For standard Time series solution using ARIMA, you can use Tim's method.
