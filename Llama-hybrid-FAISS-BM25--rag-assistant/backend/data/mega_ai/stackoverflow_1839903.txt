As an alternative to astander's (good) solution: SELECT agent, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM myTable WHERE agent = t.agent AND status = 'Mail Sent') Mail_Count, (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM myTable WHERE agent = t.agent AND status = 'Fax Sent') Fax_Count FROM myTable t GROUP BY agent Depending on the distribution of your data, performance might be better than his solution (no SUM over a calculated field) or worse (sub-selects) or equal (if the query analyzer finds the optimal execution plan in both cases).
