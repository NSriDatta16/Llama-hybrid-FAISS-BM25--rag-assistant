Android, GUI design w/ Eclipse, Layout->View->Layout

I'm trying to find my way into Android development. I'm using Eclipse Helios. The GUI design software seems to make it impossible to design certain element hierarchies. For example: I have not been able to design this structure in the GUI designer. I drag a LinearLayout to the design frame, drag a ScrollView over it, then drag a LinearLayout on top. Always, this will be inserted as a child of the first LinearLayout, not of the ScrollView. However, in this example for ScrollViews, this seems to be right. Am I doing something wrong? How would I design this structure using the GUI designer? Or is this only possible by direct XML manipulation? Thanks.
