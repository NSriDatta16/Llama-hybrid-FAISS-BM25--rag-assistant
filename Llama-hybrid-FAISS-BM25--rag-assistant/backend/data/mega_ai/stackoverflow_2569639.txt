There is definitely no way to programmatically switch your Bluetooth on and off in Java ME. However what may be useful is to switch between discoverable modes: LocalDevice.getLocalDevice().setDiscoverable(DiscoveryAgent.GIAC); to be discoverable, and LocalDevice.getLocalDevice().setDiscoverable(DiscoveryAgent.NOT_DISCOVERABLE); to hide from other devices. It doesn't save battery, but it does make things that little bit more secure I guess.
