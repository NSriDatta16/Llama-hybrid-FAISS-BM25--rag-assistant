A with statement brings the given object's members into scope, so you can mention its fields, methods, and properties without having to qualify them with the name of the object they belong to. Please see With Statements in the documentation. One thing that's valid to put in a with statement is an object that was just newly created. That's the case here. The code creates a new TQuery object and immediately uses all its members implicitly. The reference to that object is not stored in any local variable, so there's no explicitly way to refer to it, but that doesn't bother the compiler. (It can bother humans, though, which is one of the reasons you'll see for people to discourage use of with in Delphi.) Identifiers that don't belong to the given object are searched for in the next surrounding scope instead. It looks like the only identifier from TQuery being used in that with block is Eof , so the code you're converting is probably wrong anyway. It might be better to just figure out what the code was supposed to be doing, and then write new ADO code for that.
