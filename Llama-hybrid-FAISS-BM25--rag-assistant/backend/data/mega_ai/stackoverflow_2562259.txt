You want Gearman - it'll queue the requests and insert them as and when the database is ready for them, so you don't overload your DB server. Gearman provides a generic application framework to farm out work to other machines or processes that are better suited to do the work. It allows you to do work in parallel, to load balance processing, and to call functions between languages. It can be used in a variety of applications, from high-availability web sites to the transport of database replication events. In other words, it is the nervous system for how distributed processing communicates. A few strong points about Gearman: There's a recent (and quality) post about using databases for logging here , which (summarised) says: Use MyISAM with concurrent inserts Rotate tables daily and use UNION to query Use delayed inserts with MySQL or a job processing agent like Gearman (although MySQL has a limit on the number of these it will queue before silently dropping them!) HighScalability write up on Gearman . If you really want to avoid this, you could write the raw SQL statements to a file and process them with this cronjob: mysql loggingDB logTable fullLog.sql
