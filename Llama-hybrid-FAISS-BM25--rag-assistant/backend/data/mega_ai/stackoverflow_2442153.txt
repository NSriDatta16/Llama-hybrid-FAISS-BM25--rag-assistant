Adding custom tags in Wordpress

I'm creating a new WP theme and I would like to allow the user to insert a divider in between paragraphs or images he/she is entering, for a post/page. I want the output to be something like: But I don't want the user to have to enter HTML in the WYSIWYG editor. Is it possible to ask them to enter something like: and then translate that to the div markup on display? Thanks.
