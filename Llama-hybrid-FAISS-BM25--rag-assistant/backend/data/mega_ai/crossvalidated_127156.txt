Can a Moving Average be used as a dependent variable in a regression model?

I have a time series I want to use as a response in a regression model. The problem is that I suspect that the changes in this variable could be due to sampling error. As a result, I created a moving average of this time series in order to smoothed out the shocks. I am now considering using this as the response in my regression model and not the original series. Note: I am not constructing an ARMA type model. My predictors are also time series such as media spend and consumer confidence scores.
