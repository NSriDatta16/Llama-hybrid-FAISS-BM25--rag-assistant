The advantages of the provider model are outlined here , but in brief: Certain out-of-the-box webcontrols are built to use the membership provider model, such as the Login control/view and the Create User Wizard. So you miss out on a 1-step configuration for having a logged-in dashboard for all your pages without writing any code. Providers can be swapped with a simple change in the web.config file. Not saying you can't write your own login stuff to do the same, but you can easily write a custom provider at some point down the road and switch it into your application without changing a thing in the application. All the basics are provided. The default membership providers have password retrieval, account locking, multiple password encryption methods, valid password restriction rule configuration and user management, all out of the box. Just using that alone is a huge reduction in setup time for most people starting an ASP.Net application from scratch. A large component of your application is already vetted. You don't need to worry about debugging all your own authentication code! This means that when there are bugs, you often get fixes before site breaks, and you have the ability to pass the blame if not.
