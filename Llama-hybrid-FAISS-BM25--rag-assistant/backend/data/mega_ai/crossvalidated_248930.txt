How to spot the difference between an MA and AR model from the plotted time series

If I have given two time series, an MA and an AR how can I determine who is who? I know how to do it with a correlogram, i know that if the autocorrelation goes straight to zero after q lags it is a MA, and if it goes exponentially against zero it is a AR. See example http://www.diskusjon.no/uploads/monthly_11_2016/post-122992-0-13646900-1480525320.png
