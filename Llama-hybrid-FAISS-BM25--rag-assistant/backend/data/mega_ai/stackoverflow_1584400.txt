Since the URL appears to be manipulated, it looks like it is a bug in a proxy software. Maybe you can find patterns in the requesting IP Ranges to identify certain proxies or ISPs. However, that does not really explain the constant IE6 UserAgent (unless the proxy screws that up too). It could be one of the many IE bugs (e.g. gzip issues, Missing 4k Bug, etc.) but those usually break much more than just lowercasing an URL and remove one character. You could temporarily turn off gzip to see if it has any effect. Here is a question with similar symptoms and my answer includes links to some of the IE bugs.
