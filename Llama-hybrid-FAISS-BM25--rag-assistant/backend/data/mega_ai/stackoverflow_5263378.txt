If you're doing greenfield application development I would probably suggest WPF to WinForms. Pros: Less code and better separation : with WPF supporting bindings instead of having to write the app following the MVC pattern with the Controller layer being thick, you can create it following the MVVM pattern, having a relatively lightweight ViewModel Easy to reuse almost all of the code you write and port to Silverlight or Windows Phone 7 later down the way. Porting Windows Forms code to the web or mobile is much more painful More charting libraries actively developed for WPF: there are a handful of vendors providing and constantly updating their charting libraries for WPF. Vendors include Visiblox Charts (see an example trading application in Silverlight - should be the same in WPF due to ease of porting of code), Telerik RadChart and Infragristics xamChart Cons: Speed might be an issue - with GDI you can render tens of thousands of points on screen and animate them seamlessly, this gets slower in WPF. (Though it seems WPF / Silverlight is getting better at this: see the zooming functionality of a Silverlight chart with 6000 points onscreen )
