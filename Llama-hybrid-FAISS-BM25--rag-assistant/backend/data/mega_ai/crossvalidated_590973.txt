My first thought was that this indicates the variables being unrelated to the outcome, in agreement with Stephan Kolassa. However, if a large neural network cannot even overfit, that suggests to me some issue with the optimization. If your variables are unrelated to the outcome, you should expect poor out-of-sample performance, but you should be able to get something out of the in-sample data.
