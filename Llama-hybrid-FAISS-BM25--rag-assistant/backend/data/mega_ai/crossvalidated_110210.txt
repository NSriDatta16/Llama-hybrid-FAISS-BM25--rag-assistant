Look up gene-environment interaction GWAS studies. The statistical analysis they perform in essence is what you have described. The question is does your environment matter to a phenotype (observable feature)? One school of thought generally ignores all environmental information and says your genetic makeup describes your phenotype. This is in complete contrast with ecological studies where the story is environment is everything and they ignore the genes. Since both parties are trying to understand the same problem, there have been recent attempts to coalesce the two. Say we are studying BMI. We take the first few principal components of the genetic matrix as the fixed effects due to genes. We fit education with an index 1 for well educated and 0 for poorly educated as a fixed effect. There is a reasonably strong correlation between the education index and wealth of the community the person is from. So one would argue that the low income communities are more likely to have more fast food restaurants. The fast food acts as an obesogenic trigger.. "Triggers something in your genetic setup which encourages fat accumulation" so it will show up in the genetic makeup in some form. Simulating such data is not a problem. Look up http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/simulate.shtml This lets you simulate GWAS (think of this as genetic units) data responsible for a symptom. If not instructed otherwise it will generate 1000 with the symptom and 1000 controls. The norm in these simulations which I use is 9990 SNPs do not cause the symptom and 10 SNPs do. Read the instructions on how these are simulated. The output will be 1 if the person is obese and 0 if he isn't. Simulate education factors (finished college eduction/not finished college education )based on some reasonable correlation with obesity levels. Hope this helps!!!
