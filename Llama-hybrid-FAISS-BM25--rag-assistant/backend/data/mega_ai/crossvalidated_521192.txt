I think you are get the in detail answer of the question through this paper name Impact of fully connected layers on performance of convolutional neural networks for image classification link - https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231219313803 . It comes to the following conclusion - In order to obtain better performance, the shallow CNNs require more nodes in FC layers. On the other hand, deeper CNNs need less number of neurons in FC layers irrespective of type of the dataset. The shallow CNNs require a large number of neurons in FC layers as well as more number of FC layers for wider datasets compared to deeper datasets and vice-versa. Deeper CNNs perform better than shallow models over deeper datasets. In contrast, shallow architectures perform better than deeper architectures for wider datasets. These observations can help the deep learning community while making a decision about the choice of deep/shallow CNN architectures.
