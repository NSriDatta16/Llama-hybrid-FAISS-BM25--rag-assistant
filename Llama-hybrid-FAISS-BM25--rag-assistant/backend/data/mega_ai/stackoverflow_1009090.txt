Multi Band Infragistics UltraGrid Row Select problem

I am bringing in data from SQL that is to be displayed in a multi band ultragrid. This works great. It does what it is supposed to in this regard; however, if I try to select a row other than the first one, in any band of the bands, it freezes the program. When the grid is loaded, the first row seems to be active (text is bold), so I tried doing an update on the active row. This got rid of the active row, but didn't fix the problem. Thank you in advance for any help!
