I'd recommend trying it and asking questions as you get roadblocked. Most "does this run in Azure" questions are answered with "yes", but full-fledged examples and guides are going to be sparse as the platform is very new. So be the guy who writes it :) You have two options with something like this: 1.) Run a worker role that invokes and runs similar to a windows service. (most tomcat on azure guides approach this way) 2.) Use a Azure Startup task to install, configure, start jBoss as a windows service and/or on top of tomcat With the addition of full-trust, startup tasks, RDP, and eventually even VMrole .. anything that can run on a Windows 2008 server can run on Azure. So try installing on a Windows box, document those steps, then 1 by 1, figure out the "azure way" to accomplish those tasks. Approached this way, the initial setup will likely be pretty simple. From there, you'll learn a lot about Azure's offerings and can probably even make some changes to better leverage the platform for JBoss needs. Once you get up there and have issues, ask away and you're more likely to find direct answers by the audience of MVPs, Azure team members, and cloud geeks here vs just a generic "have you done this" answer.
