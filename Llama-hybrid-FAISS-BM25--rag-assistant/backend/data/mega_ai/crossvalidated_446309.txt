Finding exponential decay in noisy vibration signal

I have to analyse vibrational signals for which the general assumption is that there is one dominant excitation and an exponential decay in amplitude thereafter. I have created smoothened envelopes from the original signal like is visualised in the following plot: Now I want to fit the exponential decay in the signal. Before being able to perform a standard fit I have to select the correct subsection of the signal which contains the exponential decay. I have a kind of working solution where I simply perform a regression on slices of the signal selected by a moving window. Then I select the longest section of the signal where the normalized ${\chi}^2$ -value is below a manually adapted threshold. This leads to a result like in the following plot: One could then use this section (extending it maybe by the moving average window length) and perform another exponential fit yielding the final values. I dislike my solution because it seems quite wasteful to perform so many fits before performing another final one. And I think this has to be such a common problem in signal processing that there must be a more elegant and less brute-force solution to this problem. Another thing I thought about is simply performing a convolution but I expect the exponentials to differ quite widely between individual signals. The only idea for an improvement of the convolution approach I had, was to use multiple different exponential decays for convolution. I am searching for a standard and well-tested approach for this kind of problem. Ideally also one that is efficient or even a non-iterative one-step solution but I am not sure if that is even mathematically possible.
