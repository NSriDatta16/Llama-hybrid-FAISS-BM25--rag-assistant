Since it's complex, it's hard to do otherwise. I like to start with the one-paragraph summary of the overall requirements. If there isn't a one-paragraph summary, that's -- perhaps -- the most important thing to build. Once the summary is out of the way, there's an overview of architectural features. And after that, no one will read a single word. It isn't a novel. There's no story arc. No drama. No conflict. No characters. At least, I can't find a way to make an architecture readable. The best you can hope for is a reference work with enough indexes, cross references, overviews and sidebars that people use it. Indeed, it's the pull-outs that matter. The picture are all anyone will ever use. And those will get put into PPT's for presentation internally and externally. So, don't waste a lot of time on writing. Invest time in overviews, summaries, feature lists and pictures people want to use every day.
