Technically, it's a different connection to the web site, that's why it's a different session. It's probably better to use Application cache instead of session if you want different windows to utilize the same session storage. UPDATE: What you can do if you want to stick to using session state, is to write the session ID to a persistent cookie, this way the child window's call to the server will carry it along and you can retrieve SessionID from that cookie. IMPORTANT: Make sure you encrypt session ID ebfore putting into teh cookie to avoid session hijacking.
