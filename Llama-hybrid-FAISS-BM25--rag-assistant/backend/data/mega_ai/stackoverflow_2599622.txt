header("Pragma: public"); No - this is just wrong - though lots of people think it has something to do with caching header("Expires: 0"); header("Cache-Control: must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0"); Nothing to do with Excel - these just control caching header("Content-Type: application/force-download"); header("Content-Type: application/octet-stream"); header("Content-Type: application/download");; No - there should only be one content-type header. For a MS Excel file using OLE, the mimetype should be application/vnd.ms-excel Only the second header above is a valid mime type. header("Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=$filename"); header("Content-Transfer-Encoding: binary "); The second header is redundant, the former specifies a filename for the download. Content-Type: application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.spreadsheetml.sheet'); Only for a .xlsx file (i.e. saved in XML). Otherwise you should use application/vnd.ms-excel. Indeed the latter should be backwardly compatible. My question: is there need to set up different headers for each file type Yes - the Content-Type header is the file type. But only this header needs to change. C.
