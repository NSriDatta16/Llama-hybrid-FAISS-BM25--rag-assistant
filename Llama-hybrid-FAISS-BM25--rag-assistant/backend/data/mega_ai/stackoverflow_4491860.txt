In the area of music information retrieval, people often use a related metric known as the mel-frequency cepstral coefficients (MFCCs). For any N-sample segment of your signal, take the FFT. Those resulting N samples are transformed into a set of MFCCs containing, say, 12 elements (i.e., coefficients). This 12-element vector is used to classify the instrument, including which drum is used. To do supervised classification, you can use something like a support vector machine (SVM). LIBSVM is a commonly used library that has Java compatibility (and many other languages). You train the SVM with these MFCCs and their corresponding instrument labels. Then, you test it by feeding a query MFCC vector, and it will tell you which instrument it is. So the basic procedure, in summary: Get FFT. Get MFCCs from FFT. Train SVM with MFCCs and instrument labels. Query the SVM with MFCCs of the query signal. Check for Java packages that do these things. (They must exist. I just don't know them.) Relatively, drum transcription is easier than most other instrument groups, so I am optimistic that this would work. For further reading, there are a whole bunch of articles on drum transcription .
