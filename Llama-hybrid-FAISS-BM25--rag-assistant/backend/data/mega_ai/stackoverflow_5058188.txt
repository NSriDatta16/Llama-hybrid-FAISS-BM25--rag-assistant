Drag and Drop (javascript) breaks after first drop

So, what it does: You can successfully drag something anywhere, but when you click it again, it resets to its original position (I don't know why), and when you try to drag it again, as soon as your cursor touches the object it disappears (I don't know why). I'm hoping someone can tell me why it is happening and how to fix it! // JavaScript Document var posX; var posY; var element; function drag() { element = document.getElementById("square"); posX = event.clientX; posY = event.clientY; element.addEventListener("mousemove", move, false); } function move() { element.addEventListener("mouseup", drop, false); element.style.left = event.clientX - posX + "px"; element.style.top = event.clientY - posY + "px"; } function drop() { element.removeEventListener("mousemove", move, false); element.removeEventListener("mouseup", drop, false); } the html is a simple (position is set to relative): meep Lastly, and most importantly, thank you all for your time =]
