is there a way to set them looks like square/rect buttons, and assign a color to their inside rect area ? Step #1: Copy $ANDROID_HOME/platforms/$API/data/res/drawable/btn_radio.xml to your project, where $ANDROID_HOME is where you have installed the Android SDK and $API is some Android platform (e.g., android-2.1) Step #2: Copy $ANDROID_HOME/platforms/$API/data/res/drawable-hdpi/btn_radio* to your project Step #3: Copy $ANDROID_HOME/platforms/$API/data/res/drawable-mdpi/btn_radio* to your project Step #4: Modify those PNG files from steps #2 and #3 to suit your needs
