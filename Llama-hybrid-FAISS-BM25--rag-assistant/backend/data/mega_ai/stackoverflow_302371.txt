Which data structure would you use: TreeMap or HashMap? (Java)

Description | A Java program to read a text file and print each of the unique words in alphabetical order together with the number of times the word occurs in the text. The program should declare a variable of type Map to store the words and corresponding frequency of occurrence. Which concrete type, though? TreeMap or HashMap ? The input should be converted to lower case. A word does not contain any of these characters: \t\t\n]f.,!?:;\"()' Example output | Word Frequency a 1 and 5 appearances 1 as 1 . . . Remark | I know, I've seen elegant solutions to this in Perl with roughly two lines of code. However, I want to see it in Java. Edit: Oh yeah, it be helpful to show an implementation using one of these structures (in Java).
