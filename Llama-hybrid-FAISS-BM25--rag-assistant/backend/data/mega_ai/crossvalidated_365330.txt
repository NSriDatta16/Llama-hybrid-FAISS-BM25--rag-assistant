There may be a more elegant way to do this, but until you find it, you could try something like this (using case_when from dplyr): I created a variable "disaster_subtype" based on the categories you mentioned. disaster_subtype Now I can create a new variable based on the string patterns that belong to the desired categories. library(dplyr) new_variable There are two important points to consider: You have to find enough patterns to cover all possible answers (mind capitalization). These patterns shouldn't overlap to avoid mismatches. Please ask me, if you have questions concerning this approach. And I would also be interested in different solutions.
