I'd consider downsampling the number of points you are trying to render. You may have 50,000 points of data but you're unlikely to be able to fit them all on the screen; even if you charted every single point in one display you'd need 100,000 pixels of horizontal resolution to draw them all! Even in D3D that's a lot to draw. Since you are more likely to have something like 2,048 pixels, you may as well reduce the points you are graphing and draw an approximate curve that fits onto the screen and has only a couple thousand verts. If for example the user graphs a time frame including 10000 points, then downsample those 10000 points to 1000 before graphing. There are numerous techniques you could try, from simple averaging to median-neighbor to Gaussian convolution to (my suggestion) bicubic interpolation . Drawing any number of points greater than 1/2 the screen resolution will simply be a waste . As the user zooms in on a part of a graph, you can resample to get higher resolutions and more accurate curve fitting.
