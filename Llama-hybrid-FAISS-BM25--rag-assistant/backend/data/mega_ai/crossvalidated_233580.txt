Firstly, you have multiple observations per subject and per period. As you correctly point out the correlation within subject across session and within the periods needs to be accounted for. There are a number of ways to express this in SAS e.g. "repeated session ID". Generally, when you know nothing else making very strong assumptions about the correlation structure over time (e.g. type=AR(1) or type=CS or just having a random subject effect on the intercept) is not advisable. In my experience AR(1) tends to treat the furthest apart observations as if they were independent and you end up pretending like you have several times your actual number of (independent) subjects, when you do not. This can lead to a substantial overconfidence in the analysis results with confidence intervals having very poor coverage. If you have sufficient data, it is usually recommended to use an unstructured covariance matrix. One way to specify this here is to write "repeated measurement session / subject=ID type=UN@CS;", when there is only two sessions. Can you actually identify the effects of drug, session and sequence all at once in a 2 period 2 treatment 2 sequence cross-over? Is drug not a linear combination of session and sequence?
