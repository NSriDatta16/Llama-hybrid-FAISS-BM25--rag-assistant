Do I need ASP.NET MVC?

I realize that ASP.NET MVC has all the hype. I have my doubts that I need it, but wanted to explain my potential project: This is an internal LAN application. It is doing CRUD operations and a little reporting. The user base is small ( There is not a huge number of screens (Maybe 20) I don't care about URL rewriting My view state is typically small (like a DealID or ClientID) Even though I don't have a full mastering of Page Lifecycle, I do understand Postbacks and don't have a problem coding for it. I believe in Layering and am familiar with the M-V-P pattern and other patterns. I want to do some Unit testing, but heck 25-50% coverage is better then what most apps. The app will have a little AJAX for search screens, but don't see it being overkill. So what do you think? While using the "sexy" technology is cool, is it necessary?
