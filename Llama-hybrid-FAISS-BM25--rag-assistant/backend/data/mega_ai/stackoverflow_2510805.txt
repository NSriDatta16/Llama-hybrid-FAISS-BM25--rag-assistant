If your maths is good enough, it is possible (although mad) to do it without the canvas tag for most modern browsers using one of (as appropriate): -webkit-transform: rotate -moz-transform: rotate -o-transform-rotate The Trident Matrix Filter By creating eg. a 1px high div, with eg. a border-top for your 'line', and using the mouse drag event to position and rotate it. Madness lies this way but it would be a quite fun exercise. (You should use something like Raphael JS, which is cross browser and sane - see above)
