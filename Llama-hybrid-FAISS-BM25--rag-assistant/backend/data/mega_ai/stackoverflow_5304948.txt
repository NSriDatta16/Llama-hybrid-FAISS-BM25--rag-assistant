Updating a Sharepoint List from flex

I have been trying to find a way to connect Flex to sharepoint in an elegant way that allows me to update lists, build charts, and create widgets with FLEX on the client-side. I have researched this extensively but I am running into circles. I understand the basics of Flex data connection/webservices/etc... , I just can't seem to get my head around how to use the sharepoint list services. Does anybody out there have a nice detailed example of what I'm trying to achieve? Simple examples work too! :) Thanks so much Everyone! -E.
