Tests for Evaluating an Application Stack or Framework

I'm looking for a set of scenarios that can be used to assess the overall elegance, strengths and weaknesses of a given MVC framework . For instance, one such test could be how cleanly authorization is handled when it affects elements in the presentation layer. If the user has permission to see elements within an object, is that decision made in the view or the business logic. Are the two conflated, such that business logic is in code that affects layout of the displayed object? There are other problems within this general domain, and, given that MVC has been around since 1979, I'm sure that there are books that deal with this sort of thing. However, I'm not looking for yet another reference on patterns in enterprise architecture. I'm looking for a compendium of problems and pitfalls. So, if you've any test scenarios that you like to throw a framework up against, or if you have any suggestions for books that deal with this sort of thing, I'd be grateful were you to share them.
