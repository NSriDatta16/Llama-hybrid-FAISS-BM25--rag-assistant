Are there any good reasons NOT to use jQuery instead of plain old JavaScript?

I recently discovered jQuery, and I can immediately see how useful and elegant it is. I'm curious, though - are there any reasons NOT to use it (and just use plain old JavaScript instead)? If there aren't any reasons, should it not be integrated fully into the JavaScript language?
