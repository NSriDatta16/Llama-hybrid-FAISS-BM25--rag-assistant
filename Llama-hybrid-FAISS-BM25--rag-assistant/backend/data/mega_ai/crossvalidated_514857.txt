Is the Value of Bias and the Value of ME (mean error) the Same?

My attempt to check accuracy metrics in time series reveal this revelation to me. The bias of the model ## simulate ARIMA(1,0, 0) set.seed(289805) N10_ar0.8_seed289805 and the mean error ME Metrics::bias(N10_ar0.8_seed289805, fit) ##[1] 0.4763398 are the same Is it normal?
