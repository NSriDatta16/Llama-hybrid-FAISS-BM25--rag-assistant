As I understand item 2, in every "step" you are trying to add variables one at a time to your model and evaluate AIC for each. If that is correct, then k stays the same within the "step", so only the 2nd term of AIC is important. We see that AIC may help select the right number of variables in the model, but not the specific model. May I recommend L1-regularized logistic regression as a way of subset selection. There is no shortage papers or software; here's a good place to start: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/l1_glmnet/long-glmnet.pdf Covariance matrix indeed determines the Hessian in the linear regression case; in logistic case it's more complicated. Anyway, regularization should take care of the degenerating Hessian.
