indexing for faster search of lists in a file?

I have a file with around 100k lists and have a another file with again a list of around an average of 50. I want to compare 2nd item of list in second file with the 2nd element of 1st file and repeat this for each of the 50 lists in 2nd file and get the result of all the matching element. I have written the code for all this,but this is taking a lot of time as it need to check the whole the 100k list some 50 times. I want to improve the speed. I cant not post my code as it is part of big code and will be difficult to infer anything from that.
