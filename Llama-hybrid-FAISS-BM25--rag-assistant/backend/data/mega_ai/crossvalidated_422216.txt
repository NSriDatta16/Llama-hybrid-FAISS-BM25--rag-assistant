I used the same strategy and I had exactly the same issue. It seems that parameters > 1 are possible for explosive time series. For the parameter that should be > 1 from your auto.arima results, try to set it to 0.99 in your GLS model without using the argument fixed = TRUE . The model will use the value that you provide as starting value and should finally adjust it to a value similar to your results from auto.arima . It worked for me so I hope it will also work for you.
