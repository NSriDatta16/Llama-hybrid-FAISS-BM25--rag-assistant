You could think of this as a distance learning task. You could train your model with triplet loss and the output of your model would be some vector in a latent space such that the same objects would be really close together regarding some standard distance measure, e.g. cosine similarity. See Wang, et al for an example that matches yours. However, this approach might be prohibitive compute consuming for real-time applications in a car, depending on the hardware that would be available. I supervised a student who did something similar from a different domain (cover song identification) for his bachelor thesis. If your intern has some experience with neural networks this could be done as a summer project. Exploring 3D data and getting the data right to feed it into the network can be time consuming. I think it would be crucial to provide the student with tools to visually explore the data and the data in such a format that the data wrangling does not take too much time (e.g. grouping and labelling the objects already done).
