To address you final comment - "If this is really the case - why not just fit a whole bunch of individual models for each combination of factors within the independent variables? I understand that this might result in fitting a large number of models, but aren't modern computers strong enough to do this?" It is possible to treat a clustered dataset like this, running an individual model separately for each cluster. However, this approach has several disadvantages. First, fitting a series of individual models instead of using the whole data in a multilevel model, sample size and thus statistical power is drastically reduced. Second, using a multilevel model, you get an overall coefficient that estimates (in a simple case of y ~ x) the average relationship between x and y while addressing the clustering of data. If you run a bunch of individual models, you have a bunch of individual coefficients with no simple way to combine them to gain an understanding of an overall y ~ x relationship in your total dataset. Third, running individual models you don't get information about what kind of role the cluster plays in y ~ x relationship (with a multilevel model you can see whether cluster-specific slope variance is significant and compare different clusters' slopes). Fourth, using a multilevel random slope model you still get cluster-specific coefficients for the relationship between x and y.
