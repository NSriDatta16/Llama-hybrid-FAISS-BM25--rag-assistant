Perform clustering on individual data in categories

I am looking for ways to perform clustering on an aggregated category while still using individual data. For example, assume we have a multitude users that we have acquired through different channels. I would like to cluster groups of channels together, so that it is easier to deal with similar channels in similar ways. However, if I aggregate the user data into averages for each channel, then because these averages are heavily driven by outliers (high-spenders), it doesn't give that much insight to the behavior of the majority of users from that channel. Is there a way to use the individual user data but still gain insight into and cluster based on the channel they come from?
