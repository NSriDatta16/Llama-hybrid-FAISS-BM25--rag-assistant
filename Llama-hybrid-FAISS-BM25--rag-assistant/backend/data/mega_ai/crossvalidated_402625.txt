Selecting Mutually Exclusive PC from a PCA Analysis in R

I have run a PCA Analysis on some code and it produced a PCA analysis; however, I want to identify which PC are mutually exclusive and use them in a logistic regression. According to the PCA analysis the first 5 PC results are significant; however if I use all 5 of them in a logistic model they become not significant (possible because they actually overlap but I can't tell) I've extracted the first 5 PC and used them in a log model but I get a P-Value that isn't significant. If I just use 1 PC I get a better answer but I want to identify which PC variables I can use in conjunction. Call: glm(formula = Train.Target ~ PC1 + PC2 + PC3 + PC4, family = binomial(), data = train.data) I get a result that basically says all P values are = 1. If I use 1 PC (see below) I get an actual p-value train.data Identifying which PC variables in a PCA model are mutually exclusive.
