Errata in Extreme Programming Adventures in C#?

I'm trying to work my way through Ron Jeffries's Extreme Programming Adventures in C#. I am stuck, however, in Chapter 3 because the code does not, and cannot , do what the author says it does. Basically, the text says that I should be able to write some text in a word-wrap enabled text box. If I then move the cursor to an intermediate line and hit enter, the code should re-display the lines before the cursor, add a couple of lines and a set of HTML paragraph tags, then append the rest of the lines. The code doesn't match the text because it uses the textbox.lines property. Well, no matter how many word-wrapped lines there are in a text box, there's only ONE line in the Lines property until you hit a carriage return. So, the statement that the code should, "Copy the rest of the lines into the buffer" appears wrong to me. I'd appreciate anybody having experience with the book telling me what I'm reading, or doing, wrong! Thanks. EoRaptor
