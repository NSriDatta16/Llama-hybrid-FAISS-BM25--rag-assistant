Bayes update rule studied as an operator

Bayes' rule can be understood as a nonlinear map from the space of probability measures to itself. Are there any reference/books which study it from this perspective? E.g., can we say something about whether it is contractive or not, behaviour under iteration etc. Bayes' rule also induces a stochastic process that is both a martingale and a Markov chain. Any references along these lines would also be interesting.
