I would recommend using jQuery if you want to do this yourself. You can grab the click event of the header row (or wherever you want), and then you can use the x/y of the mouse to drag a line. Once the mouse is released, you can troll through the table and reset the width of the 's. Otherwise, there are several JavaScript table controls on the internet that you could use.
