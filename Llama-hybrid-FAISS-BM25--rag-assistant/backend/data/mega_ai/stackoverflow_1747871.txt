IsMouseOver within a Button

I'm creating a button with a down arrow: alt text http://www.robbertdam.nl/share/so/1.png The arrow is actually a button within a button. When the mouse is at the location I pointed out with a red dot it looks like this (which is good): alt text http://www.robbertdam.nl/share/so/3.png The inner button lights up okay. But when going slightly up it looks like the following picture (not good, the inner-button is not selected): alt text http://www.robbertdam.nl/share/so/2.png It appears that this has to do with brushes on the parent button (transparency, etc.). Can anyone explain me how this system works? (or point me to some documentation about this). I there a way I can force the inner-button to capture all mouse events?
