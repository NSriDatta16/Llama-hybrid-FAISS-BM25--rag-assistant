I would take a look at http://quince.infragistics.com/ , while not complete applications, it does show you some best practices/design patterns for both Windows and Web applications. I'd also take a look at some of the Windows Forms component companies, DevExpress, Telerik and Infragistics. You can learn a lot from the look and feel of their components.
