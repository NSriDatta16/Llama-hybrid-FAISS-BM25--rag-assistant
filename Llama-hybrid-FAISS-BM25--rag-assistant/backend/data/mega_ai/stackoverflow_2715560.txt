Hi I had the same problem exactly on snow leopard 10.6.2. So I built the library without enabling quicktime. There must be a work around to whatever you are doing without enabling quicktime right? To build the library without using quicktime, follow section 2 (Building from source using the new CMake build system) exactly without enabling extra options in http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Mac_OS_X_OpenCV_Port Hope this helps.
