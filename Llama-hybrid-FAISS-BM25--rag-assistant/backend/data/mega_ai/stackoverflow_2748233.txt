I'm going to offer another separate answer using CSS 3 selectors. My other answer, while simple and elegant, may not be applicable to your particular situation. A more bulletproof way of achieving what you're looking for is with this: CONTAINER { width: 1000px } CONTAINER A { width: 250px } CONTAINER B { width: 250px } CONTAINER C { width: 750px } CONTAINER B ~ C { width: 500px } /* if the B element is present, and is a sibling of C, reduce C's width to 500px */ The only caveat to this method is that the B and C elements need to be siblings, and, by the sounds of things, they are in your case.
