Free webstorage that is accessible via code

I have a desktop app for personal use and I would like it to be able to synchronize it's data with the net. Since it's not trancational, I figured a solition migth be to (de)serialize the lot to a plain text format and store that in some file on the web. Now I am looking for free storage in a way that I can access it via code, be it HTTP or FTP, that's all equal to me. Of course I would like it to 'steady', so not some obscure free service that can be stopped at any time without prior notice or services with bad connctions/ lots of downtime. Also it would be nice if the data wasn't readily available for anyone who happens to google the right term, but that's optional since I can encrypt it. I was thinking about google docs, but really anything will do as long as it is free steady (stable/trustworthy) accessible via code password protected (optional) It would be very nice when codesnippets would come with the suggested solution! I'm using C#
