Possibly in a similar way to how spam is filtered. First step is to create a training set, based on known adult sites, and extract features from them. These could be keywords, colors used in images, domain name structure, whois details, whatever. Anything that could in some way be specifically different for adult content as compared to non-adult content. Next step is to apply some sort of statistical model to that. Bayesian models seem to work well for spam, but may not for adult stuff. Support vector machines seem like a good fit, but that's a lot more complex and I'm not really familiar with it myself.
