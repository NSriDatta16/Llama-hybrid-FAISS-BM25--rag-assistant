The diversity of the dataset is much more important than the quantity of samples you are feeding to the network. You should customize your dataset to include and reinforce the data you want the network to learn. After you have crafted this custom dataset you have to start playing with the amount of samples, as it is completely dependant on your problem. For example: If you are building a neural network to detect the peaks of a particular signal, it would be completely useless to train your network with a zillion samples of signals that do not have peaks. There lies the importance of customizing your training dataset no matter how many samples you have.
