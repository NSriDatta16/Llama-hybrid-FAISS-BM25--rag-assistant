The problem is that an image doesn't "represent" state -- it doesn't have information about the motion of objects in cartpole. If you don't make motion part of your state, then you don't have an MDP anymore -- it's not markov. So basically, whatever way you choose to represent "state", you have to make sure you end up with an MDP. Presumably, taking the difference of two consecutive frames is enough to provide velocity information and make it an MDP. Stacking N frames (possibly N>2) is another common way to do this.
