Suppose that $T_{dy}$ is the temperature in a particular (day,year). Let $\alpha_d$ denote a day-specific fixed effect, $\mathbb{1}\{ y = 2016 \}$ an indicator for 2016, and let $\varepsilon_{dy}$ be an error term. $$ T_{dy} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \mathbb{1}\{ y = 2016 \} + \alpha_d + \varepsilon_{dy} $$ We can test whether the mean temperatures in 2016 are larger than average (after controlling for day-specific fixed effects, by testing whether $\beta_1 \ne 0$ . More generally what you are doing is "testing" a structural break in 2016 with respect to previous years. You can test this in R by running the following code # Import the "plm" package library('plm') # Your data: temperaturedata # Has three columns: "day", "year" and "temperature". # Create a dummy variable for the year data $y2016= ( data$ year == 2016 ) temperaturemodel
