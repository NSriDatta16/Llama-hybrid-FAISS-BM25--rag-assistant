Hm - if your ultimate goal is to predict, why do you intend to do model selection at all? As far as I know, it is well established both in the "traditional" statistical literature and the machine learning literature that model averaging is superior when it comes to prediction. Put simply, model averaging means that you estimate all plausible models, let them all predict and average their predictions weighted by their relative model evidence. A useful reference to start is https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0049124104268644 They explain this quite simply and refer to the relevant literature. Hope this helps.
