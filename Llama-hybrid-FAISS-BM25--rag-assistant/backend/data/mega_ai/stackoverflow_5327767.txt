How to know the coordinates of the last character that is added to the UITextView in iPad

I want to insert a UITextField in between the text of a UITextView to provide "fill in the blanks" functionality. I know that UITextField can't be added to the UITextView so I want to add UITextField to the super view of the UITextView by maintaining space for these UITextFields on the UITextView. How can I determine the coordinates of a particular character with respect to the origin of the UITextView? The frame of the textView and its super view are the same. Can any one please tell me how to do this? Is there any other way to achieve fill in the blanks functionality with in a paragraph of text?
