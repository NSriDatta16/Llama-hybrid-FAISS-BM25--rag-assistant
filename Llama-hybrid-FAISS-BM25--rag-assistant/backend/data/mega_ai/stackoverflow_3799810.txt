How to pass arguments to stage instances in ActionScript 3?

I have an instance on my stage that I dragged from my library at design time. This instance links to a custom class who's constructor takes an argument. package { import flash.display.MovieClip; import flash.media.Sound; public class PianoKey extends MovieClip { var note:Sound; public function PianoKey(note:Sound) { this.note = note; } } } Obviously, trying to run the the code as is yields the following argument count error: ArgumentError: Error #1063: Argument count mismatch on PianoKey(). Expected 1, got 0. Is there any way to set arguments on an instance that has been manually dragged to the stage?
