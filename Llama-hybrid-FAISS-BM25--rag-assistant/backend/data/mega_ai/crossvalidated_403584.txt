What is the relationship between the sum of squares of all weights and lambda in the ridge regression

Currently I am reading chapter 8, regression. And I feel quite confused about the following paragraph(see picture below), does it mean in ridge algorithm, the sum of all weights will be less than lambda? As I see from the execution result, it is impossible. Assume that we set a small value for lamda, and weights will be nearly same as regular least squares regression. Such this constriaint will not be met. So how should I understand the following sentence?
