Is there a way to force lxml to parse Unicode strings that specify an encoding in a tag?

I have an XML file that specifies an encoding, and I use UnicodeDammit to convert it to unicode (for reasons of storage, I can't store it as a string). I later pass it to lxml but it refuses to ignore the encoding specified in the file and parse it as Unicode, and it raises an exception. How can I force lxml to parse the document? This behaviour seems too restrictive.
