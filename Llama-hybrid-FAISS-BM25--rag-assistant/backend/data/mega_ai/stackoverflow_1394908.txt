Link in sticky footer not clickable in Firefox and Chrome

I am using a sticky footer like described in: How do you get the footer to stay at the bottom of a Web page? http://ryanfait.com/resources/footer-stick-to-bottom-of-page/ I have a paragraph with a link that I want to be at the bottom of the page, so I put it in .footer. The problem is that the link is not clickable in Firefox 3.5.2 and Chrome, it is behind .push. It does work in IE7 and IE8 but I guess that doesnÂ´t say much. I have toyed around with z-indexes but that does not work. By the way, I need the position:relative in #page to position some stuff inside that div. Is there a way to make a link in .footer clickable in all browsers? The relevant parts of the code: css html, body { height: 100%; } #page { width: 962px; text-align: left; min-height: 100%; /* sticky footer part */ height: auto !important; height: 100%; margin: 0 auto -90px; /* end sticky footer */ position: relative; } /* sticky footer part */ .push, .footer { height: 90px; } .push { } .footer { background: #181f18 url(../images/background-top.png) no-repeat center bottom; } html bla bla bla bla Some Text
