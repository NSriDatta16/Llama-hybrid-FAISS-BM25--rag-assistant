I'd use UML not because it's the defacto industry standard but because it helps you organize and document your thoughts as you explore a domain (whether personal or business). A free tool is ArgoUML. I'd mock UIs as another aid in figuring and communicating what you think you'd like to do in your system. A great free one is Balsamiq Mockups. And I'd focus on behavior first and data last. See Rebecca Wirfs-Brock's writings. Best of luck! Mark
