You misunderstand the autorelease pool. Everything put on the autorelease pool will be released at the end of the current event loop. That means that the object your're using just for the treatment of an event, it is a good candidate for the AR pool but you also need to manage your state between events and for that you need to manually retain et release. This is obviously an outrageously wrong simplification but it might help your understanding :-) There a lot of other consideration to take into account and I really strongly advice you to read what Jasarien suggested.
