Are there any simple pairwise comparison tests suitable for comparing emotions?

So, I'm pretty new to using statistics in a research context. I am currently writing my thesis in didactics of mathematics. In my study, a group of $10$ students are to solve two different mathematical problems (at two different occasions) and afterwards fill in a self-report questionnaire asking them to rate how often they felt a specific emotion during the problemsolving. This is done via a $5$ -point likert scale from never to very often . The following emotions are to be rated: Liked it Found it beautiful Felt excited Amused me Felt pleasure Felt surprised Felt lost Made me curious Sparked my interest Felt intelectually challenged Felt a sudden insight Found it ugly Felt bored Felt confused Felt frustrated Felt anxious Felt sad One student ( $S_{1}$ ) in an informal pilot test filled in the following scores for the first applied mathematical problem: $5, 5, 5, 4, 2, 1, 5, 5, 2, 3, 1, 5, 2, 1, 1, 1$ . And for the other pure mathematical problem: $3, 2, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1, 4, 4, 3, 1$ . So, how can I do some simple (adequate in a research context) comparison test on these two different scores? Just by eye-balling the scores above it seems rather obvious that $S_{1}$ gives on average higher scores on the applied mathematical problem. And if I have, say $10$ different students what type of test would then be adequate to use? Thanks in advance!
