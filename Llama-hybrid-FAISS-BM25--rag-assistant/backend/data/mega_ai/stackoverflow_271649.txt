Unfortunately, your source data file is human-oriented, which means that you're going to have to do a bunch of string parsing in order to get it into the structure. Otherwise, if the data had been written directly as a binary file, you could just use fread() to pop it directly into the struct. If you want to use an "elegant" (ie, ugly minimalistic approach), you could make a loop of sorts to parse each line, basically using strchr() to first find the '=' character, then the next space, then using atoi() to convert each number into a real int, and then using some pointer hackery to push them all into the structure. The obvious disadvantage there is that if the structure changes, or is even reorganized somehow, then the whole algorithm here would silently break. So, for something that would be more maintainable and readable (but result in more code), you could just push each value into a vector, and then go through the vector and copy each value into the appropriate strucutre field.
