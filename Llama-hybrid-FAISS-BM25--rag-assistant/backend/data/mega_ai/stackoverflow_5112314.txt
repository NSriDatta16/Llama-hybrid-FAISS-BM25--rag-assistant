Thanks for all the ideas guys. I've tried all of them except a sha-256 which my server doesn't have installed. Here's the results: Average (http_build_query): 1.3954045954045E-5 Average (diff): 0.00011533766233766 Average (serialize): 1.7588411588412E-5 Average (md5): 1.6036963036966E-5 Average (implode-haval160,4): 1.5349650349649E-5 That's running the operation 1000 times and averaging the result. After refreshing a couple times I could tell that the http_build_query was the quickest. I guess my next question would be if anyone can think of any pitfalls of using this method? Thanks Here's my code: class a { static $input; function test() { $start = null; $s = $e = $d = $g = $h = $i = $k = array(); self::$input = array(); for ($x = 0; $x "; //print_r($s); echo "Average (http_build_query): " . array_sum($s) / count($s) . " "; echo "Average (diff): " . array_sum($d) / count($d) . " "; echo "Average (serialize): " . array_sum($g) / count($g) . " "; echo "Average (md5): " . array_sum($e) / count($e). " "; echo "Average (implode-haval160,4): " . array_sum($h) / count($h); } } a::test();
