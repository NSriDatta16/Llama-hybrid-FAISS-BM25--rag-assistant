Grouping by Time ranges in Linq

I've been getting stuck into some linq queries for the first time today and I'm struggling with some of the more complicated ones. I'm building a query to extract data from a table to build a graph. The tables colums I'm interested in are Id , Time and Value . The user will select a start time, an end time and the number of intervals (points) to graph. The value column will averaged for each interval. I can do this with a linq request for each interval but I'm trying to write it in one query so I only need to go to the database once. So far I have got: var timeSpan = endTime.Subtract(startTime); var intervalInSeconds = timeSpan.TotalSeconds / intervals; var wattList = (from t in _table where t.Id == id && t.Time >= startTime && t.Time a.Value)) ).ToList(); Any help on grouping over time ranges will be most welcome.
