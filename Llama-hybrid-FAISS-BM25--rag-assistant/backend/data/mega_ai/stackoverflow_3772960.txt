Drag/drop from ListBoxDragDropTarget to PanelDragDropTarget

Using the Silverlight 4 toolkit, is it possible to drag and drop from a ListBox to a Canvas (and get an event on the drop into the Canvas)? I was able to write code to drag/drop from a wrap panel inside a PanelDragDropTarget to a canvas but the event handler did not trigger when the drop occurred. When I tried to drag/drop from a ListBox inside a ListBoxDragDrop to the Canvas inside the PanelDragDropTarget, the drop did not occur (and the event handler didn't trigger). While dragging over the Canvas, the cursor turned into the one with up/down arrows. Thanks, Ted
