Map of Map - word pairs in java - stuck

I am using a MSDOS windows prompt to pipe in a file.. its a regular file with words.(not like abc,def,ghi..etc) I am trying to write a program that counts how many times each word pair appears in a text file. A word pair consists of two consecutive words (i.e. a word and the word that directly follows it). In the first sentence of this paragraph, the words “counts” and “how” are a word pair. What i want the program to do is, take this input : abc def abc ghi abc def ghi jkl abc xyz abc abc abc --- Should produce this output: abc: abc, 2 def, 2 ghi, 1 xyz, 1 def: abc, 1 ghi, 1 ghi: abc, 1 kl, 1 jkl: abc, 1 xyz: abc, 1 My input is not going to be like that though. My input will be more like: "seattle amazoncom is expected to report" so would i even need to test for "abc"? MY BIGGEST issue is adding it to the map... so i think I think i need to use a map of a map? I am not sure how to do this? Map > uniqueWords = new HashMap >(); I think the map would produce this output for me: which is axactly what i want.. Key | Value number of times -------------------------- abc | def, ghi, jkl 3 def | jkl, mno 2 if that map is correct, in my situation how would i add to it from the file? I have tried: if(words.contain("abc")) // would i even need to test for abc????? { uniqueWords.put("abc", words, ?) // not sure what to do about this? } this is what i have so far. import java.util.Scanner; import java.util.ArrayList; import java.util.TreeSet; import java.util.Iterator; import java.util.HashSet; public class Project1 { public static void main(String[] args) { Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in); String word; String grab; int number; // ArrayList a = new ArrayList (); // TreeSet words = new TreeSet (); Map > uniquWords = new HashMap >(); System.out.println("project 1\n"); while (sc.hasNext()) { word = sc.next(); word = word.toLowerCase(); if (word.matches("abc")) // would i even need to test for abc????? { uniqueWords.put("abc", word); // syntax incorrect i still need an int! } if (word.equals("---")) { break; } } System.out.println("size"); System.out.println(uniqueWords.size()); System.out.println("unique words"); System.out.println(uniqueWords.size()); System.out.println("\nbye..."); } } I hope someone can help me because i am banging my head and not learnign anything for weeks now.. Thank you...
