Use R to perform a logistic regression and cross-validate in a small sample?

I have a small sample (n=69, 35 with diseases, 34 without disease). I have around 20 variables that came up as significant using indiscriminate univariate regression. Of these 20 variables, several are already known to be associated with the disease. I have 3 other variables that are also significant but are novel measurements from this study. My questions are How do I choose variables that I need to include to get the most parsimonious model? Are there R packages that will help do this, or should I "pick and choose"? Can I cross-validate in such a small sample? If so, again, what method would I use?
