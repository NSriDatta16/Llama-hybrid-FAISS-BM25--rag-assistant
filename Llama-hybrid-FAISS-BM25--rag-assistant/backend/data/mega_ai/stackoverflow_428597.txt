On average , yes. :) They don't make us dumber programmers. What they do is allow there to be more dumb programmers (which I suppose means that, on average, we are dumber.) Having better tools means that someone with little experience and a shady understanding of the concepts of CS can still crank out code that eventually works and does something useful. That isn't possible when writing in assembly, but it is when writing in, say, VB. (Of course, there's a greater chance of eventual WTF-style catastrophes when a less experienced person is writing big apps that eventually collapse under the weight of their poor architecture.) Admittedly, "dumb" is an inflammatory word to use here. Just because someone knows less doesn't make them stupid, it just means they're less experienced. But the point is understood.
