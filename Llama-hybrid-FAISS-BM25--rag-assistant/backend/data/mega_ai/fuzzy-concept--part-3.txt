Across at least two and a half millennia, all of them had something to say about graded concepts with unsharp boundaries. This suggests at least that the awareness of the existence of concepts with "fuzzy" characteristics, in one form or another, has a very long history in human thought. Quite a few 20th century logicians, mathematicians and philosophers also tried to analyze the characteristics of fuzzy concepts as a recognized species, sometimes with the aid of some kind of many-valued logic or substructural logic. An early attempt in the post-WW2 era to create a mathematical theory of sets with gradations of set membership was made by Abraham Kaplan and Hermann F. Schott in 1951. They intended to apply the idea to empirical research. Kaplan and Schott expressed the degree of membership of empirical classes using real numbers between 0 and 1, and they defined corresponding notions of intersection, union, complementation and subset. However, at the time, their idea "fell on stony ground". J. Barkley Rosser Sr. published a treatise on many-valued logics in 1952, anticipating "many-valued sets". Another treatise was published in 1963 by Alexander Zinoviev and others. In 1964, the American philosopher William Alston introduced the term "degree vagueness" to describe vagueness in an idea that results from the absence of a definite cut-off point along an implied scale (in contrast to "combinatory vagueness" caused by a term that has a number of logically independent conditions of application). The German mathematician Dieter Klaua published a German-language paper on fuzzy sets in 1965, but he used a different terminology (he referred to "many-valued sets", not "fuzzy sets"). In the late 1960s, two popular introductions to many-valued logic were published by Robert J. Ackermann and Nicholas Rescher. Rescher's book includes a bibliography on fuzzy theory up to 1965, which was extended by Robert Wolf and Joseph De Kerf for 1966–1975. Haack provides references to significant works after 1974. In 1980, Didier Dubois and Henri Prade published a detailed annotated bibliography on the field of fuzzy set theory. George J. Klir and Bo Yuan provided an overview of the subject in Fuzzy sets and fuzzy logic during the mid-1990s. Merrie Bergmann provides a more recent (2008) introduction to fuzzy reasoning. A standard modern reference work is Fuzzy Logic and Mathematics: A Historical Perspective (2017) by Radim Bělohlávek, Joseph W. Dauben and George J. Klir. Lotfi Zadeh's discovery The Iranian-born American computer scientist Lotfi A. Zadeh (1921–2017) is usually credited with inventing the specific idea of a "fuzzy concept" in his seminal 1965 paper on fuzzy sets, because he presented a mathematical formalization of the phenomenon that was widely accepted by scholars. The genesis of Zadeh's discovery has been described as follows: “As early as 1961, Lotfi and his colleague began writing about the need for some sort of “fuzzy” mathematics to help translate fuzzy human concepts into the concrete instructions computers need. One fateful night in 1964, those fuzzy notions crystalized. Lotfi had plans with friends for dinner that night, but at the last minute, those plans fell through. As he made his way home, he figured out the critical missing piece for fuzzy math: the idea that things can have a grade of membership to some concept. Say, for instance, whether one is included in a dinner plan, or not.” In reality, Zadeh did not literally use the expression "fuzzy concept" anywhere in his famous paper. Instead, he explained the concept of a fuzzy set and its formalization (the paper is simply titled "Fuzzy sets"). However, the terms "fuzzy concept" and "fuzzy
