How does a Bayesian update his belief when something with probability 0 happened?

Define $X:=$ "coin has probability 1 to land heads" Assume that one has the prior belief: $P(X)= 1$. However after tossing the coin once it lands tails ($E:= $ "coin landed tails"). How should a Bayesian update his beliefs in order to stay coherent? $P(X|E)$ is undefined, as $P(E) = 0 $. However, it seems to me that as his prior beliefs are quite implausible (of course probability 0 does not mean impossible) he should somehow be able to update his belief according to some rule. Is this just a pathological case in which Bayesian updating does not work or am I unaware of a solution to this problem?
