You can use send to call private methods. For the file timestamp to work properly, rails_asset_id requires the asset file to be inside assets_dir , which is by default the /public directory. Here's an example: # Get asset id for the file /public/json/example.json send(:rails_asset_id, 'json/example.json') If you're using it outside view, this is one way to do it. require 'action_view/helpers/asset_tag_helper' include ActionView::Helpers::AssetTagHelper send(:rails_asset_id, 'json/example.json') Note that all of these techniques are hackish and will not work on future versions of Rails since they have changed the way the asset tag helpers are organized. So proceed with caution.
