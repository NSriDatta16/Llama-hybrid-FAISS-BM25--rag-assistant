I wouldn't store entire models in the Session and would lean towards the ID method. The reason being that the Session will persist for the entire time the user is on your site and it wouldn't be cleaned up after the user has moved to a diff page that no longer requires the data. What if the user access many pages that you do this type of storage on? It could lead to a lot of wasted memory. If this is data that could be used by many users you might want to consider using Cache instead of Session as it will save you duplicating the same data across multiple sessions. EDIT: Noticed your note saying it was an order form. You could use the Session to store the 'current order' for the user and clear it / replace it as they submit / create orders. Would you need to store it because there are multiple steps? In some cases if it is very limitted data, you could store it in cookies and then makes sure to clear the cookie once the order is done.
