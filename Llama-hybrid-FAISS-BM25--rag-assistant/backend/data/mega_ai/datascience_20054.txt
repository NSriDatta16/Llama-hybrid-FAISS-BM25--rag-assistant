LSTMs - Carousel of Error

Is there any other materials that derives the LSTM back propagation and carousel of error except the original paper? (I could not understand it, sorry). I tried deriving and got stuck, and asked the following question: LSTMs - Data Science Stack Exchange question , however, it doesn't seems that there are much people interested in hand derivation of LSTMs. Thanks
