Did you see the help file for the ts function? At the bottom there are examples for quarterly and monthly time series. Perhaps you could directly extend this to second-wise series? You only need to specify the start date, not the end date. For example, instead of using start = c(1954, 7), frequency = 12 for monthly data starting in July 1954 you could use start = c(d, s), frequency = 60*24 for second-wise data starting on day d , second s . The time attribute of your data would be given in days. set.seed(1) x=rnorm(10^4) # generate random data d=1 s=1 x=ts(x,start=c(d,s),frequency=60*24) plot(x) print(time(x)) # extract the 'time' attribute of the 'ts' object There might be a better solution, but perhaps this one is sufficient?
