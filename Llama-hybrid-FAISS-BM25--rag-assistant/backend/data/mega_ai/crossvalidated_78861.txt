Word association

I'm doing an experiment with moodcongruency (influence of mood on word retrieval). Prior to inducing a mood, the participants will memorize a list of words containing an equal amount of positive, negative or neural words. Before the actual experiment, I want to make sure that the words are indeed associated (by a sample) with a positive, negative or neutral mood. So I've summarized a list containing 37 words and asked 24 respondents to rate their association with either (1) negative, (2) neutral of (3) positive meaning (nominal). From these results, I'm looking to distil the most reliable words into a list for each association (pos, neg, neut). How would I perform this in SPSS?
