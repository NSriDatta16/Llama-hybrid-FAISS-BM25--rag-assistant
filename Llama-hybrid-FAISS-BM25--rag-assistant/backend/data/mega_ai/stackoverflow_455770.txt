I would start by migrating to 2.6, which is very close to python 3.0. You might even want to wait for 2.7, which will be even closer to python 3.0. And then, once you have migrated to 2.6 (or 2.7), I suggest you simply keep just one version of the script, with things like "if PY3K:... else:..." in the rare places where it will be mandatory. Of course it's not the kind of code we developers like to write, but then you don't have to worry about managing multiple scripts or branches or patches or distributions, which will be a nightmare. Whatever you choose, make sure you have thorough tests with 100% code coverage. Good luck!
