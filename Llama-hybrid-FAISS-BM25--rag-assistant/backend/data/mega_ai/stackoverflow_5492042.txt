Jquery multiselect event handler

I have an html dropdown. I want to fire an event whenever the selection changes in any way. I tried registering a 'click' event but this didnt work when multi-selecting (either by dragging the mouse or holding down shift + down arrow). So basically, how can I fire an event on any selection change?
