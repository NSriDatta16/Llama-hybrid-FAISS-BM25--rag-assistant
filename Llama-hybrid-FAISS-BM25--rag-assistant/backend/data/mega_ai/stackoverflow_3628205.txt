If you have no problem with using a small PHP library, look at the answer to this question and do a header("Location:url") redirect depending on which result you get. If you'd rather use a .htaccess file, you could parse the USER_AGENT as shown in this question (it's aimed at mobile browsers but doesn't really matter). The PHP solution is much more convenient though.
