Why is every predicted $y_i$ in linear regression equal to $E[Y|X]$?

I have some loose intuition with this but I don't understand it Say we have a scatterplot of data in 2 dimensions. Then we can propose a mean model where, for all $x_i \in X$ the estimated $y_i = E[Y]$ or the average value of $y$ irrespective of $x$ . Then why are the estimated $y_i$ by the regression line equal to $E[Y|X]$ ? I feel like these two things are related but I don't understand whether 1) they are or 2) how so.
