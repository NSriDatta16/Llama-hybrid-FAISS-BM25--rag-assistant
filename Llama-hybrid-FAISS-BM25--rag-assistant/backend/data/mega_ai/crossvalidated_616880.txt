Prove that white noise + normality = independence

If the time series process is linear, then the ARIMA model is specified. The residuals from this model are $(1.)$ no autocorrelation $(2.)$ mean equals zero $(3.)$ constant variance. We say that this process is a white noise process. But under white Gaussian noise, how to proof no autocorrelation = independent? And how to proof the white noise from Gaussian distribution?
