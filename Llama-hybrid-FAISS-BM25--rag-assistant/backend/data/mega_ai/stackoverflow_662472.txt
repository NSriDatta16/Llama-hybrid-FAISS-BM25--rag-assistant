May I suggest you do use base64? It may not be the most efficient way to do it storagewise, but it does have its benefits: Your worries about the code are over. You'll have the least compatibility problems with other players, if there are any. Should the encoded string ever be considered as ASCII during conversion, export, import, backup, restore, whatever, you won't have any problems either. Should you ever drop dead or end up under a bus or something, any programmer who ever gets their hands on the comment field will instantly know that it's base64 and not assume it's all encrypted or something.
