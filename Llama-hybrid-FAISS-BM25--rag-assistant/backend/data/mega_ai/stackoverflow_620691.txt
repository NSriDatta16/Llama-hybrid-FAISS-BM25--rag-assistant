SharpDevelop is a good free IDE that has a lot of good functionality I wish was in VS2008 pro, Test Coverage comes to mind, but being an open source project somethings are missing, a lot of the special editors for example, I think for the most part this is because the audience it's intended for doesn't use them. The nice thing is this if it's important to you, you can write a plug-in and give back to the community.
