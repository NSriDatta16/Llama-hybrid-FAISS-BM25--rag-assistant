The logistic regression model is linear . It can only find an association between age and survival if the relationship is indeed linear. I'm going to explain this in two ways, first mathematically by relying on the definition of the logistic regression model, and second by a simulation study. Theory A linear relationship would for instance be present if a 10 year increase in age means you are twice as likely to die (or equivalently half as likely to survive). In logistic regression, this information is contained in the coefficients, which represent log-odds ratios . Odds are the ratio of two probabilities. Let's consider the odds of survival for a 35 year old individual: $$ \text{Odds}(\text{Age}=35) = \frac{P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid \text{Age=35})}{P(\text{Passenger dies} \mid \text{Age=35})} , $$ where the probabilities are predictions of the logistic regression model for the given variables, here only Age . Next, we consider the odds for an individual who is 10 years older: $$ \text{Odds}(\text{Age}=45) = \frac{P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid \text{Age=45})}{P(\text{Passenger dies} \mid \text{Age=45})} . $$ The ratio of both is called odds ratio and denotes the difference in odds of survival between a 45 and 35 year old: $$ \frac{P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid \text{Age=45})}{P(\text{Passenger dies} \mid \text{Age=45})} / \frac{P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid \text{Age=35})}{P(\text{Passenger dies} \mid \text{Age=35})} . $$ Referring to the example from above where a 10 year increase in age halves the chance of survival, the odds ratio would be $1/2$. The coefficient for Age in a fitted logistic regression model is closely related to this quantity: $$ \exp( 10 \cdot \beta_\text{Age}) = \frac{P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid \text{Age=45})}{P(\text{Passenger dies} \mid \text{Age=45})} / \frac{P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid \text{Age=35})}{P(\text{Passenger dies} \mid \text{Age=35})} , $$ where the factor 10 comes from the fact that coefficients consider a one unit increase, thus we have to scale the coefficient accordingly. If the assumption of a linear relationship between survival and age holds, we should obtain $$ \exp( 10 \cdot \beta_\text{Age}) = \frac{1}{2} \Leftrightarrow \beta_\text{Age} = 0.1 \cdot \log \frac{1}{2} \approx âˆ’0.069 . $$ Because the predicted probability of survival (death) given age is defined as \begin{align} P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid x_\text{Age}) &= \frac{\exp(\beta_0 + \beta_\text{Age} \cdot x_\text{Age})}{1 + \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_\text{Age} \cdot x_\text{Age})} , \\ P(\text{Passenger dies} \mid x_\text{Age}) &= 1 - P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid x_\text{Age}) , \end{align} we can derive that the logistic regression model is linear with respect the log-odds ratio: $$ \log\left( \frac{P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid x_\text{Age})}{P(\text{Passenger dies} \mid x_\text{Age})} \right) = \beta_0 + \beta_\text{Age} \cdot x_\text{Age} , $$ where $\beta_0$ is a bias (intercept) term. Most importantly, $\beta_\text{Age}$ is a constant, which always acts the same on age. In your example, you make a hard-threshold and assume that children do much better than adults, which would correspond to $\beta_\text{Age}$ promoting survival more for individuals of age less than 18 than for those older than 18. This clearly violates the result from above that the log-odds ratio is a constant for all ages. In conclusion, a standard logistic regression model cannot detect this effect accurately . By dichotomising age, you can actually model the desired effect because the odds ratio has the form $$ \frac{P(\text{Passenger survives} \mid \text{Age $ Simulation To demonstrate what the impact on prediction performance is, I carried out a simulation study. The dataset has two variables: gender and age . The coefficients have been chosen such that the odds ratio for survival with respect to females vs males is $3/2 = 1.5$ and odds ratio for Age $ Overall distribution of outcome: dead alive 124 76 Distribution of outcome among children ($ dead alive 2 25 Distribution of outcome among adults ($\geq 18$): dead alive 122 51 Fitting a simple linear logistic regression model and predicting survival on an independent test set of 200 patients, I obtained a ROC AUC value of 0.752 (1.0 is optimal).

The model is on the right path, but underestimates the impact of age. Doing the same for a model that in addition contains a dichotomised age variable, I obtained ROC AUC value of 0.796, which is quite an improvement. The corresponding model is Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -3.225066 0.719255 -4.484 7.33e-06 *** I(age In this model, it is obvious that age does not have a linear effect on survival, in fact, the coefficient for age is not significant any more. The dichotomised variable on the other hand is highly significant and has a large odds ratio. This demonstrates that the feature engineering can make or break a logistic regression model.
