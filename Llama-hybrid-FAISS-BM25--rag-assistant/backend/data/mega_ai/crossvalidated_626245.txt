Causality - Why do we typically have an exogenous noise term for every variable in SCMs?

I am working on Deep Learning so I will try to ask this question from that perspective. It seems that most recent works in CausalML uses the framework of SCMs, and that assumes each observed variable has one corresponding exogenous noise variable. Now my question is: Why do we always need exogenous noise? For example, what could go wrong with the following SCM? $$ \begin{aligned} X&= f_X(N_x)\\ Y&= f_Y(N_y)\\ Z&= f_Z(Y,N_z)\\ M&=f_M(X,Y,Z) \end{aligned} $$ where $N_i$ means noise. So in this example, $M$ has no variation from exogenous noise, but it is still "caused" by $X,Y,Z$ .
