Applications of Truncated Probability Distributions

Recently, I was wondering about how to "restrict" a statistical model from making predictions beyond a certain range ( Preventing Illogical Interoperations of Models? ). For example, in this video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5aPo5wXN8E&list=PLDcUM9US4XdNM4Edgs7weiyIguLSToZRI&index=3 @ 56:40), a Bayesian Model is created using the Log Normal Distribution when modelling human heights as heights can not take negative values. After spending some more time reading about this, I came across the idea of " Truncated Probability Distributions " ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Truncated_normal_distribution ). As I understand, a Truncated Probability Distribution is a Probability Distribution that is defined only on a "limited range" (i.e. "restricted"). For example, consider the Normal Distribution - we can "truncate" this distribution over the range $a - b$ : $$f(x; \mu, \sigma, a, b) = \frac{1}{\sigma} \cdot \frac{\phi\left(\frac{x-\mu}{\sigma}\right)}{\Phi\left(\frac{b-\mu}{\sigma}\right) - \Phi\left(\frac{a-\mu}{\sigma}\right)}$$ Where: $$\phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}x^2\right)$$ This leads me to my question: Suppose I collect some data on how long different people lived and the average amount of yearly income they earned in their life. Suppose I am interested in modelling (e.g. regression) the effect of income on life expectancy. In this problem, it is quite likely to observe an upwards trend in that people with higher incomes likely had the ability to access better quality healthcare and thus lived longer. However, it is also possible that if I use this model to predict the life expectancy of a billionaire, the life expectancy might be around 200 years - and we know that in modern history, no human has ever recorded to live that long. Thus, suppose if I found out the maximum age a human ever reached - to avoid making such illogical predictions, could I create a GLM Regression Model based on a Truncated Normal Probability Distribution between $a = 0$ and $b$ = max_age_ever_recorded and thus address this problem of illogical predictions? Is this a statistically valid approach? Or is this illogical or unnecessary? Thanks!
