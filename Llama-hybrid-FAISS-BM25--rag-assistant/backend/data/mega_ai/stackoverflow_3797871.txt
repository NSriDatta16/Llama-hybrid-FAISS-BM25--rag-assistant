Custom Selectbox (jquery script) - Non FF div scroll problem

I need a little help... After read and search for a while I discover a good jQuery plugin to deal with the selectbox custom style problems. I made some small modifications to make it work as I want. The plugin hide the custom select and append some div and ul tags. In Firefox 3.6.10 it works really nice , but in Chrome (6.0.472.63), Opera (10.62) when I tried to scroll down the selectbox list (in this case the div with an overflow) it disappears . It looks like a bug, could you check it please? Try to look around line 182: .blur(function() {...} I tried to make an example so I cleaned a lot of my custom CSS and make it all clear for anyone who wants to analyse it. view example HERE and please try it on FF and Chrome/Opera PS: I didn't pay much attention to IE... It will be another fight, but i'll keep it for later! Any help would be appreciated! Thanks for your time!! Cheers from Portugal
