Can you use this model for time series analysis? Theoretically, yes. But you would have to test your assumptions here before using this model for practical application. Here, you are assuming a deterministic component $Ct^3+Dt^4$ and a stochastic component which is modeled using an AR(2) process $$X_t=a_1X_{t-1}+a_2X_{t-2} + \epsilon_t.$$ You are also assuming the parameters of AR(2) process varying with time such that $a_1=At$ and $a_2=Bt^2$ . But I doubt that rainfall time series actually follows this model. First of all, there are periods with zero rain which are not captured by this model. Second, the deterministic component does not really capture the seasonality of rainfall. Here I suggest, using something like LOESS smoother to remove the seasonal component. Third, your data may contain long-term persistence (LTP). Therefore, I suggest using a more involved model such as FARIMA which can capture the LTP behavior. FARIMA also contains AR(p) model as a special case - parameters are constant in time. There is huge amount of work done for stochastic modeling of rainfall time series. You might find an adequate model in the literature. For example, Neyman-Scott model has been shown to preserve the first few moments of rainfall time series. Also note that AR processes exhibit qualitatively very different behavior for different parameter values. You may look at unstable AR processes for an example. The point is that if you are varying the parameters of the AR model with time, you are likely to get very different behaviors in time.
