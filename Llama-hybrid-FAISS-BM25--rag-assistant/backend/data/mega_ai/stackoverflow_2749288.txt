uploaded image doesn't change in the browser, although on the drive I have the new image

I have a View where I can upload an image and the image is also displayed in there like this: //ResourceStorage is a virtual directory that indicates to the pictures storage location ' alt='pic' /> after I upload the picture, on the hard drive I get the new "pic.jpg" but in the browser I still have the old one (I tried clearing the cache, doesn't help)
