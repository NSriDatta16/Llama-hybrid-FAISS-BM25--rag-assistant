Is a Time series' Model always an Additive or Multiplicative one?

A Time Series consits of four components trend, seasonality, cyclical and an irregular component. Now a time series can be decomposed in an Additive or Multiplicative Model. Are there other possiblities and does one in real world applications always try to decompose a series in these four components? Some enlightening is welcome!
