MCMC autocorrelation convergence diagnostic

I use MCMC (Metropolis-Hastings) to sample posterior distributions of three parameters using a nonlinear least-squares objective function to calculate the likelihood of a parameter sets. I want posteriors for about 500 different conditions, each time I calculate a posterior with MCMC. Since it is hard to check all 500 runs by hand for convergence, I would like to have a simple rule based on autocorrelation which indicates for each run if the chain converged or not, checking all conditions individually would be very cumbersome. Each chain has length 40000 (burn-in already removed) and I calculated autocorrelations for lags 1 to 10000. I then calculated the autocorrelation time as the time constant for the autocorrelation series (the first lag when the autocorrelation drops below 1/exp(1) ). I get autocorrelation times between 16 and about 7000. I suppose that with an autocorrelation time of 16 I can be sure that the Markov chain converged, but is there maybe some "rule of thumb" which tells me, given a chain of length 40000, which autocorrelation time is still "acceptable"? I searched and looked for instance here , however, the approaches I found require a visual investigation.
