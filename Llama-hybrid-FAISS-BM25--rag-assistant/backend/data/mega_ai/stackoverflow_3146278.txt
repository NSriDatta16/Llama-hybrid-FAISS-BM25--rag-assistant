Not totally understanding what you're doing, it seems like you're making extra work for yourself by using RelativeLayout. What you're trying to place on screen isn't relative to anything, it's based on a specific coordinate in the image, so even if you use one of the other layouts you're still essentially placing something in absolute coordinates. As for AbsoluteLayout being deprecated, from what I've read it's just to discourage it's use due to it's downsides relating to variable screen sizes. They have no intention of actually removing it, and even if they did you could just get the source and compile it into your project.
