Harmonic mean is less sensitive to outliers. Say that you have 3 numbers: 1 1 and 30001 Their arithmetic mean (average) is 10001 and their harmonic mean is 2 that is much closer to the majority of the points. So in a way, using an harmonic mean is more forgiving. A Bayesian look at the harmonic mean Assuming that the closer a point is, the more likely it is to be in a cluster. One can choose to model the distribution of distances from an origin point, as an Gamma-Exponential model with a priors $\alpha=m$ and $\beta=\frac{m}{\mu_0}$ where $\mu_0$ is the initial mean and $m$ is the strength of the prior. And given observations of $\{d_1,d_2,\dots,d_n\}$, the updated model's mean is: $$\mu'=\frac{m+n}{\frac{m}{\mu_0}+\frac{1}{d_1}+\frac{1}{d_2}+\dots+\frac{1}{d_n}}$$ We got our beloved harmonic mean. You could argue that the harmonic mean in k-means context is an assumption on the distribution of distances.
