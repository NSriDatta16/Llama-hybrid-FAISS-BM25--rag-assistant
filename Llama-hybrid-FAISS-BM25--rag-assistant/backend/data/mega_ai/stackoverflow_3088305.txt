Guid is by far the best choice for generating unique ids for something like a userid. They are absolutely guaranteed to be unique globally (hence the name). In order to best work with a clustered index you should use NEWSEQUENTIALID() . This generates sequential ids that can be appended to the index, and prevents sql server having to reorganise and page the index every time a value is added. There is a small security concern associated with using this function in that the next value in the sequence can be determined.
