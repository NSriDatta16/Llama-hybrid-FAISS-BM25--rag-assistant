No, because Quick Sort is slower than linear, and you add some more. O(n*log(n)) + O(log(n)) = O(n*log(n)) > O(n) Edit: Not precisely correct as pointed out, as worst case of Quick Sort is even slower with O(n^2). n*log(n) is best case and average case, which provides a lower bound is already slower than linear. The correct symbol might though be Î˜ instead of O.
