git prune is an excellent suggestion, good call Jefromi. Another thing you can do is compress your other files ; git gc ; decompress. 7z gets amazing compression, but won't preserve hardlinks and Unix owner/group, IIRC. If you have a quota, the files are probably all owned by your account, so no worries on the first score. But the safest is tar c --lzma if you have it, or just tar czf or cjf . If you have a lot of small files, the umm, external(?) fragmentation up to block-size might be significant.
