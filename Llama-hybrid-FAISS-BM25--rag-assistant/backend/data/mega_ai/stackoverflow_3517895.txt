Looking at the JW Player documentation , you'll need to make sure the image is in jpg, gif, or png format. You'll need to make sure you're not providing the image link as a php file when embedding JW Player. You can do this by using a simple URL rewrite. In a .htaccess file, you could use this code. RewriteEngine On RewriteRule ^path/to/image.png$ path/to/script.php [L] When embedding it in JW Player, you'll want to set the image as path/to/image.png.
