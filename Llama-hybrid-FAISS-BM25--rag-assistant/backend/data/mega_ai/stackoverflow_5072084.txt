Actually SEO suggests that you do not overuse the title of your blog, but rather make your post's title more important. That is why it is not a very good idea to use your blog title in a single post title as well. The header is an important part and the keywords of your post title should not be mixed with the title of your blog (because this makes them less important). However, rest assured that google already knows about these ideas and handles them properly. Therefore, i would advise you not to pay too much attention on such matters.
