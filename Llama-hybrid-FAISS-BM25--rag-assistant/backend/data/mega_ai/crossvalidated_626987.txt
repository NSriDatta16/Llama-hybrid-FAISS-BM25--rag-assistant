You are not saying what you learned from your ACF and PACF plots. Did this lead you to choose a particular ARIMA model? Do consider using an established auto-ARIMA tool: Selecting ARIMA orders by ACF/PACF vs. by information criteria In Python, pmdarima should work reasonably well, since it is a port of the forecast and fable packages in R which IMO constitute the gold standard in automatic time series forecasting. Your time series may well simply have a lot of residual variance, AKA "noise". You can't say that your ARIMA forecasts are "bad" just by comparing a holdout sample to forecasts - if there is a lot of noise, your ARIMA may do the best it can. See How to know that your machine learning problem is hopeless? Finally, you may be surprised at the fact that your ARIMA forecasts vary less than the time series. This is absolutely as it should be. ARIMA, just like any other forecasting/prediction/ML model, tries to disentangle the systematic forecastable components of your data from the unsystematic and unforecastable ones. If there are little systematic dynamics, then your forecast will not vary much. See Canonical duplicate for "Why do predictions vary less than observations?" and links therein. Per above, ARIMA may indeed be the best you can do. Alternatively, consider Exponential Smoothing. We have a collection of forecasting textbooks and resources here: Resources/books for project on forecasting models
