From what you've told us, this sounds a lot like a heirarchical binomial model. I'm going to assume that there is some population level mutation rate $\mu$ . Your sub-populations are thus samples from this larger population. Each group will have a slightly different mutation rate $\theta_i$ , but the expectation of the $\theta_i$ should be $\mu$ . Here is my stan model: data{ int num_groups; int y[num_groups]; int N[num_groups]; } parameters{ real mu; real kappa; real theta[num_groups]; } model{ theta ~ beta(mu*kappa,(1-mu)*kappa); y~binomial(N,theta); } And here is my sampling call library(rstan) options(mc.cores = parallel::detectCores()) y = c(33,66,15,20) N = c(540,100,213,32) num_groups = length(N) d = list(y = y, N = N, num_groups = num_groups) fit = sampling(model, data = d) bayesplot::mcmc_areas(as.matrix(fit), regex_pars = 'theta', prob = 0.8, prob_outer = 0.95) This results in the following plot: From this plot, we can tell that populations A and C are quite similar and populations B and D are quite similar (though we should be careful since there is still a lot of posterior variance). Overall, we estimate a 71% probability that the $\theta_D , but again we can't say for sure because there is a ton of posterior variance. One this is for sure, populations A and C are different than B and D.
