Transformations are like drugs ! Some are good for you and some aren't !. Haphazard selection of transformations should be studiously avoided. a) One of the requirements in order to perform valid statistical tests of necessity is that the variance of the errors from the proposed model must not be proven to be non-constant. If the variance of the errors changes at discrete points in time then one has recourse to Generalized Least Squares or GLM . b) If the variance of the errors is linearly relatable to the level of the observed series then a Logarithmic Transformation might be appropriate. If the square root of the variance of the errors is linearly relatable to the level of the original series then a Square Root transformation is appropriate. More generally the appropriate power transformation is found via the Box-Cox test where the optimal lambda is found. Note that the Box-Cox test is universally applicable and doesn't soley requite time series or spatail data. All of the above ( a and b ) require that the mean of the errors cannot be proven to differ significantly from zero for all points. If your data is not time series or spatial in nature then the only anomaly you can detect is a pulse. However if your data is time series or spatial then Level Shifts , Seasonal Pulses and/or Local Time Trends might be suggested to render the mean value of the error term to be 0.0 everywhere or at least not significantly different from 0.0 . In my opinion one should never willy-nilly transform the data unless one has to in order to satisfy (in part) the Gaussian assumptions. Some econometricians take logs for the simple and simply wrong reason in order to obtain direct estimates of elasticity's rather than assessing the % change in Y for a % change in x from the best model. Now one caveat, if one knows from theory or at least one thinks that one knows from theory that transformations are necessary i.e. proven by previous well-documented research , then by all means follow that paradigm as it may prove to be more beneficial that the empirical procedures I have laid out here. In closing use the original data, minimize any warping of the results by mindless transformations, test all assumptions and sleep well at night. Statisticians like Doctors should never do harm to their data/patients y providing drugs/transformations that have nasty and unwarranted side-effects. Hope This Helps . Data Analysis using time series techniques on time series data: a plot suggests a series that has structural change. The Chow Test yielded a signifciant break point . . Analysis of the modt recent 147 values starting at 1999/5 yielded with a Residual Plot with the following ACF . The forecast plot is . The final model is with all parameters statistically significant and no unwarranted power transformations which often unfortunately lead to wildly explosive and unrealistic forecasts. Power transforms are justified whrn it is proven via a Box-Cox test that the variablility of the ERRORS is related to the expected value as detailed here. N.B. that the variability of the original series is not used but the variability of model errors.
