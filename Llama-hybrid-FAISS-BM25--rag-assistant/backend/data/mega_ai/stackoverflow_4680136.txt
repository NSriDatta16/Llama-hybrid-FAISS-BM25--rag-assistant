Sharepoint 2010 Content Organiser Condition String xml

I’m working with the Sharepoint 2010 Content organiser and setting the conditions property programmatically. It's the EcmDocumentRouterRule.ConditionsString property which accepts a string representation of the following xml fragment: I have a Content Type with column called 'Crisp Name'. When its value is ‘quavers’ it should carry out some action. I think the issue is getting the right operator value, but I don't know which one should be used. The Content Organiser rule gets created successfully but when I try and edit it in Sharepoint I get a runtime error. If I remove this condition from my code I am able to view and edit the rule in Sharepoint as expected. I need the condition to make use of Equals, have tried a few variations including ‘==’ and ‘Eq’ not sure what it is that’s missing here. This is quite an urgent requirement any help would be greatly appreciated
