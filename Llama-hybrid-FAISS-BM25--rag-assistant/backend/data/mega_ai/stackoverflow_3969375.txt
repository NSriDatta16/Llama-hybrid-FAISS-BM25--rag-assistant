Leveraging WPF's CombinedGeometry in code

I have a requirement for 2D geometric boolean operations in a non-WPF application. I know you can use WPF assebmlies in a non-WPF application. Can the CombinedGeometry and PathGeometry object be used to perform boolean operations on geometric data? Currently I am doing my boolean operations manually, and it is very unstable. I was hoping to increase stability (albeit at the expense of performance) by using these objects.
