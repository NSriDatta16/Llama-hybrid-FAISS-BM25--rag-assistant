I admittedly know very little about this subject, but just to point you in a direction: Have you looked at the cluster package? It has very good documentation. In particular, look at help(agnes) for some suggestions. Martin Maechler (a member of the R core team) created the package and has contributed to Stack Overflow discussions before, so hopefully he'll provide an answer here. The hclust() function is part of the stats package. In fact, I believe that there are plans to merge hclust() and agnes(). You may also find this page from the Bioconductor project helpful . Otherwise, you may have some luck looking at other packages on the CRAN Clustering , Natural Language Processing or Machine Learning views.
