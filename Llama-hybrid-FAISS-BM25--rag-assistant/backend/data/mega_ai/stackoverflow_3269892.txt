Use something other than files for session management. PHP allows you to overwrite the handler. I use memcache. There is a PECL extension for it as well: http://www.dotdeb.org/2008/08/25/storing-your-php-sessions-using-memcached/ Here's another article on it: http://www.ducea.com/2009/06/02/php-sessions-in-memcached/ UPDATE To address issues from the comments: This allows you to use a central set of memcache machines for sessions. Instead of each server looking locally at its filesystem, it will look to a central memcache cluster you define. The memcache cluster can be as many machines as you like, to avoid a single point of failure. Here is an example config from php.ini: extension=memcache.so memcache.allow_failover = 1 memcache.redundancy = 1 memcache.session_redundancy = 2 ; Use memcache as a session handler session.save_handler = memcache ; Use a comma separated list of server urls to use for storage: session.save_path="udp://:11211?persistent=1&weight=1&timeout=1&retry_interval=15"
