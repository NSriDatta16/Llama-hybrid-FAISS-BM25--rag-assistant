I agree the authors didn't do a great job of clarifying this. My best guess is that the regression model looks like: $y_i \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu=f(x_i), \sigma^2 = g(x_i))$ where $f$ and $g$ are neural networks (or more precisely, probably two branches of the same neural network). I'm not sure I understand your concern about the uncertainty bands on the BBB network. It seems that you can just sample $\theta$ from the variational posterior, given $x$ , sample $y$ according to the above model, repeat the previous some large number of times, compute the 25 and 75% percentile of the sampled $y$ .
