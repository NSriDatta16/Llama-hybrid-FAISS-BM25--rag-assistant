Great articles/videos/... on non-ACID (distributed) systems? ("Eventually Consistent" etc.)

I'll start with these - IMO brilliant - articles: Base: An Acid Alternative - by Dan Pritchett (eBay), 2008 Eventually Consistent (- Revisited) - by Werner Vogels (Amazon), 2008 Brewer's conjecture and the feasibility of consistent, available, partition-tolerant web services (non-free) - by Seth Gilbert, Nancy Lnych (MIT), 2002 I'm interested in more articles on distributed systems, where ACID can't deliver the necessary scalability/availability anymore (or even, where ACID can still deliver in extreme cases). The articles should focus on the practical side (even though I like maths). One thing I'd find especially interesting: Which rules of thumb / design patterns / ... can be derived from non-ACID architectures?
