The units of the average of a quantity is always the units of the quantity itself. Your mistake is in the way you're interpreting the average. Suppose, we want to take the time-average value of a quantity (say "mass"), which is a function of time, $M(t)$ between times $t_1$ and $t_2.$ The time-average value is $$ \langle M\rangle = \frac{\int_{t_1}^{t_2} M(t) dt}{t2 - t1}. $$ The numerator has units of "mass*time" and the denominator has units of "time". Thus the overall units of the average is "mass". What you're doing is making the approximation that the mass is constant over a period of two days. If $t2 - t1$ is a period of two days, with a constant value $m$, then the integral becomes $m (t_2 - t_1) / (t_2 - t_1) = m.$ You're still doing the integral above, but it's a piecewise integral of constant values in each of their time windows. That's the approximation you're making. If we have times $t_0, t_1, t_2, \dots, t_N$ in equally spaced increments with $t_i - t_{i-1} = \delta t$, and approximate $M(t) \approx m_i$ for $t_{i-1} $$ \begin{split} Var(M) &= \frac{1}{t_N - t_0} \int_{t_0}^{t_N} (M(t) - \langle M \rangle )^2 dt \\ &\approx \frac{1}{N \delta t} \sum_{i=1}^N (m_i - \langle M \rangle)^2 \delta t \\ &= \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N (m_i - \langle M \rangle )^2 \end{split} $$ which is just the sample variance.
