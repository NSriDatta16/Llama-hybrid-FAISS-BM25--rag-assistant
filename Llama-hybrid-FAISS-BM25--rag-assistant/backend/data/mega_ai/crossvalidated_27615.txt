Logistic regression: Is it valid to code NA as 0?

Hi I have the following problem: I plan to do a logistic regression on web traffic data. One of my attributes is Number of days since last visit (type numeric in R). Now lots of visitors are firs-timers and I have no data for this attribute. Should I code them as NAs, or is is valid to code them as 0s? Thank you all
