RNADE vs MDR vs BART vs Bayesian Linear Regression

I'm looking at a collection of problems where I need to forecast the probability of a continuous variable. My dependent variables are a combination of categorical and continuous. It looks like there are four primary candidate areas I should be reviewing and/or testing. Can anyone here shed any light on the relative strengths and risks associated with each of RNADE, Mixture Density Networks, Bayesian Additive Regression Trees, and standard Bayesian Linear Regression?
