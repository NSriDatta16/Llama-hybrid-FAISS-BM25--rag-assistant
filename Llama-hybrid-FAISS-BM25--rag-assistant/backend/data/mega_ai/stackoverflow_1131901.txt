myGeneration problem with OraOleDB.Oracle provider (?)

I can't make myGeneration tool to work correctly. This is the connection string that I use: Provider=OraOLEDB.Oracle.1;Password=pass123;User ID=user1;Data Source=oradb1src;Persist Security Info=True And when I click on Test connection I get: [System.Data.OleDb.OleDbException] - ORA-12154: TNS:could not resolve service name [oradb1src is well defined in tnsnames.ora. That is not the problem.] But when I change the provider to MSDAORA, then connection works fine, but in the Generate window I'm missing the Tables tab on which I should be able to choose tables from my database. I've red somewhere that this is normal with MSDAORA provider, cause mygeneration uses oledb provider for meta data retrieval. But, why do I get this insane error message when using OralOLEDB.Oracle provider??? Does anyone know? Thank you in advance... PS. I have drivers for oracle 9.2 and oracle 10 installed on my computer.
