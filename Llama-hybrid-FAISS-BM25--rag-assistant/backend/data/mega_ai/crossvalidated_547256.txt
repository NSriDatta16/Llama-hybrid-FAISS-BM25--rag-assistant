The simplest explanation for your first question is that the "seven" in "an additional seven years" is a misprint and should have been "five." Such things happen. What follows assumes that was a misprint. For the second question, the issue is the distribution of censoring times. The assumption seems to be no loss to follow-up during the study, with all cases censored at the end if there has been no event . Those with events ( $T+T_S \le T_{\text{cutoff}}$ in your terminology) do not contribute to the distribution of censoring times. All those censored thus have censoring times between 5 and 8 years. You do have one related point. If you have uniform accrual of all cases and randomly remove the cases with events, what's left for censored cases won't be a uniform accrual in any one instance. Averaged over many hypothetical study instances as for this power estimate (1000 instances in the book's example), and with random "accrual" of individuals who do and don't experience events, however, the effect should be a uniform distribution of censoring times between the limits of 5 and 8 years. I can't say that it will be exactly uniform (perhaps someone else can show that), but it will be close enough for a useful power analysis--particularly given all the other assumptions that necessarily must be made.
