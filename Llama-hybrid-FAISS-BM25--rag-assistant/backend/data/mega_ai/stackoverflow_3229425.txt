This is going to be my last attempt to answer your question. Pay attention. This is how you should manage your persistent vector. static Vector data; static PersistentObject disques = PersistentStore.getPersistentObject(0x9e6d76868a999451L); } public static int test() { data = (Vector) disques.getContents(); if (data == null) { System.out.println("Disques is empty!!"); data = new Vector(); disques.setContents(data); } else { System.out.println("Disques contains: " + data); } data.add("This is question " + data.size() + "\n"); disques.commit(); } Each time test is called, it fetches the persistent object's value and checks that it has been initialized. If it has not been initialized, it initializes is to an empty Vector. Then it adds one question to the vector an commits the changes. If you don't understand this, I'm sorry but I'm not prepared to spend any more time trying to explain. And I DEFINITELY am not prepared to spend any time trying to unpick the random mess that your application has turned into.
