Really Big Numbers and Objective-C

I've been toying around with some Project Euler problems and naturally am running into a lot that require the handling of bigger than long long type numbers. I am committed to using Cocoa and Objective-C (I need to stay sharp for work) but can't find an elegant way (read: library) to handle these really big numbers. I'd love to use GMP but is sounds like using it with Xcode is a complete world of hurt. Does anyone know of any other options?
