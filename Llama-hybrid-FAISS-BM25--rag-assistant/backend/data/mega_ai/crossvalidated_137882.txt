There is no solution to your question. For data science you need make some experiments for your data samples and check changes. It's hard say what will be better for any data. You can test your overfitting in simple way. Try in every iteration compute error for training sample (blue graph) and for test sample (red graph). You can test it for full data sample and for data sample with removed some features. This trick can help you to see which was better for you.
