I used cURL to get the file into a string (simple_html_dom::load_file just wraps file_get_contents) then using simple_html_dom load (from string) method to parse it. That works for some URL's but it is failing in this case when the URL has a parameter string. It is fetching the URL as if it had not a parameter string. I set an agent with curl to impersonate a browser but no dice. Sorry this is not an answer really, but maybe using curl will work for some people for whom the fopen setting is a problem.
