Do I need a model catalog or feature store if experiments are being tracked?

Here are some uses I've found for each case: The model catalog lets you document the use case, the machine learning framework that was used to train the model, the version of that framework, and the algorithm used along with its hyperparameters.- Link A feature store is a tool for storing commonly used features. When data scientists develop features for a machine learning model, those features can be added to the feature store. This makes those features available for reuse. - Link Experiment tracking is the process of saving all experiment-related information that you care about for every experiment you run. - Link From my understanding, good experiment tracking would track models (thus documenting the use case) and training data (thus storing the features). What's the point of the model catalog and feature store then?
