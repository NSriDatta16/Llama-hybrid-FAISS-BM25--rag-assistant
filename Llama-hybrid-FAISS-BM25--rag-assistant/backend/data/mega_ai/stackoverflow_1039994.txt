If you work on records in a single database, consider performing the work within the database itself using stored procedures. The gain for processing the records on different machine might be negated by the cost of retrieving and transmitting the work between the database and the computing nodes. For file processing it could be a similar case. Working on files in (shared) filesystem might introduce large I/O pressure for OS. And the cost for maintaining multiple JVM's on multiple machines might be an overkill too. And for the question: I used the JADE (Java Agent Development Environment) for some distributed simulation once. Its multi-machine suppord and message passing nature might help you.
