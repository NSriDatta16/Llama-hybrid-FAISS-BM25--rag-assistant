R and System calls

I have used R in the past to do very basic calls to the commmand line. The example can be found here . This time around, I am looking to mimic this code which runs successfully from the command line in Windows: > cd C:\Documents and Settings\BTIBERT\My Documents\My Dropbox\Eclipse\Projects\R\MLB\retrosheet\rawdata > bgame -y 2010 2010bos.eva >2010bos.txt This is the code I am trying to run inside of R. I have already set the working directory inside of R. dir 2010bos.txt") I am sure this is user error, but what am I doing wrong? It appears to work initially, but returns the following error. I very well could be doing something wrong, but I believe I am using the same commands. Expanded game descriptor, version 109(185) of 05/08/2008. Type 'bgame -h' for help. Copyright (c) 2001 by DiamondWare. [Processing file 2010bos.eva.] >2010bos.txt: can't open. Warning message: running command 'bgame -y 2010 2010bos.eva >2010bos.txt' had status 2 Any help you can provide will be appreciated.
