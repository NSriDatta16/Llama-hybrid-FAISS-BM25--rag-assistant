jQuery Sparklines: Automatic zero-centering for bar charts

I am using jQuery sparklines to display a bar chart, e.g.: 11,13,14,15,13,12,15,11,10,13 The problem is that jQuery is using the lowest value, i.e. 10, as a reference and is only displaying a very small bar for it (as if it was 0), while the other bars differ significantly in size (although the values are almost equal). What I am looking for is an option that tells jQuery to use 0 as a reference, i.e., automatically zero-center the bars. The option zeroAxis: true is not doing the trick. A workaround would be to add a 0 manually to each bar chart, i.e.: 0,11,13,14,15,13,12,15,11,10,13 But maybe there is a more elegant way. Any help is appreciated! Thank you very much! Felix
