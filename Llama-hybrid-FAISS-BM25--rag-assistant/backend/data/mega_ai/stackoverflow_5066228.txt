A faster variation of Martin Morgan's solution to the first part: rep(1:5,5:1) [1] 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 5 unlist(lapply(1:5,function(x) x:5)) [1] 1 2 3 4 5 2 3 4 5 3 4 5 4 5 5 Roughly 7 and 3 times faster respectively. I'm not sure I follow what you mean in the second part, but the following seems to fit your description: lapply(bar,function(x) rep(x,length(x)))
