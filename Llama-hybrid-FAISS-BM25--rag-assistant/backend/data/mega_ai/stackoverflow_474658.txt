You'll be happiest if you block all these collections inside a single class and don't expose them in any way. This means moving your search and lookup routines into this class as well. For storage, everybody's covered iterating, add a hashtable and a lookup. I put this comment on nickolai's post: Store new Integer(ix + iy * 1000) as the value in your hash table. If your y index can go over 1000 use a bigger number--ints are really big. To get it back use ix=val%1000, iy=val/1000. If your array and hashtable are encapsulated in the same class, the rest of your code will be pretty easy to write and a lot cleaner.
