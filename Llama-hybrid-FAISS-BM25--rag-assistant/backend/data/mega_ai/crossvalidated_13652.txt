If I understand the graph correctly it is a plot of the number of clusters, K on the x-axis and the within clusters distance on the y-axis? Because your K-means objective function is to minimise the WCSS, this plot should always be monotonically decreasing. As you add more clusters, the distance between points in the cluster will always decrease. This is the fundamental problem of model selection, so you need to employ a bit more sophistication. Perhaps try the Gap statistic: www-stat.stanford.edu/~tibs/ftp/gap.ps or others like it. Furthermore, you may find that K-means isn't the right tool for the job. How many clusters do you expect to find? Using the variance rule for dimensionality reduction for clustering is not appropriate. See this paper for when projecting onto the first K-1 PCs is an appropriate preprocessing measure: http://people.csail.mit.edu/gjw/papers/jcss.ps You can quickly see if this is the right thing to do by plotting the projection onto the first two principal components. If there is a clear separation then K-means should be ok, if not you need to look into something else. Perhaps K-subspaces or other subspace clustering methods. Bare in mind these methods apply for Euclidean distance. I'm not sure how this changes for cosine.
