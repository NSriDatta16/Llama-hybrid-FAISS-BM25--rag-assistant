How to select NIB for view controller in xcode4?

I have created a universal window based application in xcode 4. Additionally I created a FirstViewController class with a FirstViewController.xib file. I dragged a Navigation Controller to the objects panel for the MainWindow_iPhone.xib . I want the root controller to be the FirstViewController so I selected it in the custom class property. I now want the view to be loaded from FirstViewController.xib but I can't select it in the NIB name selector, it just is not listed there. When I type it in it says that it is not intended to be there. The strange thing is that exactly this procedure worked for me in xcode 3.2.6 Any ideas?
