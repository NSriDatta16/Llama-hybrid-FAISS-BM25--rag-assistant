Returning an HTML form as a resource representation tightly couples your presentation and data. It would give you more control if you simply return the basic resource representation (which could be HTML, but I wouldn't expect it to have form elements), and then rely on my client to mark up the data in a way that's editable in HTML. Additionally, if you were to return an HTML form with the resource marked up in it, how would the form data be sent back to the server? Browsers typically only support POST and GET for form actions - but doing a POST to a resource that already exists isn't RESTful; you would want to be doing a PUT instead. Until browsers support all (or at least more) of the HTTP methods, using RESTful APIs with browser forms directly will be fundamentally broken (at least within the bounds of REST constraints). Edit: To answer your question of how you would actually have the client inform the server about how it wants the resource back, you would use content negotiation . Based on the request headers the server returns the resource in an appropriate format. It might use the user agent from the header, or the client might specify a specific Accept header that the server can obey. It's up to you and your server application to process the header(s) and return the appropriate HTML representation, if available. Edit2: Redacted my statement about returning a form not being RESTful, see comments below.
