There is a hidden cost in removing elements from an ArrayList. Each time you delete an element, you need to move the elements to fill the "hole". On average, this will take N / 2 assignments for a list with N elements. So removing M elements from an N element ArrayList is O(M * N) on average. An O(N) solution involves creating a new list. For example. List data = ...; List newData = new ArrayList(data.size()); for (Iterator i = data.iterator(); i.hasNext(); ) { Object element = i.next(); if ((...)) { newData.add(element); } } If N is large, my guess is that this approach will be faster than the remove approach for values of M as small as 3 or 4. But it is important to create newList large enough to hold all elements in list to avoid copying the backing array when it is expanded.
