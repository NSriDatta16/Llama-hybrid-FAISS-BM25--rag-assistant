This sounds like a possible intervention to me. I would guess an abrupt permanent intervention. So basically you need to identify a point where you think the "breakpoint" is starting - this can prove to be tricky. I would suggest that you look at the lockdown restrictions as well as number of coronavirus cases in the country at that time - this might help you to identify the "breakpoint". After doing this, make sure that the time series up until that point is stationary - this is now if you are using an ARIMA or SARIMA model. Obtain a model for the pre-intervention time series. Then you can "add" the intervention part to the model. If your parameters for the intervention is insignificant, it is likely that, that is not the best possible intervention to use then. Apart from abrupt permanent interventions, there are also gradual permanent and abrupt temporary interventions. I believe the parameter for abrupt permanent interventions is $\omega$ . This is the parameter that should be statistically significant i.e. smaller than 0.05 if you are testing at 5% significance level. This could actually even be an abrupt temporary intervention, but difficult to say since we don't know how long the virus will continue and there affect the price that you are referring to.
