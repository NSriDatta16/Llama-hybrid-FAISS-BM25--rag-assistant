If simply embedding the file inside the XML file is not a solution then adding a url field that the interpreting program reads should be added- you're basically asking for the equivalent of an include(menu.xml) or require(xml), but in an XML file. So since you are writing the program that is intepretting the file you can add an tag or whatever you want to call it that you will read and insert menu.xml's root note the place of the . Good luck and may your programs always compile.
