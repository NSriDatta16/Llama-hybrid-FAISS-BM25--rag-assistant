I would strongly recommend considering to integrate the other way around: your C++ application into Python. A good article on the tradeoffs of extending vs. embedding . Also, re the Django/web server part, it's not always recommended to have a monolithic application that's too large. Consider breaking the web-serving part into a separate application, purely Django on Python, that will communicate with your main application via either OS files or sockets, or some other IPC. You're still welcome to add Python to your main application (by extending or embedding) for the other needs.
