The video from Josh Bloch mentioned by yrp is a classic - I second that recommendation. Some general guidelines: DO define your API primarily in terms of interfaces, factories, and builders. DO clearly specify exactly which packages and classes are part of the API. DO provide a jar specifically used for compiling against the API. DO NOT rely heavily on inheritance or the template method pattern - over time this becomes fragile and broken. DO NOT use the singleton pattern or at least use it with extreme caution. DO create package and class level javadoc explaining usage and concepts.
