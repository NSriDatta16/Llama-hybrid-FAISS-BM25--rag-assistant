MySQL Sub-query.. Doesn't provide proper information after 3 entries into table

After I get 3 rows in my forum_threads table this no longer does it's job. Which is to organize a list of active forum threads and put the most recently responded-to thread at the top of the list, followed by second most recent posted-to thread, followed by third, fourth, etc. Like I said, the query works wonders up until there is a fourth row added to forum_threads . SELECT forum_threads.*, forum_posts.thread_id FROM forum_threads INNER JOIN ( SELECT MAX(id) AS id, thread_id as thread_id FROM forum_posts GROUP BY thread_id ORDER BY id DESC ) forum_posts ON forum_threads.id = forum_posts.thread_id
