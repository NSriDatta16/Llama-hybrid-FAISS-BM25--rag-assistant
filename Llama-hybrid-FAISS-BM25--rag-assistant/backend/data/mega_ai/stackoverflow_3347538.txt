The advantage is you can set up the dialog however you need (multiselect, initial directory, extensions) etc in the form designer. Also the form designer makes it so easy to drag an OpenFileDialog onto your form that many developers just do it. Can't really blame them. There's no significant advantage or disadvantage to either approach, I doubt you'll find any perceivable performance difference.
