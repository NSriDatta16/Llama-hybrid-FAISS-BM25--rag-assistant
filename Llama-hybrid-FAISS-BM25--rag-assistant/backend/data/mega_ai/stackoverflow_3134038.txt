I wouldn't recommend attaching images to an email....it's one of many flags to email service providers that you're sending spam. Best to do as listed in Marcos' solution and link from another server via absolute URL. Remember also to avoid the obvious email no-nos that will get you black flagged. It only takes one questionable email to raise a flag with a spam filter that will aggressively report you to the RBL's. And trust me, it's not fun to get off those lists! My company sends tens of thousands of emails on behalf of our clients every day. We tried embedding at one point for a test, and found that more than 50% of our emails were either undeliverable or lost in the "great abyss" of spam filtering. By linking, we're at well over 85% deliverablility, depending of course on the quality of the emails provided.
