You might check into the "workspace/.metadata/.plugins" directory to find the RSE plugin's data storage area. It will probably have an xml file or something with the reference to your project. Back it up and delete the reference. Hopefully this will remove it from your view. Sorry I cannot be more specific, this is just a suggestion that I am not able to try explicitly. Good luck, and like I said, back up the files you change... just in case.
