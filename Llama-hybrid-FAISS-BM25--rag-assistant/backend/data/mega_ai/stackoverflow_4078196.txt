Using the xml-maven-plugin offline

I have configured the xml-maven-plugin to run with a locally defined XSLT schema, in order to validate all XSLT files defined in a project: org.codehaus.mojo xml-maven-plugin 1.0-beta-3 validate-xsl validate test ${project.build.resources[0].directory} ${project.build.testResources[0].directory}/schema-for-xslt20.xsd **/*.xsl However, once I yank out the network cable it does not run succesfully: [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.codehaus.mojo:xml-maven-plugin:1.0-beta-3:validate (default-cli) on project projectdotnet: Failed to load schema with public ID null, system ID /home/robert/..../src/test/resources/schema-for-xslt20.xsd: src-resolve: Cannot resolve the name 'xs:schema' to a(n) 'element declaration' component. -> [Help 1] I've read that this could be solved by using an XML catalog , but I did not find any complete reference for this to work with the plugin. How can I make this validation work offline?
