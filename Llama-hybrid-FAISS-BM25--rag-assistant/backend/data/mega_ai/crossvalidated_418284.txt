Logistic regression is what you want to deal with the fact your dependent variable is bounded between (0,1). Dummy variables is what you will want to use to deal with your variables in string format. If you are interested in interpretability and avoiding overfitting consider grouping your categorical variables together. For example, instead of having a dummy variable for each country, consider grouping your countries into continents (or another grouping that you think it is valid). Interpreting a model with seven covariates representing continents as opposed to 195 covariates representing countries will be much easier.
