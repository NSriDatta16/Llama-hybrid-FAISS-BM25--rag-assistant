Rails is angry that I am instantiating a child from a parent class

I have an object Animal, and when I pass in a type I choose one of the subclasses and instantiate it there. So something like: class Museum::Animal def initialize type case type when "cat" CatAnimal.new when "dog" DogAnimal.new end end end But Rails is giving me the error: Expected ..file path ../animal.rb to define Animal The file in question is in lib/museum/animal.rb
