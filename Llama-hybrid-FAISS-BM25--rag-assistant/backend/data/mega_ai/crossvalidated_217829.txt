Bootstrapping: 632 vs n/2

Suppose I have $n$ individuals which are all either male or female and for each of which we can determine some quantity $X$. I want to decide whether there's a statistically significant difference in $X$ between males and females. Bootstrapping is one possibility to arrive at a $p$-value. When I read about bootstrapping, people usually recommend picking $n$ individuals with replacement at random, such that on average each bootstrapping sample contains $0.632n$ unique individuals. At the firm I work for, people perform bootstrapping by picking $n/2$ individuals $without$ replacement. What are the advantages and disadvantages of these two possibilities? Which of the two gives me a better estimator of the "true" $p$-value?
