You do not need Byte Arrays, Strings would be just fine. How often you would add items to this cache? I am guessing it is completely static, since they are not making new cities or airports every day. So, what you can do is using two MultiHashMaps, one keying on the city and another keying on airports. Checkout Google Multimap http://google-collections.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javadoc/com/google/common/collect/Multimap.html If you are using mySQL by any chance, you can actually use a table based on Memory Storage Engine. Many Databases can pin a table in memory, definitely Oracle can, so that is another way to go.
