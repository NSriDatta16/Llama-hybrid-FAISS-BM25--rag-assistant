URL fetch service - is https secure or not?

I'd like to use the URL fetch service for app engine (java). I'm just sending a POST to one of my own servers from a servlet. AppEngine -> post-to: https://www.myotherserver.com/scripts/log.php I'm reading the url fetch doc: Secure Connections and HTTPS An app can fetch a URL with the HTTPS method to connect to secure servers. Request and response data are transmitted over the network in encrypted form. The proxy the URL Fetch service uses cannot authenticate the host it is contacting. Because there is no certificate trust chain, the proxy accepts all certificates, including self-signed certificates. The proxy server cannot detect "man in the middle" attacks between App Engine and the remote host when using HTTPS. I don't understand - the first paragraph makesit sound like everything that goes from the servlet on app engine, to my php script is going to be secure if I use https. The second paragraph makes it sound like the opposite, that it won't actually be secure. Which is it? Thanks
