From a personal perspective, rather than a data science experience, a false positive has a higher impact on the patient's quality of live than a false negative (at least in most applications of medical image processing. We're not talking about lab results here). Let's look at a concrete example: tumor screening . A false negative means that an early-stage tumor has more time to grow and develop into malicious cancer. Overall this process takes a long time and each subsequent screening has a higher chance to detect it, but realistically the long-term health of a patient suffers. Additionally, there's always a human involved in diagnosing. Medical image processing at it's current technological stage is meant to be a help for medical personell, not a substitute . It's often meant to point out lesions or changes in tissue that are so subtle that a human might overlook them. There's no chance a doctor would overlook an advanced stage tumor. They don't need image processing for that. In terms of medical procedures, if a tumor doesn't become inoperable before the next screening, there's no big difference between removing an early-stage tumor or one that had a little more time to grow. The amount of tissue removed is more, but the kind of operation is often the same. (This assumes that the patient does regular health screenings.) A false positive has many implications that are not all directly related to an ailment: Additional procedures. After an imaging process yields a positive result, more tests are conducted for which blood or tissue is extracted (biopsy). Objectively speaking the body of the patient is damaged to be able to verify the imaging result. Fear. Lab tests take time. The person affected often lives through several days, sometimes weeks, of uncertainty weather or not the lesion is actually cancer. Many people who have experienced such a false positive describe this event as "traumatizing" and suffer from health-related anxiety for a long time. Time investment. If verifying the imaging result via lab tests or similar takes several examinations, the patient and doctors have to invest time for them. Even if it takes only one test, there are several people involved, including nurses, doctors and lab technicians. In a time when doctors are chronically overworked, this should be avoided if possible. Unnecessary medication. In the worst case the patient is treated for an ailment they don't even have and their body is put under unnecessary strain by side effects of medication. Loss of effect. Medical personell will ignore true positive results if a procedure yields too many false positives (as explained in other answers). This risk-benefit-evaluation shows that a false negative includes less risk for a patient than a false positive. Therefore the priority of reducing false positives is generally higher.
