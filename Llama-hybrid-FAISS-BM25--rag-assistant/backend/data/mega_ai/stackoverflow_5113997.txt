Svg 1px-width line for background

I need to underline each line in a paragraph. multi-line text multi-line text multi-line text single-line text Here is a style: .underline { width: 100px; font-size: 12px; line-height: 16px; background: url("underline.svg"); } And underline.svg It works fine, but when I'm trying to zoom page in Google Chrome I'm getting something like this . Note that a second paragraph looks fine. But there is a strange thin line on top of multi-line paragarpah. And other lines are fuzzy. The problem is that when I'm converting this html to pdf (by wkhtmltopdf) and printing it, I'm getting strange artefacts (some lines becomes too thin, there is also a thin line at a paragraph top). How to get exact 1px-width line? Thanks!
