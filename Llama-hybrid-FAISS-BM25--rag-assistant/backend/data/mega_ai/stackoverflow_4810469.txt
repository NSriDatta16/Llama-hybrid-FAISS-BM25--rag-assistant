In my previous company (CMMi process), about 100 developers/testers/integrators work with ClearCase (CC) with 3 full-time administrators (add 2 voluntary part-time ). Unless you use the configuration management part ( baseline ), you should move on modern SCM. The baseline feature is powerful : in traditional SCM , when you update/rebase you get the lastest revisions by default. A baseline is a set of software component at certain 'compatible' revision to make sure the build is ok. In some way, it's like dependency build (ie Maven, Ant Ivy) . When developers rebase (update) on baseline, they get what should be "buildable". Now looking back from my new company (Agile shop), we use SVN and Mercurial and I think CC was daily pain. With CC to work on a project (repository), you have a create a view , create an activity, then check out a file . Some colleagues were afraid to make branches :) . With SVN and Mercurial, we don't have such some problems with their GUI clients. Developers commit 10 times on a daily basis. Versus on CC people would check in once a day. Indeed CC has a lot of overhead and slow network latency, high licence cost and need full time administrator. So what's the benefits except the configuration management. On Mercurial, the workflow is lighter. For our current project, one messed up by committing non source files. The Hg history is immutable. We have no administrator. One developer re cloned a new project in half day. In Clearcase , you would need to ask an expert just to back up a deleted file :). To create a new repo, you ask your admin :) After moving away from ClearCase, now I'm really happy with SVN and especially Mercurial. So moving from ClearCase to Mercurial will be really lightweight in terms process, €€ and you get more productivity. Now the choice between SVN and Mercurial ? You should ask yourself whether centralized or decentralized repository. You can do a quick search on stackoverflow. I came to dislike IBM Rational products in favor elegant open source solutions. If you read this and understood it, you should title "Upgrading from clearcase to svn-mercurial" . Added : Clearcase is behind the recommendability threshold , while Mercurial, Subversion & Git are clearly recommended. http://martinfowler.com/bliki/VersionControlTools.html You can also to combine Mercurial & Clearcase. Read the paragraph "Multiple VCS"
