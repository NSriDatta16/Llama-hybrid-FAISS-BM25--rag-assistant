Customizing how a form outputs a field to a widget in django

I have a custom field called HourField, which lets you enter "1:30" to represent one and a half hours. The clean() method turns it into 1.5 for the FloatField in the model. This all works fine. Now I'm having a problem where when I want to create a formset, that field gets rendered as "1.5" instead of "1:30" which is what I want. Is there some kind of method similar to clean() but works the other way around? edit: using another type of storage method is out of the question. I have a few other custom fields I have made which are stored as one type of object, but are entered by the user as a string. I used the example above because it was the most straight forward.
