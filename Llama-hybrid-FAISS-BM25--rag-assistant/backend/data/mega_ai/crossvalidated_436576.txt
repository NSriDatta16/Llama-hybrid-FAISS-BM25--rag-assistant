Bayesian update vs optimization

Say I have a multivariate normal vector $$ r \sim N(\mu , \Sigma ) \Rightarrow Pr \sim N(P\mu , P'\Sigma P ) $$ and I observe that $$ Pr = Q $$ Now I can use Bayes rule to calculate the updated mean of $r$ using the formula mentioned here $$ E(r | Pr = Q) = \mu + \Sigma P'[ P \Sigma^{-1}P']^{-1 }[Q - P\mu] \quad \quad (i) $$ This is the same expression as would be derived if you minimized \begin{align} \min_{\tilde r} & ( \tilde r - \mu)'\Sigma^{-1}( \tilde r-\mu) \quad \quad (ii)\\ \text{subject to } & P \tilde r = Q \end{align} My question : why does the constrained minimization (ii) give the same result as the bayesian updating case (i)? Is there a conceptual link? I think it is related to MLE or MAP estimation but havent been able to link the two together.
