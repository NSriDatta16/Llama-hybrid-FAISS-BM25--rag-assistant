Despite a number of good comments, one point seems to have been overlooked in the discussion. When there are unobserved or missing data, the likelihood of the model can be specified without problems, so the ML estimation is feasible. Meanwhile, regular OLS is not feasible, i.e. it does not work with unobserved or missing data (perhaps some modification of OLS could work, though). One example is the MA(1) model: $$x_t=\varepsilon_t+\theta \varepsilon_{t-1}$$. The $\varepsilon_t$ is unobserved for any $t$. Thus there is no way you can run a regular OLS regression; the right-hand-side variables needed in it "are not there"; OLS is not feasible. Meanwhile, you can specify the likelihood function for this model, and maximize it (so you get the maximum likelihood ). That is why ML may be more natural than OLS for some time series models.
