PhoneGap: It's possible to use only the phonegap.js and it's functions only in a Website (doesn't want an App only a Webpage)?

It seems that I haven't understood correctly how PhoneGap works. I thought: Take an index.html , include the PhoneGap.js in as type of JavaScript and open the result on iPad/iPhone. But then, none of the functions like accelerometer, beep(), vibrate() is working. Is it necessary to build an app for that for working correctly? I have a Webpage and I want only include the functions of PhoneGap so that the iPad can recognize if it was shaken or a draggable HTML Element was touched and thrown at an other place on screen. Is sencha able to do that and is it the better choice? Greetz and Thanks! Markus
