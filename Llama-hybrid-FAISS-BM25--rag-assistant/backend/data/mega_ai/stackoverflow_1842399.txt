Short answer: yes! It's been my experience that valid, semantic markup actually works better with IE6. Combine this with correct, valid, and simple CSS and you're pretty much golden. Sure you're bound to encounter some strange behavior in IE6, especially for more complex designs, as noted above. However, most of these bugs are well documented . With simple, valid code, identifying and fixing these issues is often fairly simple. Conditional comments, as noted above, certainly work, but developing valid code will prevent you from peppering your code with all sorts of conditions. Still can't make it work? Degrade gracefully! Sure rounded corners are pretty and all the rage, but the 20% (hopefully less) of your users who are still living in the dark ages probably won't miss them.
