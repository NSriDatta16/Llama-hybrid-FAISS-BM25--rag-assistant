Accuracy of deep neural network

I have implemented a deep neural network which performs the classification task and obtained accuracy for each epoch as follows In graph, X-axis is number of epochs and Y-axis is accuracy obtained According to graph highest accuracy obtained is 90%, lowest is 0% and average is nearly 40% But now what will be the overall performance(accuracy) of the model How to choose best hyper parameters according to the performance of the model
