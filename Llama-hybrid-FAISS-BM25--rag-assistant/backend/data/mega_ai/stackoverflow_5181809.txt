Algorithmic staff scheduling solutions

At a gross level, the problem is simple: schedule an army of staff for one-person-per-day coverage, at any given day the staff is split into 3 pools, each staff has a vacation requirement, each staff has at most 2 shifts per week, etc. I'd hate to do this manually as it has been done at my organization for centuries. I'd love to do something cool like genetic algorithms (eg [1] http://www.sersc.org/journals/IJAST/vol14/1.pdf ). Are there any reliable Open source / free alternatives out there? This also sounds like an optimization problem, can I fire up C++, R, etc to plug into some optimization library for this? thanks
