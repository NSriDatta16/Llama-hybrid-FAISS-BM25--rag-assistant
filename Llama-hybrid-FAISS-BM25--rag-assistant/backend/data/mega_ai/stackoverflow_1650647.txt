Don't mess with relational databases unless you're forced to use them by external factors. Look at Python's pickle , shelve . Shelve is fast and scales well. It eliminates messy conversion between Python and non-Python representation. Edit. More important advice. Do not get bogged down in technology choices. Get the locations, items, characters, rules, etc. to work . In Python. As simply and correctly as possible. Do not burn a single brain calorie on anything but core model, correctness, and a basic feature set to prove things work . Once you have a model that actually works , and you can exercise with some sophisticated unit tests, then you can make technology choices. Once you have a model, you can meaningfully scale it up to millions of locations and see what kind of storage is required. The model can't change -- it's the essence of the application. Only the access layer and persistence layer can change to adjust performance.
