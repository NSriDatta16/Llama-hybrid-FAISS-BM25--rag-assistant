C# simple app create enormous number in page faults. Why?

Have simple C# console app which imports text data into SQL. It takes around 300K in memory and 80% in CPU. There are 2Gb RAM available at any time and yet the Page Fault shows 500K. The app is 32 bit and OS is either W2000 or XP 32 bit and .NET 3.5 Anyone can explain what could be the problem and how can I investigate this further? EDIT: I am now certain that the page faults are related to the disk I/O (read). I commented out SQL part and the pure disk read generates that high number alone. EDIT2: There are 200 hard faults/sec and 4000 soft faults/sec on average. I wonder if the same would appear on W2008
