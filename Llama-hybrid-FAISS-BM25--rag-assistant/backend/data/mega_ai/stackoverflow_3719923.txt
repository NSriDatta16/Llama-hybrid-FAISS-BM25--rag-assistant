As I explained in an answer to your previous question (and another question that was closed as a duplicate): iAd appears in simulator but not on device Apple will reject your application if an iAd is within a table cell. iAds are required to be in a static position on the page, and not in any kind of scroll view (this includes table views). This is because iAds pay by impression as well as by click, so having an iAd in a table view cell will cause it to be reloaded whenever it scrolls off and on screen again, which could be many times. This would seem like "click-fraud" or similar behaviour . Apple will not allow this. I have emphasised the important part of the text. iAds pay by impression in addition to click. Table cells are unloaded/reloaded when scrolled off/on screen. Reloading will cause a new request. A new request will generate a new impression (if successful). A new impression will generate revenue. In addition to this, iAds in table cells are more likely to be accidentally clicked, because they can move with the table - their position is not fixed. This section of the Apple iAd Network Contract describes fraudulent behaviour: Disallowed artificial enhancements include, but are not limited to, (a) encouraging user Clickthroughs on banners with offers of cash, prizes or anything else of value in exchange for services (collectively, “Inducements”), or (b) application design that encourages or is reasonably likely to lead to accidental or unintended Clickthroughs by the user (“Unintended Clickthroughs”). I have emphasised clause (b) that would apply in this situation. I am 99.999% certain Apple will reject an application that places iAds in table view cells.
