As with any PHP script - you're free to include files wherever you feel like. However you might want to use the built in autoloader in Magento. I'm pretty sure Magento uses Zend for autoloading. (Either way it's available to you) Zend, unlike Magento, have good documentation. Check it out here http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.loader.autoloader.html
