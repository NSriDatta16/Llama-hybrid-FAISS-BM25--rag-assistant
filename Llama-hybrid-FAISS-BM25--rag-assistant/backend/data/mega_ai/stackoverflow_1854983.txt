Subclassing NSWindow or NSWindowController will work. Similarly, you can subclass NSView and override its event-handling methods. What's a very good book to start learn MacOS Programming? Learn Objective-C on the Mac by Dalrymple is really straightforward, covers enough basics and moves fast enough to get you off the ground in a short bit. It touches on everything from Xcode and Interface Builder to OOP and Objective-C practices. Particularly helpful to beginners (IMHO) are the source file organization and Foundation kit chapters. Best of luck!
