Gitosis/Gitolite Setup

I have an issue with gitosis and gitolite which I have spent many hours researching to no avail. After following setup instructions closely for both products, the common symptom is that the target repository is not being located properly through gitosis/gitolite: This fails: $> git clone gitolite@example.com:testing Cloning into testing... fatal: 'testing' does not appear to be a git repository fatal: The remote end hung up unexpectedly While this works: $> git clone gitolite@example.com:~/repositories/testing Cloning into testing... warning: You appear to have cloned an empty repository. So specifying the full path works, but this would indicate that somehow we are not running through gitosis/gitolite. Another possibly related symptom of the problem is that when I connect to the server via ssh after the installation, my connection freezes with this message: $> ssh gitolite@example.com PTY allocation request failed on channel 0 Also, when I execute "ssh gitolite@example.com info", I keep getting the GNU info instead of gitolite's info (which I can get if I run '/usr/local/bin/gl-auth-command kreeble' as gitolite on the server). I have confirmed that in user gitolite's .ssh directory, authorized_keys has only one entry which puts me through the gitolite command: command="/usr/local/bin/gl-auth-command kreeble",no-port-forwarding,\ no-X11-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-pty ssh-rsa long_key_base64_here \ user@machine.local Any ideas on why I would not be presented with the gitolite prompt? I would appreciate any thoughts on this problem, thank you!
