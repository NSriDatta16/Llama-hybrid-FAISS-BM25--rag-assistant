"Compressing before upload" implies doing it in the user's browser -- but no text in your question addresses that! It seems to be about compression in your GAE app , where of course the data will only be after the upload. You could do it with a Firefox extension (or other browsers' equivalents), if you can develop those and convince your users to install them, but that has nothing much to do with GAE!-) Not to mention that, as @RageZ's comment mentions, MP3 is, essentially, already compressed, so there's little or nothing to gain (though maybe you could, again with a browser extension for the user, reduce the MP3's bit rate and thus the file's dimension, that could impact the audio quality, depending on your intended use for those audio files). So, overall, I have to second @jldupont's suggestion (also in a comment) -- use a different server for storage of large files (S3, Amazon's offering, is surely a possibility though not the only one).
