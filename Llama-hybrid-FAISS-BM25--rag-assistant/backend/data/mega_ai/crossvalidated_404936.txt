Paired vs. Pooled Inference... When is it okay to pair samples?

I understand that paired tests are usually done on sampling distributions that have some sort of linkage. But is there a definitive way to differentiate when to use a paired t test vs. pooled? The basic example I can think of is when sampling the same group twice, before an experiment and after. But once this gets extended to multiple samples I have difficulty conceptualizing the different uses of each test. Elementary explanations are encouraged (currently in a 2nd year university applied stats course.)
