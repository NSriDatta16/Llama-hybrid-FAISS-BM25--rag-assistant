What does the MyProject folder contain? Does this need to be added to Source Control

I am adding my code to source control (SVN). I am trying to organize my projects and solutions to fit with the SVN best practise. I obviously don't want to add junk and stuff that changes for every user. What exactly does the MyProject folder contain. This seems to be something that Visual Studio creates and maintains. It seems to contain assembly and reference information. I assume that this should be under version control. I have looked at other question but no one has mentioned the MyProject folder. Last Thing. I have two projects in my solution. One for the code and one for the unit tests. This creates a bit of a weird structure and naming problem for SVN. SVN best practise suggests repo |- Project |-trunk |-branches |-tags Which leaves me with repo |- Project X |- trunk |- Project X |- Unit Tests |-branches |-tags Now I have project X repeated in the repo structure. Not a train smash but it feels untidy. Is there a way to reconcile visual studio solution/project layout with the SVN repo layout. Should I just rather try to rename the either the project in visual studio or rename the lower Project X to source? Or should I just live with it? Any suggestion would be most welcome.
