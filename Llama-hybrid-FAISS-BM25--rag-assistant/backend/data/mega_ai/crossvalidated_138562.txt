MCMC: The posteriors are too narrow

I have this very simple MCMC there I have -an initial state and a posterior -loop : - add or subtract (each prob 0.5) a small number from the current state - compute posterior - move if the posterior if better - otherwise, move with probability proportional to the ratio of the posteriors The problem is that my posteriors are very narrow. Can I modify the last step to allow moves to less desirable areas of the space ?
