Gaussian process - posterior covariance matrix

In Gaussian Process, what is the posterior covariance matrix? Let's use terminology from Rasmussen & Williams 2006 (Gaussian processes for machine learning): Say we have Gaussian process $f \sim \mathcal{N}(\mu, K)$ , and a likelihood function and a matrix of its second derivatives: $W = -\frac{\partial^2}{\partial^2 f} p(y|f)$ . Then $K$ is the "prior" covariance matrix. What is then the covariance matrix of the posterior estimates of $f$ ?
