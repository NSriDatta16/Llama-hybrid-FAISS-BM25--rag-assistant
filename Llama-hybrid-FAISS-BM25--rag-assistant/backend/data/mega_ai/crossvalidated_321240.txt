Statistics in the context of Search Engine Optimization (SEO)?

I did my undergrad degree in math and am working on a masters in statistics, and have little to no background in SEO. I have a decent background in master's-level statistics (i.e., linear models and Casella and Berger's text). I was wondering if there are any texts focusing on statistics and/or machine learning with a Search Engine Optimization (SEO) emphasis . There are many, many books out there on SEO, but they tend to be very non-technical and seem to be more written at a high-level perspective. I am not interested in books on the various tools (e.g., Google Analytics) that are out there; I am interested in books that focus on statistical and machine learning techniques for SEO. Alternatively, I could learn all about time series, machine learning (which I'm currently doing), causality, and accumulate domain knowledge on top of that, but if there's something that currently exists out there which covers this material in the context of SEO... that would be excellent.
