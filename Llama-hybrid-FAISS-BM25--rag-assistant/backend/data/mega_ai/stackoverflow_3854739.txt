My App calls scrollViewDidScroll 19 times

I have an app based on Apple's PageControl sample. The first time the view loads, the scroll view is loaded with page 0 and page 1. Whenever a scroll is initiated, the scrollViewDidScroll method should get called by UIKit correct? When initiating a scroll from page 0 to page 1, the app should load page-1, page and page+1, (to prevent flashes during scrolling). My app seems to call scrollViewDidScroll 19 times and my loadScrollViewWithPage: method 19 times each with page 0 and page 1, before it finally gets to page 1 and 2, then it crashes. These are the methods: - (void)scrollViewDidScroll:(UIScrollView *)sender { NSLog(@"scrollviewdidscroll"); // We don't want a "feedback loop" between the UIPageControl and the scroll delegate in // which a scroll event generated from the user hitting the page control triggers updates from // the delegate method. We use a boolean to disable the delegate logic when the page control is used. if (pageControlUsed) { // do nothing - the scroll was initiated from the page control, not the user dragging return; } // Switch the indicator when more than 50% of the previous/next page is visible CGFloat pageWidth = scrollView.frame.size.width; int page = floor((scrollView.contentOffset.x - pageWidth / 2) / pageWidth) + 1; pageControl.currentPage = page; // load the visible page and the page on either side of it (to avoid flashes when the user starts scrolling) [self loadScrollViewWithPage:page - 1]; [self loadScrollViewWithPage:page]; [self loadScrollViewWithPage:page + 1]; // A possible optimization would be to unload the views+controllers which are no longer visible } - (void)loadScrollViewWithPage:(int)page { if (page = kNumberOfPages) return; NSLog(@"page: %i", page); // replace the placeholder if necessary KeyboardViewController *controller = [viewControllers objectAtIndex:page]; if ((NSNull *)controller == [NSNull null]) { controller = [[KeyboardViewController alloc] initWithPageNumber:page]; [viewControllers replaceObjectAtIndex:page withObject:controller]; [controller release]; } // add the controller's view to the scroll view CGRect frame = scrollView.frame; frame.origin.x = frame.size.width * page; frame.origin.y = 0; frame.size.height = scrollView.frame.size.height; controller.view.frame = frame; [scrollView setAutoresizesSubviews:YES]; [scrollView setAutoresizingMask:UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleWidth|UIViewAutoresizingFlexibleHeight]; [scrollView addSubview:controller.view]; } Why would scrollViewDidScroll get called so many times? Thanks
