You should also encourage research before actually setting out on writing code. I usually approach problems by thinking about a way to do it, then I try to find anything in the standard library or any other libraries that will help me out. I'd say that an hour of research in some cases can be worth days of coding. If people aren't doing this, it may be a good idea to have someone ask them questions about their general approach to the problem and what library functions/classes they are thinking about using. If they're missing something obvious, suggest it to them.
