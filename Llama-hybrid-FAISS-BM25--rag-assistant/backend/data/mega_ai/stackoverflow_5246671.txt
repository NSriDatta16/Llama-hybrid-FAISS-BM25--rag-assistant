Documentation is a whole skill set by itself. Good naming methodologies are good, as are consistency so that there aren't any changes across the database in regards to your style. Besides using SQL Diagrams or something, the best thing is a good document that explains the tables and columns. Define the overall structure and relationships between objects/tables/columns. Give explanations if concepts are more complicated, but make it easy for someone to say 'what does this column do?' and find that answer quick without having to read through a paragraph or two to understand.
