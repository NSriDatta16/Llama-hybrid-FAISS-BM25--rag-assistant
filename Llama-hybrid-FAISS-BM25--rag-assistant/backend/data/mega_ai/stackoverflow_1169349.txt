Part of my program destroys the cursor and renews it every frame (it changes very rapidly), and on OSX it takes at least 1 frame to register the mouse's position (wheras on PC it registers the mouse position right on startDrag() initiation). By waiting at least a frame before destroying the cursor again it worked out.
