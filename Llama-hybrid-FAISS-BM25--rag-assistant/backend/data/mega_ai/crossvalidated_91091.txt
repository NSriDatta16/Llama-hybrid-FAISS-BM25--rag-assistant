One-vs-All and One-vs-One in svm?

What is the difference between a one-vs-all and a one-vs-one SVM classifier? Does the one-vs-all mean one classifier to classify all types / categories of the new image and one-vs-one mean each type / category of new image classify with different classifier (each category is handled by special classifier)? For example, if the new image to be classified into circle, rectangle, triangle, etc.
