You can interrupt a sleeping thread with Thread.interrupt() . Now stopping a thread is deprecated - what if the thread is holding a lock to something? (There was a Thread.stop() , but it is HIGHLY discouraged). Alternatively, instead of sleeping, you can have your thread wait for an object to be notified with a timeout, and simplify notify the object if you want the thread to wake up.
