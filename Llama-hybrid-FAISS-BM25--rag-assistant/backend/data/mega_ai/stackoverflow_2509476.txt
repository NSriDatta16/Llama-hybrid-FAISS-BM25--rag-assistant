The specified type member 'EntityKey' is not supported in LINQ to Entities

I have 2 Entities "UserProfile" and "Agent", they are 1-many relationship. I want to do a query to get a list of Agents by giving the userProfileEntityKey. When I run it, I got this "The specified type member 'EntityKey' is not supported in LINQ to Entities" error. public IQueryable GetAgentListByUserProfile(EntityKey userProfileEntityKey) { ObjectQuery agentObjects = this.DataContext.AgentSet; IQueryable resultQuery = (from p in agentObjects where p.UserProfile.EntityKey == userProfileEntityKey select p); return resultQuery; } So, what is the correct way to do this? Do I use p.UserProfile.UserId = UserId ? If that's the case, it's not conceptual anymore. Or should I write object query instead of LINQ query?
