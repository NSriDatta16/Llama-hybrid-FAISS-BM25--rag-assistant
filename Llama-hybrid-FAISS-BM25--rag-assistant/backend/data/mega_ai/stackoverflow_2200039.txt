If you are in control of both the input and output side of this DB then you should be able to verify that your data is UTF-8 on whichever side you like and implement constraints as necessary. If you are dealing with a system where you don't control the input side then you are going to have to check it after you pull it out and possibly convert in your language of choice (Perl it sounds like). The database is a REALLY good storage facility but should not be used aggressively for other applications. I think this is one spot where you should just let the MySQL hold the data until you need to do something further with it. If you want to continue on the path you are on then check out this MySQL Manual Page: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/regexp.html REGEX is normally VERY similar between languages (in fact I can almost always copy between JavaScript, PHP, and Perl with only minor adjustments for their wrapping functions) so if that is working REGEX then you should be able to port it easily. GL! EDIT: Look at this Stack article--you might want to use Stored Procedures considering you cannot using scripting to handle the data: Regular expressions in stored procedures With Stored Procedures you can loop through the data and do a lot of handling without ever leaving MySQL. That second article is going to refer you right back to the one I listed though so I think you need to first prove out your REGEX and get it working, then look into Stored Procedures.
