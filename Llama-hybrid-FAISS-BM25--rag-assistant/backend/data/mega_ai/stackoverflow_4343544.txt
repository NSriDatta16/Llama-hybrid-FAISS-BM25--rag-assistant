Generating tags to different location by pathogen

I use pathogen for organizing my vim plugins. I git clone the plugins from github into the vimbundles directory. This way it is simple to update them. I have problem with the tags generated by pathogen. If the plugin does not have the tags included in its code, pathogen generates them by calling pathogen#helptags() . The tags are generated into the doc folder of the plugin. These files then figure as untracked in git repository. Do you know a way how to generate tags into a different location? All tags could be on the same place, the goal is not to have them generated to the directory where the plugins live. Can pathogen be convinced to do so?
