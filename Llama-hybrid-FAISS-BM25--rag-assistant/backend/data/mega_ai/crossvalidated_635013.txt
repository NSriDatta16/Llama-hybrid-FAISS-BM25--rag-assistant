A few thoughts. First, what you describe as Table 1 often is just supposed to be a summary of your study population. For that Table, it might be most useful to your readers to report the raw male/female values and differences, along with indications of how much data was missing for each variable by sex. You can then (perhaps in supplemental data) describe the similarities and differences between the raw and imputed estimates. Second, your jump to Wilcoxon tests probably isn't necessary. Think about each male/female comparison as a simple linear model, with a coefficient representing the estimated male-female difference. What's needed for inference is a normal distribution of the sampling distribution of that coefficient estimate, not of the data themselves. You can evaluate how close that sampling distribution comes to a normal distribution by resampling. See this Penn State course page on the Central Limit Theorem, and its examples of resampling. With 1200 observations that assumption should hold pretty well for most or all your variables. Third, the Wilcoxon test is only a test of stochastic ordering in values between males and females. Although it's sometimes described as a test on medians, that isn't strictly true unless the two distributions have the same shape and only differ by a shift in location . Differences in means, as recommended by Thomas Lumley in another answer, are much more useful. Fourth, the Wilcoxon test can be considered a special case of ordinal logistic regression . That also doesn't evaluate means or medians; in your situation is would estimate the log-odds of a value from a male being higher than one from a female. The coefficients, estimated by maximum likelihood, have asymptotically normal distributions. Ordinal regression has the further advantage of applying to general multiple regression models. Fifth, Rubin's Rules work when the estimates being pooled have approximately (multivariate) normal distributions. If (following the second point) the coefficient estimates of male-female differences have close to a normal distribution or if (following the fourth point) you use ordinal regression with asymptotically normal distributions of coefficient estimates, you can use Rubin's Rules directly rather than try to pool p -values For situations in which the estimates can't be assumed to have an approximately normal distribution, transformations to something approaching a normal distribution can help. See for example Section 5.2 of Stef van Buuren's Flexible Imputation of Missing Data . In particular, the p -value pooling noted in the page you link is based on a way to try to transform the p -value distribution to a normal distribution. I'd expect direct pooling of model coefficients and their variances to be more reliable, particularly with only 10 imputed data sets.
