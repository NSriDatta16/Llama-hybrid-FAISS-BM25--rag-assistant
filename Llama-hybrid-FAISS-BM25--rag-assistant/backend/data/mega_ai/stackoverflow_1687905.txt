sorting elements javascript

I'm looking for a way to sort my elements, but it isn't as easy as it sounds. Please let me explain My elements are grouped per 6 elements (thumbnails), each x represents a thumbnail However all thumbnails are inside one div xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx xx The first column (6 x's) is visible and when you click on a button the next column appears and the old one disappears. If it happens that the ammount of x's is not possible to devide with 6, e.g. you have 11 x's, then it adds filler elements (o's) xx xx xx xx xx x0 If each element no matter thumbnail or filler represents a number in which order their added in this 'table' then it looks like this 1,2 3,4 5,6 7,8 9,10 11,12 13,14 15,16 17,18 However I want to have the latest thumbnails (1->6) on the initial page. as they are the latest (newest thumbnails) so I want to show them first. (ordered by 'date') Which means the previous 'table' needs to be like this: 1,2 7,8 13,14 3,4 9,10 15,16 5,6 11,12 17,18 Now the difficulty is that it should re-order the thumbnails no matter how many columns there are whether there are only 2 columns or 10 columns. Here's a live link of the problem (2 columns, 7 thumbnails and 5 fillers): link text then click on gallery and you'll see 'column' 1 (6 thumbnails) all the elements (thumbnails and fillers) are insert into an array (javascript) so I would need to change it's position for each element with JS (or jquery if easier for you) I know this isn't really a simple question, I tried my best to explain if you have any questions regarding the question feel free to ask and I'll answer asap. edit: OK I'm a lot closer thanks to Vincent Robert. My array of objects (my thumbnails are in here) just now needs to be ordered the way it does with Vincent's array of numbers. I tested out his method which orders the elements of the array to their perfect place. They use the number as index, but I don't have that. Anyone know how to do this?
