MyApplication::Application.routes.draw do get "project/index" get "project/new" get "project/create" get "project/update" get "project/delete" get "project/destroy" get "project/edit" The problem was somehow created by the Routes.rb file. I had a catch-all routes line for my routes at the bottom of my routes.rb file - this is something which is now deprecated in Rails 3.0 and Rails 3.0 now encourages resource routing. When i generated my Project Controller, it added these get lines into the routes file. these get lines correspond to the actions that i defined when i generated the controller through the console. Whereas the show action was generated manually, and hence fell back to the last line.
