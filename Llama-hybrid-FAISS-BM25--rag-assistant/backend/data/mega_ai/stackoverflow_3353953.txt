I'm not sure the retrieval of the query plans will answer the question: the query plans hide a part of the complexity about the computation performed on the data before it is returned (or used in a filter); the query plans require a significative database to be relevant. In fact, complexity, and length of execution are somewhat oppposite; something like "Good, Fast, Cheap - Pick any two". Ultimately it's about the chances of making a mistake, or not understanding the code I've written? Something like: number of tables times (1 +1 per join expression (+1 per outer join?) +1 per predicate after WHERE or HAVING +1 per GROUP BY expression +1 per UNION or INTERSECT +1 per function call +1 per CASE expression )
