Random effect with zero SD in LMM

In my mixed-effects model there are one fixed effect and two random effects (subject and time of measurement). fit Now for some DVs variance and standard deviation for random effect time are 0. On pages 10/11 of his book (lme4: Mixed-effects modeling with R) Douglas Bates wrote: An estimate of 0 for σ does not mean that there is no variation between the groups. (...) The estimate, σ1 = 0, simply indicates that the level of “between-group” variability is not sufficient to warrant incorporating random effects in the model. The important point to take away from this example is that we must allow for the estimates of variance components to be zero. We describe such a model as being degenerate, in the sense that it corresponds to a linear model in which we have removed the random effects associated with Batch. Degenerate models can and do occur in practice. Even when the final fitted model is not degenerate, we must allow for such models when determining the parameter estimates through numerical optimization. So I do not entirely understand what that means for me. On the hand it sounds like it's not justified to include time as a random effect ("..not sufficient to warrant incorporating random effects in the model"), on the other hand it sounds as if it's OK for variance/SD to be zero (as long as interpreted correctly). Can you help me with the correct interpretation of the paragraph?
