The problem began when you sought a reduced model and used the data rather than subject matter knowledge to pick the predictors. Stepwise variable selection without simultaneous shinkage to penalize for variable selection, though often used, is an invalid approach. Much has been written about this. There is no reason to trust that the 3-variable model is "best" and there is no reason not to use the original list of pre-specified predictors. P-values computed after using P-values to select variables is not valid. This has been called "double dipping" in the functional imaging literature. Here is an analogy. Suppose one is interested in comparing 6 treatments, but uses pairwise t-tests to pick which treatments are "different", resulting in a reduced set of 4 treatments. The analyst then tests for an overall difference with 3 degrees of freedom. This F test will have inflated type I error. The original F test with 5 d.f. is quite valid.
