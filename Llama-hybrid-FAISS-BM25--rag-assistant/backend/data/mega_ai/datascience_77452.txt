Training set of a NN that classify Cat or Not Cat

Is it possible to build a Convolutional Neural Network (using Keras, Tensorflow) that can give output as 1 for an image of a Cat and 0 for everything else? How would the training set look like? I mean, let's assume if the number of images of the Cat is ~1 million, then the number of images of " not a Cat" should be potentially trillion or even more. More importantly, what classes of images should I include in the images that are labeled as "not a Cat", e.g. Dogs, Tigers, Zebras, Trees, Computers, Galaxies, etc? Doesn't it mean that we should have an infinite number of training samples that represent "not a Cat"?
