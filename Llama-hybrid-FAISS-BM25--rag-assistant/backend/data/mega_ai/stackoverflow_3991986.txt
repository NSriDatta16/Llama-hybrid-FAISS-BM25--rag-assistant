jQuery.tmpl returns an HTMLElement wrapped in a jQuery object, which could be used in the same way as rendered strings were in the old template system. var $template = $('#template'), html = $.tmpl($template, data).get(); I suspect that this might actually be faster than regular strings, but I don't have any profiling data for this yet. Update I did some basic profiling between Mustache.js and jQuery.tmpl, and the stats do not look good. I started with 1,000 preloaded records and generated templates for them several times, averaging the results. Mustache.js: 1783ms jQuery.tmpl: 2243ms I might wait until jQuery.tmpl closes that gap before switching.
