Access: More performant, particularly in regards to queries Better support of relationships beyond simple parent-child. Much easier to secure than XML files Straightforward upgrade path to SQL Server if there is a need. XML: User editable outside of the application Easier integration with third-party tools Lightweight retrieval of data, no signficant extra libraries to load. Really, I don't see a good reason to use XML files as the main data store of your application - you'll quickly run into roadblocks and gotchas. In that case Access is clearly the preferred method. For configuration information ABOUT your application, however, XML is probably an overall better solution.
