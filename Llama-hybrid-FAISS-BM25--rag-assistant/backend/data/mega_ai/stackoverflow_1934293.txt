An alternative approach is to use a floating point number as the ordering field. That way, if you want to put a comment in the middle of the thread, you just compute the average value of the previous comment and the next one, and use it for the ordering field of the comment you're inserting. There's of course a limit to how much times you can do division on a floating point before you start getting the same values, but that can easily be solved by periodically multiplying all the order fields by i.e. 2.
