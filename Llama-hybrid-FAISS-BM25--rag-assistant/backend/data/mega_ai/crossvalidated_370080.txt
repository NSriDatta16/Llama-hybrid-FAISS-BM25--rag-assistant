Compare same time serie from two different sources

I'm looking for a method to check if a time series obtained from one source is equal to same time series stored in another source. Let me explain the case: I have a data logger that gets data from 5 sensors and uploads these data to a central system. Along the upload process, can occurs some problems that may origin differences between original series and stored ones. So I would like to calculate some kind of statistical indicator (like a CRC in communications) that I can send along with time series and allows me to compare this indicator with the one calculated from time series stored. Thanks for your help in advance!!
