Maybe you should organize your code more into classes and objects? As I was writing this, Jimmy showed a class-instance based answer, so here is a pure class-based answer. This would be most useful if you only ever wanted a single behavior; if there is any chance at all you might want different defaults some of the time, you should use ordinary object-oriented programming in Python, i.e. pass around class instances with the property p set in the instance, not the class. class Aclass(object): p = None @classmethod def init_p(cls, value): p = value @classmethod def meth1(cls): # some code res = cls.meth2() # some more code w/ res @classmethod def meth2(cls): # do something with p pass from a import Aclass as ac ac.init_p(some_command_line_argument_value) ac.meth1() ac.meth2()
