The first test tells you that the odds ratio between A and B, ignoring C, is different from 1. Looking at the stratified analysis helps you decide whether it's all right to ignore C. The CMH test tells you that the odds ratio between A and B, adjusting for C, is different from one. It returns a weighted average of the stratum-specific odds ratios, so if these are $ 1$ in others, they could cancel out and erroneously tell you there is no association between A and B. So we must test whether it is reasonable to assume that the odds ratios are equal (at the population level) across all the levels of C. The Breslow-Day test of interaction does exactly this, with the null hypothesis that all strata have the same odds ratio, which need not be equal to one. This test is implemented in the EpiR R package. The Breslow-Day p value of .14 means we can make this assumption, so the adjusted odds ratio is legitimate. But this doesn't help us decide between CMH and Fisher's exact (or Pearson's $\chi^2$) tests. If the Breslow-Day test was significant, you would need to report stratum-specific odds ratios. Since it's not, you need to ask whether it's necessary to adjust for C. Does C "confound" the association between A and B? The heuristic I learned (not a statistical test) was to check whether the proportional difference between the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios is more than 10%. Here, $\frac{1.75-1.56}{1.75}=0.108$ so CMH is appropriate.
