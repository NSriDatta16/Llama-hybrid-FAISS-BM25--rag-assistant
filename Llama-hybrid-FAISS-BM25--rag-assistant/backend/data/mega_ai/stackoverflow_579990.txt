The big issue is maintenance and updating of the application. If you have multiple instances running you have to maintain/upgrade all of these, this becomes even more of a hassle if they are geographically located in different areas. The overall trend in the business software industry right now is centralizing your application to your own servers and providing software as a service to your customers. The only real reason I could see for having to run an application at your customers site is: if it is handling sensitive information and the company has policies restricting remote storage of that data. If you are concerned about hardware costs you could look into cloud hosting services like Amazon s2 , Google App Engine , and Microsoft Azure .
