I personally would never develop a site outside of a framework for anything more than a single page brocure-ware site. I work so much faster inside the framework. I'm a Python/Django developer but here's my take. I've done some small non-framework sites with PHP and I don't know how PHP frameworks compare to DJango, but if they're anything alike the fact remains that I'm far more proficient developing within a framework than to code something from scratch by hand. It helps me stay organized if nothing more than giving me the VC of the MVC. Django provides me with a lot of built-in tools, like form handling, that make my life much easier even for small sites. I'm going to presume PHP frameworks provide similar things, maybe not though. You also can't anticipate how the site will grow over time. It's easier to maintain something built in a framework, and if you ever need to extend the site in the future it's nice to have some structure behind it.
