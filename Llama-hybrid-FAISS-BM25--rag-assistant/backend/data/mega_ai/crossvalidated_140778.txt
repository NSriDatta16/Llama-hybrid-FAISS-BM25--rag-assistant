What is the best lag length for auto correlation?

I am doing a monthly rainfall forecasting model. I have monthly data from 1998 to 2012. I found in previous research that they have used partial autocorrelations and stepwise regression as an input variable selection method so they can be used as inputs for the neural network. My questions is: What is the procedure I must follow to choose the "lag length"? The previous researchers used lag24 and lag25 without justification or citation. The autocorrelation of one of the studies applied (lag length = 25) to the autocorrelation and the the plot showed that lag 24 is the highest and lag1, lag4, lag11, lag12 showed values above the confidence level (95%). So according to these values they have selected all 24 lags (lag1, lag2, lag3, ..., lag23, lag24) as the most significant lags and applied them to the stepwise regression to find the most significant variables among the 24. My question here is: If we used autocorrelation and the results showed that only five lags are above the confidence level, why do we need to apply them again to stepwise regression? Why not only apply the lags above the confidence level to the stepwise regression or just proceed to the neural network and skip the stepwise regression?
