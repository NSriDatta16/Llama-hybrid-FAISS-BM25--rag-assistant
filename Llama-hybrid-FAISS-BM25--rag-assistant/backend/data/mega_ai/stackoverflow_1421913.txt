As far as my knowledge of image processing algorithms extends , there is no certain way to get the "foreground"; it is only possible to get the borders between objects . You'll probably have to make do with an average, or your proposed array count method. In that, you'll want to give colours with higher saturation a higher "score" as they're much more prominent.
