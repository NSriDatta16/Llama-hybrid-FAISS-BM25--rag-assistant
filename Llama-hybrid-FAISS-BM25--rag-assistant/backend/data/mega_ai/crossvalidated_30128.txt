Linear factor analysis to find stationary factors?

I have a multivariate time series. My model assumption is that it was generated from underlying factors, some of which are stationary, using a linear mixing. How can I access the stationary factors? I have tried independent component analysis (ICA), but the independence assumption is too strong.
