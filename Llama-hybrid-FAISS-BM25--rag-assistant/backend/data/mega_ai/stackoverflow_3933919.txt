WPF/WinForms DragDrop IDataObject

I was wondering why WPF defines a new and apparently identical version of IDataObject for its drag/drop system? I have application code which uses the winforms IDataObject which I now need to interoperate with WPF drag/drop events. Would it be safe to simply write an adapter class which implements System.Windows.Forms.IDataObject but passes calls into the actual System.Windows.IDataObject provided by WPF? Thanks Dan
