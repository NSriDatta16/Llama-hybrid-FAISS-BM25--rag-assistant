Make JFace Window blink in taskbar or get users attention?

I wonder someone has any idea how to solve this: In my Java Eclipse plugin there are some processes which take some time. Therefore the user might minimize the window and let the process run in the background . Now, when the process is finished , I can force the window to come to the top again, but that is a no-no in usability. I'd rather want the process to blink in the taskbar instead. Is there any way to achieve this? I had a look at the org.eclipse.jface.window but could'nt find anything like that, same goes for the SWT documentation... Another thing which came to my mind - as people are using this app on mac os x and linux as well, is there a platform independant solution , which will inform the user that the process has finished but without bringing the window to the top? Any ideas are highly welcome! Edit: I found out that on windows the user can adjust whether he would like to enable a force to foreground or not. If that option is disabled, the task will just blink in the taskbar... Here's a good read on that... If anyone maybe knows about some platform independant way of achieving this kind of behaviour, please share your knowledge with me!
