FLV video not playing in Cooliris embed wall

I have a PHP file that generates a Media RSS file for the embedded wall. It reads images and video from our Amazon S3 bucket and signs the URLs before creating the RSS feed. When the wall loads, images display perfectly. Where there should be video there is only an empty black square, when the video is clicked - still only an empty square. However when I click on 'Start Slideshow' the video plays ok. When the video finishes it will load another image/video and this displays fine. I assume when i click a video thumbnail the video should start? Also cannot get Youtube videos to play unless I use this solution found on the cooliris developer forum Anyone else notice this behaviour and have any advice / solution? thanks ------------------------------- UPDATE --------------------------------------------------- I have now added video thumbnails that should be showing and this shows the play icon but does not display the thumbnail jpeg. I use PHP to generate the rss feed as follows - echo ' '.urldecode($subject).' '; And a similar way for images. Both image thumbnails and fullsize images display without problem. When I enter the link to the video thumbnail into a browser address bar the image is returned OK. Images and video are loaded from different buckets in S3 storage and I have checked cross domain policy files and they look ok to me, but could this be a problem? Like I say though the video plays ok when cooliris is in slideshow mode. Heres a link to a test page that shows the problem.
