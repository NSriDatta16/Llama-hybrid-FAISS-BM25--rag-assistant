View reuse in fragments android

I am trying to save my View states in my fragment but I am concerned I make be leaking my Activity. Here is what I am doing: @Override public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container, Bundle state){ if(mView != null){ View oldParent = mView.getParent(); if(oldParent != container){ ((ViewGroup)oldParent).removeView(mView); } return mView; } else{ mView = inflater.inflate(R.id.fragview, null) return mView; } } I am concerned because I know all Views hold onto a context and I don't know if it is the Activity context or Application context if inflated from the inflater. Perhaps it would be a better idea to pragmatically create the view and set its attributes using getActivity().getApplication() rather than use the inflater. I would appreciate any feedback on this. Thanks! EDIT: Confirmed Activity leak, although this code works great don't do it :*(
