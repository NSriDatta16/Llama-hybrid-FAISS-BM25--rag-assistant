The Docs say: Developers are encouraged to use Xcode's new Build > Build and Archive command to create an archive of their application and its associated [.dSYM] file. This archive can then be used with the Validate Application …, Share Application…, and Submit Application to iTunes Connect… sharing options in the new Archived Application source in the Organizer. The Validate Application… and Submit Application to iTunes Connect… sharing options require an iTunes Connect account and metadata prepared for that application; Validate Application… will run all of the validation tests that will be run upon submission to the App Store so that you can fix any problems before submitting your app. Submit Application to iTunes Connect… runs the same validation tests as Validate Application… and then, if all the tests pass, uploads your application for App Store review.
