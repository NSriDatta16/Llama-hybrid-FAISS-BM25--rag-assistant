Under what circumstances can an improper prior be used in bayesian analysis?

I am attempting to gain some intuition about the use of priors in bayesian analysis. I have read in some instances that an improper prior can be used when no information is known. However here is my first confusion, how exactly is an improper prior defined, I have seen some definitions that remark that it is a distribution that does not integrate to 1 and others affirm that it is a distribution that integrates to infinity, which one is it? Further how exactly does the prior distribution relate to the posterior, in terms of the attributes that the posterior must have when we use an improper prior. Is it the case that the posterior must be able to be integrated when we used an improper prior? must it be proper or improper? Further can an improper prior be used for valid bayesian inference?
