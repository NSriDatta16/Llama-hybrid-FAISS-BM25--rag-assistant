Follow Up The problem ended up being the SQL Query. As part of the SQL query, I had as In clause like the following. Select ID, Name, price/kg as unitpice from products where ID In (@ProductIds) SSRS uses exec sp_executesql and string.replace to inject the ID's into the IN clause. The problem I had was I would run the query in SQL Studio Manager. with all the variables entered and it would work as expected. but under SSRS it would fail with the divide by Zero error, and there was no real clear indication where the error occured. After I made a copy of the report and deleted items one by one until there was litrally nothing left on the report to render and it still produced the error, I turned my attention to the SQL Query. It was there that error was occuring. I only found it after using SQL Profiler to find out what SSRS was actually running. After that it was relativly easy fix of deleting the offending line and returning the seperate parts of the divide and run it through the function that RSolberg suggested.
