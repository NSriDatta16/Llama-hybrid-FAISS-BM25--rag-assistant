How to Recursively Predict a Time Series Using Neural Networks

I am currently using neural networks to forecast an electrical demand time series. I am trying to create a forecast for the following day given previous observations at half hourly intervals. My attempt is to use the previous five day values (48*5=240 half hour intervals) in order to predict predict the next value. Then I wish to use the previous 239 true load values and my predicted load value in order to get another prediction, and so on. I currently have a model which is shown in the following diagram. However the error is far too high. I am wondering if this is the best way of going about it and if so how to improve on my neural network.
