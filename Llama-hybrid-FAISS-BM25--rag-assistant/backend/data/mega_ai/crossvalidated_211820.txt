The Wikipedia page that you provided does not really use the term "variance-stabilizing transformation". The term "variance-stabilizing transformation" is generally used to indicate transformations that make the variance of the random variable a constant. Although in the Bernoulli case, this is what is happening with the transformation, that is not exactly what the goal is. The goal is to get a uniform distribution, and not just a variance stabilizing one. Recall that one of the main purposes of using Jeffreys prior is that it is invariant under transformation. This means that if you re-parameterize the variable, the prior will not change. 1. The Jeffreys prior in this Bernoulli case, as you pointed out, is a Beta$(1/2, 1/2)$. $$p_{\gamma}(\gamma) \propto \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{\gamma(1-\gamma)}}.$$ Reparametrizing with $\gamma = \sin^2(\theta)$, we can find the distribution of $\theta$. First lets see that $\theta = \arcsin(\sqrt{\gamma})$, and since $0 Thus $\theta$ is the uniform distribution on $(0, \pi/2)$. This is why the $\sin^2(\theta)$ transformation is used, so that the re-parametrization leads to a uniform distribution. The uniform distribution is now the Jeffreys prior on $\theta$ (since Jeffreys prior is invariant under transformation). This answers your first question. 2. Often in Bayesian analysis one wants a uniform prior when there is not enough information or prior knowledge about the distribution of the parameter. Such a prior is also called a "diffuse prior" or "default prior". The idea is to not commit to any value in the parameter space more than other values. In such a case the posterior is then completely dependent on the data likelihood. Since, $$q(\theta|x) \propto f(x|\theta) f(\theta) \propto f(x|\theta).$$ If the transformation is such that the transformed space is bounded, (like $(0, \pi/2)$ in this example), then the uniform distribution will be proper. If the transformed space is unbounded, then the uniform prior will be improper, but often the resulting posterior will be proper. Although, one should always verify that this is the case.
