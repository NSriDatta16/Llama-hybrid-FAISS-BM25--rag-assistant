Textbooks about reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach to machine learning?

Question: Does anyone know of any textbooks introducing machine learning (for the first time) via the reproducing kernel Hilbert space approach? I.e., which assume functional analysis as a prerequisite, but do not assume prior knowledge of machine learning? Any survey articles would be a close second. No research papers please -- I want to learn the theory first before trying to put it into practice. Background: There is a course which will be taught at my university this semester which promises to use methods from functional analysis to introduce machine learning, specifically Hilbert spaces with reproducing kernels. This would be really good for me, since I know functional analysis, do not know machine learning, and want to learn machine learning for the first time. Course Description (in German) -- no references to literature Course Home Page -- again no references to literature Course Page for a similar course at another university -- all of the references are research papers However, I am not sure if I will have the space in my schedule to take this course, or if it will conflict with a course which I have to take this semester. Thus, I would like to be able to study this subject on my own in my free time in the future if I cannot take this course this semester.
