Queues with non-constant arrival rates

https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/simmer/index.html I am interested in simulating some basic queues in R. However, I want to try to simulate queues that have "non-constant" arrival rates, i.e. the arrival rates are a function of time (e.g. instead of saying "50 people arrive every hour on average throughout the day" - we make the arrival rate a function that reflects more people coming through out certain times and fewer people coming at other times). I did some research and came across the "simmer" package in R. This appears to be one of the main packages for queue simulation in R. However, I am not sure if this package can model "non constant arrivals". Does anyone know if this is possible? Are there any ways to do this in R? Thanks!
