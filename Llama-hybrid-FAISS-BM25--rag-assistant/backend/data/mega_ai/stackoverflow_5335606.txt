Export To Excel - Change Default "Save as type" to Microsoft Office Excel Workbook(*xls)

I am Doing an Export to Excel with my Ruby on Ralis application.I have not used any gem or Plugin (since our requirement was something different, we couldn't use them). We used the inbuilt "format.xls" support that comes with Ruby on Rails. The problem is that, when we get our Excel, Save as Type appears on the webpage . I want to change this to Microsoft Office Excel Workbook (*xls) . How to do it? Below is my controller action code and the respective view with which we get the excel. Get_excel methods in controller def get_excel format.xls do headers['Content-Type'] = "application/vnd.ms-excel" headers["Content-disposition"] = 'inline; filename="myexcel.xls"' headers['Cache-Control'] = '' end end VIEW (get_excel.xls.erb) @page { mso-header-data : '&R CONFIDENTIAL'; margin: 0.75in 0.20in 0.5in 0.20in; mso-header-margin: 0.25in; mso-footer-margin:0.25in; mso-page-orientation: landscape; } table{ page-break-inside: avoid; } td{ white-space:nowrap; } Gantt Detail 319 15 74 600 600 5 5 2 3 2 False False False 8580 12120 120 45 False False Print_Titles 1 ='Gantt Detail'!$3:$5 some code some code some code some code some code
