Sorry i just want to add a pessimistic or better realistic answer here. You are under time pressure. 6 month deadline and you don't even know for sure what language is this system and what it does and how it is organized. If it is not a trivial calculation then it is a very bad start. Most importantly: You say you have never done mulitithreading programming before. This is where i get 4 alarm clocks ringing at once. Multithreading is difficult and takes a long time to learn it when you want to do it right - and you need to do it right when you want to win a huge speed increase. Debugging is extremely nasty even with good tools like Total Views debugger or Intels VTune. Then you say you want to rewrite the app in another lanugage - well this isn't as bad as you have to rewrite it anyway. THe chance to turn a single threaded Program into a well working multithreaded one without total redesign is almost zero. But learning multithreading and a new language (what is your C++ skills?) with a timeline of 3 month (you have to write a throw away prototype - so i cut the timespan into two halfs) is extremely challenging. My advise here is simple and will not like it: Learn multithreadings now - because it is a required skill set in the future - but leave this job to someone who already has experience. Well unless you don't care about the program being successfull and are just looking for 6 month payment.
