Can't accept String or Integer?

My problem is can't insert a value to my database because CATEGORY is a of type InsuranceCategory that is read only.So it will not accept a string or an integer.. What would I suppose to do this issue to be able to accept a string or an integer? Insurance oInsurance = new Insurance(); oInsurance.Category.Value = drpCategory.SelectedValue; HCSInsurance oHCSInsurance = new HCSInsurance(); oHCSInsurance.CreateInsurance(oInsurance); Much thanks!
