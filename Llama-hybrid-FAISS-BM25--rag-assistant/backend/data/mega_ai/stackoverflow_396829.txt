You could check the user agent of clients coming to your site. Some third party screen scraping programs have their own user agent so you could block that. Good screen scrapers however spoof their user agent so you won't be able to detect it. Be careful if you do try to block anyone because you don't want to block a legitimate user :) The best you can hope for is to block people using screen scrapers that aren't smart enough to change their user agent.
