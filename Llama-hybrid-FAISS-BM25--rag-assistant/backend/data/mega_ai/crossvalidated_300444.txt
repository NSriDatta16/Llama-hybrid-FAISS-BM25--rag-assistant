When SVM can do multi-class classification itself, why do people still use (one vs one) or (one Vs many) classification?

I used - library(e1071) which was able to predict all(10) of my classes in a single run. Now, why do people go for one Vs one and one Vs many approach? What is the benefit of those approaches? Is it only library(e1071) that can do multi-class classification ? Would the output or accuracy changes if the algorithm takes care of Multi-class Classification itself? Thanks.
