It generally depends on how similar your new task is with respect to the task the network was originally trained on. Also, it depends on the model architecture and if/how many of the layers you are going to update using the new dataset. Assume you have a convolutional neural network that was trained for ImageNet classification. Now, you want to specialize this network in distinguishing cats from dogs. You would replace the last layer (if it is a fully connected layer, you change $\mathbb{R}^{d, o}$ , where $o$ is the number of output classes, such that $o=2$ for your new binary classification task). Then, you can probably get away with training it with ~500-5000 cats vs dog images. It's hard to be more specific, though because there is no hard and fast rule.
