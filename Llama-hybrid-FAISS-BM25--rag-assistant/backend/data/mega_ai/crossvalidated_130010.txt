Using deep learning for time series prediction with uncertain time series window size!

I'm new in area of deep learning and I am trying to use deep learning to do prediction on machine generated log data gathered as stream of data. I have seen LSTM an how it can be helpful to train RNN with some understanding of time series Sequence to sequence learning with neural networks , but they had simple definition of how long is their time window. The problem is, I am not sure what should be the proper window size of logs that I need to push to LSTM before feeding to RNN. Can someone elaborate how should I treat this problem: I am trying to find proper window size of log data according to their context? Is RNN actually a proper general model in here?
