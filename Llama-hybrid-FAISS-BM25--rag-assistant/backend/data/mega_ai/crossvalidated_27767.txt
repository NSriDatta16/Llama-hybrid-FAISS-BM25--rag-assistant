Support Vector Machines (SVM) maximum margin hyperplane use

I have been approaching to Support Vector Machines in this period, and I need a clarification about the use of the maximum margin hyperplane. From a labeled point training set, we train a model that will correctly classify the future test set points. To do this, we search for a best hyperplane that divide the training set points into two classes (True, False). So we use kernel and etc to get this goal. But, when we've gotten our best hyperplane, what do we do with it? Do we just use it to classify new data points, by verifying which ones are "on this side" and which ones "on the other side"? I've understood how to get the famous best hyperplane, but I need some clarification on what to do next with it... Thanks!
