When to use CreateChildControls() vs. embedding in the ASPX

I'm developing a webpart for SharePoint 2007 and have seen several posts that advise to do all the creation of controls in the code-behind . I'm transitioning from Java J2EE development so I don't have the platform history of .Net/ASP/etc. In other places it shows how you can do the same thing by embedding the control definition into the asp page with tags My question is this: What is the rule governing where to implement controls? Has this rule changed recently, ASP vs ASP.Net or ASP.Net MVC maybe? Is this advice limited to SharePoint development?
