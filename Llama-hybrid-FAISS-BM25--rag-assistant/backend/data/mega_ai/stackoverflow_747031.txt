The TCP/IP stack is an essential part of any modern OS, including recent versions of MS Windows. As explained on MS knowlegebase Q299357 (speaking about Win XP): Because TCP/IP is a core component of Windows, you cannot remove it. At any rate, even if it were possible, no program that uses TCP/IP (which is most modern software, since most contain some kind of net integration, auto update etc.) would work. And most would probably fail in mysterious ways, since no one tested that configuration. So the short answer is: Don't do it. Maybe you could explain why you feel it necessary to remove TCP/IP networking? Then we might be able to help you. Edit: Based on your comment below, if you want bypass/disable the ARP handling of the TCP/IP stack, then WinPcap should let you do that. If not, you probably need to write your own Windows network driver. Again, this seems extremely complicated and intrusive. Could you please describe what your application does and why you even need to mess around with low-level networking?
