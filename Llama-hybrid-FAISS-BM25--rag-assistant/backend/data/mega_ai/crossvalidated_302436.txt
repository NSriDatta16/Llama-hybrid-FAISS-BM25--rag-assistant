As you state that your goal is prediction , a Recurrent Neural Network ---or other time series model---would be well suited to this task. I was thinking of just adding them as features (e.g. "Employees in 2014", "Employees in 2013" etc.) but that seems like a bad idea as it removes the time element. The RNN explicitly models the time element; at each time step, the prediction is $$y^{(t)}=Wx^{(t)}+Uh^{(t-1)}$$ Where $x^{(t)}$ are the input features and $h^{(t-1)}$ is the previous hidden state, so the prediction is a function of the current features in addition to the representation of the past. And what sort of regressor would people recommend I use for this kind of data? A least squares cost function can be used. There's also a problem that some factories are newer than others, so I only have a few years of data. Obviously, I could just use the factories that I have 10 years for, but I'd rather not. RNNs can process variable-lengh sequences. So, it could learn how to predict for a company with 10 observations or 3 or anything else. I have about 25 features including some qualitative (e.g. country, produce) RNNs learn a good representation of the data, so they essentially do feature extraction for you. This makes it easier to input combinations of (scaled) categorical and continuous features.
