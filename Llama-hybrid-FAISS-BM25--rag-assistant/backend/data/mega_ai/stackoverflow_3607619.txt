override save and load of an attribute in magento

How can I override the way magento saves and load a specific attribute? I want to create an attribute that implements a many-to-many relation to products so I have a custom table with entity_id and attr_id. I'm using a multiselect attribute but magento saves the values as csv in a text field. I want to override this functionality and save and load from the m2m table. When defining a backend model for an attribute I only have control over beforeSave and afterSave but not on save itself. Thanks
