I've read that this method of profiling works only on Android 2.2 and higher. Sorry, can't find link now. On lower versions you are still able profile via Debug.startMethodTracing(); ... Debug.stopMethodTracing(); Upd: check that you have properly mounted sdcard with read/write permissions and check that you have WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permission in your manifest file. May be problem in this, because beginning from Android 2.2 DDMS heap dump requests streaming directly out of the VM, removing the external storage requirement. If you have all permissions, then post here logcat output please. P.S. I've found a document that I mentioned.
