I depends on what you need. Is it used as content managment system ? There is plenty open source CMS, as stated before. Is it used as collaboration tool ? Then one of the follwing things may do the trick: eGroupWare : Already available on many hosters, project manager, Infolog for Notes, Tasks, ToDos, and more tools. Collanos Workspace : Java on Mac, Win or Linux, chats, discussions incorporated OpenGoo : PHP, tasks, calendar, contacts, weblinks, internal messages, with editor for text-documents and presentations (!) eyeOS pushes it one level further. It's like a desktop in your browser, including internal drag and drop etc. It incorporates beforementioned OpenGoo, can be enhanced by a multitude of "programs" to be downloaded separately . Sole problem: eyeOS needs full read/write permission on the files, which is often a problem with hosters. edit: I just found something else and thought it would be worth adding here: O3Spaces (see german article ) sees itself as alternative to Sharepoint and has just been released in a new version.
