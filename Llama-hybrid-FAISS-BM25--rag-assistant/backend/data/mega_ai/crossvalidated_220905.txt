I agree with @user20160 that cross correlation (CC) will most likely be a valid and fast solution to your problem (in combination with scaling of your reference pattern + selecting the window position where correlation peaks occur). What I want to point out is : if you run into problems because the pattern you search for is irregularly stretched or condensed in your time series, consider using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) instead of CC. DTW can compensate for any stretching or condensing of your pattern using its warping property - which will be helpful in such cases.
