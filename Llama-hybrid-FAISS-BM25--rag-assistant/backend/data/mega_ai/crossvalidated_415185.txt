SMD meta-analysis including cluster-randomised trials: is it possible? If so, how?

Where we have cluster-adjusted results from trials (summary statistics), under what circumstances can we include them in a standardised mean difference (SMD) meta-analysis and which calculations are necessary? For example, we have a statistical analysis that used generalised linear mixed models, with care home as a random factor, and time as a repeated measure, and reports mean and standard error (SE) for each intervention. We know the number of individuals in the intervention groups and the number of clusters. If this was not cluster-randomised, I would calculate the SD for each group = SE x √N and then the SMD using the standard formulae for Hedges’ g, as implemented in RevMan. For calculating the SD, pooled SD, SMD and SE{SMD} I would be using values of N = n1 + n2. For cluster-randomised results, is it appropriate to be using the raw number of individuals in the intervention groups, a cluster-adjusted number of individuals using the design effect, i.e. Nadj = N / (1 + (M-1)ICC), or is it not appropriate to calculate SMD from these data? Similarly, given an adjusted MD(SE) is it appropriate to calculate SD using the standard formula of SD = SE / √(1/n1 + 1/n2) using raw values for n? For good measure, given unadjusted means, SDs and ns for a cluster trial, it's presumably okay to adjust the ns using the design effect and then calculate SMD and SE{SMD}. [edit: no, it isn't, see references provided by @Wolfgang] Thanks
