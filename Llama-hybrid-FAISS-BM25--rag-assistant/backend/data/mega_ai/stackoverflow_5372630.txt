If a non-authorized user will be redirect to the " main site " then obviously Facebook ( when trying to get the details of the shared page ) will be redirected to the same page too! From the documentation: The user agent of the scraper is: "facebookexternalhit/1.1 (+http://www.facebook.com/externalhit_uatext.php)" So you may capture this and allow access for Facebook scraper, but I really don't think you should do this (ethically). Instead, make a public page for each product were minimal data is shown and encourage users to register to view the full product page! Just a side note (a reminder), always use the Open Graph meta tags .
