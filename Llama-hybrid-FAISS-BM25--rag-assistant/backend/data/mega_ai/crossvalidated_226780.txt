Is there a general and completely automated (i.e. programmed) solution to modelling and forecasting time series data?

Is there a general and completely automated solution to modelling and forecasting time series data? I think this question is extremely important. If it is not possible, please provide an explanation why it isn't. I'm interested to know whether anyone has completely automated the process of model building and forecasting in a way that works and allows a machine or programme do so without intervention. I'm not so interested in whether a human can improve on what a machine can do. I'm more interested in finding out whether a computer / programme can do this kind of work for us in a way that is "reasonable" - I don't have any metric in mind for what "reasonable" means.
