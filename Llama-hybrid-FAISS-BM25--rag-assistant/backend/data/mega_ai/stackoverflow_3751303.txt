You probably have one or more gigantic procedures/functions and I think VBA has a limit of 64k or something per procedure. You fix it by splitting that procedure up into multiple procedures that can then be called by the one procedure. So instead of having: Sub GiantProcedure() ... ' lots and lots of code End Sub You'd have something like: Sub GiantProcedure() ... ' a little bit of common code Proc1() Proc2() Proc3() End Sub Sub Proc1() ... ' quite a bit of code End Sub Sub Proc2() ... ' quite a bit of code End Sub Sub Proc3() ... ' quite a bit of code End Sub
