You would need to make your UISegmentedControl a peer of the UITabBarController view. So it would look like this: ------------------- |UISegmentedControl | |-------------------| | | | | | | | | | | |UITabBarController | | | | | | | | | | | ------------------- The key here is that your UISegmentedControl needs to not be a subview of the UITabBarController view, so I would create a separate UIViewController subclass that owns and lays out the UISegmentedControl and UITabBarController views. Also, I'd recommend embedding the UISegmentedControl in a UIToolBar . That will look a lot better than placing it on a blank view.
