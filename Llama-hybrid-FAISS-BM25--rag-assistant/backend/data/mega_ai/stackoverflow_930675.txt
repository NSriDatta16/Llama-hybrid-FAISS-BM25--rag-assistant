Functional paragraphs

Sorry I don't quite get FP yet, I want to split a sequence of lines into a sequence of sequences of lines, assuming an empty line as paragraph division, I could do it in python like this: def get_paraghraps(lines): paragraphs = [] paragraph = [] for line in lines: if line == "": # I know it could also be "if line:" paragraphs.append(paragraph) paragraph = [] else: paragraph.append(line) return paragraphs How would you go about doing it in Erlang or Haskell?
