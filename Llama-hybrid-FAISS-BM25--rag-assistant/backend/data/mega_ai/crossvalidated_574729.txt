Regarding Spherical Gaussian Latent Space

I am currently reading paper on Variational Autoencoders by Dr. Kingma and Dr. Welling, and am having a few confusions. Question 1 : What is a spherical Gaussian latent space? How do we interpret it Question 2 : In equation 1.15, does the Roman I in standard deviation mean 1 or does it have a different meaning? Could anyone please provide me some information on these?
