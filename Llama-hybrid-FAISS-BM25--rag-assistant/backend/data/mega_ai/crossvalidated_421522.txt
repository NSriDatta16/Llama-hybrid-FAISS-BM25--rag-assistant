If I understand correctly, it seems that you want a neural network that maps a sequence of (brain) images to a single (blood flow parameter) image. As you mentioned, a CNN LSTM is a good start. Without a reference, this term may have different interpretations. For your task, I would suggest the ConvLSTM which uses convolution inside the LSTM cell. This gets you image sequence to image sequence. You could simply use the output from the last LSTM cell as your prediction. In encoder-decoder situations, the output of last LSTM cell of the encoder is used as embedding of the input sequence. There are fully convolutional neural networks which learn image to image mappings. You could apply this to the embedding produced by the output of the final LSTM cell, as described above. Finally, the LSTM component could be swapped out with an attention mechanism for a convolutional attention network . Attention is often replacing RNNs.
