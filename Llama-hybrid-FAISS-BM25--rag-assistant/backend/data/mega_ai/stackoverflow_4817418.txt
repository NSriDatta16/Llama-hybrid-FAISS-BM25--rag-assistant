Nhibernate Session closed exception issue with Asp.net mvc telerik ajax grid

I am getting Nhibernate Session closed exception with asp.net mvc telerik ajax grid. The grid is bound to an entity Sale that has a related entity User. The exception thrown is when trying to access the User entity. I have used the fetchMode to eager load it but I still get the same exception. This exception only occur if I switch between the grid pages multiple times. Anyone encountered this issue? The code for that data access is as follow: public IList List() { var manager = new ManagerFactory().GetSaleManager(); var iCriteria = manager.Session.GetISession().CreateCriteria(typeof(Sale)) .SetFetchMode("AspnetUser3.Agents3", FetchMode.Eager); return iCriteria.List (); } The code that try to access the related object in the object graph is as follow: AgentId = sale.AspnetUser3.Agents3[0].Id, The exception thrown NHibernate.Exceptions.GenericADOException: could not load an entity: [SalesEntry.Data.Model.AspnetUser#7aaabf99-d77d-4edf-b949-9c4c0f3e85d8][SQL: SELECT aspnetuser0_.[UserId] as column1_12_0_, aspnetuser0_.[UserName] as column2_12_0_, aspnetuser0_.[LoweredUserName] as column3_12_0_, aspnetuser0_.[MobileAlias] as column4_12_0_, aspnetuser0_.[IsAnonymous] as column5_12_0_, aspnetuser0_.[LastActivityDate] as column6_12_0_, aspnetuser0_.[ApplicationId] as column7_12_0_ FROM [dbo].[aspnet_Users] aspnetuser0_ WHERE aspnetuser0_.[UserId]=?] ---> System.ObjectDisposedException: Session is closed! Object name: 'ISession'.
