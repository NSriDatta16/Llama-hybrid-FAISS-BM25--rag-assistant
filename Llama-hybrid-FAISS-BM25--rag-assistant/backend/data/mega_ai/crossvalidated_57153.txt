In SVM, what are the labels and how do you get them from the data?

I'm working on a school project and have decided to use SVM for stock market prediction. I have a 1000x5 matrix of stock quotes containg data for open, close, high, low, volume data. From what I know, the labels should consist of +1/-1, for either up or down. How do I get this label data? I'm using python and I am somewhat lost. I'm ultimately trying to predict the stock price a few days out in the future, or at least one day out.
