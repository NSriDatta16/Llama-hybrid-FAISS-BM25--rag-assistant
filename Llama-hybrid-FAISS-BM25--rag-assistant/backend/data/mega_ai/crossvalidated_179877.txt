ARFIMA covariance structure

I have a set of response processes (queue lengths in infinite server network). Using queue theory, I can numerically calculate response autocovariance structure, from the known service time distribution. Example: Exponential service time distribution yields AR(1) covariance structure in the response. However we model service times by the gamma distribution, often with long tail. Our objective is interpretation of a fitted gamma distribution, as to its impact on response dynamics. And we are particularly interested in long range dependence in the response dynamics. We had the idea to relate the calculated covariance structure to ARFIMA(0,d,0) so as to find a Hurst exponent that summarizes conveniently the long range dependence implied by that service time distribution. For small lags the Arfima model is of course no good. We thought to compare true and model power spectra, to evaluate the importance of this misfit. Do you think the above is correct and practical, to achieve our goal which I hope is clear from above. Second question then: How to go about fitting Arfima (p,d,q) to an autocovariance function ? Rather than to a time series e.g. arfima(x, order=..., lmodel=...).
