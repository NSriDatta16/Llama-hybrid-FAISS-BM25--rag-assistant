What's the best model to analyze inflation seasonal adjustment with R?

Please, put in R the following structure: infl It is Eurozone's CPI monthly time series. Then an inflation estimate is dinfl I would like to get dinfl seasonality with the greatest possible accuracy; it's a stationary time series. What would your suggestment be (model + package + function)? Is there any chance of structural break which may require some analysis before? I remember something about bfast() package which allowed for structural break searching, I don't know if it could be useful here. Many thanks,
