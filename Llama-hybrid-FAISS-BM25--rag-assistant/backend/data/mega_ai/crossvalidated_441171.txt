How to convert/decompose SARMA model to Unobserved Component Model (UCM) to extract seasonal component?

Often in my work I need to remove seasonality from a time series to see underlying trends/cycles. Usually the seasonality is removed using UCM, estimated by some method. However, we often also fit SARMA to the series for forecasting purpose. For interest I would like to know how to extract seasonal component series after fitting a SARMA model, i.e., convert the fitted model to UCM form?
