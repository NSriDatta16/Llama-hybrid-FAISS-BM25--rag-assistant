Principal component analysis of RT-qPCR data

Greetings to all biostatisticians, I am analyzing a gene expression data set consisting of around 100 genes that were measured by RT-qPCR and expession values are given as 2^-delta Ct. Expression of these genes was measured in 25 patients belonging to 5 different groups: Group A (7 patients), Group B (5 patients), Group C (4 patients) and Group D (3 patients) and Group E (6 patients). The question I am trying to answer: How well can we rely on the expression of this panel of genes to distinguish patients from different groups ? To answer this question, I tried doing pairwise comparisons of the expression of each gene between each two groups of patients using an unpaired two sample t-test or Wilcoxon test, and then do a multiple testing correction of the P-values. I also tried reducing the dimensions of the dataset using principal component analysis (PCA) and visualizing how patients from different groups distribute in the PCA space. Here, I would like to see patients from the same group cluster together in the PCA space. Do you have any better suggestions to address this question? Is there a way to quantify how well patients from a given group are clustered together using PC scores derived from PCA? Thank you !!
