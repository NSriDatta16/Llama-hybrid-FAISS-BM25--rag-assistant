Yes, the problem of imbalance is indeed genuine while pre processing. There are no hard and fast rules for removing outliers, but generic methodologies (percentile,boxplot,Z-score etc). Like gender, if you take salary of all employess then removing outliers means eliminating all highly paid employees.That will make your model learn more about middle/average salaried employes( Outliers handling ). But then if you keep them, they will influence and model will learn less about average salaried employee.(Making data in Log scale can minimise that though:not fully) The solutions are generally more prone to objective and training we want to give. After pre processing, the imbalance(like gender) in data can be compensated by oversampling or undersampling.(we can get more datapoints:dont worry about that). But be sure before dropping any data that is available !! Taking few columns(similar feature) at a time to process and dealing with them, instead of applying a common operation in groups,can generally works. https://machinelearningmastery.com/tactics-to-combat-imbalanced-classes-in-your-machine-learning-dataset/ https://towardsdatascience.com/a-brief-overview-of-outlier-detection-techniques-1e0b2c19e561 These might be helpful.
