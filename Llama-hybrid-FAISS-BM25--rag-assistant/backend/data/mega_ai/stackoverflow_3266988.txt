The tree as shown is not covered by the grammar, because that does not provide a derivation from IdentifierName to ReservedWord , and it does not provide for deriving ReservedWord to Literal either. The ReservedWord production in fact is used only to restrict valid values of IdentifierName , and this should be seen on the lexical level. It does not make it into a CST, where you would see just the IdentifierName . The context of Literal is PrimaryExpression, so a fragment of a real CST could look like this: ... | PrimaryExpression | Literal | NullLiteral | null
