jquery drag and drop

I am using jquery for drag-and-drop and it works fine with 2 divs, I can drag an image across 2 divs. One div can be dragged while the other can be dropped upon. What I want is to have 4 divs, where I have images in each div and I can drag an image from one div to another. Is this possible in jquery? If yes can you write a little code for me? Thanks
