the only way or doing this is divide the whole pdf in small independent components like paragraphs, chunks, images, and specially don't make big tables try to divide them in parts and small as possible so that each element can take the required space. by doing so you are occupying the small wide spaces by small independent components so most of the wide spaces will be removed.
