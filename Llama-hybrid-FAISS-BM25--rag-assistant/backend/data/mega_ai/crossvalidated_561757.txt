How to insert a constraint on coefficients of logistic regression model?

I want to build a logistic regression model on my data, which contains three continuous predictors and a logical response. I need to constrain the regression coefficients to be not less than 0 and sum up to a constant, i.e., $$y=\frac {1}{1+e^{-(\beta_1\times x_1+\beta_2 \times x_2+\beta_3 \times x_3)}}$$ $$s.t. \beta_j \geq 0(j=1,2,3)$$ $$ \beta_1+\beta_2+\beta_3=1$$ Is there anyone who knows how to add such constraint in theory? And how can this be done in MATLAB? The following is my test code using the function ' glmfit ' which did not have an option to introduce a constraint: load hospital.mat dsa = hospital; Age = dsa.Age; Weight = dsa.Weight; Blood = dsa.BloodPressure(:, 1); Smoker = dsa.Smoker; mdl = fitglm([Age, Weight, Blood], Smoker, 'Distribution', 'binomial', 'Intercept', false)
