Is there any need to scale data in SVM if my weight vector is binary in nature?

My weight vector is SVM training (using Libsvm ) will have only feature number and then 1 or 0 i.e representing whether present or NOT present. it would be like below libsvm format. 1 1:0 2:1 3:0 4:1...9600:1 0 1:1 2:0 3:1 4:0...9600:0 .... As all the measurements are based on one criteria whether present or not? Will scaling be a issue? Thanks.
