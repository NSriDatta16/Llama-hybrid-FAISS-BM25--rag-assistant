The pseudo-$R^2$ measure suggested by Koenker and Machado (1999) in JASA measures goodness of fit by comparing the sum of weighted deviations for the model of interest with the same sum from a model in which only the intercept appears. It is calculated as $$R_1(\tau) = 1 - \frac{\sum_{y_i \ge \hat y_i} \tau \cdot \vert y_i-\hat y_i \vert +\sum_{y_i where $\hat y_i =\alpha_{\tau}+\beta_{\tau}x$ is the fitted $\tau$th quantile for observation $i$, and $\bar y=\beta_{\tau}$ is the fitted value from the intercept-only model. $R_1(\tau)$ should lie in $[0,1]$, where 1 would correspond to a perfect fit since the numerator which consists of the weighted sum of deviations would be zero. It a local measure of fit for QRM since it depends on $\tau$, unlike the global $R^2$ from OLS. That is arguably the source of the warnings about using it: if you model fits in the tail, there's not guarantee that it fits well anywhere else. This approach could also be used to compare nested models. Here's an example in R: library(quantreg) data(engel) fit0 This could probably be accomplished more elegantly.
