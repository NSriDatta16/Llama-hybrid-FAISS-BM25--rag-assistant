Based on your edit, perhaps this is helpful. https://blogs.msdn.com/gertd/Default.aspx?p=7 Adding variables So far we have been looking at how things work, now it is time to add some new variables and put them to work. One place where variables come in handy is in the post deployment file that defines files: storage.sql. Variables will allow use to make the location environment dependent. Inside the storage file you will find something like this: IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM dbo.sysfiles WHERE name = 'fgdb_data') BEGIN ALTER DATABASE [$(databasename)] ADD FILE ( NAME = N'fgdb_data', FILENAME = N'C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\DATA\fgdb_data.ndf', MAXSIZE = 100MB, FILEGROWTH = 10MB ) TO FILEGROUP [TABLES] END We could parameterize this so the drive and directory get abstracted through a variable to: :setvar drive "C:" :setvar directory "Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\DATA" IF NOT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM dbo.sysfiles WHERE name = 'fgdb_data') BEGIN ALTER DATABASE [$(databasename)] ADD FILE ( NAME = N'fgdb_data', FILENAME = N'$(drive)\$(directory)\fgdb_data.ndf', MAXSIZE = 100MB, FILEGROWTH = 10MB ) TO FILEGROUP [TABLES] END Now that we have parameterized the script, next we want to make the variables part of the project file, so we have them defined in a single place instead of scattered around in the code at various places through :setvar statements. Sorry I am just starting to learn the GDR myself but I'll need the answer to this to
