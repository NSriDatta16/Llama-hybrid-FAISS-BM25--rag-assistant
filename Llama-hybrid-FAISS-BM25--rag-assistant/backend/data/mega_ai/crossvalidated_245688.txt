Choosing parameters for ratio of posteriors (Bayesian)

I'm comparing different models and how well they fit but one of the models has two parameters $L_{0}$ and $\tau$ in the model: $B+L_{0}e^{\frac{-t}{\tau}}$ My method of comparison for my single parameter models was just take the maximum posterior distribution but when I have two parameters how do I choose which to take? I know $0 Hope that is making sense, ask if not, but how do you choose which values to take?
