Odds and odds ratios in logistic regression

I am having difficulties understanding one logistic regression explanation. The logistic regression is between temperature and fish which die or do not die. The slope of a logistic regression is 1.76. Then the odds that fish die increase by a factor of exp(1.76) = 5.8. In other words, the odds that fish die increase by a factor of 5.8 for each change of 1 degree Celsius in temperature. Because 50% fish die in 2012, a 1 degree Celsius increase on 2012 temperature would raise the fish die occurrence to 82%. A 2 degree Celsius increase on 2012 temperature would raise the fish die occurrence to 97%. A 3 degree Celsius increase -> 100% fish die. How do we calculate 1, 2 and 3? (82%, 97% and 100%)
