Caret package Varimp - feature selection question

I decided to use RFE using the caret package for feature selection for a logistic regression model. The documentation says the Varimp for linear model uses the absolute value of the t-statistic for each model parameter is used. Logistic regression is not a linear model or has any of the linear model assumptions. Does it make sense to use linear model assumptions to reduce variables for a logistic regression problem using the caret package?
