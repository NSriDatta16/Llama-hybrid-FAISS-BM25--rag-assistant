In my logistic regression model one of the independent variables is redundant with the interaction term. How should I deal with it?

In my logistic regression is the dependent variable a dummy variable and I also have two independent variables. One of those is a dummy variable and the other is a metric variable. I also suppose an interaction between those two variables. I am computing three regressions because I want to explore the influence of the independent variables on the dependent variable in period 1, period 2 and in both periods together. When I compute the regressions for period 2 and for both periods together, there is no problem. But when I compute the regression for the period 1, SPSS generated a warning that "because of redundancy the degrees of freedom for at least one variable have been reduced". I actually do not know what that means, but I found out that when I exclude the independent dummy variable from my model for period 1, the interaction term is included in the model. So both variables are somehow identical. My question is how should I deal with this in my work. Should I just say that for the first period the interaction term and the dummy variable are identical? Or there are some other consequences for the interpretation of my model? I hope this makes my question a little bit clearer. Thanks again.
