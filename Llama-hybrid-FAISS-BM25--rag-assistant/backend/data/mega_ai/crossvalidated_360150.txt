I am not sure if you will be predicting several values or an actual signal. Because those are different problems. If by several values you mean a continuous signal, I suggest the use of Reccurent Neural Networks (RNN) and/or Long Short Term Memory (LSTM). You should read on both and decide which suits your problem best. As for predicting several values, I have never heard on a Neural network returning several values that are not homogeneous in type (this falls in the first suggestion). Therefore you will probably need to build a different model for each of your desired outputs. I hope I understood your question, if not, feel free to edit and I will edit my answer accordingly.
