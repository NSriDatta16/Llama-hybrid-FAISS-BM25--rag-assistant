Comparing coefficients of two different probit models---is this "bad statistics"?

Apologies for any stupid mistakes, or if the answer to this question is trivial: I have no formal statistical training. Long story short: can we meaningfully compare coefficients of two different probit models? In "Learning and Opinion Change, Not Priming: Reconsidering the Priming Hypothesis" , Lenz (2009) runs two probit models and compares the difference in the coefficients of the independent variable. Dependent variable: Support for Labour $Y_t$ Independent variable: Attitude towards European Integration $x_t$ Control variables: various demographic controls, $\phi_t$ The regression he runs takes the form $Y_{t} = \beta_0' x_{t} + \phi_{t} $ , but this is a probit model, so something like $$Pr(Y_{1994} | X_{1994}) = \Phi(X_{1994}^T \beta_0) $$ $$Pr(Y_{1997} | X_{1997}) = \Phi(X_{1997}^T \beta_0') $$ He then compares $\beta_0' - \beta_0$ and checks if the difference is significant (see "Diff." column), and then concludes that only in the "Learned from" case is there a significant difference. I've reproduced the results here (see third row) My question here is whether we can meaningfully compare coefficients of two different probit models. As Mood (2010) in "Logistic Regression: Why We Cannot Do What We Think We Can Do, and What We Can Do About It" points out, odds ratios and log-odds ratios are not comparable across groups or across time "without assuming that the unobserved heterogeneity is the same across compared points in time". For example, in a model where we want to study the difference in the effect of one variable between different ethnic groups, between men and women, or between different years, the estimate will depend on the extent to which the model predicts the outcome differently in the different categories. For example, we might be interested in how the effect of school grades on the probability of transition to university, controlling for the studentâ€™s sex, varies over time or between countries. A weakening of LnOR or OR for grades between two points in time can mean that the effect of grades is diminishing over time, but it can also mean that the importance of sex for educational choice has decreased over time. In this case, while it's true that the importance of the independent variable could have increased, couldn't it also be the case that the importance of those various demographic controls have increased? Is Lenz justified in claiming that the independent variable becomes more explanatory in the "Learned from" case? Furthermore, do omitted variables also make a difference (say if Lenz fails to control completely for all confounders)? Thanks very much for reading this and please drop a comment if this is unclear in any way.
