A thing to note is that while most RDBMS providers make a clear distinction between their extensions to SQL and the programming languages used to write stored procedures and triggers and so on, Microsoft and Sybase do exactly the contrary, they mix these two concepts into one, namely, T-SQL. You use T-SQL when you write normal queries, but you also can (and usually do) use T-SQL when you are writing stored procedures and triggers. This has the controversial benefit of encouraging (or at least making very easy) the creation a mix of procedural and SQL code[*]. Nowadays Microsoft makes a distinction between T-SQL stored procedures and those written for the CLR (ie, .NET), but this is a relatively new development (from SQL Server 2005 onwards). [*]: Controversial because people who don't speak SQL will be tempted to write procedural code (usually very inefficient in databases) instead of learning SQL (the proper thing to do).
