jQuery: Loading external HTML content; Access to elements inserted fails

I would like to load a table element from another HTML (additional_content.html) into the current HTML via jQuery. I managed to load the content but I am not able to access the elements inserted as if they were not inserted. However, when inserting an alert statement just after the load statement, I am able to access the elements of the table inserted via load . It appears to me that the DOM tree is not updated immediately. The code fragment within the parent document looks like this: $("#content").load("additonal_content.html #content table").hide(); $("#content").find("img").each(function() { alert("test"); }); And the table within *additional_content.html" is (excerpt): some text... some text...
