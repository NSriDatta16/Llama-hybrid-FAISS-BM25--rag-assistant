Android : Saving Files to SD Card

I am trying to save a file out from within my app to the external storage of a device. Specifically, I am trying to save a sound out. I've followed every 'tutorial' on doing this, and none of it seemed particularly confusing to me, yet it just will not work for me. No file is ever created on the SD card at all, much less actually transferring over the information. I've assumed I am somehow not getting the correct path to the card, but no matter what I have tried it doesn't work. I have tried entering just "/sdcard/", as well as using the getExternalStorageDirectory() method, among other random experiments. After spending over half the day on something that would seem so trivial I can't even think straight anymore, so I hope you will excuse some of the lack of detail I'm providing, but any suggestion would be helpful at this point.
