Does collinearity of one-hot encoded features matter for SVM and LogReg?

Sometimes I encode categorical features as binary values - one feature per possible category value indicating whether that feature name matches the original category value (i.e. one-of-K scheme). Now these values are linearly dependent, since obviously their total sum is 1. Does this linear dependence matter for linear SVM, kernel SVM, logistic regression, etc.? Where does it matter so that I need to remove one of the features? Does it cause problems for normal linear regression? For which methods does it not make a difference?
