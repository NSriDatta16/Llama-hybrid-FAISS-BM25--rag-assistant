How to increase a particular terms's weightage?

I am doing Text classification using LibSVM in Rapid Miner. I am using TFIDF values for processing documents. I need to Increase weightage of some terms in the documents(for eg. words in BOLD and CAPITAL letters). How can I achieve that using TFIDF values? If TFIDF is not the correct way, can anyone suggest some ways to achieve the result? Thanks in advance
