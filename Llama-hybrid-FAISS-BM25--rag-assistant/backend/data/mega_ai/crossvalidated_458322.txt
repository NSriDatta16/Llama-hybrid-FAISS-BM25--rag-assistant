It sounds like you're trying to apply the intuitions of a hard-margin SVM to the results of a soft-margin SVM and being led astray by the differences. I can tell you're using a soft-margin SVM because you provided a "cost=10" parameter; the e1071 R library does not appear to support a hard-margin classifier directly, but you can approximate it by using a suitably huge cost parameter, say 1e10. When the cost is low, a soft-margin SVM will sometimes choose to misclassify one or more points if it means it can get a wider margin . Perhaps surprisingly, they may do this even when the data are truly linear separable and a "perfect" solution could be found. If you increase the cost to 100 or 1,000 it will behave more like the hard-margin version and you will see it correctly classify all training examples.
