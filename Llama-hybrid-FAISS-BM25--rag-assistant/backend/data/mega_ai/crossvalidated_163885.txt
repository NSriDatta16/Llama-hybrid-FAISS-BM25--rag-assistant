Why we need to extract a lot of features from a dataset for classification

I am newbie in machine learning. I have been studying about features extraction and some classification approaches, in the term of my study, I have a question in my mind, what the reasons we need to extract a lot of features for classification? is it possible to extract one reliable feature from a dataset for good classification results?
