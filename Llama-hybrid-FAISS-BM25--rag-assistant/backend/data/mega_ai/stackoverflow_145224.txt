I have worked on one project where a Gantt chart/MS Project file was used to successfully manage the project. The project information was maintained by a non-developer manager who met with the team individually to obtain status updates. This system seemed to work fairly well and the Gantt chart provided a quick look for the entire team for status. And in talking with a friend of mine who works at a company that uses this approach, it seems to work very well for their teams. On other projects I have worked on where the development lead is expected to maintain the chart, it has not been successful. The lead usually spends extra time trying to wrestle with MS Project. And if the culture focuses on punishing schedule delays and not on resolving the problems, then the Gantt chart can easily be manipulated to show a project on schedule until the delivery date. In those cases the Gantt chart becomes an extra piece of work that provides no value to the project. I think the key point is to have a person outside of the development team who updates the MS Project file. And the Gantt chart should be viewed as a tool to use for communication about project status, possible problems for schedule delays and planning for resource needs. With these items in place, the Gantt chart can be helpful.
