Metadata related exception when using Entity Framework 4

I use VS 2010 Ultimate. I created an 'asp.net web application' from scratch, added a 'ADO.NET Entity Model' to my project (EF4). The problem I'm having is that whenever I try and use an EntityDataSource to pull data out of my entity model I am near constantly getting the following error: "The metadata specified in the connection string could not be loaded. Consider rebuilding the web project to build assemblies that may contain metadata. The following error(s) occurred:" I rebuilt the project but error it still there. Here a piece from my web.config .... any idea how to solve it? thanks An useful article here: http://thedatafarm.com/blog/data-access/embedding-edm-schema-files-in-entity-framework-beta-3/
