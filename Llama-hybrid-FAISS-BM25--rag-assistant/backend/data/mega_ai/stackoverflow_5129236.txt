grails using uuid as id and mapping to to binary column

I want to use a UUID for the id for my domain objects. The idea is that the uuid could be provided by a client and if not a UUID will be generated. I have the definition as like so : : class Person { static mapping = { id generator:'assigned' } String id def getUUID ={ return java.util.UUID.randomUUID().toString(); } transient beforeInsert = { if ( id == null || id.equals("")) id = getUUID(); } } Now assuming I strip the dashes out that are included in the java UUID or client provided UUID I'd like this to be stored in a binary field in my MySQL database. And also on retrieval have the correct format to send back. How can I accomplish that? Thoughts on a better way to do this?
