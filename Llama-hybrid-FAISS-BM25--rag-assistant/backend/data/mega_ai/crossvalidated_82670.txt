Maximum likelihood for number of events in Poisson process

I have a Poisson process with parameter $\lambda$ known. How do I compute the maximum-likelihood estimator for $N$, ie. the number of events over a specific time spell $T$. To repeat, I know $\lambda$ and $T$, and I need to find the ML estimator for $N$ I am asking this because, given that the average time between Poisson events can be modelled as an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda$, I am not even sure which of the two distributions I should use to write down the likelihood function and even if I solve this problem, I would not be able to take derivatives with respect to $N$.
