You have given proper justification in your question. If you want to know the effect of one with the rest held constant, use a main effects model. The principle of marginality states that main effects do not exist in the presence of an interaction, so beware that this is only valid if there is indeed only a negligible interaction effect. Note that the estimate is then the effect of one explanatory variable with the rest fixed at $x_j = 0$ . If you want to know the effect of one variable averaged over the other variables, you can use estimated marginal means. See for example the emmeans package .
