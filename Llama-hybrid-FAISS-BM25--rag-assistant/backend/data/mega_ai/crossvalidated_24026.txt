It's not clear to me that luck buys you much, but I believe you could regress $P(n)$ on $P(n-1)$, $L(n-1)$, and $P(n-1) \times L(n-1)$. I think you'd want to scale $L$ so that $0 At least that's my novice opinion. When using diagnostics to see if your coefficients are statistically significant, I believe that the fact that you're using a time series will cause significance to be over-stated (because presumably $P(n)$ is positively correlated with $P(n-1)$), and I'm not sure how you compensate for that.
