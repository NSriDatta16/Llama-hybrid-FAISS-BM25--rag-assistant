If I understood your problem right, I think you want to check Hibernate Shards. Note that this is an advanced feature, unsupported and not really tested (nor maintained). So, use it at your own risk. You may want to pay special attention to the "Shard Selection Strategy" section: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/stable/shards/reference/en/html_single/#shards-strategy-shardselection From the documentation: We expect many applications will want to implement attribute-based sharding, so for our example application that stores weather reports let's shard reports by the continents on which the reports originate But as the others said: think twice before splitting your data. Do it only if you expect really large volumes of data. A couple million records are not really that much.
