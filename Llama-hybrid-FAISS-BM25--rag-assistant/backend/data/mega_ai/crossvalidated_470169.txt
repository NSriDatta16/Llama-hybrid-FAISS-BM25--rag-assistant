The distribution of waiting times you describe is a hyperexponential distribution. See the Wikipedia entry for details. each $Y_i$ is an exponentially distributed random variable with rate parameter $\lambda_i$ , and $p_i$ is the probability that $X$ will take on the form of the exponential distribution with rate $\lambda_i$ The expected value of wait time is simply: $$E[X]=\sum_{i=1}^n \tfrac{p_i}{\lambda_i}$$ In your example, the average waiting time is $\tfrac{0.8}{1/5}+\tfrac{0.2}{1/60}=16$ minutes. The expected number of patients in a half-hour is $30/16=1.875$ Edit: I believe the final calculation for the expected number of patients per half-hour is correct for a random half-hour period but not necessarily the first half-hour. That is, if we look at a random half-hour period throughout the day it will work, but if we look at the first half-hour when the first patient arrives, or if we're assuming a patient arrives right at the beginning of the half-hour, then the answer will be different. This is because the hyperexponential distribution does not exhibit the memoryless property.
