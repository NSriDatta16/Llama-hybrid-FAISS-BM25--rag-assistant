Machine learning models for regression on small data sets

What are the "best" models to be used for simple regression of 1 numerical variable using only a small data set of e.g. 250 samples and up to 10 features? I understand that the data set is super small (even smaller if one applies e.g. a 60%/40% train-test split) and that this carries a high risk of over-fitting especially when using complex models like neural networks. What would be a reasonable model to use in such a case and what would be the best way to avoid over-fitting? Note that I do not know if relationships are linear or if all features are necessarily helpful.
