Binary predicting time series

I have a time series dataset as follows (just 1 part out of 1000 obs). The data includes only the time and the outcome (1 - success, 0 - failure). Time here is not the amount of time but the date (For example, test 1 is performed at 15:18:56 on 10/9/2012, not that it took 15 hours to complete). Tests are independent but it is assumed that lessons learned after a failure Questions: (1) Do you know any package in R/ Python that could help predicting this data? (2) How the assumption of lesson learned impact the prediction model?
