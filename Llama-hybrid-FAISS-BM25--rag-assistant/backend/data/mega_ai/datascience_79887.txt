What's Joint Training in Neural Networks?

I'm having a hard time trying to find a good explanation of the process of Joint Training in Neural Networks. I already understand the concepts of Fine Tuning and Feature Extraction, and i know it has to do with the practice of taking a network model that has already been trained for a given task, and make it perform a second similar task.
