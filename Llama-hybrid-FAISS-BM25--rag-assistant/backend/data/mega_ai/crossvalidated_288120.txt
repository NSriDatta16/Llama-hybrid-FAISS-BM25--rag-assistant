Although the comments are of course right that iid-ness is the leading case, and that dependence is the leading departure from iid-ness, it is not necessary for a LLN that the means are identical. Here is a version of a LLN taken from White, Asymptotic Theory for Econometricians , Theorem 3.7, who references Chung (1974, pp. 125-126) (link is to a newer edition, where page numbers will likely differ) for a proof. Let $\{\mathcal{Z}_t\}$ be a sequence of independent random variables, with finite means $\mu_t\equiv E(\mathcal{Z}_t)$. If for some $\delta>0$, $\sum_{t=1}^\infty(E|\mathcal{Z}_t-\mu_t|^{1+\delta})/t^{1+\delta} That is, heterogenous means are allowed for the sample average to converge almost surely to the average of the means, provided they are not "too" heterogenous.
