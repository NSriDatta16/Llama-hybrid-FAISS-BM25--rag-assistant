Depends on what information you are looking to manage. Can you be more specific? I use google reader to handle things i read, RememberTheMilk to remind me of what i have to do, and gmail overall to quickly store and search data/correspondences. Oh and i use the hipster PDA too! You should probably check out Lifehacker for more tools and Getting Things Done apps.
