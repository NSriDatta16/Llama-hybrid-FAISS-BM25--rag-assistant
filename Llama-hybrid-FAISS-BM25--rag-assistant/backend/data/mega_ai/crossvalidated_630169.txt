The proposed duplicate is not exact, but close enough. ARIMA, like any other forecasting method, tries to separate signal (forecastable) from noise (not forecastable). Usually, most of the variation comes from noise, therefore the forecast will vary much less than the historical data . This is exactly as it should be. If your data generating process follows an ARIMA(p,d,q) process and you have "enough" data, then an ARIMA model of the same order will give optimal (i.e., MSE-minimal) forecasts, even though the forecasts vary less than the history . Your proposed solution of scaling forecasts does not work, because it relies on getting a scaling factor right. In your example, you do that by looking at the holdout actuals, but now they are not holdout any more. You can't do that for "real" forecasts without waiting for the actuals to come in - by which time you don't need a forecast any more. And no, unless you know a lot of highly specific information about your time series, you won't be able to integrate such a scaling into your forecasting workflow. (And if you can do so, more power to you, but it's not an ARIMA forecast any more.) You may be interested in our resources on forecasting here: Resources/books for project on forecasting models
