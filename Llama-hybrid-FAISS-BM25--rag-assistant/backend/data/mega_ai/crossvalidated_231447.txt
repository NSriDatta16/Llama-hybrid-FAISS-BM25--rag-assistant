Are SMC samples uncorrelated?

In this paper the authors list advantages of SMC. One of them is: Unlike MCMC, SMC particles are uncorrelated and do not require the determination of a burn-in period or assessment of convergence. However, I believe that they are not uncorrelated after the resampling. Could someone help me understand why they would be uncorrelated?
