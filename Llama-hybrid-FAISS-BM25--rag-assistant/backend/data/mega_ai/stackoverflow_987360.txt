urllib2 is nice because it's built in, but I tend to use mechanize when I have the choice. It extends a lot of urllib2 's functionality (though much of it has been added to python in recent years). Anyhow, if it's what you're using, here's an example from their docs on how you'd change the user-agent string: import mechanize cookies = mechanize.CookieJar() opener = mechanize.build_opener(mechanize.HTTPCookieProcessor(cookies)) opener.addheaders = [("User-agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; MyProgram/0.1)"), ("From", "responsible.person@example.com")] Best of luck.
