Scaling a div with drop shadow on patterned background - solutions?

I'm designing a page that has a Content Area which scales against a diagonally striped background. The Content Area div is a fixed width that will scale vertically with content. Because the border is a drop shadow, I have a repeating background image (40px wide by 80px high) that has to line up with the page background image. I need the div to scale in multiples of 80px high so that the repeating backgrounds concur with each other. Is there an elegant solution that will allow me to scale the Content Area div so that it always displays at a multiple of 80px high? If not, is there another approach I can take to solving this problem rather than scaling the div to a multiple of 80px? Thanks in advance! Ryan
