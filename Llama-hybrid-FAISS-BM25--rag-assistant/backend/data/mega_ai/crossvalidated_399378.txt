Re question 1, why would you need to fit a LC model for each group separately? An alternative (and presumably easier - or at least more conceptually straightforward) would be to analyse all the data at same time and then use gender as predictor of class membership - This will tell you whether gender has a significant effect on variability in your data (and you can compute the magnitude of the gender effect - eg "male are on average +25% more likely to belong to class #1 than reference class"). Re question 2, I haven't read the cited article yet, but "simple" post-estimation following the Bayesian rule should do the job (as nicely explained in https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261502000462 ) [Not sure this approach has already been implemented in R/Matlab though].
