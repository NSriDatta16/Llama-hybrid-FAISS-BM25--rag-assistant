Use Grand Central Dispatch's dispatch_once() and check some persistent storage. static dispatch_once_t pred; dispatch_once(&pred,^{ NSUserDefaults * userDefaults = [NSUserDefaults standardUserDefaults]; BOOL hasLaunched = [userDefaults boolForKey:kAppHasLaunched]; if (!hasLaunched) { [self showFirstLaunchMessage]; [userDefaults setBool:YES forKey:kAppHasLaunched]; } }); This is the easiest way to ensure code only gets run once in your app per launch (in this case the block will only be executed once). More information about this is in the Grand Central Dispatch Reference . In this block you simply need to check some persistent storage, such as your preferences, to see if your app has ever launched before and display a message as appropriate.
