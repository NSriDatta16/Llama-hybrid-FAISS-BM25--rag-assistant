Is it possible to use statistics to detect a rising temperature scenario?

It is required to monitor temperature data from a manufacturing environment. The particular use case is to detect if the temperature is rising beyond normal values to enable timely corrective action. The temperature data is being collected by an IoT sensor. Sample data below. It's time series data so time is plotted on the X axis. Currently static thresholds are being used for alerting purposes but it would be preferable to use a dynamic method. I have tried simple linear regression but this wasn't accurate as there is no predictor data available, only sample time and temperature readings. Is it possible to apply a statistical method for this use case?
