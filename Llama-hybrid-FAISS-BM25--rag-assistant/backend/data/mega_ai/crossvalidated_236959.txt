Self organizing maps vs k-means, when the SOM has a lot of nodes

On Wikipedia it says: It has been shown that while self-organizing maps with a small number of nodes behave in a way that is similar to k-means, larger self-organizing maps rearrange data in a way that is fundamentally topological in character. What does that means exactly? I understood the first part: A SOM with small nodes behaves like a k-means algorithm. But for a larger SOM, what does it mean by "fundamentally topological in character"? It makes no sense to me. So Basically my questions are: What is "..fundamentally topological in character..."? What is the difference between a SOM and k-means, when the SOM has a high number of nodes?
