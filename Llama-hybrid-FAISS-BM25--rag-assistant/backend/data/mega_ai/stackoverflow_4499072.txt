symbolicating iPad app crash reports

Here, i am bit new to iPad developement and to objective-c. I am facing a problem here reading device logs. when i browsed through logs, people said that i have build and archive and use that build to the device. so that next time when you connected the device to your machine, device logs will automatically symbolicate the crash logs. But this is not the case. The steps i am following right now. put the xcode configuration device and release. Build -> Build and archive. Go to Build folder, drag and drop the binary file on Itunes icon and select replace. after the testing, re-connect the ipad, go to organizer window, select the device, click on device logs. This shows the symbols only...not any clue of where it is crashed. eg:the crash report Thread 0 Crashed: 0 libSystem.B.dylib 0x30d7c2d4 __kill + 8 1 libSystem.B.dylib 0x30d7c2c4 kill + 4 2 libSystem.B.dylib 0x30d7c2b6 raise + 10 3 libSystem.B.dylib 0x30d90d72 abort + 50 4 libSystem.B.dylib 0x30d7e980 __assert_rtn + 152 5 libgcc_s.1.dylib 0x307e8b4e _Unwind_SjLj_Resume + 26 6 CoreFoundation 0x35801d50 CFRunLoopRunSpecific + 432 7 CoreFoundation 0x35801b88 CFRunLoopRunInMode + 52 8 GraphicsServices 0x320c84a4 GSEventRunModal + 108 9 GraphicsServices 0x320c8550 GSEventRun + 56 10 UIKit 0x341dc322 -[UIApplication _run] + 406 11 UIKit 0x341d9e8c UIApplicationMain + 664 12 My EF 0x00002c84 main (main.m:14) 13 My EF 0x00002c4c start + 32 Please let me know if i am doing something wrong. thanks suresh
