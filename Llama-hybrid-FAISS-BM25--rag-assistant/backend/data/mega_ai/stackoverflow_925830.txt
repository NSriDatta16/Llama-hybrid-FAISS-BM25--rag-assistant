For Java development we use: JUnit complemented by Cobertura (Cobertura identifies which parts of the code are lacking test coverage) Find Bugs - tool that scours the code looking for bugs and vulnerabilities Hudson tool (see hudson.dev.java.net [I can't post hyperlinks yet!]) which manages the building and testing of software. It has a feature like AoP's (above) traffic light - Blue-successful build and all unit tests passed, Yellow-successful build and some unit tests failed, Red-build failed. Hudson also Manages software building via plug-ins to SVN, Continuus, etc Maintains a history of all builds - allowing our Junit tests and Find Bugs results to be displayed in trend graphs Sends emails to all interested parties whenever the build results in a changed state (e.g. Blue to Yellow, Red to Blue) All information is presented in a simple internal web page
