Simplest solution: use a vector which contains your address entries and loop over the vector to search. A map is usually implemented either as a binary tree (look for red/black trees for balancing) or as a hash map. Both of them are not trivial: Trees have some overhead for organisation, memory management and balancing, hash maps need good hash functions, which are also not trivial. But both structures are fun and you'll get a lot of insight understanding by implementing one of them (or better, both :-)). Also consider to keep the data in the vector list and let the map contain indices to the vector (or pointers to the entries): then you can easily have multiple indices, say one for the name and one for the phone number, so you can look up entries by both. That said I just want to strongly recommend using the data structures provided by the standard library for real-world-tasks :-)
