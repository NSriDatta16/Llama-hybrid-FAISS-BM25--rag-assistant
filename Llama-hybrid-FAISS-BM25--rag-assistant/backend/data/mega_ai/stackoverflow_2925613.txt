I'm still learning OOP. Any tips on staying unbiased and pragmatic?

I keep reading about defficiencies and issues with languages. Specifically, I'm learning PHP and Javascript, but I see it everywhere. This question arose while reading Javascript: The Good Parts and PHP Objects, Patterns and Practice. While understanding and avoiding easy pitfalls, is there a way I can learn the fundamentals of OOP and discover solid programming practices without overlooking important areas (or simply becoming jaded)? I'm sure I'll have plenty of opportunity to learn from mistakes!
