Selection of informative examples of majority class for undersample using SVM

I have this idea in mind, but I am not sure how to implement it. Suppose I have an imbalanced data that I want to down-sample instances of majority class, such that it becomes equal in size to the minority class. I want to use SVM to select from majority class, it's class support vector(s) and examples near distance such support vectors until majority class examples equal the minority examples. For example: In the above figure, we have 8 instances of class 1 and 5 instances of class 0 before undersampling. After under-sample, we have 5 instances of class 1 and 5 instances of class 0 so the classes are balanced. Can someone offer guide how this can be done?
