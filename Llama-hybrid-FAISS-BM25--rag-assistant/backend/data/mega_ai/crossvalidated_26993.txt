Classification trees to pick predictive variables

Running a logistic regression we get p-values for all the input variables which helps us choose significant inputs. Similarly can we use the classification trees to pick variables that are split, and use those variables in the model? I think the fact that splitting the dataset on a variable leads to lower classification error should be a good indicator of the predictive power of the variable, is that true?
