C# equivalent of the Ruby symbol

I'm developing a little C# application for the fun. I love this language but something disturb me ... Is there any way to do a #define (C mode) or a symbol (ruby mode). The ruby symbol is quite useful. It's just some name preceded by a ":" (example ":guy") every symbol is unique and can be use any where in the code. In my case I'd like to send a flag (connect or disconnect) to a function. What is the most elegant C# way to do that ? Here is what i'd like to do : BgWorker.RunWorkersAsync(:connect) //... private void BgWorker_DoWork(object sender, DoWorkEventArgs e) { if (e.Arguement == :connect) //Do the job } At this point the my favorite answer is the enum solution ;)
