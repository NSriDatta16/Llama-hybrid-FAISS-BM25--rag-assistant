How to use external data in Unit Tests?

I've got lots of unit tests which needs lots of txt, data, html etc. files. Externally storing these files makes life so much easier to update test cases adding new test cases etc. However having dependencies in Unit Tests brings lots of headache in different systems and in different test runners. What are the best practices? Externally storing them and relatively linking these files in the code? ( causing problems in some test runners, or requires extra configuration ) Embedding all these files in the Unit Test dlls and read from there ( makes creating tests harder ) Storing in a hardcoded location( obviously causing so many problems when you check out the code in a different place ) How do you solve this problem?
