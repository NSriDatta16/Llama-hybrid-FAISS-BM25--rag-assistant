A factor graph is just yet another representation of a Bayesian model. If you had an exact algorithm for inference in a particular Bayesian network, and another exact algorithm for inference in the corresponding factor graph, the two results would be the same. Factor graphs just happen to be a useful representation for deriving efficient (exact and approximate) inference algorithms by exploiting conditional independence between variables in the model, thereby mitigating the curse of dimensionality . To give an analogy: the Fourier transform contains the exact same information as the time representation of a signal, yet some tasks are easier accomplished in the frequency domain, and some are easier accomplished in the time domain. In the same sense, a factor graph is just a reformulation of the same information (the probabilistic model), which is helpful for deriving clever algorithms but doesn't really "add" anything. To be more specific, assume that you are interested in deriving the marginal $p(x_i)$ of some quantity in a model, which requires integrating over all other variables: $$ p(x_i) = \int p(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_i,\ldots, x_N) dx_1x_2\ldots x_{i-1}x_{i+1}\ldots x_N $$ In a high-dimensional model, this is an integration over a high-dimensional space, which is very hard to calculate. (This marginalization/integration problem is what makes inference in high dimensions hard/intractable. One approach is to find clever ways to evaluate this integral efficiently, which is what Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods do. Those are known to suffer from notoriously long computation times.) Without going into too many details, a factor graph encodes the fact that many of these variables are conditionally independent of one another. This enables replacing the above, high-dimensional integration by a series of integration problems of much lower dimension , namely, the computations of the different messages. By exploiting the structure of the problem in this way, inference becomes feasible. This is the core benefit of formulating inference in terms of factor graphs.
