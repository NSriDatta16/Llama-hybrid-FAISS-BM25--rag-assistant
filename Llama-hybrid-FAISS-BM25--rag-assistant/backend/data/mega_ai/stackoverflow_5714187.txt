Including a chunk of code in a shell script

I have a number of shell scripts that all look like this: #!/bin/bash cd ~/Dropbox/cms_sites/examplesite/media sass -C --style compressed --update css:css cd ~/Dropbox/cms_sites/examplesite rm -f ./cache/*.html rm -fr ./media/.sass-cache/ rm -fr ./admin/media/.sass-cache/ rsync -auvzhL . username@host:/home/username/remote_folder (I know the use of cd seems weird, but they have evolved!) Now, all these scripts have a few differences, in that they have different usernames, hosts, local folder and remote folder names, and I want an inexperienced user to be able to run them without arguments (so he can drag and drop them into a terminal without issue). What I'd like to do is something like: #!/bin/bash cd ~/Dropbox/cms_sites/examplesite/media sass -C --style compressed --update css:css cd ~/Dropbox/cms_sites/examplesite include ~/scripts/common.sh rsync -auvzhL . username@host:/home/username/remote_folder then have a file in common.sh that looks like: rm -f ./cache/*.html rm -fr ./media/.sass-cache/ rm -fr ./admin/media/.sass-cache/ so that I can easily change sections of the code in lots of scripts at once. Is this possible, or is there a better way to do this without using arguments and having one script?
