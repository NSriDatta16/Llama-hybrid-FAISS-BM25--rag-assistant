Are these inquiry items required to be available to everyone? Or just the particular user that created them? If they have to be globally available, then you'd have to stick them in the database, with appropriate flag fields to mark them as temporary and which session created them. If it's per user, then it's best to stick them in the session. Cookies shouldn't be used for major data storage, even if it's just a few items. The less data the client has, the less chance there is to mess around with the innards of your system by feeding bad data via the cookie. If there's just a session ID, then there's essentially no chance of doing anything, other than guessing someone else's session ID.
