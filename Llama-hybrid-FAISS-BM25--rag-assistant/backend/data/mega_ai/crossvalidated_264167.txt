Effect Of Temperature Lag On Electricty Demand

I am trying to analyze effect of temperature lag on power demand. I have half hourly power demand & half hourly average temperature data for past 4 years. Power demand does not rise immediately with temperature rise. It take some time lag to rise. So I want to analyze effect of temperature lag on power demand. (Means Impact of temperature at time (t-x) on power demand at time t where x is my lag). I want to check which lag has highest correlation on my demand.
