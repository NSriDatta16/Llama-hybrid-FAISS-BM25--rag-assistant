Build in something that does distributed queuing. When you scale the volume you can scale the different layers of your tier where a bottleneck may come up. Is there a reason to run the cron every second? Is the volume that high? I would say do your best to keep it an n-tier implementation because you will swap things in and out and refactor bits as they fight for your attention. Try not to build anything you design for a few weeks. Often other scenarios will come to you then before things get locked in.
