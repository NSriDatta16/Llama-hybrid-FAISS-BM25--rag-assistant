If malloc() simply takes a long time, you're probably traversing a fragmented free list, many of whose entries have been swapped out. That is consistent with low CPU, high IO, and limited free RAM. For more information on malloc() implementations (including understanding fragmented free lists), the Wikipedia article is good: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malloc#Implementations Oh, and memory leaks aren't acceptable, even in a test environment. As you can see, they're interfering with programs that (as far as you know) don't have leaks, and costing you time.
