How can I batch rename files to lowercase in Subversion?

We are running subversion on a Linux server. Someone in our organization overwrote about 3k files with mixed case when they need to all be lowercase. This works in the CLI rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' * But obviously will screw up subversion. svn rename 'y/A-Z/a-z/' * Doesn't work because subversion deals with renames differently I guess. So How can I do this as a batch job? I suck with CLI, so please explain it like I'm your parents. hand renaming all 3k files is not a task I wish to undertake. Thanks
