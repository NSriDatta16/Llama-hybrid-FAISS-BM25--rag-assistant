I would be inclinded to use the most significant bit of each character, which is currently wasted, by shifting groups of 9 bytes leftwards, you will fit into 8 bytes. You could go further and map the characters into a small space - can you get them down to 6 bits (i.e. only having 64 valid characters) by, for example, not allowing capital letters and subtracting 0x20 from each character ( so that space becomes value 0 ) You could go further by mapping the frequency of each character and make a Huffman type compression to reduce the avarage number bits of each character. I suspect that there are no algorithms that will save data any better that, in the general case, as there is essentially no redundancy in the message after the changes that you have alrady made.
