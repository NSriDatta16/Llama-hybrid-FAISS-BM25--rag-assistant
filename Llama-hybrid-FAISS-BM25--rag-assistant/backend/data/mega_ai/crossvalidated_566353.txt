I agree (+1) with the answers by Stephan Kolassa and Dikran Marsupial, but let me add my two cents. What you need to consider as well is what is your target model. For example, for a classification task logistic regression may be a good benchmark, but if your actual model is logistic regression, you obviously would choose something simpler than that. Usual choice would be a simple model that is known to work for such problems, for example naive forecast for time-series, mentioned by Stephan Kolassa, or LSTM model for NLP task. If you were building a novel state-of-the-art model, you would benchmark against other state-of-the-art models. On another hand, it is always useful to have a trivial benchmark as a sanity check (predict mean, median, the most common value, last value, etc), because there is always risk that your simple benchmark is not good itself.
