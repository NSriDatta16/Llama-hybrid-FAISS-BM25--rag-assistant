My personal experience was learning Object Oriented Software Construction with Object Oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition by Bertrand Meyer. The book was invaluable to me at that time, and still remains the single book from which I've learnt most regarding OO programming and software construction in general. Here are some of its strong points: In Part A: The issues , a very good definition of software quality. In Part B: The road to object orientation , a logical, step by step search for OO techniques in a way that makes the reader think the investigation is being done live, that is, as if there were still no known results. You'll probably acquire the mindset you're looking for from this part. In Part C: Object oriented techniques , the technical core of the book, you'll make your knowledge solid and learn very useful techniques regarding Design by Contract, Inheritance, Genericity, etc. Part D: OO methodology: Applying the method well is a more practical approach on design, which I also find very useful. See for example How to find the classes (22) , which you can find online . After these parts, more advanced topics come, such as Concurrency (30) or Databases (31) . Since the book uses the Eiffel language (designed by the author), this will put you in the right mindset and teach you to think. It will be easy to apply these ideas to other, more or less OO, programming languages.
