Your formula does not seem to match the actual Fieller's Theorem, which according to Wiki, has a correction due to the correlation of the two variables. If your goal is to construct an approximate CI for a ratio of poisson RVs using the upper and lower bounds of the CIs for two Poisson means, this is impossible: you must assume those variables are independent or you must know their covariance. If they are independent, there is no reason to appeal to Fiellers theorem, the CI is a direct result of the $\delta$-method. In either case, your only task is to identify the SE from the CI which I describe below. The first task, for poisson RVs, is to identify the scale on which a normal approximation is made. On the linear scale, the SE of lambda is $\sqrt{\hat{\lambda}/n}$, on a log scale the SE of the log lambda is $\sqrt{2 \hat{\lambda}/n}$ which results in a better coverage 95% non-symmetric CI when re-exponentiated. In either case, it is only algebra to transform the upper and lower bounds of a CI into the SE for the estimate (either lambda or log-lambda). Then you can use the general form of Fieller's theorem to obtain the SE and CI for the ratio or set the covariance to 0 for the special case. Or you can derive the SE yourself with $\delta$ method.
