No, there is no replacement for an #include statement. C# is an object-oriented language where code is organised into classes. You can use code from one class in another class depending on its visibility, and you can split the code from a single class across multiple source files using partial classes. These are essentially the way you use code from one "file" in another. But it's not the same thing at all.
