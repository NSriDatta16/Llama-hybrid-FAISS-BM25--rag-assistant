I know I am very late to this party, however, I wanted to draw your attention to our product, dbMaestro TeamWork for Oracle, which provides exactly the functionality required here. We offer the functionality equivalent to source control tools for Oracle artifacts. Many companies use SCM by proxy (as suggested above by northpole, re using SVN), our solution is "in touch' with the database as required by Reuben on the original post. To read more please visit our site at http://www.dbmaestro.com or e-mail us at info@go-esi.com. Disclosure - My company represents this product in the US.
