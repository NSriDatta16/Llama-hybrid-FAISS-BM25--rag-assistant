Rails action/fragment cache only if admin user is not logged in

Is there a way to disable action/fragment caching when an "admin" user is logged in (like when current_user.role = "admin")? I use caching on my site, but when an admin user is logged in, I add some extra links to certain things which are cached. The amount of admin traffic is really minimal so I would only like to cache what the normal user sees. When an admin is logged in I basically want caching to be turned off for him. I am NOT asking about full-page caching, only fragment.
