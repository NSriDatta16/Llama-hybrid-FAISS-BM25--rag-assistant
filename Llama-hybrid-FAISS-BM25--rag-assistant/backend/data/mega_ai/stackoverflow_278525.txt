SQL CE Merge Replication: Error 28532: A read operation from the transport returned no data

I am using sql server 2005 and ce framework 3.5 and attempting to use merge replication between my hand held and my sql server. I am getting the following error: Error 28532 : A read operation from the transport returned no data. The version of SQL Server Compact 3.5 Client Agent and SQL Server Compact 3.5 Server Agent should match. I am finding little to no information on the net. Can anyone tell me either how to check the versions of Server Compact 3.5 Client Agent and SQL Server Compact 3.5 Server Agent or any steps i can take to resolve the issue ? Thanks Loads Cheryl
