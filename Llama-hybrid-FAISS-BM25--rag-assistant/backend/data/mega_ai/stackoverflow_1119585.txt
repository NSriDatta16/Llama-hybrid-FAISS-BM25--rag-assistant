VIM: is there an easy way to manage Visual Studio solutions / makefile projects from Vim?

I tried using Visual Studio instead of VIM(+plugins), but to be honest - the only advantage of VS over VIM is it's ability to automatically manage my project. I know of existence of ViEmu for VS, but I would like to do the opposite - is there any way to manage projects from within VIM? I tried both c.vim plugin and Project plugins, but: I have a problem while using c.vim on windows (from what I remember, there is an error with "slashes" in filepath ). Project allows to organize projects, but it lacks features for generating makefiles / msbuild files (or am I wrong?). Are there any tips / solutions / hacks, which would allow me to use VIM to manage my projects? (ideally, using both makefiles and MSBuild files, but just one type of build files would be enough.)
