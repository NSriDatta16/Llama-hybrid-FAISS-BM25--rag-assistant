It is an odd thing, But I would suppose it is because the field is private but is accessed using the class name in front. The compiler should realize it is referred from the same class, but it obviously doesn't. So, change the private to protected (not elegant, but should work) You can also try upgrading the JDK (and hence javac). Note that eclipse uses its own compiler (not javac)
