Depends on which version you are using; here is a solution for 1.9. I imagine 1.8 could get ugly. This falls down on elegance, but seems to work. "I love ျမန္မာ".gsub(/([\u0000-\u0999])([\u1000-\u9999])/, '\1,\2') If this method is suitable, you'll have to supply the other case (high to low transition)
