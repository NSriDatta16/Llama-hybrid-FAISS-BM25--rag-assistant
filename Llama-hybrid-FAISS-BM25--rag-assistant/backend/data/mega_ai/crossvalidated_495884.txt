Loosely speaking, the Glivenko-Cantelli theorem says that the empirical distribution converges to the population distribution. This is how the world should work: if we keep drawing from a population, we should be pretty close to the population. Maybe it takes ten draws to get "close" and maybe it takes ten-trillion-bazillion draws, but we should get close. However, we do not get a uniform distribution with a finite sample size. For a continuous uniform distribution, this cannot ever happen, as the empirical distribution is finite and therefore discrete. (Note that being discrete does not require finite-ness, however.) For a discrete uniform distribution, the empirical distribution can happen to be distributed the same way as the population distribution, but sometimes values will be over-represented or under-represented. After repeated sampling with the distribution tend to 2 of each colour ? No, though you will wind up averaging two of each color.
