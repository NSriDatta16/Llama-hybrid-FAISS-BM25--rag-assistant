NeHe is in the process of writing new tutorials . Some of the things you may have been used to 10 years ago have been more or less abandoned (compatibility profiles are still around, but they're deprecated) in moving to a fully-programmable pipeline and more efficient primitives. For example, passing vertices between glBegin() / glEnd() is being left behind in favor of vertex buffer objects and vertex arrays. The old transform and lighting model is going away in favor of fragment shaders. I'd suggest starting with Joe Groff's intro to modern OpenGL , and get a copy of The OpenGL SuperBible, 5th edition , which covers all of the new ways of doing things.
