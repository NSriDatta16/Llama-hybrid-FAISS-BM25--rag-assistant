Best way to represent x attributes in y categories in same chart over time series

Is it possible to represent x attributes in y categories over a time series in same chart without losing ability to cross verify between attributes within same category and same attribute between different categories? A more concrete example would be, I have download, upload (2 attributes) for a device reported by different data sources (say 3 data sources, so 3 categories). I would like to represent download, upload for all data sources in same chart without losing the ability to check upload, download per data source and also be able to check upload attribute alone across different data sources. Also I would like to represent this data over time series. Say for example, per hour in a day. I feel like this would be a common data visualization problem, could someone point me in right direction please?
