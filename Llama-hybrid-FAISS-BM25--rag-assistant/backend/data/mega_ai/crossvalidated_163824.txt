Different ways to produce a confidence interval for odds ratio from logistic regression

I am studying how to construct a 95% confidence interval for odds ratio from the coefficients obtained in the logistic regression. So, considering the logistic regression model, $$ \log\left(\frac{p}{1 - p}\right) = \alpha + \beta x \newcommand{\var}{\rm Var} \newcommand{\se}{\rm SE} $$ such that $x = 0$ for control group and $x = 1$ for case group. I have already read that the simplest way is to construct a 95% CI for $\beta$ then we applied the exponential function, that is, $$ \hat{\beta} \pm 1.96\times \se(\hat{\beta}) \rightarrow \exp\{\hat{\beta} \pm 1.96\times \se(\hat{\beta})\} $$ My questions are: What is the theoretical reason that justifies this procedure? I know $\mbox{odds ratio} = \exp\{\beta\}$ and maximum likelihood estimators are invariant. However, I do not know the connection among these elements. Should the delta method produce the same 95% confidence interval as the previous procedure? Using the delta method, $$\exp\{\hat{\beta}\} \dot{\sim} N(\beta,\ \exp\{\beta\}^2 \var(\hat{\beta}))$$ Then, $$\exp\{\hat{\beta}\} \pm 1.96\times \sqrt{\exp\{\beta\}^2 \var(\hat{\beta})}$$ If not, which is the best procedure?
