To allow data capture in a PDF you will not necessarily need LiveCycle on the server side, but it will make your life much easier. The module you're looking for is LiveCycle Forms ES2. This provides a host of functionality for stripping info out of dynamic and static PDF (and HTML) forms. As a cheaper option you can also consider simply embedding a PDF Form (XFA standard) in your client app. This form will have to be designed using the LiveCycle designer tool which is fairly inexpensive. If you want a lot of interactivity inside the PDF itself (for example allowing users to save it offline for later use or to make Acrobat comments) then you'll also need to apply a reader extension credential to the PDF. Reader extended forms give you another option, i.e. submitting data directly from a PDF form into a SOAP web service.
