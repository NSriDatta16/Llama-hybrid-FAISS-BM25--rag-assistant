No. Building software isn't an activity that scales well. If it takes one woman 9 months to have a baby, does it take 18 women one month? Someone above mentioned "The Mythical Man Month" - this problem was first covered there. At some point, communication and overhead costs of developing software in a team actually begins to hinder forward momentum. There's also the argument that there's a factor of 10 difference in productivity between great programmers and an average programmer (or - those that waste their time posting on StackOverflow and those that don't) And the mythical (or perhaps not-so-mythical) Net-Negative Productive Programmers - those that through bad practices, bad design decisions, or in some way destroying team morale actually cause negative productivity. Plus, most software houses specialize in a type of software, or a language, and there's new stuff coming out all the time. "Innovation Happens Elsewhere" - once you're big enough, you're comfortable doing what you've always done, so you're not going to be looking for new things that may destroy your current model. And open source is big now - so you can't really get a big company that's going to lock out all software except for theirs. (No matter how much Microsoft wants to...)
