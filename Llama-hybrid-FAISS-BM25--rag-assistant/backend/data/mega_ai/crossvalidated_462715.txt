Books or articles to study different forecasting techniques for lumpy and intermittent demand

I am doing a project to forecast demand for an automotive firm making spare parts. Using average demand interval (ADI) and square of the Coefficient of Variation (CV2), I have categorized product SKUs into smooth, erratic, lumpy and intermittent. There are ARIMA, exponential smoothing techniques for smooth demand. However, I am unable to find enough literature for lumpy and intermittent demand. There are 3 methods that have been mentioned in several blogs for intermittent - 1) Croston's method 2) Adjusted Croston's method 3) Bootstrap method I am reading about these 3 methods. However, I haven't found any literature on lumpy demand forecasting. Can some please suggest me some good books or articles to understand the different forecasting techniques for lumpy and intermittent demand (can have state space and neural networks also)? If that book or article explains the above 3 methods, it will be an added bonus for me. Thanks.
