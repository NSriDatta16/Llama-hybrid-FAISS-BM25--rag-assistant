Stop drag-n-drop event with Raphaeljs

I am trying to simulate the swipe event from the iPhone with Raphaeljs. To do so, I am using the drag and drop event. To simulate the event in have a method in the move event that calculate the distance between my object and the mouse position. If the mouse goes after that distance I want to stop the drag and drop event. This is where I'm stuck. Here is the code: var start = function (event) { }, move = function (event) { inrange = self.inRange (circle.attr("cx"), circle.attr("cy"), event.pageX, event.pageY); if(inrange == false){ //Stop draging! } }, up = function () { circle.animate({ r: 40, "stroke-width": 1 }, 200); }; circle.drag(move, start, up); In the move method I need the stop the drag event or simulate a mouseup . How can I do so?
