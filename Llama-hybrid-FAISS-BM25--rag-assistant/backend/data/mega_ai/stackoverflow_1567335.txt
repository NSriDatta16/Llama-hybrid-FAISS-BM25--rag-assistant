Plagiarism Analyzer (compared against Web Content)

Hi everyone all over the world, Background I am a final year student of Computer Science. I've proposed my Final Double Module Project which is a Plagiarism Analyzer, using Java and MySQL. The Plagiarism Analyzer will: Scan all the paragraphs of uploaded document. Analyze percentage of each paragraph copied from which website. Highlight only the words copied exactly from which website in each paragraph. My main objective is to develop something like Turnitin, improved if possible. I have less than 6 months to develop the program. I have scoped the following: Web Crawler Implementation. Probably will be utilizing Lucene API or developing my own Crawler (which one is better in terms of time development and also usability?). Hashing and Indexing. To improve on the searching and analyzing. Questions Here are my questions: Can MySQL store that much information? Did I miss any important topics? What are your opinions concerning this project? Any suggestions or techniques for performing the similarity analysis? Can a paragraph be hashed, as well as words? Thanks in advance for any help and advice. ^^
