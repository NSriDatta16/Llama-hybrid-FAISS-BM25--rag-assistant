SVN+SSH authentication isses when running CruiseControl.NET 1.4.4 SP1 service on Windows Server 2003

The SVN+SSH protocol works great for the logged-in user because we have Pageant (PuTTY authentication agent) running in the background for that user. When we try to run the ccservice (as opposed to the ccnet.exe app) the svn+ssh fails. What am I missing in the config to get it working? D:\cc\ProjectX\code\trunk\src\ D:\cc\ProjectX\artifact\ ProjectX http://localhost/ccnet/ 30 0.1. true 000 svn+ssh://10.10.2.19/srv/svn/ProjectX/trunk/src D:\cc\ProjectX\code\trunk\src C:\Program Files\Subversion\bin\svn.exe super duper 5 TortoiseSvn is installed on the server if that helps. I'm not sure if I need to add some command-line switches to get it to work or what.
