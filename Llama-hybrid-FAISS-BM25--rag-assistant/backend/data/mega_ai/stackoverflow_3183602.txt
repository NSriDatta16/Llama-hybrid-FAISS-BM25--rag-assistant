iphone xml parses text but no images or paragraph spacing

i am trying to parse an xml blog found here: http://www.feed43.com/1515171705611023.xml it has pictures within the text . I am able to parse the headers, the content and the link of the individual posts. I, however, cannot get it to parse the paragraph spacing links within the text or images. all three of these are EXTREMELY important. I am using this: http://github.com/mwaterfall/MWFeedParser with very few changes. most them having to do with appearances and the actual feed loaded as well as using a scroll view for the detail view instead of the table view shown. note: it didnt load these things before I made changes either. Can anyone help me?
