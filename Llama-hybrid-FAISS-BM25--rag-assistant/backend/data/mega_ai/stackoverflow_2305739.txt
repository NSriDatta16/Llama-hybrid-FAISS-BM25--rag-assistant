Primary keys are like unique indexes except: Cannot contain NULLable columns Some storage engines treat them differently - InnoDB, for example, clusters the primary key, which can sometimes be a Good Thing, occasionally be a Bad Thing, but mostly not matter. As they can't have NULLs, a primary key MUST uniquely identify a row.
