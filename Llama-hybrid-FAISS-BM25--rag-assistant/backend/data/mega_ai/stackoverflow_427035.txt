Implementing Java's getResponseCode() in C?

If it's any help, there is also a similar class in C#'s WebRequest. Although I do not want it in java or .NET, i am wondering how to implement this in native C/C++ code (for windows). for reference: try { URL url=new URL("http://google.ca"); HttpURLConnection con=(HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection(); con.connect(); int code = con.getResponseCode(); System.out.println(code); } catch (MalformedURLException e) { System.err.println("Error reading URL."); } prints out: 200 meaning "OK" I understand I probably need to use sockets and send a User-Agent string, but I haven't a clue where to begin. Whenever I learn a new language the first thing I like to do is try porting my code to it, but this one has stumped me. Any help is appreciated
