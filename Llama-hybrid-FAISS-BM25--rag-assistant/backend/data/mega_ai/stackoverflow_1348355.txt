Enough to store a reference to any A! :-) Note that it's generally impossible to know exactly how many bytes a particular implementation will actually use for a particular allocation, even in low-level languages like C: malloc() itself is a function which obviously needs to maintain internal data structures. To avoid fragmentation, it usually allocates a 2^n-sized block of memory. And so on. If you're concerned about how much memory is actually used, write a sample program, and run it through your profiler.
