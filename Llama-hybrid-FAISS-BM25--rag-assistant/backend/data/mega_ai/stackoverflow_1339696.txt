My suggestion for drag-n-drop in silverlight: Define a Canvas layout 'below' your regular layout (z-order). When you select your object to drag-n-drop from your regular layout (grid, etc), move the object to the underlying Canvas which allows pixel positioning. Move the canvas 'above' the current layout. Drag the object by updating its Canvas position. When you finished the drag, return the object to the regular layout at the appropriate location (you might have to fish through your top-level layout to find the appropriate connection point). Return the canvas layer to a lower z-order than your regular layout. This worked pretty well for a simple Drag-drop system that i needed. Telerik controls also provides a drag-n-drop framework. -Jeff
