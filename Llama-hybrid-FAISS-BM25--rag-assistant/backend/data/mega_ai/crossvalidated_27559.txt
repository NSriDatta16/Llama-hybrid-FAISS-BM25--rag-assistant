I don't think a book like this exists. The book that I think comes closest is Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models . Cons: It's ~5 old and aimed at social scientists. It does not have everything on your TOC list (nothing spatial, basically nothing on time series, etc.) Pros: Well-written It's got a list of errata and a TOC at the link It covers key things like missing data, which is not on your numbered list. It does hit most items on your bullet list. Lots of graphs and R code (some Bugs code for the multi-level). All the data/code is available for downloading.
