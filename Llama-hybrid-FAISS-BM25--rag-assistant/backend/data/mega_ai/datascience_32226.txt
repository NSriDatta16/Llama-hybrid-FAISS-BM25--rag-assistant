Have you looked at the Rainbow RL ? It combines all improvements of RL. Apart from structural changes other improvements come from Reward Shaping, Curiosity-driven Learning, RL with Unsupervised Auxiliary tasks and RL with external memory (e.g. Neural Episodic Control, Model-free episodic Control). It's pitty that you leave out from your question Policy Gradients, they are lots of fun :) Happy reading!
