Personally I take a pragmatic point of view for this sort of thing - that it's okay to make unit tests "white box" tests (i.e. you can take implementation details into account and test them) but don't go so far down that route that they end up being hugely brittle. I'd make the private methods internal and test them via InternalsVisibleTo . Also run some "black box" tests via just the Run method... it sounds like these are really integration tests more than unit tests. Another thing to consider is whether this really should be one class. Are the tasks separable? Would they make sense as individual classes themselves, with the current class just coordinating them?
