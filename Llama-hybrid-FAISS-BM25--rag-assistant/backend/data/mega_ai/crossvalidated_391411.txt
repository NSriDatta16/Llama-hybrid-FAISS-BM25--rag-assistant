Using ARMA-GARCH models to simulate foreign exchange prices

I've fitted an ARIMA(1,1,1)-GARCH(1,1) model to the time series of AUD/USD exchange rate log prices sampled at one-minute intervals over the course of several years, giving me over two million data points on which to estimate the model. The dataset is available here . For clarity, this was an ARMA-GARCH model fitted to log returns due to the first-order integration of log prices. The original AUD/USD time series looks like this: I then attempted to simulate a time series based on the fitted model, giving me the following: I both expect and desire the simulated time series to be different from the original series, but I wasn't expecting there to be such a significant difference. In essence, I want the simulated series to behave or broadly look like the original. This is the R code I used to estimate the model and simulate the series: library(rugarch) rows And this is the estimation output: *---------------------------------* * GARCH Model Fit * *---------------------------------* Conditional Variance Dynamics ----------------------------------- GARCH Model : sGARCH(1,1) Mean Model : ARFIMA(1,0,1) Distribution : std Optimal Parameters ------------------------------------ Estimate Std.

It appears as though the model residual is not being used as the noise term in my simulation attempt, though I'm not sure how to incorporate it.
