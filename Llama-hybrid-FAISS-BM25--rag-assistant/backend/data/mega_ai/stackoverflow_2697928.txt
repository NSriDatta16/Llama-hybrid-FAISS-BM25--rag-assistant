Algorithm on trajectory analysis

I would like to analyse trajectory data based on given templates. I need to stack similar trajectories together. The data is a set of coordinates (xy, xy, xy) and the templates are again lines defined by the set of control points. I don't know to what direction to go, maybe to Neural Networks or pattern recognition? Could you please recommend a page, book or library to start with? Kind regards, Arman. PS: Is it the right place to ask the question? EDIT To be more precise the trajectory contains about 50-100 control points. Here you can see the example of trajectories: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KFE0JLx6L-o
