I think it would be more practical to scale it up, so don't add a node, but double the number of nodes, and half the value of each connection. You're going to have to play around a bit with exactly how you implement this in order to get it acting normal, and then just mess with doubling the size and seeing how training the "half trained/half fresh" neural network affects the results. As for an algorithm that only uses "Needed" nodes, that doesn't entirely make sense, because from a mathematical standpoint the algorithm is trying to match the training data as well as possible, and therefore every node "helps". Over-fitting isn't actually a failure of the backprop algorithm, it is when enough resources are provided that it can actually do it's job TOO well, and not actually recognize overarching patterns but specific input cases.
