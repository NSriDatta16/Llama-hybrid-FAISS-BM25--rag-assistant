Estimation Procedure of Multilevel Logistic Regression

I know the estimation procedure for logistic regression is the iterative weighted least squares method. In the book An Introduction to Generalized Linear Models written by Dobson & Barnett, in chapter 7, they described how to estimate parameters of logistic regression by an example. I am looking something like that (including example) for the Estimation Procedure of multilevel logistic regression. Can you please give me online reference for the topic?
