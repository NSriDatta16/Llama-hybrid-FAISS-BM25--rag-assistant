There are a couple of different misfire policies that could work for you. Look at the javadocs here: http://www.quartz-scheduler.org/docs/api/1.8.0/org/quartz/SimpleTrigger.html paying attention to the static final constants that start with MISFIRE_INSTRUCTION_RESCHEDULE_*. There are a number of different behaviors in regards to the repeat count, but I think they'll accomplish what you're trying to do.
