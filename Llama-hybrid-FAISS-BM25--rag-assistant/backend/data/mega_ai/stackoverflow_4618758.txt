Problem Creating MSBUILD Script

I'm having trouble with the tag in my WPF project. What I'm trying to do is implement a post-build event in the automated team build I have set up in TFS 2010 that triggers a piece of integrated software for measuring code metrics called NDepend. NDepend's site gives some code samples of what I need to do, I believe. These code snippets are shown below: c:\tools\NDepend\NDepend.console.exe $(SolutionDir)MyProject.ndproj $(TargetDir)NDepend $(TargetDir) and c:\tools\NDepend\NDepend.console.exe $(SolutionRoot)\Main\src\MyProject.ndproj $(BinariesRoot)\NDepend $(BinariesRoot)\Release I run into trouble, though, when trying to find where to put this code. The website may be telling me everything I need to know and I'm just overlooking it or something, I don't know. But wherever I try typing in the tags, VS just acts like it doesn't recognize it. In fact when I try typing just about all of the tags in the above snippets VS doesn't seem to recognize it. Am I just missing an(some) assembly reference(s) somewhere? I've written some XAML before, but I've never seen "target" as a tag, I've always seen it in the form of a property. So when I originally saw this code on their site, it looked a little strange to me, but I just thought it was because I haven't had a ton of exposure to XAML. EDIT: The above paragraph is mistaken--As seen in the comments, the aforementioned code is XML, not XAML The site does say that the code snippets given are for VS2008, which does make a difference, I understand. However, I didn't realize it was THAT big of a difference. So could it be just a difference from 2008 to 2010? In which case, what is the difference in the code from 2008 given above and what it should be in 2010?
