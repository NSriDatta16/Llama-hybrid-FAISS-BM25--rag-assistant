The issue isn't in the compiler (candle.exe). Candle.exe creates the separate "sections" (Module and Fragment are both "sections"). It is the linker (light.exe) that is responsible for pulling it all together. Light.exe starts at the "entry section" (Product, Module or Patch) and follows the references down from there. Since you don't have a reference from your Main.wxs to your Secondary.wxs, the stuff in the Secondary.wxs is never pulled in. To resolve this just add: somewhere under your Module element (I usually put them at the end). If you get lots of Components then ComponentGroup and ComponentGroupRef becomes useful.
