Boot camp for learning a new language

Is it possible to learn an entire programming language with about a week, at most two to spare? When i say a week i mean an average full time computer science university school week. are there some specific programs you can try that will make you reach substantially above intermediate level? Substantially above intermediate level - Getting assignments and projects done with little or no help. Update. I think it should be possible with about two and a half to three weeks. A single week might be too short.
