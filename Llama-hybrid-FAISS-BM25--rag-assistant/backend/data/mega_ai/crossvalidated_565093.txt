What are we actually testing in the Augmented Dickey fuller test?

I have been trying to understand the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test and have watched many lectures and videos about it, and I would say the video from ritvikmath is the clearest one. He says that to test whether there is a unit root we do a t-test for the delta term (Yt-1 coefficient) and test it against the Dickey-Fuller distribution, and we do a regular t-test for the beta coefficients for the Yt-i terms, comparing against the regular t distribution. What I don't get is that delta and beta coefficients are just sums of coefficients, for an AR(3) the delta term that we would test is ∂1+∂2+∂3-1 or a sum of 2 coefficients minus 1. However we don't have any actual terms for those coefficients, so what are we testing? That is the sum of coefficients minus 1 which represents delta in rikvitmath's video, but how do we do a t test for coefficients with no assigned values? This is the equation to find the t value but pi in this case is just a representation of the summation of coefficients with no value, so how does this calculation work? Furthermore, the regular t test for the beta value states βi. but i stands for the order of the auto-regressive model, how does a computer determine how many lags there are, or what order AR(p) the time series is.
