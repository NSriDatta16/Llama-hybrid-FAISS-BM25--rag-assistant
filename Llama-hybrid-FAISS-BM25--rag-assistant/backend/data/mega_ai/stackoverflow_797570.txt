Zend_Search_Lucene crashes during indexing

I wanted to create search engine for my webpage, but during indexing on server it crashes with errors : Warning: opendir(/admin/lucene/) [function.opendir]: failed to open dir: Too many open files in /admin/includes/Zend/Search/Lucene/Storage/Directory/Filesystem.php on line 159 Warning: readdir(): supplied argument is not a valid Directory resource in /admin/includes/Zend/Search/Lucene/Storage/Directory/Filesystem.php on line 160 Warning: closedir(): supplied argument is not a valid Directory resource in /admin/includes/Zend/Search/Lucene/Storage/Directory/Filesystem.php on line 167 Fatal error: Ignoring exception from Zend_Search_Lucene_Proxy::__destruct() while an exception is already active (Uncaught Zend_Search_Lucene_Exception in /admin/includes/Zend/Search/Lucene/Storage/File/Filesystem.php on line 66) in /admin/test.php on line 549 I am using newest version of ZF. Is there code solution for such error - I run script on localhost and it works great. Thanks for any help.
