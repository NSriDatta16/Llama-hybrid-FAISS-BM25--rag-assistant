If I understand your question correctly, you need admin rights to install your product. I see three options: 1) Don't install to the tester's desktops. Get some scratch testing machines (as dmo suggested, VMWare might help) that you can safely give them admin rights to. This may mean giving them a test domain and their own group policy to edit. 2) Build a variant that doesn't require MSI installation, and can be executed directly. Obviously your testers would not be testing the deployment and installation process with this variant, but they could perform other tests of the product's functionality. I don't know if this is possible with your product; it would certainly be work. 3) Take your agile medicine: "[prefer] responding to change over following a plan". That is, if denying admin rights to your testers is interfering with their ability to do their jobs efficiently, then challenge the organization to give them admin rights. (from experience, this will mean shifting to #1, but it might be the best way to make the case). If they are expected to test the product, how can they not even be allowed to install it in the same way a customer would?
