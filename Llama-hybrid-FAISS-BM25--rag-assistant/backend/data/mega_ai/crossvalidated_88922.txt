Logit with dummies when certain number of dummies must be used

In Stata 12, I'm using logit to model a process that is successful or fails and requires seven workers. I have a larger pool of potential workers and am using dummies to signify which seven individuals were working on the process, which resulted in a success or fail. So the coefficients will report the impact each individual worker will have on probability of success if they are included. However, (again) this process requires seven workers. All of the observations show exactly seven of the 30-something worker dummies activated. In reality, it doesn't make sense to imagine the addition or removal of a worker - the process will be fundamentally different if only six workers are present. My results can still show the relative impacts across workers, but I'm worried about the conceptual problem of having only six workers. I would be interested in comparing the impact of each worker relative to some "average" or "benchmark" worker, but I'm not sure how to do that.
