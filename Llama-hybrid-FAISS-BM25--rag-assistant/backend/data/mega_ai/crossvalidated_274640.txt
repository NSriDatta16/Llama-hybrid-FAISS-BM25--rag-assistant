Calculating the Standard Deviations for Percentages

I have a data-set consisting of the Analytical and Label nutrient values for certain food (their mean and standard deviations). I was checking the consistency of the calculations. I believe that there are two major flaws with this analysis and would be glad if someone could address them. The Mean Percentage discrepancy has been calculated by taking the average of the percentage discrepancy of each row (highlighted). I think that one should not take the averages of percentages which are unrelated (Each percent is defined for different nutrients). However, I would love if someone could confirm this. The standard deviation for Mean Discrepancy percentage is just the standard deviation of percentage Discrepancy (% Discrep). Is it a correct way to compute the standard deviation? I feel that the standard deviation of the Analytical and label values do not reflect in this value of standard deviation.
