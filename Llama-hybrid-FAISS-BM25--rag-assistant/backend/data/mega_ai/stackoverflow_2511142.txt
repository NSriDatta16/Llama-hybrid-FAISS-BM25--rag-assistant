Using Magento with a simple one-product site

What's the best way to integrate Magento with a simple HTML-based single product site? I envision installing Magento, and then the existing site just "hooks" into Magento versus using the entire Magento framwork, etc. I don't want to use Magento as a "CMS" I just want to use it to handle the order processing. Any tips or suggestions on how to accomplish this?
