If you know the angle of the red line for some polygon ( a , say), then the polygon is on one side or other of that line. So: Use the average colour of some pixels near the line on both sides to determine which is the case. If the polygon is above the line, the rotation angle is 180+ a . If the polygon is below the line, the rotation is a . where above and below correspond to the smaller-angle side and larger-angle sides of the line according to how you measure a .
