I have one sort of crusty answer. You can create a new branch with out foo, bar, and baz in it and then cherry-pick bar to the new branch and then git-svn dcommit that branch and remove it when you're done. That doesn't seem very elegant though. So assuming foo, bar, and baz are in branch x and master doesn't have any of them. git branch y master git checkout y git cherry-pick git svn dcommit git checkout x git svn rebase git branch -d y If master does have these commits you can reset the head as Sizzler suggests.
