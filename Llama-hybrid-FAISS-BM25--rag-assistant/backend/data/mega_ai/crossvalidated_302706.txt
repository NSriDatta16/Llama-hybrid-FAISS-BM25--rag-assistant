How to reverse factor analysis (FA) and reconstruct original variables?

I saw this interesting topic: How to reverse PCA and reconstruct original variables from several principal components? and a nice answer with a very useful example of Iris data in Matlab. I would like to do the same using factor analysis instead of PCA. I tried to make it with 'factoran' of Matlab with the help of @ttnphns and @amoeba but I don't obtain a good correlation between my reconstructed data and the original ones. input_data (*data are EMG measurement from 6 arm muscles in order to identify synergies) PCA method: X = input_data; mu = mean(X); [eigenvectors, scores] = pca(X); nComp = 2; Xpca = scores(:,1:nComp) * eigenvectors(:,1:nComp)'; Xpca = bsxfun(@plus, Xpca, mu); I obtain good correlation between them. FA method: X = input_data; mu = mean(X); [LoadingsPM,specVarPM,rotationPM,stats, scores] = ... factoran(X,2,'rotate','promax'); Xfa = scores*LoadingsPM'; Xfa = bsxfun(@plus, Xfa, mu); But in this case the correlations are bad. I don't know if I forget something? (I divided per 3 the FA reconstruction in order to see better the 3 curves). @ttnphns note : word "reverse" in the title should be taken in the technical sense of computing variables as they are returned by the computed factors (their scores), - not in the theoretical sense (in which FA model is nothing but predicting variables by factors, so that there is no a "reverse" direction). In PCA, this prediction/direction indeed could be called "reverse" in a theoretical sense, too.
