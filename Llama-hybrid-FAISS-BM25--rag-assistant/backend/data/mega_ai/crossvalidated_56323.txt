Testing for weak instruments in panel data

Suppose I have hierarchical data such as students clustered into classrooms. I want to use a two stage least squares regression with an instrument that affects students at the classroom level to test my hypothesis. What is the appropriate method to test if my instrument is weak? The Cragg-Donald F-statistic with Stock and Yogo critical values seems appropriate for the general case of identifying weak instruments but it doesn't build in any adjustment for clustering.
