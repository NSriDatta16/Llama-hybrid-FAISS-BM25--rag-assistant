Here is a link to a huge database of handwritten digits. The front page also has relative performance data for many different methods including 2 layer Neural networks. This ought to give you a good start: MNIST digits database and performance You might also want to check out Geoff Hinton's work on Restricted Boltzmann Machines which he says performs fairly well, and there is a good explanatory lecture on his site (very watchable).
