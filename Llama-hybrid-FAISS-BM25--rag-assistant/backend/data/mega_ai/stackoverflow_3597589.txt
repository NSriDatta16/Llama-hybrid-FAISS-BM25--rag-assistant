If you want to write practical code, and/or you want a good degree of portability from one implementation to another, use Common Lisp. There are eleven implementations currently under active maintenance. See my survey of implementations. The different implementations have different strengths. If you want a free, open-source one, Clozure Common Lisp (CCL) (not to be confused with "Clojure"!) and Steel Bank Common Lisp (SBCL) are good general-purpose implementations. There are also commercial implementations, the best known being Allegro Common Lisp and LispWorks. For Windows-friendliness, Corman Common Lisp has useful facilities. For embedding, Embedded Common Lisp (ECL) is great (you don't have to use it in an embedded way). If you want a Common Lisp that compiles to the Java Virtual Machine, there's Armed Bear Common Lisp (ABCL). See the paper for others; which one you want depends on your individual circumstances.
