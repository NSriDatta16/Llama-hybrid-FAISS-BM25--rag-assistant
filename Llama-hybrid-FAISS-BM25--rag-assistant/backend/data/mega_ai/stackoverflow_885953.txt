How relevant is the OpenAjax Alliance to the average web developer?

The OpenAjax Alliance states that it is an "organization of leading vendors, open source projects, and companies using Ajax," but I don't find any questions on stackoverflow that reference them. I am wondering if it is important to the practicing web developer. John Resig has a Thoughts on OpenAjax blog post in Feb 2007, but I can't find many other references. I have looked at the OpenAjax Hub 1.0 as a way to do publish/subscribe messaging in the browser (similar to TIBCO PageBus , which implements the specification). Is anyone using this technology effectively in a large, public facing web application?
