If your missing values are MCAR you could simply drop them (and probably lose some information this way) or impute them (multiple times) and get pooled results. I suspect these values are not MCAR, in this case it's significantly more complicated, especially if you do not have any domain knowledge about the underlying process. Personally I would not drop them, unless they really pose computational problems. I would try using a method that can deal with missing values internally (see for ex. xgboost ). Otherwise, faced with hard decisions and no readily available solutions, you could simply leave them as is, at 0, representing below (or above) a detectable threshold. You could also try imputing them in various ways (mean, median) to check how the results change (some sort of sensitivity analysis). If the results change significantly then it is possible that these variables are quite important. If the results do not change, then they may be useless. If a variable only has 1 or 2 non-missing values then you can safely drop them, since they won't provide much of any information. There is no hard threshold, so you would have to use your own judgement.
