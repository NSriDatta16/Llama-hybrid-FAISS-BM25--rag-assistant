Yes, I would also totally agree with Louis T , as he has suggested it is better if you start with 3 hidden layers and see how the model is performing. There are couple of things which I would like to add to his answer: I would recommend you to do feature engg. on data so that you can make better sense out of it, rather then model taking over that task, one of the major reason for that is sometimes machine cannot give some meaningful features with respect to the business and the other important thing would be Cost Function , as the model increases its Complexity the more the cost function would be. So, how do you decide which model would give you better results: For example, there are 2 networks(assuming using NN for Prediction) : Net-1: hidden layers = 3 and RMSE = 3.4500 Net-2: hidden layers = 4 and RMSE = 3.4200 If you we look closely RMSE for Net-2 is less but considering the scenario WRT to hidden layers, I would go with Net-1 because we are considering the Complexity and Cost Function for deciding. Hope my answer is helpful. NN : Neural Network RMSE : Root Mean Square Error
