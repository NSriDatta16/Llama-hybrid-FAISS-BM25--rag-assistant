vnc application for iPhone. How to go about building one?

Alright.. I am on a mission to learn iPhone development as much as possible. At my current job they have requested me if I can build a vnc viewer in iPhone.. there are many vnc apps but i want to learn how to build an app like that.. what would be the architecture of this app how should i organize my app? Edit: Specific question: Is VNC the best (or the only) opensource protocol to do remote desktop connections? What security precautions should one consider when building the client? Any thoughts? comments?
