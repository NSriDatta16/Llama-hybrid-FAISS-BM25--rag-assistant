I don't completely agree with Dan Heberden's analogy, so here's my "corrected" version (IMHO)... DNS = host/hostess Shows you where to go Web server = kitchen It's where all the dirty work goes down, usually out of sight of the customers Web browser = waiter/waitress Passes your order to the kitchen, and later returns with your food HTTP = ticket/order Standardized the ordering format, to make waiter-to-chef communication easy PHP = chef Generates content and structures it with HTML Database = fridge/pantry Where all the ingredients are kept, organized and easy to access HTML = plate/bowl Provides structure for content CSS = presentation Makes your content appear attractive Content = food It's what you came for in the first place JavaScript = your food running around on the plate while you chase it with your fork Provides behavior to your food - this may seem odd to western cultures ;)
