As @Analyst noted, there is no R-Squared for logistic regression. While there are several 'pseudo-R-squared' options available, I would advise against using them - there are simply too many and none of them properly get at the issue you are trying to solve. Remember that the purpose of logistic regression is different from OLS regression. In the latter, you minimize the squared error, and the R^2 is conceptually straightforward - the total % variance accounted for by the model. In contrast, logistic regression seeks classification accuracy. This can be assessed numerically in several ways, using such metrics as AUC (area under the ROC curve), confusion matrices, positive predictive value (PPV), etc, etc. For AUC/ROC, I suggest you look into R package 'pROC'. For confusion matrices, PPV, etc., try R package 'caret'.
