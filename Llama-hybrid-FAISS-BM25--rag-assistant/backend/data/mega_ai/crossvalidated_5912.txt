What are the practical & interpretation differences between alternatives and logistic regression?

A recent question about alternatives to logistic regression in R yielded a variety of answers including randomForest, gbm, rpart, bayesglm, and generalized additive models. What are the practical and interpretation differences between these methods and logistic regression? What assumptions do they make (or not make) relative to logistic regression? Are the suitable for hypothesis testing? Etc.
