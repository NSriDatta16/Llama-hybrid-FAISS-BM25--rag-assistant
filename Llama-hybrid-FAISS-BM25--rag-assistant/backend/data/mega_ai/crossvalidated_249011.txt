Finding the probability and mean for binary logistic regression

I want to derive the logit model so that I can calculate the probability of the sample choose $Y=1$ and $Y=0$. I've read somewhere that after obtaining the regression (e.g. XB=b0+b1x+b2x) we can use the mean of each variable (x's value) to derive XB. But SPSS logistic regression doesn't provide the mean for each of the variable. So my question is Can we use the mean of each variable that we derived from descriptive statistic (i.e. analyze -> descriptive statistic -> descriptive)? If no. 1 is correct, how can I calculate the mean for the categorical variable of more than 2 (e.g. single, married, divorced and widowed), as the mean does not provide mean for each categories?
