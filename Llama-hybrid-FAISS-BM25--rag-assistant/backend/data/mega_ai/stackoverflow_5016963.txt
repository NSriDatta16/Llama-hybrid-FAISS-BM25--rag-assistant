Embed image to vsix

I'm playing around with the custom start page template in vs. How would I go about embedding an image that I can use the in the start page xaml. I have tried the normal way of setting the image to Resource and setting the source property on the Image control to the file name. but it doesn't work...it builds ok and spins up the start page ok, but doesn't show the image. If I stick in a url to the source that works fine. Thx Steve
