The knnclassify() function uses the k-nearest neighbours classification algorithm to perform classification. The crossvalind() function is a separate one to divide a data set in to folds to perform cross-validation. Both are part of the Bioinformatics toolbox. I suggest that you read the documentation associated with them, so that you can be sure you are using them correctly. In general, however, with a single n-fold cross-validation (CV) run, you don't really need to average results from folds. You just collect the results from the individual folds. For example, with 5-fold CV, your dataset is divided into 5 separate folds, used as follows: Train with Folds 1..4, Test on Fold 5 Train with Folds 1..3+5, Test on Fold 4 Train with Folds 1+2+4+5 Test on Fold 3 and so on. So all of the data is used for testing exactly once. You can just combine the test results in a single list, and count how many it got right and wrong to compute the overall accuracy.
