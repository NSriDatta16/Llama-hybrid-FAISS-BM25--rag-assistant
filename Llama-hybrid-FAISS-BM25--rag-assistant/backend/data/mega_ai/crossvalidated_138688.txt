I'm a Stata user so will defer to @Nick Cox. If you had monthly data something like interrupted time series +/- Prais-Winsten / Cochrane-Orcutt regression if you find significant autocorrelation would be useful. Daily data is usually very messy, and that approach might well break down. Aggregating data to month or even week would (1) throw away a huge amount of information and be hard to justify...but (2) likely give you an outcome that is easier to model in terms of distribution (distribution may well still be count data but with less zeros) and I would assume auto-correlation. Standard review can be found here Wagner: Segmented Regression Analysis I don't think this is what you're looking for but will give you more information: is there a secular trend, is is changing etc.
