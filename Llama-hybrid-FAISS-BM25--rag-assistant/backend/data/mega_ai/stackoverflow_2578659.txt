It sounds like each department has their own feudal database, and this implies a lot of unnecessary redundancy and inefficiency. Instead of transferring hundreds of megabytes to everyone across your network, why not keep your data in MySQL and have the departments upload their data to the database, where it can be normalized and accessible by everyone? As your organization grows, having completely different departmental databases that are unaware of each other, and contain potentially redundant or conflicting data, is going to become very painful.
