Not sure if this is what Idera's scripts do, but you could script a (native) SQL backup to a temporary location, then call PKZip or 7zip or some command-line compression software to compress the backup to a permanent storage location. Note that most of these zip utilities have a high CPU cost. See the discussion in the comments of this post: https://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/02/our-backup-strategy-inexpensive-nas/ (Edit: Or just upgrade to SQL2008 R2, which supports native backup compression.)
