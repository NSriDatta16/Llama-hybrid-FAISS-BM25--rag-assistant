You usually want $KL(Q||P)$. That's from $P$ to $Q$. I remember that it goes from right to left, just like the notation for conditional probabilities. You want the expectation being taken with respect to the true distribution $P$. That way, sample averages can be assumed to converge to the true expectations, by the law of large numbers.
