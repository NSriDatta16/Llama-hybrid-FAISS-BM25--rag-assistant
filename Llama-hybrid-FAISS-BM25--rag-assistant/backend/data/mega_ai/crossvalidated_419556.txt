None of the questions is specific to beta regression but is the same for any other model based on a linear predictor, i.e., linear regression, ANOVA, logistic regression etc. Thus, I encourage you to read more about factors and the corresponding contrasts in (generalized) linear models. Your factor has three levels, thus two coefficients can be freely estimated, the third one needs to be restricted. For an unordered factor the default in R is to use treatment contrasts , i.e., restrict the first coefficient to be zero and then estimate the other two in relation to that. However, for an ordered factor the default is to use a polynomial contrast. This fits a quadratic polynomial through the three points/levels and reports the linear (.L) and quadratic (.Q) coefficient. Here, you see that the linear term is significant while the quadratic is relatively small and not significant. Thus, approximately the effect for two fires is twice that of one fire (albeit a somewhat smaller, as indicated by the negative coefficient in the .Q term). I guess this has a natural interpretation that is easy to summarize. By itself "significance of the third treatment" is not yet precise enough. What contrast do you want to test? Significantly higher effect for two fires compared to one fire? If so, successive difference contrasts ( MASS::contr.sdif ) would be better suited than the default polynomial contrasts. Clearly, nitrogen_content is significant and the effect of the treatment appears to be captured well by a linear effect . Note also that no matter which conding of the contrasts you choose, the fitted values and hence the maximized log-likelihood remain unchanged. Thus, the argument for or against a certain coding is not goodness of fit but just ease of interpretation (and of coding the contrasts you acually want to test).
