How to run scripts for embedded objects in AJAX deep linked sites

I have an AJAX deep linked site. The basic structure is something like this: ... ... ... ... So the idea here is that AJAX according to the fragment value of the URL ( #query ) will appropriately populate the content of the . Here is the issue. Consider this. User initially loads this page - ( #home ) and the following loads: ... ... ... ... After this, the user goes to the page #query . In order to load this page, AJAX will change the innerHTML of the tag. Let's say that the content of the #query has an embedded object (in this example, an embedded video using FlowPlayer). After AJAX will be done, code will look something like this. ... ... flowplayer("player", "flowplayer.swf", { clip: "video.mp4" }); ... So here is the question, when I try to do this, the following script never runs and therefore the video never loads: flowplayer("player", "flowplayer.swf", { clip: "video.mp4" }); How can I fix this issue or what am I doing wrong? Any help is appreciated. EDIT Progress report I used to swap HTML content of ajax div tag by doing this: document.getElementById("ajax").innerHTML = xmlhttprequest.responseText; Now I have changed it to this: var element = document.createElement("div"); element.setAttribute("id", "ajax"); element.innerHTML = xmlhttprequest.responseText; toswap = document.getElementById("ajax"); toswap.parentNode.replaceChild(element, toswap); This solved the issue in Firefox, so the get triggered, however it still does not work in Chrome and IE. Any ideas?
