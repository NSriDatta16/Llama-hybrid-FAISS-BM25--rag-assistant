Autoenoders are extremely flexible methods. They are prone to overfitting, and needs to have careful selection of hyperparameters to not just fit all the data - including the outliers. I think they are not a good choice in your case. Instead of reconstructing the inputs, like autoencoders do, you may want to use supervised models for this problem: Use how much money they spend as a target, and build simple (preferably linear) regression models based on the features. Make predictions with this model, and compute differences to the real value. High error signals that these are outliers wrt the model.
