Load Testing a Database attached to a Network storage device

We are looking at stress testing a NAS system for a Database, basically was want to see how much abuse it can take and how much it affects the Database performance. here is what we have planed I have a test Tool I'm building that will kickoff a configurable number of threads that run a sql query (also configurable, and thinking about having it able to run multiple quires) using the SQLIOSim utility to simulate SQL Server activity Copying very large amounts of Data onto and off of the device (at the same time) Can anyone think of anything else we could do (that's repeatable) for placing a load on the system.
