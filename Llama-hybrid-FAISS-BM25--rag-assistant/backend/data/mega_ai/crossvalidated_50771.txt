Analysing a grouped 0 to 10 scale using ordinal logistic regression

I read in an article that the logit link is considered suitable for analyzing ordered categorical data evenly distributed among all categories. I want to do ordinal logistic regression and I have an ordinal variable on the scale of 0-10 and have to make three groups, 0-6, 7-8 and 9-10. Does this mean that the data is not evenly distributed and I shouldn't use ordinal regression or do they mean that there has to be approximately the same number of observations in each category?
