the most simple way is to create the image in the client ... get a BitmapData snapshot of the image using BitmapData::draw ... convert this to JPEG or PNG using the as3corelib , that offers encoders for both formats ... and then just send the raw binary data to the server (store it into the data property of your URLRequest ) and there, store it to the file system (retrieve it in $HTTP_RAW_POST_DATA ) ... so the whole storage process is just a couple of lines ... you will need a database of course, for session management (you could rely on PHPSESSION only, but personally i don't trust it), login, registration and to store which image belongs to which user ... so yeah, the whole netcode/backend/storage thing etc. will be quite a piece of cake (btw. you might wanna look into amfphp ) ... designing a good interface and implementing the galery view etc. will be the biggest chunk i guess ... there are no real security gotchas, as long as your SWF comes from the same server, that it communicates to ... so good luck then ... ;) greetz back2dos
