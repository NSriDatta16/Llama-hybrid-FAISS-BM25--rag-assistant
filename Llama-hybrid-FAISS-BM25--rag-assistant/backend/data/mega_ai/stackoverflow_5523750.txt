Matlab - low neural network goal affects result

I've created an OCR with matlab's Neural Networks. I've used traingdx net.trainParam.epochs = 8000; net.trainParam.min_grad = 0.0000; net.trainParam.goal = 10e-6; I've noticed that when I use different goals I get different results (as expected of course). The weird thing is that I found that I have to "play" with the goal value to get good results. I expected that the lower you go, the better the results and recognition. But I found that if I lower the goal to like 10e-10 i actually get worse recognition results. Any idea why lowering the goal would decrease the correctness of the Neural Network ? I think it might have something to do with it trying too hard to it right, so it doesn't work as well with noise and change.
