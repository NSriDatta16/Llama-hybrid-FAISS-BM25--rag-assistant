Why is my replication of Silver & Dunlap 1987 not working out?

I'm trying to replicate Silver & Dunlap (1987) . I'm just comparing averaging correlations or averaging z transform correlations and back transforming. I seem to not be replicating the asymmetry in the bias they find (back transformed zs are not closer to the population value for me than rs). Any thoughts? Is it possible that 1987 computing power just didn't explore the space enough? # Fisher's r2z fr2z With these function it's easy to look at a bunch of correlations (basically replicate silver and dunlap 1987) and see the difference between averaging correlations and averaging z-scores and back transforming. Here's just one. r Just looking at the sample size of 10 and correlations of 0.1, 0.5, and 0.9 these are the results. rho r bias z bias 0.1 -0.006 0.006 0.5 -0.024 0.021 0.9 -0.011 0.011 And these are derived from Table 1 of Silver & Dunlap. rho r bias z bias 0.1 -0.007 0.003 0.5 -0.025 0.001 0.9 -0.011 -0.007 These are quite different results. From my test I'm seeing that it's just a matter of direction of bias, not magnitude. But, in the published paper they're finding much less magnitude with z. I couldn't find a published non-replication.
