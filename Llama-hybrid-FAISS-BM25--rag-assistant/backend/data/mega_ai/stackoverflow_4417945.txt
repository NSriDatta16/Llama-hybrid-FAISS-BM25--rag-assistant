Eureka! After many days of studying this problem I finally found a very effective solution. The key is to take your Tomcat XML context fragment file and use the element of cargo to drop it in the conf/Catalina/localhost directory with the name context.xml.default . The only downside is that this will make your context definitions available to all web-apps, but this shouldn't really matter only Cargo is using this Tomcat instance thus there is no other web-app. Here's the configuration: standalone ${tomcat6.port} com.myapp myapp-war war ${tomcat6.context} ${basedir}/../config/tomcat-context.xml conf/Catalina/localhost/ context.xml.default The net result is no more bogus WAR modules for testing only, and no more merging of WARs. Hope this helps somebody.
