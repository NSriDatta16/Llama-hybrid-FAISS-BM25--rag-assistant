Face morph and recognition

I have two requirements: members of a social network choose other member's faces and morph an average face of them. The website finds other members' faces that resemble the morphed face and list up in order of resemblance. Is there a script that can do this? I see that http://www.faceresearch.org/demos/average does the item 1 but they don't license their technology. Please help. Thank you in advance.
