Describing Results from Logistic Regression with Restricted Cubic Splines Using rms in R

Updated I have been developing a logistic regression model based on retrospective data from a national trauma database of head injury in the UK. The key outcome is 30 day mortality (denoted as "Survive" measure). Other measures with published evidence of significant effect on outcome in previous studies include: Yeardecimal - Date of procedure (expressed as decimal of year) = 1994-2013 Age - Age of patient = 16.0-101.5 ISS - Injury Severity Score = 16-75 Sex - Gender of patient = Male or Female inctoCran - Time from head injury to craniotomy in minutes = 0-2880 (After 2880 minutes is defined as a separate diagnosis) Mechanism - Mechanism of injury = Fall 2m, Shooting/stabbing, RTC (Road Traffic Collision), Other neuroFirst - Location of first admission (Neurosurgical Unit) = NSU vs. Non-NSU rcteye - Pupil reactivity = NA / Both unreactive = O, 1 reactive = 1, both reactive = 2 rcteyeYN - dummy = 0 or 1 for presence or absence of data GCS - Glasgow Coma Scale = 3-15 GCSYN - dummy = 0 or 1 for presence or absence of data Dummy variables were included to enable a larger sample size where the majority of cases were excluding GCS and rcteye variables (missing not at random). In order to test for interactions, initially I ran the following: rcs.ASDH but when I did I got the following error: singular information matrix in lrm.fit (rank= 151 ). Offending variable(s): GCSYN * Yeardecimal''' GCSYN * Yeardecimal' GCSYN * Yeardecimal GCS * Yeardecimal''' GCS * Yeardecimal GCS * GCSYN rcteyeYN * Yeardecimal''' rcteyeYN * Yeardecimal'' rcteyeYN * Yeardecimal rcteyeYN * GCSYN rcteye * Yeardecimal''' rcteye * Yeardecimal rcteye * rcteyeYN Mechanism=RTC * Yeardecimal''' Mechanism=Other * Yeardecimal''' Mechanism=Fall > 2m * Yeardecimal''' Mechanism=Shooting / Stabbing * Yeardecimal Mechanism=RTC * Yeardecimal Mechanism=Other * Yeardecimal Mechanism=Fall > 2m * Yeardecimal neuroFirst * Yeardecimal ISS'' * Yeardecimal''' ISS * Yeardecimal''' ISS'' * Yeardecimal'' ISS'' * Yeardecimal ISS' * Yeardecimal ISS * Yeardecimal ISS'' * GCSYN ISS'' * rcteyeYN ISS'' * Mechanism=RTC Age'' * Yeardecimal''' Age'' * Yeardecimal'' Age''' * Yeardecimal' Age''' * Yeardecimal Age'' * Yeardecimal Age' * Yeardecimal Age * Yeardecimal Age'' * GCSYN Age''' * rcteyeYN Error in lrm(formula = Survive ~ (rcs(Age) + rcs(ISS) + neuroFirst + Mechanism + : Unable to fit model using “lrm.fit” The only way I could run the model is with an adjustment. Yeardecimal is excluded from any interaction as is the interaction of GCS:GCSYN and rcteye:rcteyeYN which produced the same error as written above. It made sense to exclude the interactions between a variable and its missing dummy but I am not sure what to do about Yeardecimal : rcs.ASDH From this model the following interactions were identified with an anova output: > anova(rcs.ASDH) Wald Statistics Response: Survive Factor Chi-Square d.f. P Age (Factor+Higher Order Factors) 130.42 52 The summary function revealed the following results: Effects Response : Survive Factor Low High Diff. Effect S.E.

I read that exclusion only of a "chunk" is advised - Including the interaction but not the main effects in a model 4 - Is the odds ratio for each variable the "Effect" column? If so, is this the OR between the lowest and highest value of each variable?
