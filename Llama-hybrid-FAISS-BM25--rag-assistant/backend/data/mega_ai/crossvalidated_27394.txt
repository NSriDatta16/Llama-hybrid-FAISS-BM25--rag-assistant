How actually my time series models tells me about data behaviour?

I have different models namely AR, ARMA, ARIMA for different time series (in data set of 4449) stationary-3096, Non stationary-1353 , why this classification appears to be? If I have $AR(p=1-5)$ and $AR(p >5)$ what does my data tell ?, I have many time series which follows ARMA-1239 best models, some are AR-90 best model & ARIMA-7 best models out of 3096 stationary data set Please, kindly tell me in philosophical/non-statistical way (because I didn't understand by term like normal/marginal distribution).
