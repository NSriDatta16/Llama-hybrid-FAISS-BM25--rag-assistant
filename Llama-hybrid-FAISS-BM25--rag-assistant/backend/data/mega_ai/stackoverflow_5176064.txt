jQuery - problem using .css() with ajax data

This should be really simple but for some reason I'm stumped on this... I'm trying to set the position of an element on page load from ajax data like so: $.ajax({ url: "session_data.php", type: 'POST', async: false, success: function (data) { $('#dragable_box').css( data ); console.log("Stored Session Data: " + data); } }); the data variable returns a correct result as I can see it in the console and I tried copying in the result as a test and it positioned the element as expected. It just wont work with data ... I tried with and without async: false What am I doing wrong or not doing?
