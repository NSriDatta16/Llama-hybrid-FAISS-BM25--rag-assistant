Zero waste would be log_2(26) bits per letter. As pointed out earlier, you can get to 4.7 by reading 47 bits and converting them to 10 letters. However, you can get to 4.67 by converting every 14 bits into 3 characters. This has the advantage that it fits into an integer. If you have storage space and run time is important, you can create a lookup table with 17,576 entries mapping the possible 14 bits into 3 letters. Otherwise, you can do mod and div operations to compute the 3 letters. number of letters number of bits bits/letter 1 4 4 2 9 4.5 3 14 4.67 4 18 4.5 5 23 4.6 6 28 4.67 7 32 4.57 8 37 4.63 9 42 4.67 10 47 4.7
