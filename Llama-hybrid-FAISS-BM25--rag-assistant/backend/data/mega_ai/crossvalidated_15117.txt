Training c linear discriminant functions is a example of a "1-vs-all" or "1-against-the-rest" approach to building a multiclass classifier given a binary classifier learning algorithm. Training C(c,2) 2-class classifiers is an example of the "1-vs-1" approach. As c gets larger, the "1-vs-1" approach builds a lot more classifiers (but each from a smaller training set). This paper compares these two approaches, among others, using SVMs as the binary classifier learner: C.-W. Hsu and C.-J. Lin. A comparison of methods for multi-class support vector machines , IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks, 13(2002), 415-425 . Hsu and Lin found 1-vs-1 worked best with SVMs, but this would not necessarily hold with all binary classifier learners, or all data sets. Personally, I prefer polytomous logistic regression.
