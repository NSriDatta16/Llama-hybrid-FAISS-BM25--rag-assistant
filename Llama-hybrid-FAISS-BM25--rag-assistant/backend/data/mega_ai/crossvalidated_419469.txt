what is the name of this computation?$e_{10}{(0.1)} = 0.8$

section 1.4.3 of the book "Machine Learning - A Probabilistic Perspective" gives an example about KNN: the input is two dimensional, we have three classes, and K = 10 which contains a computation $e_{10}{(0.1)} = 0.8$ what does that mean? what is the name of this computation?
