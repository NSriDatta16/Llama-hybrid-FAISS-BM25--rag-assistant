Reverting part of a commit with git

I want to revert a particular commit in git. Unfortunately, our organization still uses CVS as a standard, so when I commit back to CVS multiple git commits are rolled into one. In this case I would love to single out the original git commit, but that is impossible. Is there an approach similar to git add --patch that would allow me to selectively edit diffs to decide which parts of a commit to revert?
