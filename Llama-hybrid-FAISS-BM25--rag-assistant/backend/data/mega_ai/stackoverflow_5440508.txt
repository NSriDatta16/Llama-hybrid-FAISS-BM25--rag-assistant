Did you select the "Schema on the top left (right to the run button) to "Project Name" | iOS Device? If so then open the Organizer window and make sure that the device is listed there and that you have a valid provisioning profile. Can you run your app in the simulator? If so then set the scheme to iOS Device and run again. Then it should install.
