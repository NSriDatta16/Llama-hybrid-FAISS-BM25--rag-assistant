K-means is not a good idea for DTW. It should only be used woth Bregman divergences, and DTW is not one. If you look around in literature, you will also see papers that "disprove" time series clustering as being as bad as random patterns... k-means must also only be used on continuous numerical data. So if it inherently doesn't even work on point data, it will not work on time serries either! Clustering is very hard . Don't expect magic, but a tiresome work with many iterations. Things get much harder once you need to integrate different data types, because there are infinitely many possible combinations. From a statistics point of view, most clustering results are probably not sound but rather "seeing things in clouds".
