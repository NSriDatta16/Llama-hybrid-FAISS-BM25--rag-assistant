pting only improved the performance for models that had at least 62B parameters. Smaller models perform better when prompted to answer immediately, without chain of thought. identifying offensive content in paragraphs of Hinglish (a combination of Hindi and English), and generating a similar English equivalent of Kiswahili proverbs. Schaeffer et. al. argue that the emergent abilities are not unpredictably acquired, but predictably acquired according to a smooth scaling law. The authors considered a toy statistical model of an LLM solving multiple-choice questions, and showed that this statistical model, modified to account for other types of tasks, applies to these tasks as well. Let x {\displaystyle x} be the number of parameter count, and y {\displaystyle y} be the performance of the model. Interpretation Mechanistic interpretability Mechanistic interpretability seeks to precisely identify and understand how individual neurons or circuits within LLMs produce specific behaviors or outputs. By reverse-engineering model components at a granular level, researchers aim to detect and mitigate safety concerns such as emergent harmful behaviors, biases, deception, or unintended goal pursuit before deployment. Mechanistic interpretability research has been conducted at organizations like Anthropic and OpenAI, although understanding the inner workings of LLMs remains difficult. Mechanistic interpretability has progressively replaced the characterization of large language models as inscrutable "black boxes" by identifying neurons and circuits that implement specific computations and by producing causal traces of how representations propagate through transformer layers. Researchers have demonstrated automated neuron-explanation pipelines and released neuron-level datasets, and they have developed circuit-tracing and replacement-model methods that produce attribution graphs and component-level descriptions applicable to modern transformer models. Substantive limits remain, including polysemanticity, superposition, non-identifiability of competing explanations, and the risk of anthropomorphic inference, so current mechanistic results increase controllability and surface actionable interventions. These results do not by themselves justify treating LLMs as models of the human brain or human mind without additional empirical validation and cross-disciplinary evidence. Thinking Machines Lab published reproducible interpretability work addressing these gaps through techniques for defeating nondeterminism in LLM inference. The reverse-engineering may lead to the discovery of algorithms that approximate inferences performed by an LLM. For instance, the authors trained small transformers on modular arithmetic addition. The resulting models were reverse-engineered, and it turned out they used discrete Fourier transform. The training of the model also highlighted a phenomenon called grokking, in which the model initially memorizes all the possible results in the training set (overfitting), and later suddenly learns to actually perform the calculation. Some techniques have been developed to enhance the transparency and interpretability of LLMs. Transcoders, which are more interpretable than transformers, have been utilized to develop "replacement models". In one such study involving the mechanistic interpretation of writing a rhyming poem by an LLM, it was shown that although they are believed to simply predict the next token, they can, in fact, plan ahead. By integrating such techniques, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into the operations of LLMs, fostering trust and facilitating the responsible deployment of these powerful models. Understanding and intelligence NLP researchers were evenly split when asked, in a 2022 survey, whether (untuned) LLMs "could (ever) understand natural language in some nontrivial sense". Proponents of "LLM understanding" believe that some LLM abilities, such as mathematical reasoning, imply an abil
