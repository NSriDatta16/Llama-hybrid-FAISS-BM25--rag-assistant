Model for percent resource allocation between groups

I have a panel data set indicating each entities percent resource allocation among a number of different options. I have been using a logistic regression model to predict the share of allocation for each option for each entity over time. This, however, allows for the possibility of the sum of one entities allocations being greater or less than 100%. Does a softmax model (from a dnn perspective only a single layer) fitted on these percent allocations solve my problem or is there a better methodology to use?
