ARIMA - SARIMAX modelling with R

I am really new to R and to time series. My field of studies is in the field of Networks and Telecommunication, but my summer internship is about trying to find a statistical model for some sets of data. The data consists of what is called "10-minutes-points", recorded over a year and which represent power consuption of a source substation. It means I have 6 * 24 * 365 = 52 560 points of data to process, one set for each source substation. It's been about a week I'm trying to found information about ARIMA models. This website and the report of my predecessor quite helped me getting in the subject, by I still encountered many problems. I found one might be due to the large size of the data set as explained here , the second one to the existence of exogenous data as mentioned there . My predecessor found the ARIMA model to be effective for short term predictions (up to 20-ish hours), and the SARIMAX for mid-term predictions (around a dozen days). I guess it is cause exogeneous data doesn't affect as much the core data on such short periods of time. I found this thread to be very interesting but I'm not sure I understand everything. In a first time I would like to know if my understanding of the general method to evaluate a model is correct : first you plot your data and try to look for any trend/seasonality (the data I have showed to have a daily seasonality and a yearly one) you use log in order to reduce the trend, and maybe differentiate to eliminate the seasonality (so I should use something like : diff(data.ts, 144) in my case to get rid of the daily seasonality (6*24 points a day) ?) plot the acf/pcf of the differentiated time series and try to estimate a model from there try to fit the model to my data with fit but I don't where the seasonality (144) would appear in this function ? study the residuals of fit to see if the model is correct (looking at the acf/pacf) use fitted or forecast (I don't know which one is better) to predict future values Thing is, since the data set is huge, I always get significant spikes at many lags in the acf/pacf and I don't feel I can judge if a model is correct or not. Here is an example : data = scan("auch.txt", skip=1) plot.ts(data) data.ts = ts(log(data) data.diff = diff(data.ts, 144) plot.ts(data.diff) Which seems somehow stationary to me. I then proceed to look at the acf/pacf, and had to differentiate once more because it wasn't stationary in fact : tsdisplay(data.diff, lag.max=150) tsdisplay(diff(data.diff), lag.max=150) And I really don't know how to handle these results, so I hoped I could find some help here, because I came across the website a lot during my researchs. Thanks in advance, and I apologies for any grammatical mistakes or vocabulary error ; English is not my native language. Edit : does anyone know why my pictures won't appear ? Edit bis : nvm in fact it might be me, because imgur is blocked on my work computer
