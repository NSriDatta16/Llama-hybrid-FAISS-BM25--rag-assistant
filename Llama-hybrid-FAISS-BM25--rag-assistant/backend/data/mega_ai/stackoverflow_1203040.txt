C#-WebRequest in a Windows Service

I'm currently developing a Windows Service to download some emails in the background. For easy testing, the core of this service can be run in a standalone application, too. There's no problem while downloading the mails (service and standalone) but I'm not able to get a WebRequest when running the service (everything's find in the standalone app). I know, Windows Services are limited by the local system account - but is there a way to work with (Http-)WebRequest without changing the service-user manually. Thanks in advance, Bert
