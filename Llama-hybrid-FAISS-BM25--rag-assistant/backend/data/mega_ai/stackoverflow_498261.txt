you could use an iframe to set the cookie, ie. have an iframe on your web server that makes a request to a page on your exchange http server ( https://my.school.edu/exchweb/ ) with your wanted cookie vars set as get or post variables. then use the vars to set the cookie for that domain, and redirect the user to the exchange server. now, there could be logic on the backend of OWA that checks ip address, user agent, etc.... when registering the session that may invalidate this..... not sure
