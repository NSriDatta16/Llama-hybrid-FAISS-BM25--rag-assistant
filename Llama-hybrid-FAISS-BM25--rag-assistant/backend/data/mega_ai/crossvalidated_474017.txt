The boruta feature selection process is exactly designed to only retain features which are more important than randomized features, so your suggestion is on the right track. Boruta works by creating a randomized version of every feature in your data set and then training a classifier, such as a random forest model. The features which consistently have a higher feature importance than the highest randomized feature are retained. This process is repeated to recursively eliminate the features which are consistently less informative than a randomized feature. By "consistently," I mean that a statistical test concludes to either include or exclude the feature. The procedure terminates when all features have been classified as either informative or uninformative. Kursa, Miron B., and Witold R. Rudnicki. "Feature selection with the Boruta package." (2010).
