Backpropagating a Dueling Architecture Network: Gradient Calculation

I started coding a Dueling Network Architectures for Deep Reinforcement Learning . I devided my network into two streams, arriving at a V(s) value and A(s,a) values. I arrived at the Q(s,a) output values by calculating: Q(s,a) = V(s) + ( A(s,a) - Mean of All A(s,a) ) Now my problem is with backpropagation. After calculating the loss, how do I calculate the gradients of V(s) and A(s,a) without there being any weights?
