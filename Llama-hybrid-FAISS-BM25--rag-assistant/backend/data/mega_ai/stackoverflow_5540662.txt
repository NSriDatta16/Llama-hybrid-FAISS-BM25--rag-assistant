You can target drawables, not just layouts. You want drawable-hdpi-large-long-land for the first situation (assuming you're letting the system handle rotation events and recreate your activity), and drawable-mdpi-xlarge for the second. Of course it's futile to try to ship with a separate image for every conceivable phone resolution; partially because there's a lot you'd need, and partially because some targets aren't differentiable (the 854x480 and 800x480 phones out there are all hdpi-large-long, for example, despite the 54px difference). Try to use a scaleable image, a stretchable 9patch, or an image you can just fix at the top-right corner (you can define stretch behaviors using an XML-defined bitmapdrawable).
