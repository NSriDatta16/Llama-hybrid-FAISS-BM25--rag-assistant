Under most circumstances I would calculate the scale score as the mean of the items. This is generally a more desirable coding because you don't lose information. You could then just use a t-test to assess the effect of condition. Even if you binary code each item, and calculate the mean or sum of items, you are still left with a variable with 7 different values (i.e., 0,1,2,3,4,5,6 if you used the sum). If you were willing to accept an approximation, you could consider still using a t-test in this case. However, you couldn't use standard binary logistic regression. Perhaps, generalised estimating equations (GEE) might be suitable for predicting repeated measures of proportions. R packages include gee and geepack . Here are some GEE resources that I prepared. UPDATE After reading the paper mentioned "Using Presence Questionnaires in Reality" , I still think that the scale should be the sum or mean of the six items coded 1 to 7, and that a t-test is the most straightforward tool for group comparison of means.
