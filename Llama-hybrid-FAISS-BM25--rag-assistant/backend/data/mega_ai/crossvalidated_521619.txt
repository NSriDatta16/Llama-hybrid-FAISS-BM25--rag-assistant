You have ordinal categories and missing data. I recommend estimating inter-rater reliability using a generalized agreement coefficient that can accommodate these properties. For instance, you could set up your data in an $n$ -by- $r$ matrix where $n$ is the number of x-rays and $r$ is the number of unique raters. Each cell in this matrix $(i,j)$ would contain $\{1$ , $2$ , or $3\}$ to indicate th rating made on x-ray $i$ by rater $j$ . If x-ray $i$ was not rated by rater $r$ , treat that cell as missing (e.g., NA). Then use a generalized agreement coefficient (as described in the citations below).
