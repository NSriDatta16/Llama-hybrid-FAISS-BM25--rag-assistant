Absolutely. JMX is part of the standard JavaSE6 API. Every Java5+ VM has an embedded JMX server. JavaEE appservers typically make heavy use of JMX, but it's by no means limited to them. The comparison with JMS only goes so far - yes, there is a separation between interface and implementation, and yes, different implementations have proprietary network protocols to access them remotely, but JMX is an awful lot simpler than JMS.
