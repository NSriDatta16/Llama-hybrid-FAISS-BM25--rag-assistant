Drag Drop Portlets in Drupal

I want to create a portal interface in Drupal, with drag drop portlets. I should also be able to create my own portlets. I came across the following link http://aymanh.com/drag-drop-portal-interface-with-scriptaculous , but that is only compatible with Drupal 4. Any other way to implement the required functionality ?
