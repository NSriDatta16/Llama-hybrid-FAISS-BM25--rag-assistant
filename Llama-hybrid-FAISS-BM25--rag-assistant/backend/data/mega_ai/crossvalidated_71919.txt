Whether to categorically code likert predictors in binary logistic regression in SPSS and whether to use the Enter method?

I am working on a project trying to predict the antecedents of adoption for a new technology. I am using IBM SPSS software but I am not confident with statistics analysis. I have 10 independent variables (each of them is formed of 3 likert scale items. I just summed the three items to compute each latent variable) and one dependent variable (a dummy variable with 0 not adopting and 1 adopting). I plan to perform a binary logistic regression. My questions regard the SPSS software functions and they are: When I put my independent variables in the covariates box should I also select the option Categorical Covariates because they are not continuous variables? In the option Method should I leave the option Enter selected or is preferable one other method?
