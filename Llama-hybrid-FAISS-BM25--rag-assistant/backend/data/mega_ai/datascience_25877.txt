Multivariate non-negative, discrete time series forecasting with neural networks

I have a data set obtained from the event log of a bunch of access points in a building. At the moment I am interested in forecasting, for each access point, the number of connected devices at each access point on a given point in time. The features in this data set are timestamp , containing the datetime and AP1 , ... , AP9 , containing the (relative) number of connected devices for each access point. An example: > synced_logs[500:515,] timestamp 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 500 2017-09-25 12:55:00 1 0 1 -1 -1 0 1 -1 0 501 2017-09-25 12:56:00 1 0 1 -1 -1 0 1 -1 0 502 2017-09-25 12:57:00 1 0 1 -1 -1 0 1 -1 0 503 2017-09-25 12:58:00 1 0 -1 -1 1 0 1 -1 0 504 2017-09-25 12:59:00 1 0 -1 1 1 0 -1 -1 0 505 2017-09-25 13:00:00 1 0 1 1 1 0 -1 -1 0 506 2017-09-25 13:01:00 1 0 0 1 -1 1 -1 -1 0 507 2017-09-25 13:02:00 1 0 0 1 -1 0 -1 -1 0 508 2017-09-25 13:03:00 1 0 -2 1 -1 -1 3 3 0 509 2017-09-25 13:04:00 1 0 1 0 -1 -1 1 -2 0 510 2017-09-25 13:05:00 1 0 0 0 -1 1 -1 2 0 511 2017-09-25 13:06:00 1 0 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -2 1 512 2017-09-25 13:07:00 1 0 -2 -2 -1 3 1 -2 1 513 2017-09-25 13:08:00 1 0 -2 -2 -1 1 -1 -2 -1 514 2017-09-25 13:09:00 1 0 1 -2 -1 1 0 -2 -1 515 2017-09-25 13:10:00 1 0 1 -2 -1 1 -2 -2 -1 (the exact number of already connected devices at the first measurement is not known, so the counts are all relative). The data set spans a period of a week and contains 9803 observations (at the minute level). The data set was transformed from a asynchronous event log to a synchronous time series format. I plan on adding lagged variables to this data set if needed (based on partial auto- and cross-correlation statistics). I want to try to model the counts using neural networks, but have a few questions: Do neural networks play nice with non-negative, discrete data? Are certain network topologies preferred over others in a case like this? E.g. LSTMs? Is it better to model a multivariate outcome (i.e. a vector a counts) or is it better to fit a model for each access point?
