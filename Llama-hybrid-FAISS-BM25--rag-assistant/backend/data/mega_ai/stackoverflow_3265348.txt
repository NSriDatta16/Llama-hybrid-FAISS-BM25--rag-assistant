Storage of passwords in Google Chrome Extension

I started reading Google Chrome's documentation, and liked it's approach of using HTML and Javascript to create extensions. Reading this tutorial about Local Storage made me think about a lot of different uses. I want to develop an extension to help me with corporate systems. It's very specific, and it's only going to be used inside a company. This extension would do some activities to this corporate system, using javascript DOM, with just one click on Google's Chrome toolbar. To work with just one click, the extension needs to store a password in Chrome: so if you restart your system, you don't need to enter it again. How do I do that? Persist a password in a Google Chrome extension to login to another system? I don't want to store it in "plain text", I would like to at least use some kind of encryption (maybe a Google Chrome API with this resource). Is it possible? How do I persist this data with Google Chrome's extensions structure (best way)?
