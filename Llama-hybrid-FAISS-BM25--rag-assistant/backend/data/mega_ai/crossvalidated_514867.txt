Is random policy a stochastic policy?

I'm a student to start to study RL. When I studied MDP and watched the gridworld example, I had one question. In the gridworld, we usually assume that we can have four actions in any states, e.g. up, down, left, right. In this case, if we have a random policy, which means the probability is 0.25 for each action in any states, then does the policy correspond to a stochastic policy? As I searched it, because the deterministic policy maps only one action for each state with 1.0 probability, I think that the random policy corresponds to the stochastic policy, but I'm not sure.
