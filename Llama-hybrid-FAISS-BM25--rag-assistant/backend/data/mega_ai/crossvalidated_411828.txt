BIC, sometimes called the Schwarz information criterion (SIC) was introduced by Gideon Schwartz in 1975. Here is that paper . It's not very long. Both AIC and BIC address the model evaluation problem where more parameters lead to increased likelihood. To resolve this they penalize additional parameters. Schwartz gave a bayesian argument. His central thesis was, "In a model of given dimension, maximum likelihood estimators can be obtained as large-sample limits of the Bayes estimators for arbitrary nowhere vanishing a priori distributions." So even though the formula for BIC has nothing Bayesian about it, the original paper is chock full of Bayesian explanations for the procedure since it was derived from a special "large-sample" case of Bayes Theorem.
