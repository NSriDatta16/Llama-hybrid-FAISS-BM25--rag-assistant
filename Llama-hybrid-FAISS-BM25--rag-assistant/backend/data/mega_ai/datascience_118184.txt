Unlike word embedding, where you can get "for free" the embeddings of words, in your use case you'll need to derive the embeddings yourself. I would try an approach based on autoencoders. An autoencoder is a neural network architecture based on an encoder and a decoder. The idea is that the encoder takes the input data (in your case a curve) and encodes it to a small vector (in your case a vector with dimensionality Here you have an example with images.
