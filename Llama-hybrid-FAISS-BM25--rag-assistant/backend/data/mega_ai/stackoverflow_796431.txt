Every URL is akin an "address" to a location of data on the internet. The "host" part of the URL (in your example, "www.example.com") is a web-server, or a set of web-servers somewhere in the world. If we think of a URL as an "address", then the host could be a "country". The country itself might keep track of every piece of mail that enters it. Some do, some don't. I'm talking about web-servers! Of course real countries don't make note of every piece of mail you get! :-) But even if that "country" keeps track of every piece of mail - I really doubt they have any mechanism in place to send that list to you. As for organizations that might do that harvesting themselves, I think the best bet would be Google, but even there the situation is rather grim. You see, because Google isn't the owner every web-server ("country") in the world, they cannot know of every URL that accesses that web-server. But they can do the reverse. Since they can index every page they encounter, they can get a pretty good idea of every URL that appears in public HTML pages on the web. Of course, this won't include URLs people send to each other in chats, SMSs, or e-mails. But still, they can get a pretty good idea of what URLs exist. I guess what I'm trying to say is that what you're looking for doesn't exist, really. The only way you can get all the URLs used to access a single website, is to be owner of that website . Sorry, mate.
