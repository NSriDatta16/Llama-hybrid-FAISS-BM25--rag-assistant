Class design â€” circular references between related classes

I need help trying to figure out the proper design of my classes. I have a user class: class AppUser: _email - String _fullname - String _organizations - List of ???? _active - Boolean ------------------ getOrgs - Method Also, I have an Organizations class: class Organization: _name - String _domain - String _members - List of ???? ------------------ getMembers So, my issue is the Lists. The Org class has a list of _members. This list should probably be a list of AppUser objects. And, the AppUser class has a list of _organizations. This list should probably be a list of Organization objects. But this would create a circular reference. So, how should I implement this? Edit: Need to implement this using Python.
