How to label observations based on latent class analysis

I perform a latent class analysis to a dataset of binary variables with library("BayesLCA") data("Alzheimer") alz Now I want to label my observations of Alzheimer given the likelihood of each belonging to one particular group. I extract the estimate of class membership for each unique datapoint class_memb and label each unique datapoint according to the highest probability labels_df I collapse each row of my original dataset Alzheimer into a string of 1 and 0 row_sequence and finally I replace the sequence of each observation with my max probability grouping And yet the classprob and my labelling don't match. And then when I test it on a larger dataset the gap between class probabilities and proportion of labels is even wider. Am I doing something wrong? sj3.em$classprob # [1] 0.50162847 0.47880396 0.01956757 prop.table(table(grouping)) # grouping # Group 1 Group 2 Group 3 # 0.54166667 0.43750000 0.02083333 NOTE: Question crossposted here . Didn't receive much attention there and probably CrossValidated is more appropriate.
