Welcome to the site! So far what you have done is good. Before going to modelling you need to take care of couple of things(Exploratory Analysis), Like: Removing all the unnecessary variables based on business knowledge Imputing Missing values Removing Outliers removing unimportant variables Correlation analysis between variables once these are achieved then look into Modelling(you have done most of the above steps). Now coming to your problem: When you are trying to apply Logistic Regression on data to predict then you need to take care of couple of things: Remove all the factors with single level Then you need to make sure that data which is partitioned(Spliting between Test and Train) have Same Levels before you predict. For now you din't see the issue but once you predict then you will get this error. Important thing to remember is, Logistic regression works by converting Categorical variable to dummies before applying model, because of this it is unable to return you anything.Since you have more Categorical variables in your data I would suggest you not use Logistic Regression. To get Predictor Importance(Important Independent Variables), you can use a Package in R called Boruta , this link has the implementation in R. Once you get important variables then you can apply Random Forest, Decision Trees(Rpart) and see how they perform. Let me know if you have any issues.
