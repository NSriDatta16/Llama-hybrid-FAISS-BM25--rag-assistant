Yes, you're correct. However... NSUInteger newPath[] = {[indexPath section],0}; NSIndexPath *row0IndexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathWithIndexes:newPath length:2]; I would strongly discourage you from using this format to create an NSIndexPath that's intended for use in a UITableView . There's a convenience method to do this much more simply: NSIndexPath *row0IndexPath = [NSIndexPath indexPathForRow:0 inSection:[indexPath section]];
