Hypothesis testing with quotient of regression coefficients

Suppose we have the following multiple logistic regression model $\beta_0 + \beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2$, where $X_1$ and $X_2$ are binary variables, and $\theta = \beta_1 / \beta_2$. Then I have two questions: Since $\theta = \beta_1 / \beta_2$, is it true that $$\frac{\hat \theta - \theta_0}{\hat{\mathrm{se}}(\hat \theta)} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1) \enspace ?$$ I mean, can I use the Wald statistic to test whether $\theta = \theta_0$? On the other hand, if we wanted to use a t -test for the same purpose, how many degrees of freedom should we use? I mean, as we are really using 2 coefficients, would it be a t -test with $n - 1$ or $n - 2$ degrees of freedom?
