Your question has nothing to do with NLP or text-mining (as you claim in the attached tags), or data science in general. It's a pure programming question best suitable for StackOverflow . Moreover, you don't really need any libraries to do, what you want to do. A simple function will do. NOTE: I am using map and reduce functions on purpose to include at least a little bit of data science-related stuff (WINK): coord = (1.23, 4.56) def get_coord(coord): coord_str = map(lambda x: str(x).replace('.', ''), coord) for level in range(1, len(coord_str[0])+1): yield reduce(lambda x, y: (x[:level]+'_'+y[:level]), coord_str) print list(get_coord(coord)) Running this code will result in printing: ['1_4', '12_45', '123_456'] You're not discussing any corner cases in your question, so I assume there are none.
