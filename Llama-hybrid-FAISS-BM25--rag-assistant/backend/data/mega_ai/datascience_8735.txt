Firstly, please read up on what exactly is a PCA algorithm and when can it be used and what purpose does it solve. Just throwing it on a problem and expect it to improve your results would work most of the time. PCA reduces the features in the dataset into dimensions, and it is for the user to select the number of dimensions he/she want to use in the model as features. So, choosing the right number of features to use or eliminate from the model would dictate your accuracy.
