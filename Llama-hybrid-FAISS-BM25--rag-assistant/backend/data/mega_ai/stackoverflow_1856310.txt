How to dynamically load & unload a TinyMCE Plugin

Does anyone know if there is a way I can dynamically load and unload a TinyMCE plugin after TinyMCE has already been loaded? Specifically, I'm thinking about asking the user whether or not they wish to load the fullpage plugin using perhaps a radio button or something above TinyMCE: Enable Fullpage Plugin Disable Fullpage Plugin ... I suppose I could destroy the original instance and load a new config (one for enabled / one for disabled), but it seems as though there should be a more elegant way of loading and unloading plugins.
