Seeing the value of a synthesized property in the Xcode debugger when there is no backing variable

I just recently began using synthesized instance variables in my iPhone projects. The problem is, I can't see the synthesized ivars in the debugger. Is there any way to view the properties of an object in the debugger when it's not using the explicitly declared instance variables? I need to clarify the second question. I'm not asking about how to access properties, or what they do; I know all that stuff. I was under the impression that you could not access instance variables directly when using synthesized ivars based on this post . I've clearly been able to do what I previously thought wasn't possible. I'm wondering what's going on. I'm using Xcode 3.2.4/iPhone Simulator/LLVM Compiler 1.5.
