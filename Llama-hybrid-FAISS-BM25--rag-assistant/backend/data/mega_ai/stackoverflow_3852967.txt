Extending Olie's response on the "symbolicated version" of the app: The debugging information is stripped from the distribution version of the app to make it smaller and also to protect the developer's intellectual property (so you can't see class and method names). In order to decrypt the log, you need to have the debugging symbols file associated with the specific build that created the crash log. This file (.dSYM extension) will be present in the build folder where the binary of the iPhone app is also located. Please note that you need the .dSYM file for the specific compilation that was used to compile the app on the phone - the dSYM file is timestamped, so if you recompile the app, the dSYM file will change even if you don't change a line of code. Once you have this file on your computer, drag the crash file into xcode (or view logs from attached devices in the Organiser), which will give you a stack trace of the methods called and the specific lines of code called which led to the crash.
