You can also try principal component analysis (PCA) to see if buy_decision is closely linked to any of the predictor variables. Using iris data set as an example (and converting Species variable to numeric), following is the PCA plot of variables: It shows that Species variable is closely linked to Petal.length and Petal.width. It is also correlated with Sepal.Length but not with Sepal.width. The first 2 components used in this plot account for 95% of variability of data. The plot has been drawn using FactoMineR package in R.
