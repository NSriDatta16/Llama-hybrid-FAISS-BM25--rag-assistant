You can register additional pragma directives : Extensions to the predefined set of pragma directives may, under certain conditions, be registered in the WHATWG Wiki PragmaExtensions page . Conformance checkers are then required to recognise them: Conformance checkers must use the information given on the WHATWG Wiki PragmaExtensions page to establish if a value is allowed or not: values defined in this specification or listed on the aforementioned page must be accepted, whereas values not listed in either this specification or on the aforementioned page must be rejected as invalid. That may be hard work though, don't know if there's any reason why these headers haven't been listed before but I guess you'll find out if you try it :) Your .htaccess looks OK according to the MS docs , there may be some variations depending on what version of Apache you're on, but probably the best way to check is to try it and see.
