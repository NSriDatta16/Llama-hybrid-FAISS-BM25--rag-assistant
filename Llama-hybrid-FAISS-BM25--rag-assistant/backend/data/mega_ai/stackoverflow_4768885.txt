Not sure if this applies to you but is your PK of type INT? If it's some sort of VARCHAR or TEXT it could order like the example you showed. And are you sure that column is actually your PK? Post the SHOW CREATE TABLE output of the table and it might become clearer. And which storage engine are you using. The default order of a select is insert order for MYISAM and PK for InnoDB if I remember correctly. This would also depend of your version of MySql. To be sure in all circumstances you SHOULD use ORDER BY in your select statement.
