See functional programming: immutable data structure efficiency (especially my answer that points to Rich Hickey's talk) for the 'general' convincing evidence that yes, immutable structures can also be very efficient. As to how well this is true in the specific case of F# Set , well, perhaps only moderately so today. It would be great to use a more efficient underlying structure (in pragmatic terms; in theoretical terms, of course everything is O(logN) (which in practical terms is O(1)) ).
