Multi-touch support for web browsers/web pages

Multi-touch seems to be gathering more and more references worldwide every day. Soon the prices will most likely drop, as there are already a good amount of companies investing in them. Now what I wanted to ask to stackoverflow is the following: Is it time to start developing an open-source multi-touch api for browsers, like addons to Firefox? What modifications will we need to do to current web-frameworks to support for multi-touch? I know this is not directly programming related, thus being community wiki. Just trying to gathering some opinions on it. Edit: What i'm trying to aim with this is to know if devs would be interested in this, a couple of stuff you could probably do would be like: Zooming Increased iteractivity, for example allowing re-organization of the webpage Multiple persons using the same web-page at the same time. Why the question (one example): - Javascript, for example, is not ready to handle multiple actions at the same time. (You can simulate it, but you can't just go to your web-browser with 2 mouse pointers and do multiple stuff at the same time)
