It highly depends on the type of game and the information about the state of the game that is available to your AI. Some of the most famous game playing AIs from last few years are based on deep reinforcement learning (e.g. Playing Atari with Deep Reinforcement Learning ), which is normal reinforcement learning (e.g. Q-learning) with a deep neural network as reward value function approximation. These approaches receive the raw pixels of the game plus the points of the player, and output the actions of a game pad, much like a human. In order to do something like that, you need to master reinforcement learning (see Sutton and Barto's seminal book ) and deep learning (see Ian Goodfellow et al. book ), and then how to fuse them into deep reinforcement learning (search for "reinforcement learning" in any curated list of deep learning papers like this one ). However, if the information about the game that is available to your AI is more structured than that (e.g. position of the player, description of the environment), you can do well with more classical approaches where you decompose your game into tractable problems and solve each one algorithmically e.g. by searching with A* .
