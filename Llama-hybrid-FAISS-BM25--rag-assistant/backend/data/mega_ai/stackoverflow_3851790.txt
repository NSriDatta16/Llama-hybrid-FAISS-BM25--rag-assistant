You should use GroupBox control. All radio buttons in a GroupBox are mutually exclusive - put 2 radio buttons in one GroupBox, and the other 2 in another GroupBox. If you don't like your container to be visible - use Panel control instead of GroupBox. (Just drag and drop) As you can probably guess, the upper one is a GroupBox, the lower one (which is invisble, but allows only one readioButton within it to be selected) is a panel. HTH.
