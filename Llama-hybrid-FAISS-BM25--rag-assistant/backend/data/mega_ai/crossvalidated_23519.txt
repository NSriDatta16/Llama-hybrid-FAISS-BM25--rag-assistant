How do I evaluate standard deviation?

I have collected responses from 85 people on their ability to undertake certain tasks. The responses are on a five point Likert scale: 5 = Very Good, 4 = Good, 3 = Average, 2 = Poor, 1 = Very Poor, The mean score is 2.8 and the standard deviation is 0.54. I understand what the mean and standard deviation stand for. My question is: how good (or bad) is this standard deviation? In other words, are there any guidelines that can assist in the evaluation of standard deviation.
