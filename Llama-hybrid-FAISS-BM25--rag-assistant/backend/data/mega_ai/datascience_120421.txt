data science is sometimes considered applied machine learning so maybe you want to have a look at this to get an idea of what people are doing in different parts of the field https://paperswithcode.com/search?q_meta=&q_type=&q=data+science This has a good algo that selects papers that is considered by researchers at meta aka facebook ai to be good for sota here is the github on the algo https://github.com/paperswithcode/sota-extractor#automatic-sota-state-of-the-art-extraction And a bit on the about page "dataset_citations" - zero or more Link objects, representing the papers that are the primary citations for the dataset sota - the Sota object representing the state-of-the-art table on this dataset" The state of the art will evolve and as long as this project is maintained it seems like a good place to check for the next 3 years. Citations are the main criteria here but what people use on the job is years behind.
