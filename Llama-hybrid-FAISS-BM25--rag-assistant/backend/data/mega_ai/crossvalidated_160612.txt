auto.arima doesn't calculate AIC values for the majority of models

I have manually discovered that the best model for my time series is the next one (AIC = 244.9): But auto.arima function tells me that the best model is (0,1,0) with AIC = 247.93: If I look at the trace I see: Why can't auto.arima calculate AIC values for the majority of the models and returns Inf?
