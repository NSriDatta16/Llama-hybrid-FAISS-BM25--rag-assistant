Can naive Bayes model this type of (approx. circular) decision boundary?

In a recent exam on machine learning I came across the following question: "Which of the following techniques can model the decision boundary depicted in the figure? (check all that apply)" See my self-made picture. Logistic regression (with linear features) Neural Networks Naive Bayes Support vector machine (with linear Kernel) I was convinced the answer is Neural Networks and Naive Bayes. In particular Gaussian Naive Bayes can model circular decision boundaries (see an example here ; it works, I also tried it myself). However I have been told Naive Bayes was not rated as correct. Instead only neural nets was the correct answer. How is this possible or is it a mistake?
