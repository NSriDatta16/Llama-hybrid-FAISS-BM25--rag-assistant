Detecting drawn shapes in Canvas+Javascript?

I had an idea for a WebOS, but it requires detecting drawn shapes. Ie: I want a user to be able to draw an image, then draw a big box around the whole image. Then the user can drag that box by the grabbing the border, and moving the whole image around. This requires that I be able to detect when such a box has been drawn, and turn it into a Rect type. Anyone have any pointers or tips on how to do this? I don't even know where to start.
