Can't open Tab Bar Controller in IB

I've only just started learning to build iPhone apps using xcode. I'm slowly getting the basics, but I've come across a problem in Interface Builder. When I create a new project using the Tab Bar Application template, I can't seem to do anything with the Tab Bar Controller in main.xib . When I double click the file, IB opens up fine, but there is no window to add/remove items to the view. If I drag a second Tab Bar Controller from the library, it opens up a window to edit the view, but does nothing else as it isn't connected. If I close the editor window and double click the new Tab Bar Controller icon in IB, it opens it back up but refuses to open up the original (connected) one when I double click that. I'm more than happy to start completely from scratch with a basic Window application, but I can't find any resources to get me started with Tab Bar Controllers that don't simply use the xcode template! I'd appreciate any help anyone can give.
