default init value for struct member of a class

The fragment below is from a VC++ 2008 Express Edition. Say, I have a class with a member that is a struct. I am trying to define default values for the member variables of this class. Why this does not work? struct Country{ unsigned chart id; unsigned int initials; std::string name; }; class world{ private: Country _country; unsigned int _population; public: world(){}; world(): _country(): id('1'), initials(0), name("Spain") {}; _population(543000) {} : : ~world(){}; };
