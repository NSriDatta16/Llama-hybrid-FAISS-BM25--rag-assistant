What exactly happens when I do a feature cross?

I was going through a machine learning course and they talked about combining various features to create synthetic feature to take care of non linear data. For eg in the below picture I didn't do any feature crossing and the model didn't fit: But if I do some feature crossing and create/activate features $x_1^2$ , $x_2^2$ and $x_1x_2$ I get this: The model fits now. But why? What exactly does feature crossing do that enables a model to fit non linear data? Can some one please help me understand it?
