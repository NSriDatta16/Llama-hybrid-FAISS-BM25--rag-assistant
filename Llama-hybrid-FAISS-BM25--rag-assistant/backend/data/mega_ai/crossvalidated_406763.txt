Interpretation of the following logistic regression problem

I have a function that gives the probability of Y=1 given X i.e P(Y=1|X)=f(wX) . This function is dependent on variables w and X and I have to give the range of w such that the following condition is satisfied: There are two points namely X1 and X2. The question is "give the range of w such that X1 is more likely to have a positive sentiment than X2" . My interpretation is that "X1 must have a positive sentiment and X2 will not" since the question can be simply compared with "X1 is more likely to have chocolate than X2" which eases my understanding. As a result, P(Y=1|X1) > 0.5 and P(Y=1|X2) However, the solution that my faculty has stated is P(Y=1|X1)>P(Y=1|X2) which conforms to the statement "X1 is likely to have more positive sentiment than X2" . Ultimately it boils down to two things: 1- What is the meaning of the statement: "X1 is more likely to have a positive sentiment than X2". 2- Is it different from "X1 is likely to have more positive sentiment than X2" Kindly elaborate your thought process and help me find errors in any of the two approaches.
