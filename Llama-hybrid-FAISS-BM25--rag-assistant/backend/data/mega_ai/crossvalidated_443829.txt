Having a problem reading my multiple logistic regression model

I have a logistic regression model that is seemingly significant when regressing individual variables in a univariate regression, but the entire thing falls apart when input into a multiple model. I've tried my best to fix multicollinearity problems. The thing I'm most surprised is how BMI goes from being very significant to non-significant, as there is a strong clinical suspicion that BMI should play a part and it seems to do so when univariately regressed. EDITED data file out as question has been answered.
