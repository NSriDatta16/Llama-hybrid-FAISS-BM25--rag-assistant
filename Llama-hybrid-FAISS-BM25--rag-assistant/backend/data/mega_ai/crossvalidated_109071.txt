Standardizing features when using LDA as a pre-processing step

If a multi-class Linear Discriminant Analysis (or I also read Multiple Discriminant Analysis sometimes) is used for dimensionality reduction (or transformation after dimensionality reduction via PCA), I understand that in general a "Z-score normalization" (or standardization) of features won't be necessary, even if they are measured on completely different scales, correct? Since LDA contains a term similar to the Mahalanobis distance which is already implying normalized Euclidean distances? So it would not only be not necessary, but the results after an LDA on standardized and non-standardized features should be exactly the same!?
