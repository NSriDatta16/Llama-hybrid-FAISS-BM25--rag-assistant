How to compute error terms in moving average time series model?

Currently I am studying time series Moving Average model MA(q) $$X_t -\mu= \epsilon_t + \theta_1\epsilon_{t-1} + \theta_2 \epsilon_{t-2} + ... + \theta_q \epsilon_q$$ where $\theta_1,...,\theta_q$ are parameters and $\epsilon_t$ is a white noise with mean $0$ and constant variance. I have been puzzling on how to compute $\epsilon_t.$ Are they just residuals? This post illustrated how to compute $\epsilon_t$ in $MA(1)$ model. But I do not see how the same technique can be carried forward to $MA(q)$ model.
