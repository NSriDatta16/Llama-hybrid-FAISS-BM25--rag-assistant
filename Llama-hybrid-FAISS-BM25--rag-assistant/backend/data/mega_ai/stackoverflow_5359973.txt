Styling the actual first child (not just first found child)

I want to negate the leading in a tag, if it exists - and :first-child doesn't fit the bill. Any ideas? This must be caught. I don't want extra space at the top of a paragraph: Some Text But not this one: Some Text Some more text This code, unfortunately, catches both: p br:first-child { display: none; } How do I get it to catch only leading tags? CSS3 is fine. I don't need to support dead horses.
