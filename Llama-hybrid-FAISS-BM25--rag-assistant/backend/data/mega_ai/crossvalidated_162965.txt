I think that you can clearly see the pattern and seasonality (probably the peak some where in the summer) in this time series and you don't need to train complex network for this issue. You can just model it with function. For example you can choose some polynomial (or better some other function which can monotonically decrease) which will fit it in a line and add some sin or cos function to control the time period (or maybe 2 additional terms). Don't use complex tools for simple tasks.
