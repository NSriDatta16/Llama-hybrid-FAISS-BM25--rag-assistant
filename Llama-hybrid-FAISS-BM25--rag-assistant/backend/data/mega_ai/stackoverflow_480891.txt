Is there a way to tell Eclipse to "Save all" before building?

Does anyone know if there's a way to get Eclipse to do a "Save all" before building java code? (I don't use the "Build automatically" option, I'm talking when you use "Ctrl+B" to do a build all) I've dug thru the preferences, and can't seem to find anything, so I figured I'd check the hive mind at Stack Overflow just in case. I'm using Ganymede, V3.4.1, Build id: M20080911-1700, if it's relevant. Thanks in advance, Dave Mackie
