How to use neural networks with large and variable number of inputs?

I'm new to machine learning, but I have an interesting problem. I have a large sample of people and visited sites. Some people have indicated gender, age, and other parameters. Now I want to restore these parameters to each user. Which way do I look for? Which algorithm is suitable to solve this problem? I'm familiar with Neural Networks (supervised learning), but it seems they don't fit.
