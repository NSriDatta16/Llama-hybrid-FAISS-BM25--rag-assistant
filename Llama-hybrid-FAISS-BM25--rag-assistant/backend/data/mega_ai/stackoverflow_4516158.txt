Grouping by Name but disregarding capitalization

I have built a Ruby on Rails app that allows users to track workouts. I also allow them to add groups (like blog tags) to workouts to help keep organized. In most places where I display the tags I do so by grouping by name. @group_counts = current_user.groups.count(:group => :name, :order => 'count_all DESC') Is there a way to disregard capitalization. For instance I have two different records returned for Push press and Push Press .
