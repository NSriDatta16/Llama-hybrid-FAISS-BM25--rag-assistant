You should make 1 ListBoxDragDropTarget with a list box in it. The listbox has 3 item. Each item contains Listbox DragDropTarget with a list box in it. And every sub level contains an listbox again for all the files. With a little effort you can create your own listboxitem which has a button to open or close it like a treeview. And tada,, you can rearrange the items but no the levels.
