Is this web page publicly accessible? I work for a company called Changebase who have a product called “AOK Browse-It” which can check for IE8 compatibility. If you can send me the URL I can run it through this tool and post the results here. The tool can ‘spider’ static websites automatically, or for more complex web sites (user logon, dynamic content etc) we use ‘client-side capture’ which monitors web browsing using an agent on the PC.
