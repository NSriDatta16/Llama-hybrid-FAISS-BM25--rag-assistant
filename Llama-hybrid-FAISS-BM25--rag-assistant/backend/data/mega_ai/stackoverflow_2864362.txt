What is the best way to call MSWord from C++

What is the best way to call MSWord from C++ I never did this before. I always used VB6 and the Word-COM-Library: C:\Program Files\Microsoft Office\OfficeXX\MSWORD.olb Respectively: Microsoft Word XX.0 Object Library How should I use/call Word from C++ (VS2010) ? Should I use .NET ? (C++CLI) Do you have a good step by step explanation? Code example in VB Option Explicit Sub Main() Dim mWord As New Word.Application mWord.ScreenUpdating = False Dim mMaxParagraph As Long Dim aDoc As Word.Document Dim aFileName As String aFileName = "C:\mydoc.doc" Set aDoc = mWord.Documents.Open(aFileName) mMaxParagraph = mWord.ActiveDocument.Paragraphs.Count Debug.Print CStr(mMaxParagraph) aDoc.Close mWord.Quit End Sub
