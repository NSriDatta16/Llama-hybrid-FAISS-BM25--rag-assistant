This link should help: http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/faq.html#/Q3:_Data_preparation It's mentioned that the data is stored in a sparse array/matrix form. Essentially, it means only the non-zero data are stored, and any missing data is taken as holding value zero. For your questions: a) Index merely serves as a way to distinguish between the features/parameters. In terms of a hyperspace, it's merely designating each component: Eg: 3-D ( 3 features) indices 1,2,3 would correspond to the x,y,z coordinates. b) The correspondence is merely mathematical, when constructing the hyper-plane, these serve as coordinates. c) If you skip one in between, it should be assigned a default value of zero. In short, +1 1:0.7 2:1 3:1 translates to: Assign to class +1, the point (0.7,1,1).
