clustering with heterogeneous (quantitative and qualitative)data?

I'm a Phd student and I have the results of some approaches (algorithms) that I would like to analyze. Data (results) are stored in csv files as follows: - the lines describe each algorithm with its parameters and the result obtained. - Some columns (characteristics) are quantitative and others are qualitative (enumerated types) and the last column is the results which presents the efficiency of the algorithm and it is a numerical value that I can convert in classes (of intervals of values). I would like to highlight at first what is the tendency of the good and worse algorithmes. Then, what are the features that contributed to obtain these results I'm beginner in machine learning and I searched a lot on the net but i didn't find the appropriate method . Could you point me to a clustering/ learning method for this purpose. I would be very greatful. Best regards.
