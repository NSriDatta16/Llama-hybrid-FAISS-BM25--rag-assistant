jquery disable click over

Can we disabled click over an tag. I'm appending a player to the body using the embed code. When the player is clicked it's taking the user to the players page, like youtube for example. This is interfering with the draggable functionality i have on the player. As soon as the player is dragged and mouse is released the link executes.
