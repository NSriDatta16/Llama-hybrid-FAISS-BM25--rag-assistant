Just found an answer to this here : I found a more elegant solution as the whole problem originated from using Intraweb, I rather get Intraweb to initialise com for me. This sorts it out nicely. When using your MS SQL DbExpress driver or ADO driver with Intraweb, you must set the ComInitialization property in the ServerController to ‘ciMultiThreaded’. This will eliminates the "CoInitialize has not been called" error.
