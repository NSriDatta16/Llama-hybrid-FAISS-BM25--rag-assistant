Non-parametric tests for interaction effects

I have two datasets that are both organised as follows: an algorithm calculated a quality score (Q) of a specific image (image) that was processed using a certain algorithm (method). One has 315 observations, the other 2709. I first tried applying a simple linear regression model, only looking at method as a possible predictor, and looked at the QQ-plot. fd I decided that the residuals did not follow a normal distribution. I then tried a Box-Cox transformation to fix the issue. The new model showed this QQ-plot: bc $q ~ data_drim$ method) (lambda $x[which.max(bc$ y)]) powerTransform $q, lambda) ~ data_drim$ method) I wasn't convinced yet, so I went with a non-parametric test instead: the Kruskal-Wallis test. I followed this up with paired comparison tests (Wilcoxon with BH correction). My questions: Is this a good approach, given the results with the linear models? I read that you can ignore the normality assumption safely due to the central limit theorem once the number of observations surpasses 200, but I figured that was a 'per condition' number (or is it?), so I didn't go that way. Suppose I now want to investigate the interaction between different images and the method used. That's not something I can do with Kruskal-Wallis. I could have done that with a (g)lm, but I'm not sure how to go about that using non-parametric methods (if that is indeed what I should be doing).
