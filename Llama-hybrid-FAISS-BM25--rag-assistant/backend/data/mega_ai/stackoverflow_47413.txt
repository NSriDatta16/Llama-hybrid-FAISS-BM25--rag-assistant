MS-Access design pattern for last value for a grouping

It's common to have a table where for example the the fields are account, value, and time. What's the best design pattern for retrieving the last value for each account? Unfortunately the last keyword in a grouping gives you the last physical record in the database, not the last record by any sorting. Which means IMHO it should never be used. The two clumsy approaches I use are either a subquery approach or a secondary query to determine the last record, and then joining to the table to find the value. Isn't there a more elegant approach?
