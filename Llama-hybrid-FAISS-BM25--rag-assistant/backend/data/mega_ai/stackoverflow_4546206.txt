I have an app in Heroku, I need simple file storage for uploaded images for this I used send_data using attachment_fu plugin. After that I have used the tmp/ directory to write this file and want to display on browser, But these files are not displayed in browser. How can I display these images on browser? What is the alternate solution to store and retrieve images? Thanks!
