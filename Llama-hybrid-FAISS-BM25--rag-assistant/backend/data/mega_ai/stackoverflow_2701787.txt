EDIT: See comments indicating that this doesn't work with C# 4. I'm not clear whether it worked in earlier versions of the compiler. The C# 4 spec makes this pretty clear though. Section 2.5.8.1 states: A #pragma warning restore directive restores all or the given set of warnings to the state that was in effect at the beginning of the compilation unit. Note that if a particular warning was disabled externally, a #pragma warning restore (whether for all or the specified warning) will not re-enable that warning. Jeff has a workaround in a blog post - basically to reprocess autogenerated code as part of the build. As Tom says, you can add an "ignore" to the whole project (Build / Suppress Warnings - enter 1591 as the warning number) - but then you can restore the warning yourself at the top of each of your non-generated files: #pragma warning restore 1591 It's pretty ugly, but it works (I've just tested it).
