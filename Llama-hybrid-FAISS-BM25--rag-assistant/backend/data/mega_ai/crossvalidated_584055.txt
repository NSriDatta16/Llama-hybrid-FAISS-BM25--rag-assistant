Assumptions give you power - when they are valid. When the assumptions of a linear regression (or any other simple model) are fulfilled, they will outperform more complex and flexible models. Let's consider a model with a single predictor. If the relationship is linear, a linear regression will quite likely outperform a neural network. More complex/flexible models can be beneficial when important assumptions are violated. But in order to gain the benefits of the flexible models, you need a lot more data in order to learn the complex pattern, or that flexibility can degrade performance relative to a simple model. So in your case, it seems likely that this is because you have a small dataset, or because the relationships you are modelling are linear, or both.
