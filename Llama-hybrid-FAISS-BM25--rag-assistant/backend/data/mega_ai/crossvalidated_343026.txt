You will almost always have unknown words/characters in your test data e.g. unique names in sentences. For example a sentence in training data might be 'Thank you John' and in test data be 'Thank you Mary'. One way to overcome this issue in training phase is to create a dummy unknown token apart from all the tokens of your training data. For example if using a word embedding like fasttext, you could insert a new token with a embedding vector of all zeros/random initialised. This way, the above sequence will be 'Thank you '.
