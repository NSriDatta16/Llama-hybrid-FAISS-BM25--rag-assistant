How to check if a multi dimensional array has at least 1 value that equates to (bool) true in PHP

I have a multi dimensional array. The only actual values (other than other arrays) in there are numbers. By default, they are all 0. I would like to know is there an easy way to determine if the array has a value other than 0 in it. I know I could build something recursive, but I want to know if I could leverage array_map() or something similar. I could not get array_count_values() to work with an associate array. If that's not possible, how would I design a recursive function? Here are some test cases $array = array( 'test' => array(0, 0, 0, array(0, 0, 0)) ) Should return false. $array = array( 'test' => array(0, 0, 0, array(6, 0, 0)) // notice the 6 ) Should return true. Thanks!
