Network programming and Packets interactions

Greeting, This month I will start working on my master thesis. My thesis's subject is about network security. I need to deal with network interfaces and packets. I've used shappcap before to interact with packets but I'm not sure if C# is the most powerful language to deal with network programing and packets. I worked a bit with wireshark and I saw how powerful it is and as you know winsharp is open source developed using C++. I'm not sure if I should use C# or C++ for network security programming and I want your through about the best language might be for network programming and packets interaction. should I use C#, C++, or java or some thing else? please give me your advice. Thank you, UPDATE .......................... I'm going to do different packet mining by taking each packet and read each field on it then use these values and in same stages I would modify some of the packets value then resend them back. I want to control the packet since it received by the network interface until it passes to the application layer. also
