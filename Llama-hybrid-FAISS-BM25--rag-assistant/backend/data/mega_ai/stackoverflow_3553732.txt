I discourage using htaccess/htpasswd for complex password management. Instead, I recommend you build your own password management/login system. However, if you still want to use htpasswd, follow these directions: First, make sure that you have the htpasswd.exe file in the path/current directory. Then, modify and add this line to your program where you need it. exec('htpasswd.exe -b passwordFile myUserame myPassword'); where passwordFile is the name of the password file myUsername is the username you want to change and myPassword is the new password If you want to use dynamic input, MAKE SURE you clean the content first. Otherwise, you could open up security holes to malicious attackers.
