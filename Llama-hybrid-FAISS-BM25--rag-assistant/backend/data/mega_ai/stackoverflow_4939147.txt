I can only guess right now, but after looking at Django's source code and your error message I think the format of your fixture might be broken. The example you posted, is that the whole content of the file? If yes, then I think you need to put that model in a list, like this (pay attention to the outer brackets): [ { "pk": 1, "model": "seo.opportunitymetadatamodel", "fields": { "_content_type": [ "opportunity", "jobopportunity" ], "og_description": "", "description": "", "title": "test", "keywords": "", "og_title": "", "heading": "" } } ] Why? After Django parsed the JSON data successfully, this data is passed to the python deserializer. This iterates over the data as follows: 82 for d in object_list: 83 # Look up the model and starting build a dict of data for it. 84 Model = _get_model(d["model"]) http://code.djangoproject.com/browser/django/trunk/django/core/serializers/python.py#L82 Now imagine object_list is a json object (equivalent to python's dictionary), iterating over it will only get you the keys, in this case pk, model, field . In line 84 Django does _get_model(d["model"]) , that is, using a string "model" as index to another string, probably pk (which is the first element in object_list ). That's a type error. When object_list is an actual list, iterating over it will give you dictionaries, which can be indexed by strings.
