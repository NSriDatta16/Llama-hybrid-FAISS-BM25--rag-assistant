Check out Castle DynamicProxy , which leverages IL Emit to create a proxy object on the fly. You can Emit a proxy that implements the two interfaces and then delegates the calls to the two encapsulated instances. If you're interested, it's actually not too difficult to implement this yourself, though there are some corner cases to consider and the IL Emit classes are not particularly forgiving of errors (making them a challenge to learn.)
