LINQ- Combine Multiple List and order by a value (.Net 3.5)

I'm trying to combine a number of List where T:IGetTime (i.e T will always have method getTime() ). Then I'm trying order the items by the DateTime that getTime() returns. My LINQ looks like this: public static List Combine(List one, List two, List three) { var result = from IGetTime item in one from IGetTime item2 in two from IGetTime item3 in three select new{ item, item2, item3 }; return result.ToList(); } I've yet to add an orderby . Which should look somthing like this: var thestream = from T item in this orderby item.getTime() descending select item; Is there anyway to both combine and order the final list???? Thanks in advance, Roberto
