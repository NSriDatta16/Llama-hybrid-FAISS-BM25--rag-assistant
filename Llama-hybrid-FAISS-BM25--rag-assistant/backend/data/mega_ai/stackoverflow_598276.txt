JavaScript/jQuery: event fired twice

I'm trying some event bindings with jQuery, and I have this simple code in my document ready: $(document).ready(function() { $("p a").each(function(i, selected){ $(selected).hover( function(event) { alert('over: ' + event.type); }, function(event) { alert('out: ' + event.type); }); } ) }); So, when I move mouse over a link thats inside a paragraph (selector is "p a") alerts pop-up twice. So, mouseenter and mouseleave are fired twice. This only happens in Google Chrome. In Internet Explorer 7, Firefox 3, Opera and Safari both events are fired only once. Why is this happening?
