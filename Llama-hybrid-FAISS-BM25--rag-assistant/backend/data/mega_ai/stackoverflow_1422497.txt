As ennuikiller said, you must define what you wish to name the variable(s) that is passed back from the yield statement. This has to do with a variable's scope. The scope inside of the block that you pass to test_method does not know about the i variable. You can actually call this whatever you wish. For instance, you could do the following: def test_method ["a", "b", "c"].map { |i| yield(i) } end p test_method { |some_variable_name| some_variable_name.upcase } Just because the test method knows about it, it does not means that the block that you pass to the test method will know about it. Edit 1: To give a little more information, you can redefine test_method as follows if it makes it a little bit more clear: def test_method(&block) if not block.nil? ["a", "b", "c"].map { |i| yield(i) } end end
