A major problem with one-word-per-line storage is that there is no random access for lines in constant time (accessing line X consists in counting X newline characters from the beginning of the file) so your binary search would suffer. What you need in this specific (auto-complete) situation is a Prefix Tree or a variation of it (combining several nodes into one, or turning sub-trees smaller than a certain size into plain old sorted list of words).
