How to account for competing events when using a logistic regression model?

I am creating a model to identify which factors predict two different recidivism outcomes (A)new arrest, or (B) return to prison in a group of people who parole, with equal time at risk (2 years). The outcomes of interest are A) arrested within two years or not, or B) returned to prison within two years, or not. Each outcome of interest occurs in about 25% of cases and individuals can experience both outcomes of interest during the two year period. I am using multinomial logistic regression to build two different models for the two outcomes of interest. However, when people are returned to prison (i.e. experience outcome B), they are not able to experience outcome A (arrest) for at least 6 months. I understand this is biasing my results when I am building a model for outcome A, but I am unsure of how to correct for this. I have seen other scholars simply extend the time they are tracking individuals who pause their time at risk (i.e. individuals who experience outcome B are tracked for 2.5 years, instead of 2 years to account for the 6 months they were unable to experience outcome A), but this strikes me as not particularly sophisticated. Is there a model better suited for this type of issue?
