Django and project/application organization

I'm just beginning to learn Django and am a little confused on the best way to layout and organize a project and applications. From my understanding, a project is your site as a whole and applications are the pieces that make up that site? For a first project I am making a small e-commerce type site which will have users, items, etc... So should I have "users" and "items" applications? What about the smaller parts that would go along with those like user registration/logging in, tags for items, comments for items? Should user authentication, tagging, and commenting be separate applications as well? Basically I am having trouble on wrapping my head around the concept of what an application is and when to separate different use cases into separate applications while keeping everything manageable and DRY.
