Are you using the default 'Cygwin Bash Shell'? This is the one that launches inside a Windows cmd shell, and you can't drag to resize the screen. This shell is horribly broken, because of the underlying Windows component. Try using something like rxvt , or one of the putty forks. If this is all set, then the issue is likely a termcap issue. Some people set their Cygwin TERM variable to 'xterm', because many remote machines don't have termcaps installed for things like rxvt-cygwin-native . Overridding it locally will cause problems with programs that attempt a range of terminal operations. In your ~/.bash_profile, you can set your terminal to the following. export TERM=rxvt-cygwin-native See my rxvt install guide and tips for more on rxvt.
