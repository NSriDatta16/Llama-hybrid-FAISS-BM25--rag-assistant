Logistic regression with non-negative parameter

I want to model the probability of a binary variable x given some predictor, d. It needs two parameters: One parameter that sets the "break point", at which p(x=1 | d) = 0.5. One parameter that sets the "softness", i.e. how abruptly the probability changes around the break point. (Sorry I'm sure there's standard terminology for this, but I'm a bit of a novice.) A logistic regression model feels like the right approach, but the domain of d is [0, inf] (d is a distance metric). Is there a standard way to transform d to [-inf, inf] so a logistic regression can be used (e.g. f(x) = x-1/x)? Or is there another common model for this kind of scenario?
