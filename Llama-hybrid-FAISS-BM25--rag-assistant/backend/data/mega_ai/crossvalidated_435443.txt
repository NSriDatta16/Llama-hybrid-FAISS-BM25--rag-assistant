Can deep learning determine if two samples of handwriting are by the same person?

I have dabbled using Tesseract CNN OCR on handwriting records before and was surprised by the accuracy. I am wondering, is it possible to use it, or something else, to determine if a sample of handwriting is written by the same person? I have searched for solutions but it is difficult to get results for anything but OCR recognition with handwriting. Has anyone attempted this before or can point me in the right direction? Thank you.
