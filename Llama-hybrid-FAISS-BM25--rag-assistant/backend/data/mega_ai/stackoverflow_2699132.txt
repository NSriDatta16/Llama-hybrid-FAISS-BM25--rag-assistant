jQuery nested sortables jumpy behaviour

I want to allow user to drag and drop UI elements. I've 'container' and 'control', control may be in container, containers may include other containers (this is important requirement). I created simple prototype using jQuery. HTML: Control 1 Control 2 Container drag area Subcontrol 1 Subcontrol 2 Subcontrol 3 Subcontrol 4 Subcontrol 5 Subcontrol 6 Subcontrol 7 Subcontrol 8 Subcontrol 9 Control 3 Then I created sortables using jQueryUI: $('.one').sortable({ items: 'div.control', placeholder: 'placeholder', forcePlaceholderSize: true }); Now when I'm trying to drag "Subcontrol 8" and place it between "Subcontrol 2" and "Subcontrol 3" for example I'm getting jumpy effect, you can observe it here: http://jsbin.com/egipu4/2 Interesting thing is - when I remove ability to drag "container" then it becomes smooth and perfect (you can see this on jsbin example below "jumpy" example, you can't drag using "Container drag area" span). I tried different "nested" plugins and techniques, google'd for a long time and the only one that worked was on this page: (StackOverflow doesn't allow me to post more than one like, google for "Brian Swartzfager's Blog: Nested List Sort Demo" should be first, sorry!) But it does work great only in jQuery1.2 and very old jQueryUI. If I include latest jQuery (1.3/1.4) and UI (1.7/1.8) it gets jumpy as well. What am I doing wrong?
