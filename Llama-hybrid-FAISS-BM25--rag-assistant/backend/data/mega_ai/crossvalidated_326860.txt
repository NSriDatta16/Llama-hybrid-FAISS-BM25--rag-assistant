I would suggest to use CNN's. Pros: No need manual feature extraction Faster experimentation with different networks Cons: Manual labelling of dataset In Keras framework, there are many pre-trained CNN's available for use: Ex: Xception VGG16 VGG19 ResNet50 InceptionV3 InceptionResNetV2 MobileNet https://gogul09.github.io/software/flower-recognition-deep-learning You can use any of the above mentioned networks and fine tune for your dataset. There are many blogs that explains how to use pre-trained networks to do transfer learning & fine tuning. Ex: https://www.learnopencv.com/keras-tutorial-transfer-learning-using-pre-trained-models/
