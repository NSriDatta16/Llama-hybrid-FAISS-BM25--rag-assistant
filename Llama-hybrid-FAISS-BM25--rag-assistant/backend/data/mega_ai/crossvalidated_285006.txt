Random forest: advantages/disadvantages of selecting randomly subset features for every tree vs for every node?

There are two methods to select subset of features during a tree construction in random forest: According to Breiman, Leo in "Random Forests": “… random forest with random features is formed by selecting at random, at each node, a small group of input variables to split on.” Tin Kam Ho used the “ random subspace method ” where each tree got a random subset of features. I can imagine that by selecting a subset of features at each node is more superior as the correlated variables can still be involved in the whole tree construction. Whereas if we select a subset of features for each tree, one of the correlated variables will lose its importance. Are there any other reasons why one method can perform better than the other one?
