Classification in BERT - why not use class as a feature?

I am currently following this post , which details how BERT was trained. I had a few questions about the classification task: In the post, it mentions that the authors of BERT decided to add classification into the language modeling in the following way: However, is there a reason why the authors did it this way? Why not use the classification class as a feature and not a label? In general, when training in this multi-task way, when is it better to add the multi-task as a feature or as a label?
