Thanks to Smasher , I remembered how the Delphi team used class helpers and a designer trick to add properties to Delphi 2007 without breaking binary compatibility with Delphi 2006. See this great article by Hallvard Vassbotn on how to do this. I think it solves most, if not all, of your problems. look for these things in the article: TCustomFormHelper = class helper for TCustomForm The FPixelsPerInch storage hack Injecting design-time properties Defining the streaming properties You'll have to work your own way to do the streaming, though, as you hook from the outside world into TWinControl, but that might be possible too. --jeroen
