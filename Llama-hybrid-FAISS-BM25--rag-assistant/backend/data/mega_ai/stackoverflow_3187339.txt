Keep all child nodes indented in unordered list

I'm trying to do something similar to http://www.lukew.com/ff/content/simpletable1.gif . I created my structure like this. Outages: 1 Forced 1 Planned Customers: N/A Equipment: 1 Breakers 1 Transformers This is my CSS. ul li ul { background: #DDD; margin: -20px 0 0 75px; } I have tried using a definition list however only the first definition () would be aligned properly. The other definitions would not obey the left margin. Why don't the children ul nodes not get indented on the BB browser? I'm using the 8330 (v4.3) simulator but would preferably like a solution that works across all BB browsers. Thank you.
