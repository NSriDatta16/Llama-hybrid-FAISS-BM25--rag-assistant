Dave, If you're dead set on using users to organize these businesses, then your best bet would be the two custom fields. They're easier to use in templates and you don't have to worry about pulling in the channel data for the item in the custom member field 'id'. That being said, you should check out Solspace's User Module â€”it'll give you more flexibility with the member information. Another thought, and depending on whether or not these businesses should be able to edit their widget and price, is you could just make it a channel and skip using users altogether. Using Freeform, you could create a form where businesses add that information, you get an email, and you add the information to the channel you want. Wes
