This rather extensive request for clarification plus the available information I could find will hopefully turn into a more complete answer when we have more information. I see two main possibilities - (A) Plant Growth I found this paper on plant growth: http://www.wseas.us/e-library/transactions/biology/2007/25-645.pdf which suggests that the deterministic Mitscherlich (note the spelling) growth law is: $$K + (X_0-K)e^{-\frac{r}{K}(t-r_0)} \quad \quad \quad \quad (1)$$ where the response might be some measure of size, for example, breast height diameter , and that the Mitschelich steady state density (as solution to the Fokker-Planck equation) is: $$N_s x^{-2\left(\frac{r}{K\sigma^2}+1\right)}e^{-2\frac{r}{\sigma^2x}} \quad \quad \quad \quad \quad (2)$$ where the normalizing constant $$N_s = \left(\frac{2r}{\sigma^2}\right)\frac{2r}{K\sigma^2}/\Gamma\left(\frac{2r}{K\sigma^2}+1\right)$$ The article itself doesn't make life much easier, for example, by misspelling "Fokker-Planck" (!). Is one of those two things the object you're talking about? If so, which one? i.e. are you trying to fit either an equation describing the mean to data (expression (1)), or are you trying to fit a distribution that changes over time (expression (2))? (B) Crop Yield I also found this page on crop yield: http://soil-statistic.de/mitscherlichs-law/mitscherlich.html which has $$\hat y = c + (a-c)(1-e^{-bx})$$ Are you trying to fit one of these? Or some other functional form? If you're trying to fit the expression (1) in (A) or the equation in (B), what are you assuming about the error term? Does it have constant variance? Please note that if your question is merely something like " What do I type to fit a specific equation using nls in R ?*" it is off topic for CV, but probably on-topic for StackOverflow and will likely be closed or moved (indeed you can flag it for moderator attention and ask for it to be moved yourself). If that's the case, the check the asymptotic and asymptotic-with-offset models (which have self-start functions, SSasymp and SSasympOff ) in nls and the logistic model which has self-start function SSlogis in nls . Both expression (1) in (A) and the equation in (B) are closely related to the first two functions (try a little reparameterizing!), and various forms of the logistic model can be parameterized to the logistic one that already has a self-start function. Using these models and self-start functions is described pretty well in the nonlinear models appendix to Fox's Companion to Applied Regression, here - there's also an older version at CRAN, here You may also like to check the documentation for nls and also the packages nlstools and nls2 .
