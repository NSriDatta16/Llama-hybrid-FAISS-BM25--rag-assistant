I would suggest embedding the CSDL, etc., as resources instead of keeping them as files. Add the CSDL, etc., files to your project and specify "Embedded Resoruce" as the build action. Then you can do: metadata="res://MyAssembly.dll/MyAssembly.bin.Models.DSManagedCoModel.csdl| //etc. Use Reflector to discover the true resource name. I wrote an article on connect strings which should help . Note that these files aren't actually the pregenerated views; they're just the model. But you need them to generate the views with EDMGen.
