This is a well known subject in Human Computer Interface. The idea to control the pointer with your eyes won't easily work according to me (since our eyes are always distracted by external inputs). Image you're dragging a folder with your brand new eye-mouse and a nice lady walks just outside of your window :) Anyway, eye tracking could be useful, for example, for safety applications (you could check the eyes of a bus driver are focused on a range angle - the street - and you might want to trigger a sound alarm if he's distracting/falling asleep).
