Questions for data analysis of a class room

I have Wireless Sensor Network setup in a classroom. I'm sensing data like temp, humidity, light, occupancy, etc. Classroom can accommodate 150 students and has 6 AC with light. From one side the classroom has big windows and that side is towards west and other 3 sides have thick walls and doors always closed. I have been looking for some questions that can be answered by analyzing data collected. Some of the questions I can think of are: Predicting optimum time to turn on AC before class starts so that class is attains required temp with least energy consumed. As of now I have 9 sensors on all walls and ceiling too. So to decide best position for sensor such that I can co-relate and predict other sensor values from only one or two sensor values. Decide optimum amount of light needed by occupants to be comfortable in classroom. Please suggest to me more questions that can asked about this situation. Also suggest if I can use somehow machine learning in WSN I have deployed.
