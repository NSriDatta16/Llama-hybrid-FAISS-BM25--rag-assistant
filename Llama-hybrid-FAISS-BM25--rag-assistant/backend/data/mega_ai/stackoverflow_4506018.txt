From your previous questions, it looks like you are doing social-network searches against facebook friend data; so I presume your data is a set of 'A is-friend-of B' statements, and you are looking for a shortest connection between two individuals? If you have enough memory, I would suggest parsing your csv file into a dictionary of lists. See Can this breadth-first search be made faster? If you cannot hold all the data at once, a local-storage database like SQLite is probably your next-best alternative. There are also some python modules which might help: graph-tool http://projects.skewed.de/graph-tool/ python-graph http://pypi.python.org/pypi/python-graph/1.8.0 networkx http://networkx.lanl.gov/ igraph http://igraph.sourceforge.net/
