How to use a sample from the posterior predictive distribution

Suppose I have a sample drawn from a posterior predictive distribution of a previously trained Bayesian Network (or any other Bayesian model). I.e., I have a vector $\tilde{\textbf{y}}_n = [\tilde{{y}}_1, \tilde{{y}}_2, ..., \tilde{{y}}_n]$ , where all elements are data points drawn from $\text{P}(\tilde{y} | \textbf{y})$ . My question is: What are the ways in which Bayesian statisticians would commonly make use of this sample, drawn from the predictive posterior distribution? Are my following three suggestions correct? Are there other ways? 1. Point estimate We can summarize the sample vector $\tilde{\textbf{y}}_n$ with $1$ single scalar, that would represent our "prediction". For example, we could take the sample mean. $$E[\tilde{y} | \textbf{y}] = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^{n} \tilde{y}_i$$ 2. Probability estimate We can compute the probability of having a future value larger than (or smaller than) a certain value. For instance, we might want to compute the probability that the future value will be larger than 8.5. Then, we could simply take the proportion of the elements in our sample vector $\tilde{\textbf{y}}_n$ that are larger than 8.5. $$\text{P}(\tilde{y} > 8.5 | \textbf{y}) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\textbf{1}_{\tilde{y}_i > 8.5}}$$ 3. Prediction interval Suppose that we want a prediction interval, in which 95% of the future values will lie. Then, we would simply take the 2.5th percentile from $\tilde{\textbf{y}}_n$ as lower bound and the 97.5th percentile from $\tilde{\textbf{y}}_n$ as upper bound to get the prediction interval: $$\text{95% prediction interval: } (2.5^{\text{th}} \ \text{percentile}, 97.5^{\text{th}} \ \text{percentile})$$
