Lot's more data and trading capital. If I understand you right, you want to predict prices at, say P(t+1) based on today's price at P(t). The problem is that any time series like stock prices there is a natural correlation from today today's price and tomorrow's: much like weather, the best estimate for tomorrow's price is today's price likely with a but of drift. The problem with this is that it gives a false sense of security. In cross-sectional data a high R-squared gives you a sense of what you have accomplished. Usually one looks at both the "adjusted R-squared" (which is, loosely, the R-squared once that serial correlation is removed or accounted for. Hence, we try to predict the amount by which tomorrow's price can be estimated today, and that ideally captures the "real" R-squared - not one boosted by serial correlation. One would also look at the t-statistic on the "growth per day" to make sure it is statistically sound. One thing that should not matter is the size of the typical variables. you could laser-measure movements in the Hoover dam measured in thousandths in a millimeter based on the weight of the water in the lake as measured in quadrillion pounds. All of the scaling should be irrelevant, it just gives you more accurate or intuitive results.
