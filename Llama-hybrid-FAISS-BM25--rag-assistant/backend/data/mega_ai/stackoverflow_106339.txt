I'd honestly recommend looking at Martin Fowlers Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture . It discusses a lot of ways to make your application more organized and maintainable. In addition, I would recommend using unit testing to give you better comprehension of your code. Kent Beck's book on Test Driven Development is a great resource for learning how to address change to your code through unit tests.
