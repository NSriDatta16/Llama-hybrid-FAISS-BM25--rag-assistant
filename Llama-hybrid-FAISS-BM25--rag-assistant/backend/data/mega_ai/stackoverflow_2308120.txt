The two things you want to do are: Convert it to PNG (10-30% smaller than GIF on average); and Cache it effectively. The way to cache it is to version it and use a far future Expires header. For versioning I generally just use the mtime (last modified time) of the file as a query string: body { background-image: url(/images/background.png?1232343455); } See Speed Tips: Add Future Expires Headers for adding the Expires header. You can do it with a script or with Web server configuration. The reason you need the version is that you can change it to force a reload of the file otherwise you need to rename it whenever you want to change it. This way the background will only get downloaded once. Splitting the file into several will actually worsen the situation as browsers tend to limit the number of concurrent downloads and you'll be downloading more data overall (more HTTP headers plus image file overhead).
