It is because how logic gates work: There is a logical output (1) if the control voltage exceeds a certain threshold; no logical output (0) if not. But probably much more crucial: Maybe one time computers wouldn't work in binary anymore when quantum based machines arise (or other stuff like that, which maybe would encourage more complex state representations). But as binary values are the simplest possible representation of any (more complex) state , even in "quantum times" it probably would be most appropriate to stay with computers working in binary (abstracting from other physical representations like ternary or so, if given).
