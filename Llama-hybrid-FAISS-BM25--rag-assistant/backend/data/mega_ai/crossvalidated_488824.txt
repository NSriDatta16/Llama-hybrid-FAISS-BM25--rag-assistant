Deep Learning Approaches for Aggregating Data

I am looking for an automatic way of aggregating data to derive meaning features. For example, I have a table. It contains multiple customers. Each customer is associated with multiple loans. Each loan is associated with multiple payments. So the table contains these three columns: customer, loan and payment. If I want to get something like each customer's last loan's average payment. I need to first aggregate payment to loan level to get "average" payment. Then need to aggregate loan to customer level to figure out "last" loan. Since I am looking for an automatic way of doing so, a simple approach would be to use a rule-based approach. It goes like this: if a table contains customer, loan, payment, then I will do the above aggregation to get each customer's last loan's average payment. Since I intend to do this sort of meaningful aggregation for all possible columns, I need to implement a lot of rules to do so. I see deep learning can do some very intelligent things for some applications. I wonder if it is possible to use deep learning to come up with an intelligent way to do aggregation.
