Headers set on embedding

Lets say I have a URL ( http://www.example.com/something ). Is the following scenario somehow possible? A) The user visits the URL directly and a standard page with markup, js, etc. is shown. B) The user embeds the same URL in an image tag and the URL is served only as an image.
