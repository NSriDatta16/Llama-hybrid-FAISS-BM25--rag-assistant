First, I'd like to say that I would be adding a comment, but I can't do that yet (rep), but I like the question and wanted to participate, so here's an "answer". Also, I see that this is old, but it's interesting. First, would it be possible to use a dimension-reduction technique, like PCA, to condense the time series? If the first eigenvalue is large, maybe that means that your use of the eigenvector would represent most of the dynamics. Second, and more generally, what is your desired use of the time series? Not knowing much else, I would guess that the temperatures could vary quite a bit. E.g., if some temperature records are near cities, you could get a "heat island" type effect. Or perhaps a small change in lateral distance happens to yield a large change in vertical distance--- one location could be at sea level and right on the ocean, and another not "too far away", but at a kilometer in elevation. Those would definitely have different temperatures! These are just some thoughts. Maybe someone else could jump in and give a better answer.
