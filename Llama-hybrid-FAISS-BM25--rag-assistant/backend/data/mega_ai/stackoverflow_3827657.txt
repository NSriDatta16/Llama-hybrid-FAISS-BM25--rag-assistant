Android TOUCH_MOVE event not firing in avd or device

In fact, only the touch_down event will fire. Basically, I'm trying to implement a drag feature in my app so I need the touch_move event. I have a method that writes out the touch events to the LogCat in Eclipse but the touch_down is the only event that shows up. not even touch_up shows up. I have this problem when I debug on the device or in the avd. This isn't really a code question. But has anyone had an issue getting different touch events to fire? If so, how did you resolve them? I'm using the latest Android SDK and Eclipse version. I'm using a simple ImageView. Any ideas?
