I really don't know if this is an elegant approach, but in theory you could use fork() to fork the PHP process for each item. This would allow all code to be in one file. // Get items from DB $items = get_items_from_db(); foreach($items as $item) { $pid = pcntl_fork(); if($pid == -1) die("Couldn't fork!"); if(!$pid) { // Process the item in the child process process_item($item); exit(); } } // Wait for all child processes to end pcntl_wait(); // We're done! But yes, this solution will most likely make some people scream ;)
