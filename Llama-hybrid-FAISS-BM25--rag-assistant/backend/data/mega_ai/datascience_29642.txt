You may consider using a score function estimator (also known as REINFORCE), which defines an estimator of the gradient of a scoring function that does not need to be differentiable. This can be achieved thanks to the log derivative trick . You may find its mathematical foundations in the original REINFORCE article by Williams or in Ian Goodfellow's seminal book on Deep Learning (section 20.9.1 Back-Propagating through Discrete Stochastic Operations ).
