Is it valid to build a SEM with binary data and Likert data?

I have a survey with 129 respondents, no missing data and I have 3 independent variables (Communication, legitimacy and rewards system) and 1 dependent variable (Organization breakdown) Communication and legitimacy were measured in a 5 point-Likert scale . Reward system was measured with binary data and Organization breakdown composed of binary data . I'm doing a PCA for the binary data and likert. Questions: Is it valid to build latent variables like this? Could I do a SEM with that information? This is the model I'm doing: I'm using R, any help welcome.
