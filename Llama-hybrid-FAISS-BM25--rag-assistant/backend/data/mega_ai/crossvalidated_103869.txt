$R^2$ correspondence for nonlinear time series

Is there a statistical measure for nonlinear time series data that is comparable to $R^2$ value in linear regression (giving an idea of how well the fit is)? The data is not monotonic, so I cannot use Spearman's $\rho$; and it's not linear, so Pearson's $\rho$ is not valid here either. Data looks like below (It's mostly monotonic decline. But since there is a spikes in the 11th year, it's not strictly monotonic): Here is the fitted exponential curve (in blue) and the original data (in red) Here is the qqplot: (Doesn't seem to be a good fit although it should be a good one because of the image above?)
