How to interpret the output of LDA (discriminant analysis) in R

I'm doing a study where I have 4 groups of people who take 5 different psychological tests. I'm interested in determining what test (or tests) is better at determining in which group a person is in. To do this, I have read I can use LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis). I have used the following code: my_lda = lda(participant_group ~ test1 + test2 + test3 + test4 + test5, my_data) The output I get has different sections, some of them I don't quite understand: First, I get the prior probabilities of groups (i.e., how likely it is for the participants to end up in one or another group based on the data I collected) - I think I understand this part. Prior probabilities of groups: group_1 group_2 group_3 group_4 0.1935484 0.2983871 0.3387097 0.1693548 Then, I get the group means , which I assume are the means my participants got in the tests (organized by group). Group means: test1 test2 test3 test4 test5 group_1 74.06042 23.12500 17.08333 36.58333 13.50000 group_2 50.67886 22.21622 19.45946 31.62162 18.86486 group_3 69.71243 22.85714 18.47619 35.38095 14.64286 group_4 37.15314 22.19048 19.90476 28.71429 21.28571 Thirdly, I get the coefficients , which is the part I'm struggling with. From what I've read, this is supposed to tell me which test has more weight (aka. is more important) when it comes to dividing people into groups. So, for LD1, for example, both test4 and test5 have more weight (compared to the others). However, they have a negative weight. How can I interpret the negative sign? And, does this mean these two tests are good at predicting groups (they also have a high weight in LD2)? Coefficients of linear discriminants: LD1 LD2 LD3 test1 -0.02042613 -0.0008603193 -0.03856752 test2 0.35315854 -0.0105201433 0.19364442 test3 -0.19335860 -0.0128410283 -0.30453445 test4 -0.42951316 -0.7805021655 0.42228513 test5 -0.48963686 -0.7305423473 0.36484221 Lastly, I get the proportion of trace . I think this is telling me what percentage of the data can be explained by each of these three LD functions. For example, LD1 explains roughly 60% of the data, which means that it is the most informative function of the three, and thus, whichever tests have more weight for LD1 will also be the best at predicting groups. Is this interpretation correct? Proportion of trace: LD1 LD2 LD3 0.6044 0.2204 0.1752 I'm also not sure how I should report my results in a paper. Should I include all the output or just the coefficients and proportion of trace for LD1, since it's the most informative?
