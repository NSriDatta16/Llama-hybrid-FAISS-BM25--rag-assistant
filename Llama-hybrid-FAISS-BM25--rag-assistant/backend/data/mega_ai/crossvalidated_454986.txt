Back calculate intercept from multivariable COVID-19 logistic regression model

I am interested in creating a web tool to predict the absolute risk of in-hospital death from a published risk model of COVID-19 patients. Is it possible to estimate the intercept from the significant, multivariable model coefficients published(Table 3 at https://doi.org/10.1016/S0140-6736(20)30566-3 )?
