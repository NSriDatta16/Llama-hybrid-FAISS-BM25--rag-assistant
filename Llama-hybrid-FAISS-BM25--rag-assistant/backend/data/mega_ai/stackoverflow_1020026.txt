From the manual: Beginning with MySQL 5.1.32, TRUNCATE is treated for purposes of binary logging and replication as DROP TABLE followed by CREATE TABLE â€” that is, as DDL rather than DML. This is due to the fact that, when using InnoDB and other transactional storage engines where the transaction isolation level does not allow for statement-based logging (READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED), the statement was not logged and replicated when using STATEMENT or MIXED logging mode. You can simplify your insert to: INSERT INTO table ( SELECT id, COUNT(id) FROM table2 GROUP BY id );
