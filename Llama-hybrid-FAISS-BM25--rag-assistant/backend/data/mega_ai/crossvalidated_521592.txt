Sort of not answering your question, but the brms R package covers the multinomial model. E.g. like this brm(bf(y | trials(size) ~ 1, muy2 ~ x), data = mydata, family = multinomial(), prior = myprior) (see e.g. here ). The great thing - assuming you are happy with a Bayesian approach - is that you can then get predictions based on each MCMC sample. One of the reasons why this gets a lot easier in a Bayesian context is that if you have MCMC samples for some parameters, then to get MCMC samples for some transformation (including adding, subtracting, multiplying etc. the parameters) just requires you to calculate the transformation for each MCMC sample. Then, voil√†, you've got pseudo-random samples for the transformation. If you then want to predict for new data, you just draw pseudo-random samples from the outcome distribution for each of the samples from the combination of parameters. In short, what I'm suggesting is that reflecting uncertainties gets a lot easier, if you take a Bayesian approach. You don't need to derive any results about delta-methods etc., but of course this comes with the downside of people potentially criticizing your prior choices and MCMC sampling taking a bit longer than fitting a model using maximum likelihood.
