EF4 - Foreach local variable with static data

I'm using EF4. I've found a very annoying issue. I have a db view that I've dragged into my Entity Model class. When I try to iterate over the hole collection, the data displayed, it's almost the same that the first objects... I've tried enabling Lazy Loading, but nothing works.. it's a really simple snippet.. why doesn't work??? Dal.Entities context = new Dal.Entities(); list = context.vw_Full_Poll.ToList(); foreach (var item in list) { PrintPoll(htmlWriter, item); }
