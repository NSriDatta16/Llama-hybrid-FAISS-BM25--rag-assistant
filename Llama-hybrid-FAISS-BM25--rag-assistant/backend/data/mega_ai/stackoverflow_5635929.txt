I know it's horrible, not elegant and time consuming, but this query works: SELECT deviceId,deviceName,deviceDescription, (SELECT time_stamp FROM datalog WHERE datalog.DeviceId=devices.deviceId ORDER BY time_stamp DESC LIMIT 0,1) time_stamp, (SELECT FuelLevel FROM datalog WHERE datalog.DeviceId=devices.deviceId ORDER BY time_stamp DESC LIMIT 0,1) FuelLevel, (SELECT Voltage FROM datalog WHERE datalog.DeviceId=devices.deviceId ORDER BY time_stamp DESC LIMIT 0,1) Voltage FROM devices I tried to have a single subquery retrieving multiple columns, but MySql complains because it wants only one column.
