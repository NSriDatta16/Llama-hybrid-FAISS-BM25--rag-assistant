95% is very good, I'm not sure if improving that result would not alter the result in production: Keeping an error margin might be helpful to avoid overfitting, but it may not be your case. Nevertheless, here are some tips to improve your model even more: Apply the AdamW algorithm instead of SGD. AdamW is an optimizer that reduces the learning rate progressively with iterations. I've already improved models by 20% using this optimizer. https://www.fast.ai/posts/2018-07-02-adam-weight-decay.html Fine-tune your hyperparameters & structure thanks to a genetic algorithm. This solution requires a lot of patience, as it explores many different model configurations, but you will eventually reach better results. Therefore, you could rent a powerful GPU in a cloud for a few hours to do this task (=few dollars). https://sainivedh.medium.com/optimization-of-cnn-architecture-using-genetic-algorithm-for-image-classification-5c48f25dac9c
