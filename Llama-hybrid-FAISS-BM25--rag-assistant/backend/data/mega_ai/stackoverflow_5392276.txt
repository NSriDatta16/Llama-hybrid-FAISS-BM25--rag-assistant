RGB distance in the euclidean space is not very similar to "average human perception". You can use YUV color space, it takes into account this factor : | Y' | | 0.299 0.587 0.114 | | R | | U | = | -0.14713 -0.28886 0.436 | | G | | V | | 0.615 -0.51499 -0.10001 | | B | You can also use the CIE color space for this purpose. EDIT: I shall mention that YUV color space is an inexpensive approximation that can be computed via simple formulas. But it is not perceptually uniform. Perceptually uniform means that a change of the same amount in a color value should produce a change of about the same visual importance. If you need a more precise and rigourous metric you must definitely consider CIELAB color space or an another perceptually uniform space (even if there are no simple formulas for conversion).
