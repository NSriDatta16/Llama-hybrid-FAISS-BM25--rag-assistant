The summation indices should be from $\tau+1$ to $N$ , assuming 1-indexed series, and the cross-correlation matrix looks fine. At least in statsmodels library, which is a popular tool for time series workloads, there isn't any function to calculate a sample cross-correlation matrix with $\tau=[0,N-1]$ entries, which would be a 3D tensor.
