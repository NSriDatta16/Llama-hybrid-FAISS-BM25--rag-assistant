I'm not sure if you can catch it starting up, but you could try to look for the program in the list of windows (was it ENUM_WINDOWS? I can never remember) and shut it down as soon as it shows up. You could probably even do this in AutoIt! Drag out the Petzold and have some fun with windows... EDIT: Check out sysinternals for source on how to list the active processes - do this in a loop and you can catch your program when it starts. I don't think the official site still has the source though, but it's bound to be out there somewhere...
