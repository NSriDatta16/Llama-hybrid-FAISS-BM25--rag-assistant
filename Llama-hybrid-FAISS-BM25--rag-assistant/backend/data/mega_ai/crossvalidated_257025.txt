Connections between Logistic Regression and Linear Programming

This post Testing for Linear Separability with Linear Programming in R , discusses using linear programming to test if data is linear separable. What's the connection (if there are any) between LP formulation and logistic regression? This picture is coming from the link I posted Specifically, are the lines coming form linear programming as the same as the decision boundary in logistic regression? And why?
