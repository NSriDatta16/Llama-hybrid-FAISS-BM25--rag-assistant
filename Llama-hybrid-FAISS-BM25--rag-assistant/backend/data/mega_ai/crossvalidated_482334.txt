MCMC methods approximate the posterior by drawing samples from it. Using these samples, one can form an empirical approximation to the true posterior calculate certain statistics like posterior mean/variance/moments numerically calculate hard integrals and so on. So, finding the posterior might be seen a byproduct of what you really want to achieve via MCMC. Analytically, if you have the unnormalized version of a density, i.e. $p(x)=cq(x)$ where $c$ is unknown, integral calculations (moments) will include $c$ as well: $$\mathbb E[X]=\int xp(x)dx=c\int x q(x)dx$$ Even if you can easily evaluate $\int x q(x)dx$ , you still need to find $\int q(x)dx$ .
