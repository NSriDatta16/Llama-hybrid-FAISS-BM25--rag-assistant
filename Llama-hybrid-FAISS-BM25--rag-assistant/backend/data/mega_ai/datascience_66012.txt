The task is doable, but time consuming and not easy. This is how I would plan the work: Write a PDF scraper that navigates the document and converts all the informations it contains into some standardized textual format. Label the words/elements of this text that correspond to the informations that you are looking for ("lender name", "lending amount", "outstanding balance", etc.). Run some NLP model, such as an RNN classifier or CRF, to extract information from text. Steps 1 and 2 are very time consuming (2 more than 1), but it's certainly doable. It will be a lot of work, especially labeling observations to create the Training set, but a nice thing to put on your CV.
