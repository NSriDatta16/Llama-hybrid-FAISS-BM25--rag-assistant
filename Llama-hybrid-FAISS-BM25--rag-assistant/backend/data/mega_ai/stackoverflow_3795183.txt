If its always going to be a combination for retrieval. Then its better to form a single compound key using multiple keys. You can do this either Storing the key as a concatenated string of ints like (int1,int2,int3) => data Using a higher data type like uint64_t where in u can add individual values to form a key // Refer comment below for the approach
