Please Help Me Troubleshoot Why My Site Is Loading So Slowly

My website is http://secretpassagesbooks.com/ . It runs on the latest version of wordpress and is hosted via GoDaddy on a shared web server. My website takes at anywhere from ten seconds to one minute to load, and I don't understand why. I have tested in IE, FireFox, and Chrome, and the page speed is the same. I performed several speed tests at various online speed test sites and have an average load time of 5 - 6 seconds. Yet when I click on a link to my URL or enter it directly it takes in excess of 30 seconds (sometimes more than a minute) to load the index page. Here is what I have done so far to troubleshoot the issue: I have the YSlow and Page Speed extensions installed in Firebug Yslow test gives me a "Grade A -Overall performance score 90" My Page Speed a score is 94/100 I have the W3Cache wordpress plugin installed and am using page, browser, and database object caching I've tried minimizing as much CSS and JavaScript as possible The site is using HTTP compression Is there anything more I can do with this design, or is it case of my shared web server being overloaded? Thanks in advance for all your help.
