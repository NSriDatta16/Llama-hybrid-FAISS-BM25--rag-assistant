You approach - creating a private site and adding users to their respective sites - definitely works. Your users will not only get a document library with preview in the browser, but also all the other goodies that come with an Alfresco Share site e.g. a configurable dashboard with latest document updates etc. In the document library, you can also set permissions on folders so you can organize access control for different users at this level as well. If you're dealing with 100's of users / sites, a standard hosting server will do fine. If you're talking about 1000's of users / sites you will need more hardware to keep things fast. Alfresco supports webdav, this is ideal to manage files remotely without using the web client. Roeland
