Can anyone suggest disadvantages to production use of a database embedded in a servlet container?

Specifically, my team is considering embedding Apache Derby in Tomcat as part of a production deployment, with ease of deployment being the primary motivation. Can anyone suggest any significant disadvantages to this plan? The database will be accessed by two, or potentially three, web apps simultaneously. Initially, the highest number of entries in any one table is predicted to be around the 10,000 mark, though this may increase. Any advice appreciated.
