The Git support was added in CC.NET 1.5 according to the documentation. Since Thoughtworks seems to be having issues with their public CruiseControl.NET site I wanted to mention that full coverage about the "official" Git Source Control block can be found in the documentation that ships with the CruiseControl.NET installation: Locally on a default 64-bit Windows install: file:///C:/Program%20Files%20%28x86%29/CruiseControl.NET/webdashboard/doc/CCNET/Git%20Source%20Control%20Block.html On your remote build server: http://buildserver/ccnet/doc/CCNET/Git%20Source%20Control%20Block.html It seems like the official plugin has some added features about tagging and checking in files modified during the build.
