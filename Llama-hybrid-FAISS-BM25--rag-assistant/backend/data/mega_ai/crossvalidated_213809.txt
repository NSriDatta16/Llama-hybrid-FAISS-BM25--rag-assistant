There is a simple explanation which resolves the different answers which one gets from calculating expected waiting time for buses arriving per a Poisson Process with given mean interarrival time (in this case 15 minutes), whose interarrival times are therefore i.i.d. exponential with mean of 15 minutes. Method 1 ) Because Poisson Process (exponential) is memoryless, the expected wait time is 15 minutes. Method 2 ) You are equally likely to arrive at any time during the interarrival period in which you arrive. Therefore the expected waiting time is 1/2 of the expected length of this interarrival period. THIS IS CORRECT, and does not conflict with method (1). How can (1) and (2) both be correct? The answer is that the expected length of the interarrival period for the time at which you arrive is not 15 minutes. It is actually 30 minutes; and 1/2 of 30 minutes is 15 minutes, so (1) and (2) agree. Why does the interarrival period for the time at which you arrive not equal 15 minutes? It's because by first "fixing" an arrival time, the interarrival period it is in is more likely than average to be a long interarrival period. In the case of an exponential interarrival period, the math works outs so the interarrival period containing the time at which you arrive is an exponential with double the mean interarrival time for the Poisson Process. It is not obvious that the exact distribution for the interarrival time containing the time at which you arrive would be an exponential with doubled mean, but it is obvious, after explanation, why it is increased. As an easy to understand example, let's say that the interarrival times are 10 minutes with probability 1/2 or 20 minutes with probability 1/2. In this case, 20 minutes long interarrival periods are equally likely to occur as 10 minute long interarrival periods, but when they do occur, they last twice as long. So, 2/3 of the time points during the day will be at times at which the interarrival period is 20 minutes. Put another way, if we first pick a time and then want to know what the interarrival time containing that time is, then (ignoring transient effects at the beginning of the "day") the expected length of that interarrival time is 16 1/3. But if we first pick the interarrival time and want to know what its expected length is, it is 15 minutes. There are other variants of the renewal paradox, length-biased sampling, etc., amounting to pretty much the same thing. Example 1) You have a bunch of light bulbs, with random lifetimes, but average of 1000 hours. When a light bulb fails, it is immediately replaced by another light bulb. If you pick a time to go in a room having the light bulb, the light bulb in operation then will wind up having a longer mean lifetime than 1000 hours. Example 2) If we go to a construction site at a given time, then the mean time until a construction worker who is working there at that time falls off the building (from when they first started working) is greater than the mean time until worker falls off (from when they first started working) from among all workers who start working. Why, because the workers with a short mean time until falling off are more likely than average to have already fallen off (and not continued working), so that the workers who are working then have longer than average times until falling off. Example 3) Pick some modest number of people at random in a city and if they have attended the home games (not all sell outs) of the city's Major League baseball team, find out how many people attended the games they were at. Then (under some slightly idealized but not too unreasonable assumptions), the average attendance for those games will be higher than the average attendance for all the team's home games. Why? Because there are more people who have attended high attendance games than low attendance games, so you are more likely to pick people who have attended high attendance games than low attendance games.
