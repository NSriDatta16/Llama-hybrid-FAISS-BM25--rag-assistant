I think $X, Y, Z, W$ should all be interpreted as random variables, and " $YW$ " is not the product of $Y$ and $W$ , but the random vector $(Y, W)$ . Therefore, the expression means: \begin{align} (X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} (Y, W)|Z)_P \implies (X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y|Z)_P, \end{align} i.e., if $X$ and $(Y, W)$ are conditionally independent given $Z$ , then $X$ and $Y$ are conditionally independent given $Z$ . This interpretation is supported by the following statement which appears in the second paragraph after the expression: The decomposition axiom asserts that if two combined items of information are judged irrelevant to $X$ , then each separate item is irrelevant as well. The mathematical proof for this property should also be straightforward: $(X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} (Y, W)|Z)_P$ means that for any $A_1 \in \sigma(X), A_2 \in \sigma(Y, W)$ , it holds that (see this thread for a rigorous definition of conditional independence): \begin{align} P(A_1A_2|\sigma(Z)) = P(A_1|\sigma(Z))P(A_2|\sigma(Z)). \tag{1} \end{align} Since $\sigma(Y) \subset \sigma(Y, W)$ , $(1)$ holds for any $A_2 \in \sigma(Y)$ , hence $(X \mathrel{\unicode{x2AEB}} Y | Z)_P$ .
