MissMDA Bayesian MIPCA help/MIFAMD

While looking into methods relating to principal components related imputation, I came across MissMDA package in R. Could anyone please tell me what the Bayes in the MIPCA means in layman terms? I have some trouble understanding the paper as I am rather weak in grasping math/statistical concepts (I am still learning)... In addition, something interesting I found - MIPCA is dedicated to only continuous variables and that excludes encoded categorical variables. Hoping that this finding will help someone who faces the same confusion as I had initially about the package. It is recommended to use MIFAMD instead because its designed for mixed data.
