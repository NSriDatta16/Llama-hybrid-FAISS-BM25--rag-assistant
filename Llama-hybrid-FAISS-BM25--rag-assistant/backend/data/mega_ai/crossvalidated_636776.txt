The component $\eta_t$ is not " a " "deterministic" time series. It will be a time series such that it will be covariance-stationary (at least) itself. Here the terminology "deterministic" (a terminology issue, once more), should better be " conditionally deterministic ", because what it aims to convey is that $\eta_t$ is perfectly predictable given the past values of the whole process . It does not mean "deterministic" as in "a deterministic rule/function to generate it". While a covariance stationary process could conceivably be broken into two non-stationary ones, where together the one would "cancel out" the non-stationarity of the other, it could not be decomposed into one stationary and one non-stationary component.
