Both analyses (non-linear regression and binomial GLM) have their advantages and disadvantages. They will produce quite similar LD50s if the data aren't variable but can produce wildly different results if the data are quite variable or if the bottom of the curve is not found (e.g. 100% lethality in the highest treatment). I'd recommend trying both to see what makes the most sense with your data. Personally I find nonlinear regression gives a more realistic fit of the data given the experiment is a controlled lab-based assay, and therefore can better meet some of the requirements such as normality of residuals, homogeneity of variances, minimal deviation from the model (i.e run/replicate tests), reasonably balanced sample units. Usually at least 5 treatments levels are needed for model convergence. Appropriate constraints are also needed. In addition to the drc package, a very easy to use program is Graphpad Prism which requires no coding. I'd recommend using it's free online Help-section to better understand non-linear regression. On the other hand, binomial GLMs (logistic regressions) need to meet fewer criteria and may be stronger for an unbalanced designs and smaller sample sizes, utilising the underlying probability distribution (the binomial) to inform estimates. Random variation, which is common in biological data, can also be incorporated using a binomial GLMM. Also they also don't need artificial constraints like non-linear regression often do. Hope this helps.
