What's on your C++ cheatsheet?

Every so often, I'll have to switch between languages for the majority of the code I write (whether for work or for play). I find that C++ is one of those languages that requires a lot of mental cache space, so if I take a long break from it, then I forget a lot of the details. Even things like adding items to an STL container or using the static storage keyword in various contexts get all jumbled up ("is it add , append , push ...oh, it's push_back "). So what essential tidbits do you like to have loaded into your brain when you're writing C++? Edit: I should say, I'd like to be able to bookmark this page and use it as my cheatsheet :)
