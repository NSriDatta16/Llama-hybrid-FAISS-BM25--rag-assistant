406 error on firebug only

Im using a script from this guy A. Valums http://valums.com/ajax-upload/ Everything is fine until the file has finished uploading and i get a 406 error on the firebug(ONLY). when i right click the link on firebug and open in new window, the file does exist and does what i expect it to do. the page on firebug says Not Acceptable An appropriate representation of the requested resource upload.php could not be found on this server. Additionally, a 404 Not Found error was encountered while trying to use an ErrorDocument to handle the request. but when i see the page on a new tab it works fine and returns the right thing, that script on A. Valums has ajax requests btw UPDATE Host www.example.com User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-GB; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101203 Firefox/3.6.13 Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language en-gb,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive Content-Type application/octet-stream Referer http://www.example.com Content-Length 192378 Cookie
