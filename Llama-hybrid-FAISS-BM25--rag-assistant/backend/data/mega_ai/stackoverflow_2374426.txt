LINQ to XML - Load XML fragments from file

I have source XMLfiles that come in with multiple root elements and there is nothing I can do about it. What would be the best way to load these fragments into an XDocument with a single root node that I can create to have a valid XML document? Sample: Should be something like: Thanks!
