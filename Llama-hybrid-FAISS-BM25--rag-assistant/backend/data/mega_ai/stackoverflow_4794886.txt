Why BizTalk? I think there are better solutions out there that would be cheaper, as well as less resource intensive. My understanding is that BizTalk requires many adapters as well as a deep understanding of the .NET framework. You could just as easily invest in a very slick drag/drop universal mapper from a company like Liaison (see their Delta and ECS products), and take a more "rapid development" approach. When I think about EDI software, BizTalk is usually an afterthought. Companies like Liaison (formerly Softshare), Sterling Commerce, Extol, Inovis/GXS, Tie Commerce, SPS (for managed hosting) come to the forefront. If you already have (purchased) BizTalk in house, then it makes sense to go down that path. I would recommend if you're going to look at a lot of EDI data, that you download EDI Notepad. It is a free application that is for editing / reviewing EDI data. It can be found here: http://liaison.com/products/integrate/edi-notepad Keep in mind that EDI follows a "standard". The quotes are there for sarcasm. You will find your partners will take liberties with the standards. While some might consider EDI "easy", please be aware there are a lot of potential minefields with this type of integration.
