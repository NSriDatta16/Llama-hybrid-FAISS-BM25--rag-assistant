How can I schedule a daily backup with SQL Server Express?

I'm running a small web application with SQL server express (2005) as backend. I can create a backup with a SQL script, however, I'd like to schedule this on a daily basis. As extra option (should-have) I'd like to keep only the last X backups (for space-saving reasons obviously) Any pointers? [edit] SQL server agent is unavailable in SQL server express...
