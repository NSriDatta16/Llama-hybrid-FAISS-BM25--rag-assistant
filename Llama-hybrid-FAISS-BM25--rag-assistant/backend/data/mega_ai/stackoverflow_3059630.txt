Construct MediaStore URI for specific folder

For example if a have two directories /sdcard/Music/Music-1 and /sdcard/Music/Music-2 how can I construct a URI to get the files in Music-1 dir for example. I can use MediaStore.Audio.Media.EXTERNAL_CONTENT_URI to get the content of all external storage but how to do the trick only for specific dir.
