How can you define below average, average and above average according to percentile rank?

A particular school evaluation lists abilities by percentile rank against the abilities of a population, and each ranking/ability is then given a group ranking of "Below Average", "Average", or "Above Average". Oddly, the "Average" group ranges from 16% to 84%, so a 16% in reading comprehension and an 84% in reading speed both receive an "average" for each ability, which strips the labels of almost all meaning. Ignoring the obvious observation that all points above/below the average are "above/below average", how might one define, say, "poor, average, and excellent" or even "poor, fair, average, good and excellent" according to their percentile ranks, as measured against the population of students considered? This is not merely an academic question, but impacts how we advocate for our child's future schooling. Thank you.
