One memory location in a computer stores how much data?

Assume 32 Bit OS. One memory location in a computer stores how much data? Whats the basic unit of memory storage in a computer? For Example to a store a integer what will be the memory addresses required? If basic unit is BYTE the integer requires 4 bytes. So if I need to store a byte then if start putting in the 1st byte in memory location 0001 then will my integer end at 0003 memory location? Please correct me if am wrong?
