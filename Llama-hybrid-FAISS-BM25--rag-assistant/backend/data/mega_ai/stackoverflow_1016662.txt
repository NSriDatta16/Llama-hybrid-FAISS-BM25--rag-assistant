It seems that Dan and I have been puzzled in the same issue on the same days, and we get the same solution! I'm using XML-RPC and the Magento API. I wrote this code as a part of a bigger class that read the image data from a file and makes it compatible with Magento API. internal void readFromFile(string fullImpgPath) { m_file.content = System.Convert.ToBase64String(System.IO.File.ReadAllBytes(fullImpgPath)); string ext = System.IO.Path.GetExtension(fullImpgPath).ToLower(); switch (ext) { case ".gif": m_file.mime = "image/gif"; break; case ".jpg": case ".jpeg": m_file.mime = "image/jpeg"; break; case ".png": m_file.mime = "image/png"; break; case ".bmp": m_file.mime = "image/bmp"; break; case ".tif": case ".tiff": m_file.mime = "image/tiff"; break; default: m_file.mime = "application/octet-stream"; break; } } The very important thing is that the "content" must be of type string and must be obtained from bytes[] through the call of the system function Convert.ToBase64String(...) . Concerning the MIME type of the image, only "gif", "jpg" and "png" are supported as I discovered looking inside the Magento API code.
