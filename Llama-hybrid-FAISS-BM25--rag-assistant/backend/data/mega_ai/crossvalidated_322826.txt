You have three parameters in your problem, so $\theta = (\beta_0, \beta_1, \sigma^2)$ . $I(\theta)$ is a matrix and you cannot "divide by" $I(\theta)$ , as in the formula in your second paragraph. What you need instead is to take the inverse of $I(\theta)$ . If you are looking for the confidence interval e.g. of $\beta_1$ , you would take the element $[2,2]$ of $I(\theta)^{-1}$ . and plug it in place of $1/I(\theta)$ in your formula. You would have then $$CI_{\beta_1} = \hat\beta_1 \pm 1.96\sqrt{{I(\theta)^{22}}}$$ where $I(\theta)^{22}$ denotes the element $[2,2]$ of $I(\theta)^{-1}$ .
