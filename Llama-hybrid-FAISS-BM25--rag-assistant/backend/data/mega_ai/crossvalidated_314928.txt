In absence of cointegration, running a VAR in levels is not justifiable, because the dependent variables diverge from any possible combination of the regressors (unless in each equation of the model, only the own-lag is present, e.g. $x_{1,t}=a_{11}x_{1,t-1}+\varepsilon_{1,t},\dots,x_{k,t}=a_{k1}x_{k,t-1}+\varepsilon_{k,t}$ , but that is a very special case). Under cointegration, evidence is mixed as to whether VECMs yield better forecasts than unrestricted VAR models, especially for short forecast horizons; see e.g. Engle and Yoo (1987), Hoffman and Rasche (1996), Löf and Franses (2001), and Chigira and Yamamoto (2009); in the meantime, Christoffersen and Diebold (1998) find that imposing cointegration does improve forecasting results in long horizons. There, VECMs do better than VARs in levels, because over longer periods, the effects of error correction due to cointegration are sufficiently strong to warrant modelling the error correction mechanism explicitly (as done in VECMs). See this answer by @Matifou for several of the same references. References: CHIGIRA, H. & YAMAMOTO, T. 2009. Forecasting in large cointegrated processes. Journal of Forecasting, 28, 631-650.
