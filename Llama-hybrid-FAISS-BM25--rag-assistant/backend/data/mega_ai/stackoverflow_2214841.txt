I don't think it does anything. It has the same URL Alex posted , so I'm not going to repeat it here. When I tried retrieving it with curl with a user agent header of IE6, logging headers to a file, I got these headers: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Server: nginx Date: Sat, 06 Feb 2010 21:37:13 GMT Content-Type: text/javascript Connection: close X-Powered-By: PHP/5.1.6 Expires: 0 Pragma: no-cache Cache-Control: no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Cache-Control: private Content-Length: 2 Additionally, the content of the file seemed to be just a CRLF. Nothing very special. I don't know why they put it there, but perhaps there used to be something malicious, but now there isn't... or they're just waiting for some time to put some malicious code there.
