Why does the survival probability of the survival package return 0% at the end of the time horizon when there are survivors in the dataset?

I've just started using the survival and survminer packages in R and am trying to understand its output. In the code below I create a dataframe with the first 12 rows of my actual dataset, as representative of the issue/question. In this representative data: ID = unique identifier for each element time = survival time for the element in months where value > 0 means death (the month that death occurs) and value = 0 means no death (right censored) during the study period status = the element's censoring status where 1=censored and 2=dead node = one of the variables associated with each element where I try to assess its association with the probability of death Running length(which(testDF$status == 2))/nrow(testDF ) shows a death rate of 66.67% with this data, but the survival probability curves shown in the image below end at 0%. Should they not be ending at 66.67% at least for the average of all the data? What am I doing wrong here or am I misinterpreting survival probability? Code: library(ggplot2) library(survival) library(survminer) testDF Modifying the OP above to reflect accepted solution: Revised dataframe to reflect paulduf solution to correctly represent censored data (in my data, no deaths within the 40 month study is "censored"), with commented revised graphic beneath: testDF $status == 0))/nrow(testDF) length(which(testDF$ status == 0 & testDF $node == "A"))/length(which(testDF$ node == "A")) length(which(testDF $status == 0 & testDF$ node == "B"))/length(which(testDF $node == "B")) length(which(testDF$ status == 0 & testDF $node == "C"))/length(which(testDF$ node == "C")) In the plot confidence intervals are removed for enhanced clarity:
