How can i do Error Handling in a MVC/MVVM Windows Form app

i'm building an application using a pattern similar to the MVC. The situation is the next: in the context of the model making changes to the associated repository. If the change throw an exception what is the correct way to present the information about the error to the user? In the previous version of my program when i have spaguetti code organization (model, view, controller overlaped), launching a messagebox telling the user about the error wasn't weird because i was doing almost everything from the views. Now in this new version i want to do the things correctly, so i guess that is bad doing anything that has a visual representation in the model layer. Some time ago i ask what is the correct way to capture exceptions. The specific point i was refering was to scale up exceptions from an inner code to an upper layer vs capture them in the most upper layer. Almost all the response were that isnt a good approach scale exceptions(capture and throwing again to be captured by a responsable entity), and is better to capture in the most upper layer. So i have this conflict in my head. I was thinking that is inevitable to maintain the separation of concerns to scale up, but that is in conflict with those previous advices. How can i proceed?
