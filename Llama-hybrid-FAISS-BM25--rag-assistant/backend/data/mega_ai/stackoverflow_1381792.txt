If PagTeste2.xaml is at the top-level folder of your project you can load it using this code: Application.LoadComponent( this, new System.Uri( "/SLBookDemoApp;component/PagTeste2.xaml", System.UriKind.Relative ) ); If you have placed PagTeste2.xaml in a subfolder inside your project (say folder Tests ) you need to include the path to the file in the uri: Application.LoadComponent( this, new System.Uri( "/SLBookDemoApp;component/Tests/PagTeste2.xaml", System.UriKind.Relative ) ); Also, pay close attention to spelling. PagTest2.xaml is different from PageTeste2.xaml and PageTest2.xaml . Apparently Test is inserted before the e in Page . You can read more about pack URI's on MSDN .
