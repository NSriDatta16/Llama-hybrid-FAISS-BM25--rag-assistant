Most effective way to learn time series with poor quant background

End goal will be practical application (model building) by using time series analysis to analyze/forecast macroeconomic/finance data. Background: I have taken stats, introductory econometrics, intermediate macro, micro in the past couple years, but is has been 10 years since I took my only calculus course. I'm confused whether I should (a) go do all the required math, (b) just find a math econ refresher course, then to read a book focused on theory or (c) just try to build models. I realize I'm starting from a low base, but I'm hoping to become reasonably proficient in a year (unless this is unrealistic?). Thanks in advance for your help.
