Should i pick this as a career?

I'm mainly interested in creative things, but also interested in the science behind viewership and marketing a piece of media. Think about having a stable career in data science, where do you think I should begin? Are media analytics as big as others like business intelligence? Ive checked online courses, like google analytics academy and others like these: https://www.edx.org/xseries/data-science-analytics-context https://www.coursera.org/specializations/jhudatascience Is this the right path to take? And is it easy to find jobs in such a field even if the person is a beginner in programming?
