Several great answers on here, in particular, @damienfrancois's answer very succinctly captures the general idea. However, I don't see any examples of feature engineering for relational or time-series data. In that case, data scientists generally extract statistical patterns across relationships and over time. For instance, in order to predict what customers will by in the future in an ecommerce database, one might extract quantities like the average historical purchase amount, or the frequency of prior purchases. I wrote a piece on this topic that goes into much more detail with several examples here: https://www.featurelabs.com/blog/feature-engineering-vs-feature-selection/
