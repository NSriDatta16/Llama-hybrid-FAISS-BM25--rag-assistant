First, I agree with Eduardo Leoni's comment that we need a reproducible example, so that we have “real” code to work with. My blind guess would be that, because in R you can abbreviate parameters, g is not correctly resolved between “your” g and an abbreviated gradtol from the nlm function. On the other hand, if I try your code fragments, nlm proceeds with calling log.pr.data and fails only at the second print statement because T.chan isn't known. So sadly, without a working (i.e. failing reproducibly) example, it's difficult to find out what's wrong.
