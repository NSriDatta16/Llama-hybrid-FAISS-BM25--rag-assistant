When you define a primary key, the database creates an index based on that key. It needs to be unique. In general you can create an index that to speed up access to data based on non-unique query data. The indexed retrieval time for a uniquely keyed data should be better than for non-uniquely keyed indexes, so I try to use unique indexes where possible.
