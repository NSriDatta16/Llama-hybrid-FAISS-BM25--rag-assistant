In machine learning paradigm, model refers to a mathematical expression of model parameters along with input place holders for each prediction, class and action for regression, classification and reinforcement categories respectively. This expression is embedded in the single neuron as a model. For single layer perceptron and deep learning model, one needs to extract this model by carefully walking the neurons and layers to collect and stitch activation function in an ordered fashion.
