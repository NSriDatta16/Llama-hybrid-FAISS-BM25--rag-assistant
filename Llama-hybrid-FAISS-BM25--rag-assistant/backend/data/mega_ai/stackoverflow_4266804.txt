If ErrorListener is not set, the error/warning message will go to System.err , so it is useful to redirect error messages. It is up to application to decide should it continue transformation, if an error/warning occured. If the appropriate method in ErrorListener throws an exception, the transformation will exit with TransformerException . On fatalError transformation will be stopped, even if ErrorListener::fatalError doesn't throw an exception. Update Summary TransformerException is thrown, when a fatal error occurs, and this doesn't depend on ErrorListener or whether it is set or not. TransformerException is thrown, when a recoverable error or a warning occurs, the ErrorListener is set, and the corresponding method ( error or warning ) has thrown an exception. So the application can decide what to do on rec. errors and warnings.
