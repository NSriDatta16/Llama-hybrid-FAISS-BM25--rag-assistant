The good way to check whether features are descriptive or not is to try train some classifier(svm/bayes/tree/whatever) upon them and check it cross-validated precision/recall etc. You also can filter your feature vector by feature selector like Chi/infogain. Other than PCA, you can visualize your data with SOM, or by clustering.
