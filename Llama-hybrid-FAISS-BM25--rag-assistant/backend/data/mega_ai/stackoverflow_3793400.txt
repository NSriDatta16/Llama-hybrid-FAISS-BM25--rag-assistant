Is there a function in java to get moving average

I have a situation where I need to process 5000 samples from a device in every 0.5 sec. Lets say the window size is 100, then there would be 50 points resulting from the moving average. I am trying with conventional method, i.e. with loops. But this is a very inefficient way to do it. Any suggestions ?
