Most of the answers given so far refer to "Supervised Learning" (i.e. where you have labels for a portion of your dataset, that you can use to train algorithms). The question specifically mentioned clustering, which is an "Unsupervised" approach (i.e. no labels are known beforehand). In this scenario I'd suggest looking at: k-means and kernel k-means Agglomerative Clustering Non-negative Matrix Factorisation Latent Dirichlet Allocation Dirichlet Processes and Hierarchical Dirichlet Processes But actually you'll probably find that your similarity/distance measure is more important than the specific algorithm you use. If you have some labelled data, then "Semi-Supervised Learning" approaches are gaining popularity and can be very powerful. A good starting point for SSL is the LapSVM (Laplacian Support Vector Machine).
