What machine learning techniques can, once trained, generate prediction despite some missing inputs?

I have a training set where the inputs & outputs are all present, but I suspect that in the data where I want to do prediction, I will occasionally encounter scenarios where a small fraction of the input features are missing. Are there any machine learning methods that, once learning is complete, can provide reasonable prediction amidst missing inputs like this? If it matters, I'm looking for real-valued predictions (ideally multivariate, as I have 2 outputs to predict per input set).
