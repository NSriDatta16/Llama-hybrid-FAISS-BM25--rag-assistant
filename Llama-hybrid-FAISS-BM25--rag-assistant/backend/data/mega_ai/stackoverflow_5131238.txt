I'm not sure how easy it will be to do as a Fragment. I have frequently extended FormComponentPanel and treated it like a WebmarkupContainer by overriding onComponentTagBody like so: public class CustomFormComponentPanel extends FormComponentPanel { public CustomFormComponentPanel(String id) { super(id); // Various Form Items } @Override protected void onComponentTagBody(final MarkupStream markupStream, final ComponentTag openTag) { // Render as a WebMarkupContainer, not a panel super.renderComponentTagBody(markupStream, openTag); } } I can then just add my FormComponentPanel like so: add(new CustomFormComponentPanel("custom")); with this markup Fragment's onComponentTagBody() calls a lot of private methods in the Fragment class that I presume you would have to duplicate. For a one-off, use my method above. If you really need to re-use it, I'd go with a Panel as originally intended.
