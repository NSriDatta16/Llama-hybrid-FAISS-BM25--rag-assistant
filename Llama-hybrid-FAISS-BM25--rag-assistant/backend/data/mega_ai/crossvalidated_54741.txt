Equation for a logit link function for a series of events

I have modeled some data using generalized linear modeling with a binomial distribution and logit link function. However, my data is not dichotomous, it is actually a series of events. I have fixed the number of trials at 20 (because there were 20 trials) so it is not a binary outcome (i.e., logistic regression). I believe the logit link function looks like this: exp(X * beta)/[1 + exp(X * beta)] or In(natural log) (probability of the event happening/ 1 - the probability of the event not happening). I am trying to do something on excel so I need the actual equation for the link function I used but because this is not a traditional logit I am a bit confused. Can someone tell me based on this what the equation would be in a form I could use? In other words, what does the logit link function equation look like when instead of a binary DV it is viewed as some number of events, for a fixed amount of trials (20 in my case)? Thank you!
