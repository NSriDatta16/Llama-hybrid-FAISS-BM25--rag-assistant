References with mathematical formulation of the learning problem with neural networks

I'm a novice at using neural networks. I've developed a good solution for a problem using a neural network that has two branches: a feed-forward network and a bi-LSTM, that receives different kinds of inputs. After, the outputs of these two branches are concatenated in a block of layers. I'm writing a paper for presenting our solution. However, I don't know how to formulate in a mathematical way the learning problem in the context of our architecture. I'm looking for references that explain how can I do that. Best regards.
