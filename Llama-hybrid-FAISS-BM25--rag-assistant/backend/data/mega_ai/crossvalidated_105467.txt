As the other answers explain, dummy coding works in logistic regression. This would only necessitate 19 dummy variables in your case. Dummy coding is effective for nominal data but suboptimal for ordinal data. Penalized regression is preferable for predictive modeling; it reduces overfitting by smoothing differences in slope coefficients for dummy variables corresponding to adjacent ranks. See Gertheiss and Tutz (2009) for an overview of penalized regression for ordinal predictors; section 6 covers applications in logistic regression. I've discussed penalized regression in other contexts here: Effect of two demographic IVs on survey answers (Likert scale) Continuous dependent variable with ordinal independent variable Reference Gertheiss, J., & Tutz, G.
