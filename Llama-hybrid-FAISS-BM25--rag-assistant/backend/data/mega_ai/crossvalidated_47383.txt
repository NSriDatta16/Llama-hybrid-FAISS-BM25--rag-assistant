Logarithmic regression of form $y=a+b \log(x_1)+c\log(x_2)$ using R

How can I fit a logarithmic regression equation of form $y=a+b (\log (x_1)) + c(\log(x_2))$ on a data set using R? Here the main concern is that data contain zeros multiple times, so R will give infinity in the output. I have tried adding some constant to the $x$ variables, such as log(x1+0.00001) to avoid Inf but Is there any specific way to calculate this constant so that results are not affected? https://dl.dropbox.com/u/53624395/11.csv : LINK FOR DATA FILE ON WHICH I WANT TO PERFORM THE OPERATION.This is time series data and i have to perform logarithmic regression of form y=a+b(logx1)+c(logx2). and find a,b,c and then check is there any such type of relation exists or not.
