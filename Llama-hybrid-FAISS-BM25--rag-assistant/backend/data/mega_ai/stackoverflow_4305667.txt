Determine when all init functions have completed?

We have a JavaScript/JQuery page with a number of "initialization functions" a la: $(function(){ //Do stuff } Is there a programmatic way you can determine when all these methods have completed running? We could set a boolean variable to true in the last function()... was wondering if there was a more elegant way. ??
