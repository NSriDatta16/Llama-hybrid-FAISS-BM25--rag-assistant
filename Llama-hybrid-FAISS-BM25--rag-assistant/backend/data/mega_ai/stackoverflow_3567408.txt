If I understand what your looking to do, this should work, did not test the syntax... based on your comment maybe your looking for: Select a.*,sum(quota_payment) as sum_quota_payment, sum(total_deductions) as sum_total_deductions, sum(net_cheque_or_direct_deposit) as sum_net_cheque, sum(interim_payment) as sum_interim_payment, sum(final_payment) as sum_final_payment from (SELECT patron_name, producer.federal_number, hst_number, average_bf_test, (SELECT MAX(s.statement_number) FROM statement s) AS statement_number, (SELECT MAX(s.period_ending) FROM statement s) AS period_ending FROM producer JOIN producer_details ON producer.federal_number = producer_details.federal_number JOIN statement ON producer.patron_number = statement.patron_number WHERE producer.patron_number = @PatronNo) a left join payment ON a.statement_number = payment.statement_number
