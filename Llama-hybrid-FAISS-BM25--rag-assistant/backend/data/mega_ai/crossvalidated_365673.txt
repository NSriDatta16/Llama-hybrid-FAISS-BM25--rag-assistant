Developing algortihm/model to identify thin linear features in aerial imagery

I am exploring the possibility of identifying fencelines from NAIP aerial imagery (GSD = 0.6m). I have tried some basic processing in OpenCV using canny edge detection that was detailed in a question to the OpenCV forum . Here's what time imagery looks like. The right shows the fenceline mask. The next approach seems to be to try a CNN. I'm thinking I'll try implementing the unet architecture. I'm looking for suggestions, including alternative approaches, as well as comments on whether this is a fool's errand. For training, my initial plan is to convert my vector line features into a 2-pixel wide raster mask. Thoughts? For clarity: Does implementing the unet architecture seem like a good first step to approach this problem? Is my masking approach reasonable?
