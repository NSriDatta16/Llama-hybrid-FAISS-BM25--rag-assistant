C++ redefinition due to including header files multiple times

As, the title says. I'm encountering redefinition errors due to including header files multiple times. I know its because of that, but I don't know how to resolve. Yes, I previously posted the same problem in SO an hour ahead. But I wasn't able to explain properly (I think so) and didn't get answers expected. Here is the link: C++ Redefinition Header Files I'm not editing that question since it has been filled up :). Okay I have some classes and the structure of them is like this: main.cpp: #include "Server.h" #include "Handler.h" #include "Processor.h" int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { } Server.h: // Server.h #pragma once #include Handler.h: // Handler.h #pragma once #include #include #include "Server.h" Processor.cpp: // Processor.cpp #include "StdAfx.h" #include "Processor.h" #include "Handler.h" Server.cpp: // Server.cpp #include "Server.h" #include "Processor.h" The problem is that is included multiple times, don't know where but it is. #pragma once serves the same purpose as #ifndef SOME_FILE_H #define SOME_FILE_H // code here #endif // SOME_FILE_H in my compiler (MSVC2008 in this case). So I'm pretty much sure I don't need the header include guards. But can you spot where I'm doing the mistake by which is included twice and how may I resolve? Thanks
