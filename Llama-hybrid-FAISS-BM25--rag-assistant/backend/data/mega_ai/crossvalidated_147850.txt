Are pooling layers added before or after dropout layers?

I'm creating a convolutional neural network (CNN), where I have a convolutional layer followed by a pooling layer and I want to apply dropout to reduce overfitting. I have this feeling that the dropout layer should be applied after the pooling layer, but I don't really have anything to back that up. Where is the right place to add the dropout layer? Before or after the pooling layer?
