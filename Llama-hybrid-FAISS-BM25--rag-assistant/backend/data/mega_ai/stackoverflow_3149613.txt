For Java 5 and later this can be done using Java agents. For earlier versions - including 1.1.8 - you must load native agents to do this. If you cannot instrument your code, you must do the work needed yourself. One approach to get most of the way is to use a Java 1.1 compatible version of log4j which allows you to essentially write out strings prepended with a timestamp. This can then be massaged afterwards into extracting answers to whatever you want to know.
