Run shell script via PHP

Is there a way to run the following script via PHP http://www.magentoadvisor.com/magento-backup/tutorial-magento-backup-scripts-part-2/ I have tried to use exec, shell_exec, system but none of them are working. They do work when I try exec('whois domain.com') though so it must be something I am doing wrong!! If this is not possible does anyone know of a good way of backuping up Magento via PHP, unfortuantely I don't have SSH access. Thanks UPDATE This is the code I am trying to use system('magento-backup-script.bin -date', $output); var_dump($output); Output: int(127) Php safe mode is off UPDATE: I managed to get i working by copy the script into the PHP file and use the tactics operator to run the command. Thanks for all your help everyone
