Mathematical explanation how Random Forest works

I would need to carefully understand the mathematical background behind the RF prediction. I am not sure if this is the right website to post this question, but I will take the chance. Namely, I am not sure how to express this in mathematical terms how RF predict. Let's say we have a RF with three trees resulting with predictions and the classification task. T1: 1 0 0 1 0 T2: 1 0 1 1 0 T3: 0 1 1 1 1 ------------- R : 1 0 1 1 0 Note how the end result is what is more close to the average value. How would you define this mathematically?
