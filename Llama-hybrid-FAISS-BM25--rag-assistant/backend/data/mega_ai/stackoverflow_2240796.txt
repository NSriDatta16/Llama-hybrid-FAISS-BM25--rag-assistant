JSF 1.1 and MyFaces Tomahawk 1.1.9

I am trying to use the calendar component from Myfaces Tomahawk. I am running JSF 1.1 with Tomahawk 1.1.9 and Websphere 6.1. Looks like JSF1.1 and Tomahawk 1.1.9 are not compatible as the following code does not work - When access this jsp page thru IE 7, it throws some javascript problem like popupcalender not defined. I found that java scripts are added in the rendered HTML page, but no idea why this problem ? Any idea which version of Tomahawk should I use with JSF 1.1 ? EDIT: I already have Extension Filter configured in the web.xml file. Something like this - MyFacesExtensionsFilter org.apache.myfaces.webapp.filter.ExtensionsFilter MyFacesExtensionsFilter Faces Servlet MyFacesExtensionsFilter /faces/myFacesExtensionResource/*
