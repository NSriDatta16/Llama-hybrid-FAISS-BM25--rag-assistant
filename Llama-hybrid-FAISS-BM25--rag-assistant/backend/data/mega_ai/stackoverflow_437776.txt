You shouldn't really be adding anything that does anything but provide styling to your theme, if you want to keep database loading low. (Of course, I mean other than the default data retrieval functionality found in pretty much all themes.) The only parts of your theme that should really be doing any significant querying are: The regular bits and bobs in the loop (for the main blog page and archive pages) The comment retrieval (for single-view posts) The sidebar (presuming you're going for a widget-enabled sidebar) I'd suggest leavingextra functionality (and, therefore, extra DB queries) to plugins - a theme should focus purely on aesthetics.
