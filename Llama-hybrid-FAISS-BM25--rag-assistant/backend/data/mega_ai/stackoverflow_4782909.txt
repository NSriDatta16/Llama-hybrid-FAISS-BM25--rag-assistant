You can try to use Cobertura , it creates nice reports, and is easy to use in conjunction with junit, using ant or maven. A great tool for reporting is Sonar , which integrates coverage tests, but also tools like checkstyle, findbugs, and provides a nice interface to analyse the outputs. It is also very easy to setup, definitively worth trying.
