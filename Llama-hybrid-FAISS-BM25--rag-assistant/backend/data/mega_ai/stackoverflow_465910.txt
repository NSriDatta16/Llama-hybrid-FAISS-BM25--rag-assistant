ASP.Net: Authentication via Browser's Login Window

I have what appears to be a fairly common scenario: I have a database that contains a list of users/passwords, and ideally, when someone visits the site, I'd like to use their windows name (internal), otherwise whatever name the user provided (external). My main question is how do I send a response to the browser forcing it to prompt for their username/password for external users (like when you visit a page that uses windows authentication)? Has anyone done this before? My main goal is to avoid creating a login screen, and just use what the browser has built in. Is there a way I can leverage the built in forms authentication to do this? Thanks! *Update: I found something similar to what I was looking for here: http://blog.codeville.net/2008/08/25/using-the-browsers-native-login-prompt/
