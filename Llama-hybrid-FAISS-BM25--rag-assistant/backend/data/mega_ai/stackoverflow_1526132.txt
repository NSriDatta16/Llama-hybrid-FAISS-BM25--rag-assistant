Not that this excuses it, but one reason developers may copy and paste code is that they don't understand the code that they're working with. For example, if you hire a C# or Java developer, and put him on a Fortran system and tell him to get work accomplished, he is going to copy and paste throughout that system due to lack of understanding. In addition that that, quality of code can play a part in this. I know of one particular system that was not allowed to be refactored, but new changes had to be introduced. The developers had to do what they had to do to get the task done in a timely manner. Of course, both of these scenarios don't excuse copy and paste coding, but it's worth a look inside the organization to understand why this may happen.
