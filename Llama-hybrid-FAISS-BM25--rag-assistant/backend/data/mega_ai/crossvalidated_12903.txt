Sarah, Take your 36 numbers (12 values per cycle ; 3 cycles ) and construct a regression model with 11 indicators reflecting possible week-of-the-semester effect and then identify any necessary Intervention Series ( Pulses, Level Shifts ) necessary to render the mean of the residuals to be 0.0 everywhere or at least not statistically significantly different from 0.0. For example if you identify a level shift at period 13 this might be suggest a statistically significant difference between the mean of the first semester i.e. the first 12 values) versus the mean of the last two semesters (last 24 values ). You might be able to draw inference or test the hypothesis of no week of the semester effect. A good time series package might be useful to you in this regard. Failing that you might need to find somebody to provide help in this analytical arena.
