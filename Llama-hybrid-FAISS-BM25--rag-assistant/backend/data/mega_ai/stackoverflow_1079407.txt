How Can a SuperClass name be retrieved from a java file using ASTParser?

I need to retrieve SuperClass name of a java file (which extends a class, i need that class name). In order to do this, I began to use ASTParser but I'm newbie so any example or illustration can be helpful. I use ASTView to comprehend which ways that AST keeps a java file structure but I'm stuck while trying visit(), endvisit() functions. I could not find any detailed example. Thanks in advance...
