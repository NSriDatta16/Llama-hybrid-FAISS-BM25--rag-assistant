How many samples required to reduce standard error to a specified figure?

I have a large batch of product that I am testing for protein content (target = 12%). I know the standard deviation for the test method is 0.6. I want to test a number of samples from the batch, so that I can average these results, reducing the error. I want the error to be 0.1 or lower. How many samples do I need to take? Thanks in advance
