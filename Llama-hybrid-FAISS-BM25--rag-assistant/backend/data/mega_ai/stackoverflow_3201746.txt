Not really answering the question here, but readers might like to note that there is an entire niche industry around the idea of MultValued Databases : These databases differ from a relational database in that they have features that support and encourage the use of attributes having a list of values, rather than all attributes having a single value Since in this case the database engine has extensions to it's query language to accommodate the multi-dimensional nature of it's tables (which I assume Access probably does not) then it's not really comparable to multivalued fields in Access. But an interesting parallel in any case (for anyone who's not previously even heard of MultValued Databases).
