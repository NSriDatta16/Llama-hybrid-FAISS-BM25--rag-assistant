Microsoft Certified Partner? Important to Developers?

My company has recently became a Microsoft Certified Partner and from a business perspective it helps us greatly as it provides the software licenses needed to continue development in a much more cost effective manner, and the added benefit of marketing abilities. Now, I know that Microsoft Certified Partner status is important to many clients, but from a developers perspective, is it something that as a .NET developer you would look for when selecting an organization to potentially work for? Is it seen as a benefit where you know at a minimum that the organization will have access to the tools needed for the job?
