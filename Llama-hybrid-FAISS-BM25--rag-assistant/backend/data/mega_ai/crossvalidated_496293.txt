Why do we say Bayesian statistics is suited for probability of one-time events?

People say frequentist statistics is not suited for one-time events, with Bayesian statistics being better suited. I wonder what the reason for this is. I also wonder what "one-time event" means, because (for example) a coin toss also seems to be a one-time event because we cannot reproduce the exact same environment whenever we toss a coin.
