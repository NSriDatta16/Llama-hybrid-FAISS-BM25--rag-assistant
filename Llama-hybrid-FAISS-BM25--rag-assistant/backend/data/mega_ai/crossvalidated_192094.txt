Choosing which of the independent variables to enter into multinomial regression

I am performing regression analysis only very newly, so am practically lacking skills! It would be greatly appreciated getting your guidance pls. I have 50 observations of 26 IV (categorical ) and One nominal(or ordinal?) DV (detected above average, detected below average, not detected). I am interested in knowing which of those IV contributed mostly to status of DV. SO i ran multinomial regression. In order to decide which of the 26 IV i should enter, I initially performed a separate linear regression analysis to test the significant explanatory variables to an overall assessment score (DV)- which is a total score on all 26 IV for each observation. So i considered those variables as the most meaningful to enter. is it a wrong approach? and how wrong would be the other approach to perform factorial analysis and enter those variables in a factor with high eigen value? note: i have limited understanding of this test, but somehow when i did it, i ended up with a factor of 17 components explaining 95% of variations I appreciate a lot your help , although i may have sounded not reasonable with my method!
