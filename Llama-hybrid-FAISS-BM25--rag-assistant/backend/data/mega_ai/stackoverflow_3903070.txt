Telerik's Grid for MVC is supposed to be good, but you may want to consider an alternative to the traditional grid UI experience. The MVC paradigm does not explicitly define how you should do things- that's one of it's many strengths. But it does however encourage users into certain directions: testing; maintainability; separation of concerns (logical isolation); design patterns; user experience; user centered design; etc, etc. With this in mind is there an alternative to a grid that you may be able to use? Repeating elements? In line editing (think Facebook comments)? Don't show all items, just the top 10 most relevant to the user? Live Search to filter without all the options? Maybe you can create a better experience for the users without a grid, and now that you're going to use MVC, this is the best time to do it. See how easy it is to turn something sad looking ..into something happy Keys ideas: Remove the fluff Some things are obvious Search is capable of figuring out stuff by itself and the popular: Less is more
