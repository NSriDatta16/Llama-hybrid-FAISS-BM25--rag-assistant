Copying selected text to a Swing Java app?

My goal is assign a global hotkey (JIntellitype, JXGrabKey) that would pass an arbitrary selected text to a java app. The initial plan is to utilize the java.awt.Robot to emulate Ctrl-C keypress and then get the value from clipboard. Probably there's a more elegant solution? EXAMPLE: Open Notepad, type in some text, select that text. Now, that text needs to be copied into a Java app.
