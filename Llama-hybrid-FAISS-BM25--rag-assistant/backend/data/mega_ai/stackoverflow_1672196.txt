Why aren't my touch-handling methods being called for a UIView subclass?

In my application I need to implement touchBegan for the custom View that has been created . I haved added the following method to my custom view class. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } But these methods are not called, when my custom view is dragged or moved ... I have also tried setting [self setUserInteractionEnabled:YES]; [self becomeFirstResponder]; and override the following method : -(BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder { return YES; } Apart from this , does anything need to be done ... Any help would be greatly appreciated ... Best Regards, Mohammed Sadiq.
