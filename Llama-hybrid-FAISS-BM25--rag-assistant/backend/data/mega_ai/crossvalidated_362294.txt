Why would you expect the coefficients to be similar? After all, the likelihood function of logistic regression and Cox's proportional hazard function focus on different quantities. In logistic regression, we want to maximise the likelihood of mortality , given the other variables $$ \max \prod_{i=1}^n P(\text{mortality} \mid x_1, \ldots, x_d) . $$ In Cox's proportional hazards model the focus is time to mortality and the partial likelihood function is $$ \max \prod_{i=1}^n P (\text{subject experiences event at $y_i$} \mid \text{one event at $y_i$}, x_1, \ldots, x_d ) . $$ Accordingly, the meaning of coefficients is quite different. In binary logistic regression, they describe the log-odds-ratio , which indicate by how much the odds change when the value of the corresponding variable is increased by 1 \begin{align} \exp(\beta_j) &= \frac{P(y_i = 1 \mid x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ij}, \ldots x_{id})}{P(y_i = 0 \mid x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ij}, \ldots x_{id})} / \frac{P(y_i = 1 \mid x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ij} + 1, \ldots x_{id})}{P(y_i = 0 \mid x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ij} + 1, \ldots x_{id})} , \\ P(y_i = 1 \mid x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{id}) &= \frac{\exp \left(\beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^d x_{ij} \beta_j \right)}{1 + \exp \left(\beta_0 + \sum_{j=1}^d x_{ij} \beta_j \right)} , \\ P(y_i = 0 \mid x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{id}) &= 1 - P(y_i = 1 \mid x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{id}) . \end{align} In the Cox model, coefficients describe the change in hazard ratio if all variables are fixed and only the value of the $j$-th variable is incremented by 1: \begin{align} \exp ( \beta_j ) &= \frac{h(t | x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ij}, \ldots x_{id})}{h(t | x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{ij} + 1, \ldots x_{id})} , \\ h(t | x_{i1}, \ldots, x_{id}) &= h_0(t) \exp \left( \sum_{j=1}^d x_{ij} \beta_j \right) , \end{align} with (unspecified) baseline hazard function $h_0(t)$ (cancels out). You are correct, that the expressions for $\beta_j$ boil down to the same expression: $$ \exp ( \beta_j ) = \frac{\exp \left(x_{ij} \beta_j \right)}{\exp \left( (x_{ij} +1) \beta_j \right)} . $$ However, it is important to remember that semantically they aren't the same, because coefficients are determined according to different criteria (likelihood functions). In logistic regression, coefficients describe mortality (a binary variable), whereas in the Cox model they describe time to mortality (a continuous, non-negative variable). Moreover, Cox's proportional hazards model has no intercept. Finally, it is important to remember that each model has different assumptions that need to be satisfied for the coefficients to be interpreted in this way. Most importantly, the proportional hazards assumption for the Cox model, which states the hazard ratio is a constant independent of time.
