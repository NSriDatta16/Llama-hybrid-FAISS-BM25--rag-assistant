I will reply only to the first one: Yes, in all real problems overfit is unavoidable. Every model can in principle lead to overfit. Overfitting is something that you can only limit, and never eliminate. This because given an arbitrary big number of parameters (trees, or iterations, in the case of Random Forest) you could obtain a ~100% match on the training set. Now, in the hypothetical case where the training set includes all the samples existing in the universe, then you are OK with that model. But as you know this is impossible. So, in real life, where you have only a tiny sample of all the possible existing data, you have to limit your model in order to capture only the most important characteristic of your data, and left the details (which your model is unable to capture) behind. The more details the model try to catch in the training dataset, the more is likely that they are pattern/structures which actually exist in the training set, but that do not hold true in general, and so the model is unable to behave well with unseen data. As example: say you train the cat classifier with a dataset where a small percentage of the pictures show cats on sofa. If you go too deep in training it, the model can get to the conclusion that being on a sofa is a characteristic of the cats, which of course is wrong. While if you are more conservative, and you train the model less deeply, your model will ignore the detail "sofa", focusing on details that affect the majority of the cats, and this will lead your model to generalize better. Here the amount of data helps: the more you have, the more those details become evident to a model. Following the example above, if in your dataset lots of pictures with different stuff/animals on sofas are present, it can give a better interpretation on things being on sofas, and so it can be trained deeply, or with more parameters, and so increase it's performance on the training set while keeping a good performance also on the test set.
