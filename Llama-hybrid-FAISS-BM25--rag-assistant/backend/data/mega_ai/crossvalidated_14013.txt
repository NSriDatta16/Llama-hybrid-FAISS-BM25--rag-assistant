Uhm... quite different. In PCA, you are given the multivariate continuous data (a multivariate vector for each subject), and you are trying to figure out if you don't need that many dimensions to conceptualize them. In (metric) MDS, you are given the matrix of distances between the objects, and you are trying to figure out what the locations of these objects in space are (and whether you need a 1D, 2D, 3D, etc. space). In non-metric MDS, you only know that objects 1 and 2 are more distant than objects 2 and 3, so you try to quantify that, on top of finding the dimensions and locations. With a notable stretch of imagination, you can say that a common goal of PCA and MDS is to visualize objects in 2D or 3D. But given how different the inputs are, these methods won't be discussed as even distantly related in any multivariate textbook. I would guess that you can convert the data usable for PCA into data usable for MDS (say, by computing Mahalanobis distances between objects, using the sample covariance matrix), but that would immediately result in a loss of information: MDS is only defined up to location and rotation, and the latter two can be done more informatively with PCA. If I were to briefly show someone the results of non-metric MDS and wanted to give them a rough idea of what it does without going into detail, I could say: Given the measures of similarity or dissimilarity that we have, we are trying to map our objects/subjects in such a way that the 'cities' they make up have distances between them that are as close to these similarity measures as we can make them. We could only map them perfectly in $n$-dimensional space, though, so I am representing the two most informative dimensions here -- kinda like what you would do in PCA if you showed a picture with the two leading principal components.
