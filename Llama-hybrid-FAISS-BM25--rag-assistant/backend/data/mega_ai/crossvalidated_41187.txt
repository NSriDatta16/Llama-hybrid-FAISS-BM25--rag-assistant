How to use the SD of a normal sampling distribution to specify the gamma prior for the corresponding precision?

The gamma distribution is a commonly used prior distribution for the precision ($1/sd^2$) of a normal distribution in Bayesian hierarchical modeling. I want to use an informed prior for the variance and I ask an expert on the data I'm trying to model. An easy way of describing earlier knowledge about the variance of the data is using the standard deviation as it is on the same scale as the data. My expert tells me: "Well in general the data tend to have a SD of 100, and I believe the SD of the SD is at most 50". I believe it would be much harder for my expert directly give this statement using precision and the SD of the precision. Now that I have the expert's statement I want to incorporate it into my JAGS/BUGS model but in JAGS/BUGS I can't specify the gamma prior directly using this data as gamma is parametrized using shape and rate and the normal distribution is parameterized using precision. What I would want to do is to take the statements of the mean of the sampling distribution's SD ($\mu_\sigma$) and the SD of the sampling distribution's SD ($\sigma_\sigma$) and use these parameters to set up the corresponding gamma prior for the precision of the sampling distribution. How could I do that? That is, given the expert's guestimate of the mean SD and the SD of the SD of the data, how do I specify the corresponding hyperparameters shape and rate for the gamma prior on the sampling distributions precision? The following diagram shows the model and illustrates my question: The code below would be the corresponding BUGS/JAGS model, where the "functions" f1 and f2 are the functions I would like to know how to implement. model { for(i in 1:length(y)) { y ~ dnorm(mu, tau) } tau ~ dgamma(shape, rate) shape The reason why I would want to specify the shape and the rate of the gamma using $\mu_\sigma$ and $\sigma_\sigma$ is because I would find it more intuitive to think in the scale of the SD of the sampling distribution rather than in the scale of the precision.
