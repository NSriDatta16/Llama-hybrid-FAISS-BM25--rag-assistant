Given the nature of the problem, I'm not sure how much more performance you can squeeze out of it. If the files are distributed among several different disks, then I could see creating a thread for each disk; that way you could parallize several reads at a time. If they're all on the same disk, though, then at some level all the reads will be serialized (I think; I'm not a storage expert). I/O is your limiting factor here, not the algorithm.
