Well if you just want speed, then standard ZIP compression is just fine and it's most likely integrated into your language/framework already (ex: .NET has it, Java has it). Sometimes the most universal solution is the best, ZIP is a very mature format, any ZIP library and application will work with any other. But if you want better compression, I'd suggest 7-Zip as the author is very smart, easy to get ahold of and encourages people to use the format. Providing you with compression times is impossible, as it's directly related to your hardware. If you want a benchmark, you have to do it yourself.
