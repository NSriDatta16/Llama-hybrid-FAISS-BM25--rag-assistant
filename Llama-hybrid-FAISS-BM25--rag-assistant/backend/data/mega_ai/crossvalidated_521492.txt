The method of collapsing SBP and DBP into one measure should be guided by subject matter expertise. If you are interested in MAP then compute MAP. PCA is guided by variance maximization not by subject matter meaningfulness. If you want the data to fully speak, and don't want to impose a one-number summary, then use multivariate regression to jointly model (SBP, DBP).
