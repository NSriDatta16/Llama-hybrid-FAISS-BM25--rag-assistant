I once tried solving this problem by using the PanGesture. To all the subviews you want to be draggable, you can probably add a UIPanGestureRegognizer and do whatever you want to do in their selector. That works well even inside ScrollView. UIPanGestureRecognizer *panGesture = [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(doSomething:)]; [panGesture setDelegate:self]; [subviewtoMove addGestureRecognizer:panGesture];
