Just create a an NSTimer that calls a tick method at whatever frequency you desire. But keep in mind that NSTimer is not guaranteed to be precise, so in order to avoid gradually accumulating errors, you might want to check how much time has actually passed (e.g. if the timer fires an average of 10 ms late over 500 ticks, code that depends on precise timing will be five seconds off).
