Convolutional Neural Networks - Flattening with multiple feature maps

I have a very simple question about CNNs, which I unfortunately couldn't find an explanation for. Imagine we have a CNN, that has four filters (eg right, left, top, bottom edges) each of those outputs a 2x2 feature map for simplicity. Each of them gets flattened, so we are left with 4 4x1 feature maps. Does the fully connected input layer have 4 input nodes, where we feed the 4x1 maps, or does it have 16 input nodes, each 4 corresponding to the feature map of a certain filter?
