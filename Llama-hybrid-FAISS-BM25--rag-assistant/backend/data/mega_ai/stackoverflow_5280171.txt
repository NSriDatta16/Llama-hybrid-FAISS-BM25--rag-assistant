You dont mention which version of the API you are using, so i will asume v3... There is a draggable property that you can either set in the constructor using the options parameter 'draggable: true' or by invoking the setDraggable(true) function after it is created. Check http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html#Marker for more info. Edit: For version 2 there are enableDragging() and disableDragging() functions... As for adding markers, perhaps subscribe to the mouse click event on the map, and then add a marker in there. The coordinates are passed into the event handling function as part of the event parameter.
