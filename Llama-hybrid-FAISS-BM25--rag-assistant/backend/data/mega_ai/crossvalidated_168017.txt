The RBF kernel function is as follows, for two vectors $\mathbf{u}$ and $\mathbf{v}$: $$ \kappa(\mathbf{u},\mathbf{v}) = \exp(-\gamma \|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{v}\|^2). $$ The hyperparameter $\gamma$ is used to configure the sensitivity to differences in feature vectors, which in turn depends on various things such as input space dimensionality and feature normalization. If you set $\gamma$ too large, you will end up overfitting. In the limit case $\gamma\rightarrow\infty$, the kernel matrix becomes the unit matrix which leads to a perfect fit of the training data, though an entirely useless model. The optimal value of $\gamma$ depends entirely on your data, any rules of thumb should be taken with a pound of salt. That said, you can use specialized libraries to optimize hyperparameters for you (e.g. Optunity (*)), in the case of SVM with RBF kernel that is $\gamma$ and $C$. You can find an example of optimizing these parameters automatically with Optunity and scikit-learn here . (*) disclaimer: I'm the lead developer of Optunity.
