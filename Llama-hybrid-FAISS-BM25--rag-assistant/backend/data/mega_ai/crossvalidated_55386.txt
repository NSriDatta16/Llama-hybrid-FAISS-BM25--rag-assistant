PCs scores from Correlation and Covariance matrices through matrix computations and prcomp

I'm want to get PCs scores through matrix approach. My calculated PCs scores for correlation matrix matches with prcomp results but the PCs scores for covariance matrix do not match with the results of prcomp . Could you point out what am I missing? Thanks PCA on Correlation matrix # PCA on Correlation matrix X PCA on Covariance matrix # PCA on Covariance matrix Cov
