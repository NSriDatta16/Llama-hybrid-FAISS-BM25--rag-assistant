Letting users create customized Bundles in Magento

We are building an e-commerce site where users can create their own bundles with products of their choice. Other users can then buy these bundles. Please guide me as to how a bundle can be created based on the products selected by user and store this bundle. From whatever little I have read, I can create a module which will do this. Is this the right approach, or is their any other way to do it. I have gone through Alan's post to create modules, but still my magento knowledge is limited. I am new to magento, and a newbie programmer (hence this is my first post on stackoverflow), any detailed description will greatly help me. Thanks.
