Kalman filter + MCMC vs pure MCMC for bayesian dynamic linear(state space) models

I have heard that you can use both kalman filter integrated with MCMC to estimate bayesian state space models, i have also heard that you can use pure MCMC to estimate bayesian state space models. Why would one want to use the kalman filter approach?
