How do I make a Read More Toggle within H tag using jQuery?

I'm having trouble with selectors I think. Here's what I'm trying to do. I have several H3 tags with an a href within them that are above paragraphs of text. The paragraphs all have a class that hides them. I want to be able to click the link and have only the hidden div for that specific h3 open. Everything I've tried either toggles all the hidden divs (since they share a class) or they can't be within the h3. That's the trouble with this code here, it doesn't work unless I have the a tags outside of the H3 which is bad code. Here's the html: Headline some text here.... same thing on down... And here is the jQuery: $(document).ready(function() { $("a.expander").click(function() { $(this).next(".hidden-text").toggle(); }); }); Is there a better way to do this?
