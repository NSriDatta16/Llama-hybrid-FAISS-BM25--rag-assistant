I had same problem when porting an iPhone game to iPad. There are few optimizations that raised FPS from 5-6 to 20+: using vbo-s reducing as much as possible per fragment operations(fog, blend, multi-texturing) putting some operations on CPU(lights for example) using multi-texturing instead of multi-pass with blend improving culling algorithm(now we have a better CPU)
