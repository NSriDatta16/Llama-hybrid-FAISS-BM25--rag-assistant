I'd suspect from what you write that you need more experience with / knowledge about some core OO design principles, in particular inheritance and polymorphism. A good understanding of these concepts can help you better understand the relationships between your objects, and the ways in which they should be coupled. Given your comments about your OO designs moving towards an implied persistent data storage element, you might also want to look into such concepts as Aspect Oriented Programming (Spring is a great tool for this). Also, look into what an ORM such as Hibernate can do, and how it does it (this may be a bit advanced, though).
