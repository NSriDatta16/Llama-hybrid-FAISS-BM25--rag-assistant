Neural Networks and a catalogue of the number of floating point operations in various types of statistical and time series models

I recently came across this paper Green AI . In the paper they discussed using floating point operation (FPO) count during testing and implementation of Neural Networks (NNs) to compare the efficiency of various NNs. I would like to look at this topic more generally. Mostly from a forecasting perspective where naive, state space, and auto regressive models are used heavily. I would like to know if there exists information on the FPOs to calculate these simple models and if this does not exist are there estimation techniques to get to a rough idea of this value.
