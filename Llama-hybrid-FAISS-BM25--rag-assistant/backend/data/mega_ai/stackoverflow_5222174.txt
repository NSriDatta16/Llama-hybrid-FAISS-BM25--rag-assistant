There are two steps on a project like this one I believe: First step would be to record the voice from an analog input into digital format (let's assume wav-pcm). For this you can use DirectShow API in C#, or standard Wav-In as in this project: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/audio-video/cswavrec.aspx . You may consider compressing your audio files later on, there are many options for this, in Windows you may consider Windows Media Format SDK to avoid licensing issues with other formats. Second step is to build or use a voice recognition framework, if you want to build a recognition framework you will probably need to define a set of "features" for your sound fragments and select+implement a recognition algorithm. There are many aproaches available for this, IEEE amd ACM.org websties are usually good sources. If you want to use an existing framework you may want to consider Nuance Recognizer (commercial) or http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net (open source). Hope this helps.
