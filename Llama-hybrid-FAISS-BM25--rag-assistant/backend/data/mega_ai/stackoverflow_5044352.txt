how to configure local and remote repository in settings.xml for maven

I have my own organization internal repository for which i would like to use: archiva.default http://my.org.repo:8000/archiva/repository/internal/ I also needed remote repository to get latest version of maven-resource-plugin, maven-compile-plugin, jboss etc. Can someone please suggest me how to configure settings.xml so that maven downloads the dependencies that are available in internal repository, if the dependencies are not available in internal repository then get it from remote repository.
