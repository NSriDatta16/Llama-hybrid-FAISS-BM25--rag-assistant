Endogeneity issue in time series model

Can anybody tell me about endogeneity issue in time series? I've read one paper, discuss that income is likely to be endogenous for consumption. However, on the UK data, the current quarter growth of real income appears to be weakly exogenous for the long consumption to income ratio. Also, another one says the flow of funds into mortgage is determined by financial system, which is exogenous. Actually, I knew a little bit about endogenous in a cross-section model, but here I cannot understand why there is endogeneity in a time series model. If the endogeneity issues do exist in a model, when I conduct an ECM model, can I use 2SLS in the long run model?
