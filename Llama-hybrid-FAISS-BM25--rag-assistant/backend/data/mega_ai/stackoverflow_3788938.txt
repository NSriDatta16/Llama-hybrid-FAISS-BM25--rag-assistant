How is answer declared? If it is a single precision real you can only expect about 6 decimal digits of precision. Also, values are converted to binary for internal storage and computations. This can cause rounding and other issues, but the difference here is too large for this to be the cause. To declare answer as double precision, use the following: integer, parameter :: DRK = selected_real_kind (14) real (kind=DRK) :: answer This will guarantee that answer has at least 14 decimal digits. "DRK" can be used throughout your program. Depending on your compiler, you can try asking for even more digits ... it may provide a such a type. Rarely is more than double precision necessary.
