Maybe an answer now; see comment below. But if nothing else, an identical problem and question. I've tried all of the unique suggestions made on this and other forums, several times for some suggestions, as the original author has done, and I continue to get the same message. I've removed everything from the provisioning portal, from my iPhone (3.1.3), and from XCode (3.2), and rebuilt/reinstalled everything. As above, the green dot shows in the Organizer as does the relevant iPhone specific data, the provisioning file is there and on the iPhone, all the appropriate certificates appear to be in place. I've "clean"ed the build; I've turned the iPhone off and restarted XCode, in several different sequences; I shut down the development Mac and restarted everything. But, I continue to get the "No provisioned iPhone OS device is connected". And, yes, this is my first try at loading a development application to the iPhone, so the original question's author and I seem to share similar relevant experience and behavior. I keep hoping to go back and find a missing step. And, while it did take several tries to get to this point, with everything looking like it's right, it appears I've still overlooked something important. Beyond the "restart" suggestions, has anyone found any strong sensitivities to the order in which things are done, or anything that seems to have become more difficult with XCode 3.2 or iPhone 3.1.3? I notice that the many examples of this question first appeared 18 months ago, then it was silent for quite a while, and now there's been a slew of new queries of this kind.
