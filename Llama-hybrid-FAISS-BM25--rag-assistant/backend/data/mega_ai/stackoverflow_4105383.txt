Well, you could use Dictionary in C# 4 / .NET 4 - but other than that, you can't do it with exactly the code shown because there's no type which is implicitly convertible to int , string and double . (You could write your own one, but you'd have to list each type separately.) You could use Dictionary but then you'd need to cast the results: int a = (int) Storage.Get("age"); string b = (string) Storage.Get("name"); double c = (double) Storage.Get("bmi"); Alternatively, you could make the Get method generic: int a = Storage.Get ("age"); // etc
