This really is a more theoretical questions than practical. Indexes impact on your performance depends on the hardware you have, the version of Oracle, index types, etc. Yesterday I heard Oracle announced a dedicated storage, made by HP, which is supposed to perform 10 times faster with 11g database. As for your case, there can be several solutions: 1. Have a large amount of indexes (>20) and rebuild them daily (nightly). This would be especially useful if the table gets thousands of updates/deletes daily. 2. Partition your table (if that applies your data model). 3. Use a separate table for new/updated data, and run a nightly process which combines the data together. This would require a change in your application logic. 4. Switch to IOT (index organized table), if your data support this. Of course there might be many more solutions for such case. My first suggestion to you, would be to clone the DB to a development environment, and run some stress testing against it.
