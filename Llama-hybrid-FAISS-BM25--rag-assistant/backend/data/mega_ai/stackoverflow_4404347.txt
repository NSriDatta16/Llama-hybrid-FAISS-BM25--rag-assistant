If you need to convey a signal in the audio domain, playing on time but not in pitch: You have to know what your signal is composed of. So as to synthesitize the good frequency when its worth. 1/ You have all the parameters known, like in analogic synthesizing, you know you want to synthetize one note, so you tune all the Oscillators frequencies you can to this value: I guess this not what you can do, any virtual/virtual analog synth can do this on your demand. 2/ you have a source sound ou want to control You have to decompose it in items you can control to futhfill your harmonic constraint, in time and rhythmical constraints: 3 solutions. a. FFT, fast fourrier transform, giving you the amount of power on all harmonics of your source sound, and up to you to enlarge the time scale of some harmonics or another ( really cook recipes, but really worth the expreriment) b. Wavelet, close to FFT, but focussing on harmonic details whenever they happen, and how precise they happen. (imagine its like FFT optimizing on some meaningfull frequencies at each time) c. Granular Synthesis , i think it is the easiest: it perfroms windows, (applying sort of Gauss Normal law to each time fragment of sound), like clouds of windows over your original sound, decoupling it in numerous parts, totally manageable on their pitch and duration (the speed and period of the window applied on the sound) There maybe be a lot of other techniques but I am not aware of.
