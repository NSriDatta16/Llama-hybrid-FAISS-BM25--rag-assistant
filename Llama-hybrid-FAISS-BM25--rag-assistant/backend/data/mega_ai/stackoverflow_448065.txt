Create the lock outside the method. class Agent(Thread): mylock = Lock() def write_result(self): self.mylock.acquire() try: ... finally: self.mylock.release() or if using python >= 2.5: class Agent(Thread): mylock = Lock() def write_result(self): with self.mylock: ... To use that with python 2.5 you must import the statement from the future: from __future__ import with_statement
