Like Dylan's organisation, we also use the excellent Confluence wiki. I wrote an article about why this is better approach called Wiki is my word-processor , which should give you some reasons to change the situation. Benefits of using a wiki for internal documentation include the following. Word-processor users get sucked into changing the layout and typography, however good your templates are, which wastes time and reduces consistency. A wiki provides full-text search, which you are unlikely to have for your body of the MS Word documents written by everyone. A wiki provides a document version history; I have never heard of a team successfully keeping all revisions in Word documents and always being able to compare old versions, or using a version control system (with the possible exception of SharePoint but that's whole different failure scenario). A wiki makes hyperlinks between documents easy; it is too hard to reliably link between documents in a collection of Word documents, so new documents end up duplicating older content into new monolithic documents which means they take more time to read and write. Separate wiki pages can be edited by different people at the same time, and Confluence can merge changes when multiple people edit the same page at the same time; collaboration is harder with a Word document that only one person can edit at a time. A wiki like Confluence automatically generates navigation pages based on wiki structure and tags; you need a librarian and lots of discipline to make it possible to browse a large collection of Word documents. A wiki page usually loads and displays more quickly than a Word document. A wiki page has more automatic meta-data; you need templates and discipline to make sure that Word documents always have Title, Author and Version set in the document properties and visible in the document on-screen and in print. If you want more ammunition than this, then there is lots of wiki-promotion on The Atlassian Blog .
