Thank you all for your posts! I wanted to change the whole environment...not just the code. I almost did it... Tools->Options->Environment->Fonts and Colors->Text Editor I did prior to surfing. Then Roy mentioned above to use Tools->Options->Environment->Fonts and Colors-> Environment Font. That did 92%... Than I changed ALL options I could to either Arial 11 or Tahoma 12. EVERYTHING was changed except: the controls when I drag them to the form. Any further ideas? It would sure be nice to see what I am creating! I also want to set a standard font for all of my applications. Where do I set it? The default is either Windows San Serif 8 or Tahoma 8. Thanks, guys!! Hopefully I can return the favor and help others later.
