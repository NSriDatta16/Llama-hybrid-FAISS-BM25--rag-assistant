I read the previous answers, and Neil Slater's comment to Emre's post, copied again below, hits the nail. "Dimension hopping" is a term created by Dr. Hinton of machine learning pioneer fame in the context of view point. To quote Dr. Hinton "So, typically envision the input dimensions correspond to pixels, and, if an object moves in the world and you don't move your eyes to follow it, the information about the object will occur on different pixels." Age and weight are input dimension that are not easily confused. Dr. Hinton used this obviously NOT likely dimension hopping situation of age and weight of patients to mean we would certainly be able to spot and fix any erroneous between these types of data (It's hard not to notice most adults are under 100 years old and more than 100 pounds). The likely problem of dimension hopping, which Dr. Hinton was addressing, is pixels could be displaced because we have a different view point (e.g. the object could have moved or we are looking at it from a different angle). Linear neural networks would not be able to detect this, whereas convolutional neural networks by design would. "The age example is supposed to highlight a dataset that does not have dimension-hopping. Age and weight do not "hop" or swap values randomly between examples - they are not interchangeable and the example is showing how odd that would be (and how difficult it would make simple tasks such as linear regression). Pixel values in images (and similar data in many signal processing tasks) do interchange or move easily due to the nature of the problem. â€“ Neil Slater May 29 '16 at 18:01"
