Eclipse HTML editor for HTML template files

I'm trying to edit phpbb HTML template file with Eclipse Ganymedes version 3.4.1 containing Web Developer Tools. These template files contain HTML markup with template variable marks in form { variable_name }. Now, when trying to open such file, Eclipse trys to validate also these template variable marks. For example template contains After opening Eclipse shows on editor body: Unsupported Character Body Character encoding "{S_CONTENT_ENCODING}" is not supported by this platform. Set encoding... How to solve this using WTP or is there any better editor for template editing purpose ?
