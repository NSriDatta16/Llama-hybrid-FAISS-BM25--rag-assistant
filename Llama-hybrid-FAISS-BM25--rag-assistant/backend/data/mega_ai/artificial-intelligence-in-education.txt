Artificial intelligence in education (often abbreviated as AIEd) is a subfield of educational technology that studies how to use artificial intelligence, such as generative AI chatbots, to create learning environments. The field considers the ramifications and impacts of AI on existing educational infrastructure, as well as future possibilities and innovations. Considerations in the field include data-driven decision-making, AI ethics, data privacy and AI literacy. Concerns include the potential for cheating, over-reliance, equity of access, reduced critical thinking, and the perpetuation of misinformation and bias. History Efforts to integrate AI into educational contexts have often followed technological advancement in the history of artificial intelligence. In the 1960s, educators and researchers began developing computer-based instruction systems, such as PLATO, developed by the University of Illinois. In the 1970s and 1980s, intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) were being adapted for classroom instruction. The International Artificial Intelligence in Education Society was founded in 1993. In the late 2010s and 2020s, large language models (LLMs) and other generative AI technologies have become focuses of AIEd conversations. During this time, AI content detectors have been developed and employed to detect and/or punish unsanctioned AI use in educational contexts, although their accuracy is limited. Some schools banned LLMs, but many bans were later lifted. Theory AIEd applies theory from education studies, machine learning, and related fields. Three paradigms of AIEd One posited model suggests the following three paradigms for AI in education, which follow roughly from least to most learner-centered and from requiring least to most technical complexity from the AI systems: AI-Directed, Learner-as-recipient: AIEd systems present a pre-set curriculum based on statistical patterns that do not adjust to learner’s feedback. AI-Supported, Learner-as-collaborator: Systems that incorporate responsiveness to learner’s feedback through, for example, natural language processing, wherein AI can support knowledge construction. AI-Empowered, Learner-as-leader: This model seeks to position AI as a supplement to human intelligence wherein learners take agency and AI provides consistent and actionable feedback. Socio-technical imaginaries Some scholars frame AI in education within the concept of the socio-technical imaginary, defined as collective visions and aspirations that shape societal transformations and governance through the interplay of technology and social norms. This framing positions AI in the history of “emerging technologies” that have and will transform education, such as computing, the internet, or social media. Applications AI has been employed in educational settings through a wide range of tools. AI-based tutoring systems Intelligent tutors or Intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), such as SCHOLAR system in the 1970s, are designed to create an artificial interaction between a student and a teacher. ITS have also been considered for accessibility purposes like supporting students in larger classes who may not be able to get direct attention from human instructors. Customized learning platforms Personalized AI platforms can tailor instructional environments to students' needs using algorithms to predict students' patterns and habits and making recommendations to improve performance. Many such platforms are app-based, for example Photomath, which purports to help students solve and understand equations. Automated grading systems Automation in student assessment and feedback could save time for educators. Systems make use of different rubric combinations to grade performances. These systems need oversight to prevent bias in scoring and raise concerns about labor equity and job replacement. Generative AI Generative AI chatbots like ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude and Grok have become particularly popular in the 2020s. These chatbots use
