What representation of data should I choose, pandas, numpy or tensors to train neural network model

I am having a pandas dataframe divided to X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test by train_test_split and I am using it to train my neural network model for binary classification. It is taking some time and I was wondering if it would be faster if I changed it from pandas.dataframe to numpy.array or tensor .
