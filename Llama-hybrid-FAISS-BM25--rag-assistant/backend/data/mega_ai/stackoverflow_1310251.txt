I created a "Settings" library that was essentially just a namevaluepair library that reads/writes to a db table. It's flexible enough to hold lots of data types and is reusable. You could easily implement such library in each of your other libraries. Call some sort of function like: AgileSetting.SetSetting("EmailSubject", "All your base are belong to us"); string emailSubject = AgileSetting.GetSetting("EmailSubject"); You could also take it to another level and create some sort of grouping of settings to help organize them.
