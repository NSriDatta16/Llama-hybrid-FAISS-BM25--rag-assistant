All I can tell you is how I organise my projects. I have an ASP.NET CMS / Framework; this is made up of 3 core solutions: MyCode.Core (sln) \MyCode.Core.Common (proj) \MyCode.Core.BusinessLogic \MyCode.Core.IDataprovider \etc... The MyCode.Core sln is the only place I do any (serious) development on these projects. I copy successful builds to a "neutral" location on disk. Included in this is copies of the dll's these projects reference (MS Ent Libs, AntiXSS library). Next I have a project which is a sort of SDK for "skins and templates". MyCode.Templates (sln) \MyCode.Templates.Nasqueron (proj) The output of this project gets copied to the same neutral location as the core. This project references outputs of the MyCode.Core projects - specifically the ones kept in the neutral folder. Finally I have the web project itself. I let Visual Studio manage this the way it wants to. All references are aganist the dlls copyied to the neutral location. So basically my approach is: Only allow projects to be edited within the scope of one solution (basically - decide on who "owns" the project). copy / deploy stable copies to a neutral location that sits outside of the actual solution / project file structure, and reference these copies of the shared code.
