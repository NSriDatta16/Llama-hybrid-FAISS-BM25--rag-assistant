Public dataset for news articles with their associated categories

I am wondering if there are any public datasets of Google news with various news categories such as politics, entertainment, lifestyle, general news, sports etc. I want to use such dataset for topic detection of various sentences or paragraphs. I was planning to train a classifier with such a dataset and use it for predictions. However, I couldn't find any. Are there any such known datasets available?
