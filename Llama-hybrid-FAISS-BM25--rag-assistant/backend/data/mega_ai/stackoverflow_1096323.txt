Well my experiences with that are devastating. ProjectCenter the IDE distributed for GNUstep does not work here at all the debugger intergration is well not existant. But that's what you get with GNUstep. There is Gorm as interface builder and ProjectCenter. Not more. That's very discouraging. The best you can do with Objective-C is currently having a Mac in some form and use XCode. That's the best you can get currently, and I expect that won't change in any forseeable future. Now you should step back and just use the "plain" old Makefile route. There is a somewhat very rough tutorial about GNUStep makefile starting somewhere below http://wiki.gnustep.org/index.php/User_Guides Regards Friedrich
