Open questions in machine learning

I was just having a short discussion with a leading researcher in statistical learning theory. He told me that in his perspective NOT the issues like speed or such matter but mostly the question how to validate models or better how to validate algorithms. I wanted to ask the community about different opinions what the currently important questions in statistical learning theory and machine learning are? (On a fundamental basis, i.e. not how to optimize certain algorithms or such).
