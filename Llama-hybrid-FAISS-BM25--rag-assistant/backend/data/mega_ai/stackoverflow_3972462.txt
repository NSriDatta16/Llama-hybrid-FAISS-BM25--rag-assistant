No, sorry: there is no supported way to do that. In part because the MIB you're staring at is not legal under SMIv2. To implement it, you'd either need to change multiple spots in the agent/helper directory (starting near line 328 of table.c and probably other places) or implement a table entirely from scratch without using the helper modules at all. But nothing mib2c gives you will solve this for you.
