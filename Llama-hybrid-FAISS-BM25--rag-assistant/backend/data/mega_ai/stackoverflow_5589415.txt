Entity Framework allows you to create a mapping for your "conceptual" domain (your objects), and a separate mapping for the "storage" domain (your database). You then map these together using a central conceptual storage mapping specification. It sounds complicated, and unfortunately it is... EF is not a lightweight tool. There's a lot to learn, but a place to start would be to read up on the CSDL, SSDL, and MSL specifications for Entity Framework . If you want to use your current objects and database, you may have to define custom mappings in CSDL, SSDL, and MSL. If you want to make your life easier, you could generate a default Entity Data Model using the built-in Visual Studio tools. Creating an EDM from an existing database will generate objects that map to your database, but there are about a million ways to customize this process, and there are several ways to define your objects so that they can be used with EF. I would suggest creating a default EDM from your database, and take a look at the .edmx file that is produced. An .edmx usually contains the CSDL, SSDL, and MSL in an XML format, along with generated code. (Again this can be totally customized). You might want to also spend some time reading up on EF ... it's a beast.
