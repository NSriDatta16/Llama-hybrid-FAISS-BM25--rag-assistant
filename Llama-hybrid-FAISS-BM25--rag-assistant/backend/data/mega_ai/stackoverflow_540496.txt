How can I workaround the Google Calendar's link redirect notice?

I have a Google calendar embedded on a webpage, with events related to activities the site is organizing. Some calendar events have links that redirect the user to a page, within the same website, which has more information and the option to enroll in the event. The problem however, is that since the end of last month, Google imposed a redirect notice that doesn't even automatically redirect. The links I create on events are changed by Google and, once a user clicks on a link, a new tab opens leading to a page with a redirect warning that the user must click. Since I am providing the users with a link to within the same website this is very inconvenient and makes no sense at all. I'd want the users to be able to click a link on the calendar and go through to the webpage with the relevant data. Do you guys know how I can go around this warning? My thought process: Initially, I thought of using JS to rewrite the links but since the calendar's iframe is in a different domain, the browser won't allow it due to XSS exploits (AFAIK). I could build my own AJAX calendar and sync it with Google's using the API, but that's a hell of a lot of work because of stupid "feature" that makes no sense. I like Google's calendar and I'd like to use it. The third thing that I though of was that, instead of having an iframe with the calendar I could use AJAX to fetch the entire code on the frame's url. Then I'd just rewrite the links on the that code with JS. Could this work? I would be REALLY thankful for any help. This is driving me insane! Using Jon Cram's input I created a php script that parses the code and makes the adjustments. However I could only get that working for the html version. No AJAX for me. =(
