Thank you @ben-bolker! Your answer led me to this paper: Estimating Pearsonâ€™s Correlation Coefficient With Bootstrap Confidence Interval From Serially Dependent Time Series . It confirms that the effective sample size I have is in reality much reduced due to the autocorrelation, as I suspected. I think I can adapt the method by using block bootstrap on each individual time series. I will look up bootstrapping residuals as well when I get the time. (Btw: my question was migrated to this forum and it seems I do not own it anymore - "You have not asked any questions" - so I could not just add a comment due to lack of "reputation")
