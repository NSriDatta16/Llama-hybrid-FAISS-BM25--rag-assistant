You can refer to the excellent book Bayesian forecasting and dynamic models (Harrison and West, 1997). The authors show that almost all traditional time series models are particular cases of the general dynamic model. They also emphasize the advantages. Perhaps one of the major advantages is the easiness with which you can integrate many state space models by simply augmenting the state vector. You can, for example, seamlessly integrate regressors, seasonal factors, and an autoregressive component in a single model.
