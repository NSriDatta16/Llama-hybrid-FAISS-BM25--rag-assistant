probability distribution of output value with regression tree methods

If I have a regression problem where I try to estimate the value of $y$ as function of $x_1 \dots x_d$: $$ y = f(x_1,\dots,x_d) $$ using a Boosted Regression Tree or a Random Forest Regression, is it possible to estimate the probability distribution of the output value (instead of only an estimate of $y$) : $$ p(y\ |\ x_1,\dots,x_d) $$ from the distribution of the outputs of the individual nodes ? (i.e. for fixed $x_1,\dots,x_d$ I'm interested in having a probability distribution for $y$ from which one then could obtain the mode, mean and also the width which is an indication of 'how well' this value is predicted).
