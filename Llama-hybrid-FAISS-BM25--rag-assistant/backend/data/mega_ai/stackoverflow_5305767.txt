An issue with the #if approach is that you can rapidly start falling into a situtation where you have multiple #if statements for different compiles. It very quickly becomes difficult to tell which chunk of code goes with which project. A better solution would be to identify all common code and keep them in a separate project folder, such as common/ . Then you have the specific service code under server/ for example and all forms code under client/ . All common code will still exist in one location and you server and clients become much more readable. You no longer have to worry about client only changes affecting the server and the opposite. Plus with proper organization of folders you can keep the what of your project (abstract concepts such as client/server) apart from the how (concrete implementations such as forms).
