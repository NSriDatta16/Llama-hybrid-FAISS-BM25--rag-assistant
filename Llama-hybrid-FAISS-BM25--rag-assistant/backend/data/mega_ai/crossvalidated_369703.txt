Non negative time series

I've been given to analyse a continuous non negative time series. Please give me an idea of whether I can use normal time series analysis for this or should I use differently. Also when converting a non-negative series to a time series should I consider this matter and change accordingly or can I just convert it in the usual manner (concerned with r). I've been also asked to do time series clustering as well. 0.0 0.0 0.0 2.0 5.0 10.0 1.0 0.5 0.0 3.5 2.5 3.5 2.5 2.5 3.5 1.5 21.0 22.0 21.0 23.0 2.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.0 2.0 3.5 3.0 3.5 2.0 1.5 0.0 7.0
