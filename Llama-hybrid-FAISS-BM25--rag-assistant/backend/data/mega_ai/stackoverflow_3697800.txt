You're after a code coverage program. Which unit testing framework are you using? If you're using Microsoft's built in unit test framework in VS2010 Ultimate or Premium you'll have code coverage built in. You can enable it by following these steps . If you don't have Ultimate/Premium, or you're using another framework (ie: NUnit), you could consider dotCover from JetBrains. For a free alternative, if you're using NUnit, you can download the community edition of NCover (a previously free coverage framework).
