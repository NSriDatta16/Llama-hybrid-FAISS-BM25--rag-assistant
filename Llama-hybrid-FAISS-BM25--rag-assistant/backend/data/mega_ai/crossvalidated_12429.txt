Two options: One way to get the amplitude at an arbitrary frequency (say 5.3 Hz) would be to resample the signal at a sampling rate such that the base frequency calculated by the wavelet transform would be 5.3 Hz (instead of 1.0 Hz). A more appropriate way for a frequency range (say the 8-13 Hz alpha rhythm) is to discard the wavelet transform, filter the signal in this range with a band-pass filter (say a Butterworth filter), apply the Hilbert Transform, and calculate the analytic signal amplitude. In MATLAB, the latter option would correspond to: [b a] = butter(2,[8 13]/(sampling_freq/2)); eeg_filtered = filter(b,a,eeg); eeg_amp = abs(hilbert(eeg_filtered));
