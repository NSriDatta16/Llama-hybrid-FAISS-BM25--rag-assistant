Here is a way to solve what you are trying to do: Customer c1 = new Customer(); c1.FirstName.Value = "Me"; Type t = c1.GetType(); MemberInfo[] infos = t.GetMembers(BindingFlags.NonPublic | BindingFlags.Instance); foreach (MemberInfo info in infos) { if (info.MemberType.ToString().Contains("Field")) { Console.WriteLine("Found member {0} of type {1}", info.Name, info.MemberType); } } But I agree that using a templated solution would be better.
