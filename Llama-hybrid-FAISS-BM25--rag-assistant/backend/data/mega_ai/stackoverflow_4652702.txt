jquery add text and anchor link to paragraph

Hi I have the following jQuery code that splits some content after the second paragraph, adds some other content in between, then displays the rest of the content at the end. jQuery('#bookDescription > p').slice(2).appendTo('#bookDescription'); I need to add a read more link at the end of that second paragraph that will link to and anchor link on the 3rd paragraph. Normally this would be easy to set up with just html but not sure how I can accomplish this with jQuery. So, right now I have something like this (accomplished by jQuery above: Paragraph One Paragraph Two Other content Paragraph Three Paragraph .... And I want to add: Paragraph One Paragraph Two ... Red More Other content Paragraph Three Paragraph ....
