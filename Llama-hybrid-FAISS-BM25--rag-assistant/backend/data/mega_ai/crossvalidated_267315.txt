The random effect is not a number , but a random variable , with mean 0, and standard deviation $\sigma=0.2599$ in this case. It follows a normal distribution. Something you can do is simulate a large sample of the random effect, since you know what distribution it follows, and then average the predictions, like a Monte Carlo procedure. But, also, it is likely that the R library you are using already has a prediction function for this type of regression. If you are asking about the formal way of writing the equation, it would be $$P(y=1|x,u)=\frac{1}{1+e^{-(2.6418-0.9009x+u)}},$$ where $u\sim N(0,0.2599^2)$.
