Natural Language Parsing tools: what is out there and what is not?

I'm looking for various NLP tools for a project I'm working on and right now I've found most useful the Stanford NLP projects. Does anyone know if there are other tools that are out there that would be useful for a language understander? And more importantly, are there tools that are NOT out there? Most specifically, I'm looking for an api for morphophoneme analysis etc. EDIT: I am an academic (a student working on a research project) and am mainly looking for open source or, at least, open api projects.
