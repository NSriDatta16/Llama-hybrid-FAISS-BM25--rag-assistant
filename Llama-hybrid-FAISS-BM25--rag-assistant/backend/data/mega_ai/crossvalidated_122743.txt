At least in the social sciences you often have panel data that has large N and small T asymptotics, meaning that you observe each entity for a relatively short period of time. This is why applied work with panel data is often somewhat less concerned with the time series component of the data. Nevertheless time-series elements are still important in the treatment of panel data. For instance, the degree of auto-correlation determines whether fixed effects or first differences is more efficient. In difference in differences proper treatment of the standard errors to account for autocorrelation is important for correct inference (see Bertrand et al., 2004 ). Dynamic panels using estimators for small N, large T asymptotics are also available, you often find such data in macroeconomics. There you may run into known time-series issues like panel non-stationarity. An excellent treatment of these topics is provided in Wooldridge (2010) "Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data".
