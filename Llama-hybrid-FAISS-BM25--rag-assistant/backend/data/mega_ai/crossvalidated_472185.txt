Well, "It's close enough, especially when $n$ is large" In fact, people often do use better approximations when $n$ isn't very large. Some of them are described here on Wikipedia . The Clopper-Pearson interval (described there) always has at least its claimed coverage probability, and is a lot shorter than using p=0.5. There's one setting where using $p=0.5$ actually is popular: election polling. The "maximum margin of error" that pollers quote is 1.96 times the standard error of $\hat p$ when $p=0.5$ . Election polling also shows the problem with overly-conservative intervals: if you are in a country where minor parties are important, you might want a confidence interval for a party with, say, 5% support. In a sample of 1000 people, the maximum margin of error is about 3%, so the interval would be 2%-8%, which is too wide. Worse, for a party with 2% support the interval would be -1% to 5%.
