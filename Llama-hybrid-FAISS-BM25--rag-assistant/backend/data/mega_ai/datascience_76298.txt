LSA, LDA or NMF in Topic Modeling?

I'm trying to implement Topic Modeling via Python & NLP but can't figure out what algorithm should I use. I have studied Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA), Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) but how to decide which algorithm fits best for certain task? If I just try all of them in a row then how to measure the result?
