After reading through Kingma's NIPS 2015 workshop slides , I realized that we need the reparameterization trick in order to backpropagate through a random node. Intuitively, in its original form, VAEs sample from a random node $z$ which is approximated by the parametric model $q(z \mid \phi, x)$ of the true posterior. Backprop cannot flow through a random node. Introducing a new parameter $\epsilon$ allows us to reparameterize $z$ in a way that allows backprop to flow through the deterministic nodes.
