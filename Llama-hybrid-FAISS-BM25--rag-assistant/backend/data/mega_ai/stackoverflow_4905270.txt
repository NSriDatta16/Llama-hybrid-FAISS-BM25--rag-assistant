I've done this with a pretty reasonable degree of success, mapping denormalized tables into a normalized entity framework, and vice versa. I started out by using the designer provided with entity framework, you can actually drag and drop properties around the diagram to build new entities... However, I'm of the opinion that the UI + tools for doing this isn't quite there yet in terms of automation or ease of use. Some stuff just doesn't map the way you expect or want it. If you plan on doing a lot of denormalization you will end up doing a lot of hand editing of the XML behind the designer. This is what I've had to do for a while now on my most recent project.
