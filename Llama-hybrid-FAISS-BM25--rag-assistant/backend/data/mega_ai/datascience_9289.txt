I don't get the assertion that a sum of temperature loses pertinence $$ \text{avg}(T) = \frac{\text{sum}(T)}{n} $$ $$ \frac{\text{avg}(\text{Revenue})}{\text{avg}(\text{Temp})} = \frac{\frac{\text{sum}(\text{Revenue})}{ n}}{\frac{\text{sum}(\text{Temp})}{n}} = \frac{\text{sum}(\text{Revenue})}{\text{sum}(\text{Temp}) } $$ Now multiply does lack meaning if the value is not 0 based 200 degrees 째F (Fahrenheit) is not twice as hot 100 째F As 째F is not zero based You need to translate to absolute - 째R (Rankine) (200 + 459.67) / (100 + 459.67) = 1.17867672 Not sure what term you want to call it but I think you are describing linear zero based properties Like $\log$ is not linear $\frac{\log(a)}{\log(b)} \ne \frac{a}{b}$ (even if $a$ and $b$ are zero based) Spacial data does not add, subtract, or average in a simple linear manner.
