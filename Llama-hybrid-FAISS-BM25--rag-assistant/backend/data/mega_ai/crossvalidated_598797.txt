Sorry to revive an oldie, but a student asked me about this. I might be looking at the wrong end of the stick, but the answer by @GavinSimpson seems to me a bit on a tangent, not really aiming at a key distinction between the two methods. A PCA can be run either on a correlation matrix or a covariance matrix. If you run it on the correlation matrix (instead of the covariance matrix), then the absolute values are not being considered. Any multiplication of a row by a constant would not change the results. So the main difference between PCA and a CA must be something else. Underneath the hood, the PCA considers Euclidean distances between points, the CA a qui-squared distances between points. In practice the CA seems to work better with non-continous data (as in nominal, categorical, a considerable amout of 0's, etc). If someone can explain what is the difference in methods regarding the linear algebra underneath the hood in a way that is diggestable to humans, then hats off to them and please post here as I'd love to read it.
