Ok, I believe the way we can look at your problem with a multinomial distribution. Like the binomial models the sorting of N balls into 2 containers, the multinomial models the sorting of N balls into m containers. So in this case, take a gene (call it gene1), this gene has N_1 molecules. If you have an equal probability of these molecules ending up in each of the R vials, then on average, you will get $N_1 /R$ molecules in each vial. Now, since we hope that the partitioning acts the same for each gene, this means that we now have a probability model for this situation, ie independence between genes, the joint distribution is now the product of multinomials. This means that if $y_{ij}$ represents the number of molecules of gene i in vial j, we have the probaiblity model: $$f(y_{11} .... y_{I,J}) = \prod_{i=1}^I \prod_{j=1}^J Multinomial(N_i, (1/2, ... 1/2)) =\prod_{i=1}^I \prod_{j=1}^J \frac{N_x}{y_{ij}!} p_{ij}^{y_{ij}} $$ Great, we now have a statistical model for this phenomenon. Now we can compute the variance. When we deal with just one gene, we have a multinomial $(y_{1,i}, ... y_{I,i}) \sim $Multinomial(N_i, (1/2, ... 1/2), so you can get right from the wiki that: $$Var(Y_i) = n_i p_i (1-p_i) = N_i (1/2)^2 = 4 N_i$$ $$Cov(Y_i,Y_j) = -n_i p_i p_j = -\frac{N_i}{4} $$ Now when we upgrade to the multiple gene situation, since we are assuming independnece between genes, this becomes the product-multinomial distribution. The variance matrix of the product-multinomial would give you what you are looking for.
