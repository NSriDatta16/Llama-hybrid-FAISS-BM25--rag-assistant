Java Persistence API (JPA) is the 'official' Sun/Oracle ORM for Java. It's heavily based on Hibernate but with a more limited feature set, so I think that makes it easier to learn. It is also annotation based (there is usually just one XML file for the database connection). There is more than one implementation of JPA: OpenJPA , EclipseLink and Hibernate are some well-known implementations; I use the Hibernate JPA implementation because I can then use Hibernate-specific extensions when JPA doesn't do what I want it to. Also, the Sun JPA tutorial is exactly five pages :-) http://download.oracle.com/javaee/6/tutorial/doc/bnbpz.html
