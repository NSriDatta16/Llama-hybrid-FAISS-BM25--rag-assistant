It seems like you're writing a lot of unnecessary code, but perhaps that's just because it's out of context and there's more to it that I'm missing. To get the image: [[UIImage imageName: @"bottom_part.png"] stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth: 27 topCapHeight: 9]; What part of your code are you displaying this image? i.e. in what method call are you drawing the images above? Why not just use a UIImageView and put the image in there? Then you don't need to do any of the image context drawing etc.
