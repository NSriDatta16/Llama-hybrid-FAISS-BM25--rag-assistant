What is the best way for non-developers to create XAML Grids?

We need to have non-developers create dozens of input forms with XAML. The best solution I found was the free XAML Power Toys since you can create and edit grids visually, also create from classes. I took a look at Blend 3 quickly, dragged a Grid into my Window but found no options to actually create, say, a 4 x 10 grid with labels. I thought Blend would have these kinds of options so that designers could quickly design a grid with label/control pairs. Am I missing something about Blend, or does it really not have any input form designing features?
