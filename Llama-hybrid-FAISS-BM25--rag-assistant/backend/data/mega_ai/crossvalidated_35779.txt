Essentially what you have is an error term with a nonzero mean. Consequently the assumptions required for OLS to be appropriate are violated. So you should use OLS directly. However if q is known subtract it from the Y^$_i$s and apply OLS using the variance of the error term which is σ$^2$$_ν$+σ$^2$$_e$. Given that this is a time series even after inclusion of the covariate X$_i$ there may still be some autocorrelation structure left in the series. So it might be appropriate to also include some autoregressive and/or moving average terms.
