How large a study would you need to deal with the 10X programmer?

The theory of the 10X programmer states that there is a range of 10X between the fastest and slowest programmer with a given amount of experience. Or in other words, if the fastest programmer takes 10 minutes, the slowest programmer in the group takes 100 minutes to perform the same task. I have two groups, lets say group A uses Test Driven Development and group B, the control group, doesn't. I find that on average group A is 30% faster than group B, with the usual 10X range in both groups. How many people do I need in each group for this finding to be statistically meaningful?
