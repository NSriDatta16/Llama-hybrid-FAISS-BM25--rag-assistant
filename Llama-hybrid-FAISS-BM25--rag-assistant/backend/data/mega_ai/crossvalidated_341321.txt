Bayesian statistic in model comparison

I am trying to use the Bayesian statistic in model comparison. Let's say I have 4 different pharmacokinetic models which I use to fit breast MRI data. Each of this model M gives me a certain number of parameters: M1: K12 and K21 for the first one (2 params) M2: K12 K21 and v for the second one (3 params) M3: k12 k21 v and t for the third one (4 params) M4: s1 s2 s3 v1 v2 v3 k1 k2 k3 g for the fourth one (9 params) Now I would like to make a model comparison with the Bayesian statistics. I know I have, for the first two: P(M1|D) / P(M2|D) = P(D1|M1) / P(D2|M2) * P(M1)/P(M2) I know that the Bayes factor is proportional to the log of the likelihood but: Is it simply the residual sum of squares over the number of data points? what is the prior probability of each model? Thank you. I really appreciate any help.
