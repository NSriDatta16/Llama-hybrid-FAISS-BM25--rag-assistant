How to calculate probability from logistic regression using interaction effect parameter?

I have a logistic regression (logit link) model that I use to estimate probabilities. In the absence of interaction effects this formula is given in a lot of references as $$p_i = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-\Sigma\beta_ix_i}}$$ However, I can find no reference to an explicit formula for probability estimates when the model parameters contain interaction effects. I currently have these coefficients from an analysis in R, but need to calculate the probabilities in a C++ application (and unable to do so). Could anyone provide the formula for the general case with multiple interaction effects please (or a reference to it / source code) ?
