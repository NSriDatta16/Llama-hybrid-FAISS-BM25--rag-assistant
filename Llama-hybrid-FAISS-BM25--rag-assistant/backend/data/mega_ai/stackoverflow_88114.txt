Technically, converting a result set to an XML file is straight forward and doesn't need any tool unless you have a requirement to convert the data structure to fit specific export schema. In general the result set gets the top-level element of an XML file, then you produce a number of record elements containing attributes, which effectively are the fields of a record. When it comes to Java, for example, you just need appropriate JDBC driver for interfacing with DBMS of your choice addressing the database independency requirement (usually provided by a DBMS vendor), and a few lines of code to read a result set and print out an XML string per record, per field. Not a difficult task for an average Java developer in my opinion. Anyway, the more concrete purpose you state the more concrete answer you get.
