This is a broad question that I would answer by a no. Regression to the mean is about interpretation fallacy of a test result Regression to the mean is primarily a phenomenon that consists in observing that an extreme event is likely to be associated with a less extreme future event. This phenomenon can be the cause of many badly designed inductions leading to wrong interpretations. I remember an enlightening example from the book "Think fast, think slow" by D. Kahneman. During a lecture of his to flight instructors on rewarding students being much more effective than blaming them when teaching, an instructor in the audience told him of his experience that when he rewards a student for excellent performance, the next performance was generally not an improvement, while when another is blamed for a bad performance, that student generally does better afterwards. The observation was mostly due to the regression to the mean effect: performances are subject to random perturbations and an extreme one is more likely to be followed by a less extreme one. (I do not have the book at hand but remember its words as enlightening (and more generally I really enjoyed the book).) More generally, one can imagine a standardized experiment, where one group is people with good performance (G1) and another with people with bad performance (G2) to see whether they will improve on their next performance. Why not? If all students have the same performance on average (with independent realisations), then the test will conclude that G1 got worse and that G2 got better (on average). The test is valid but the interpretation of its result may be wrong if one does not care about the regression to the mean effect. Power analysis is about minimal sample size to conclusive test Power analysis is dedicated to control type 2 error when testing an hypothesis having built the groups whatever they are. And they may be wrongly built cause of the regression to the mean phenomenon! So the two concepts are pretty different.
