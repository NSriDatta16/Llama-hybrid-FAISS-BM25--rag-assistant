I need help clarifying the term forecast interval

I am reading Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting by Douglas Montgomery et al. They describe the term forecast interval as: The forecast interval is the frequency with which new forecasts are prepared. For example, in production planning, we might forecast demand on a monthly basis, for up to three months (the lead time or horizon), and prepare a new forecast each month. Thus the forecast interval is one month, the same as the basic period of time for which each forecast is made. Generally forecast interval is used interchangeably with prediction interval. However, in this case I have hard time understanding what exactly it means. Is it the same as one-step prediction vs multiple-step prediction? The part of the book (page 5) that discusses this does not include an example.
