modeling cumulative effect of a winter

I am trying to make a model that predicts the survival rate of wildlife based on the severity of an entire winter. The idea is that colder weather in combination with lots of snow has a negative effect (the colder it is the longer the snow lasts). It might be cold winter with lots of snow, but if the cold and snow did not occur in the same month it would have less of an effect. In order to preserve the interaction of snow and temp, we want to use monthly data, but our survival will always be for the entire winter. It doesn't really matter which month the bad weather occurs in so I am hesitant to use month as a variable. Is there some technique that I can use where it preserves the interaction of snow and temp each month but uses the cumulative effect of all months in a winter to predict survival? example of what the data looks like: Year1 survival = 0.9 month temp snow m1 -5 20 m2 -15 20 m3 -20 100 m4 2 100 Year2 survival = 0.7 month temp snow m1 -5 20 m2 -18 110 m3 -20 100 m4 -11 20 Temp was the average temperature for the month, and snow was the sum of all snow in a month. I'm not sure where the comment about order statistics is going but if it makes a difference daily data is available.
