My approach has been to log to a remote service, keyed by a unique user ID or GUID. The overhead isn't very high with the usual async calls. You can cache messages locally, too, either in RAM or in isolated storage -- perhaps as a backup in case the network isn't accessible. Be sure to watch for duplicate events within a certain time window. You don't want to log 1,000 copies of the same Exception over a period of a few seconds. Also, I like to log more than just errors. You can also log performance data, such as how long certain functions take to execute (particularly out-of-process calls), or more detailed data in response to the user explicitly entering into a "debug and report" mode. Checking for calls that take longer than a certain threshold is also useful to help catch regressions and preempt user complaints.
