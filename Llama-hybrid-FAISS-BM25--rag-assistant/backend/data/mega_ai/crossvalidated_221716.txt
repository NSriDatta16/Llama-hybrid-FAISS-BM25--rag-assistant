How to generate heteroskedastic data for linear regression analysis given Y

I have at m different points on a surface representing an organ n measures of a organ property for n subjects (such as wall thickness). These values have been stored in a matrix Y with m columns and n rows. The measures at different points are highly correlated - the correlation coefficient between two columns of Y always ranges between 0.6 and 0.9. For each column $\tilde{Y}$ of Y I have computed a linear regression model of the form $ \tilde{Y} = \beta X $ where X is a vector which contains n values of a variable such as age or height - one for each subject. X is always the same for all the m regression models. By doing this, I am trying to test at all the points of the surface where there is a significant association between the values at that point and the variable in X - age for example. By using this approach (mass univariate analysis) I could discover the regional effects of that clinical variable on the organ. However, as the number of points under study is greater than 100k, I have to apply to the p-values associated to each correlation coefficient a multiple testing correction that I have specifically created for this problem. Unfortunately, the data are heteroscedastic and therefore one of the linear regression assumptions is violated and I would like to test how the failing of this assumptions affects the results that I have obtained. In particular, in order to test that I would like to generate a vector X with no relationship ($\beta=0$) with $ \tilde{Y}$ and that would make the variance of Y unequal along the range of X (heteroskedasticy). But in doing so, I would like to maitain untouched the values of Y as I believe that the correlation between its columns plays an important role. Do you have any idea/suggestion on how I can generate such data, please? I already succeed to generate heteroskedastic data by generating X using a normal distribution and by adding to each column of Y an additional term generated with a normal distribution with mean 0 an variance equal to X, but in this way I am losing the correlation between the columns of Y.
