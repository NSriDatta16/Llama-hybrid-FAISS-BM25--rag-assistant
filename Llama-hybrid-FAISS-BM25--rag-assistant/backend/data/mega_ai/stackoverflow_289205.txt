Try reading the very first paragraph of the Wikipedia article on duck typing. Duck typing on Wikipedia I can have an interface (IRunnable) that defines the method Run(). If I have another class with a method like this: public void RunSomeRunnable(IRunnable rn) { ... } In a duck type friendly language I could pass in any class that had a Run() method into the RunSomeRunnable() method. In a statically typed language the class being passed into RunSomeRunnable needs to explicitly implement the IRunnable interface. "If it Run() like a duck" variant is more like object in .NET at least.
