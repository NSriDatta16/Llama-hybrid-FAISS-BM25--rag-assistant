subversion and tortoisesvn: branching / moving directory

my company'scode is in a subversion repository, and it has worked well so far. I followed the advice on how to setup the repository, i.e. I have branches/tags/trunk sub-directories. But I now want to be a bit more organised, and have 2 meta-branches, dev and release. The former is obviously for development purpose, where the engineers can try different weird things , whereas the latter would be for stable code that is product-ready. All new features would first live in "dev" while being developed, and once deemed ok, they would be merged onto the "release" branch once in a while. Commit to the "release" would only come from such merges plus normal bug. Each of these meta-branches would contain the normal branches/tags/trunk sub-directories. The problem I have is I cannot for the life of me set this up. I have created the 2 meta-branches, moved all the existing subdirectories into "dev", and I now want to move the "dev"'s trunk into the "release" trunk. But I cannot figure how to. If I switch (from TortoiseSVN), it simply deletes everything, because the "release" trunk is empty. If I try to create a branch 'release/trunk' from 'dev/trunk', tortoisesvn complains that the path does not exist. I cannot figure out what to do. This should be simple shouldnt it? I'd guess many people uses a similar organization, dev vs. release?! Any advices/comments/ideas welcome. Thanks in advance. A
