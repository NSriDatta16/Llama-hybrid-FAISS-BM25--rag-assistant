I've handled the problem as followed: In the dragOver event handler: start a timer to determine how long the user has dragged the item over the current item if the current item has no childs, add a new child with the title "drop item here" remove the the added child after the item has been dropped (in the dragComplete handler) or the user moved the dragged item away from the current item (in the dragOver handler)
