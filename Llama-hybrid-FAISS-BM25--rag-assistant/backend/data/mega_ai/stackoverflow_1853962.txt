The problem is that there are two types of speech recognition engines. Speaker-trained ones such as Dragon are good for dictation. They can recognize almost any spoke text with fairly good accuracy, but require (a) training by the user, and (b) a good microphone. Speaker-independent speech rec engines are most often used in telephony. They require no "training" by the user, but must know ahead of time exactly what words are expected. The application development effort to create these grammars (and deal with errors) is huge. Telephony is limited to a 4Khz bandwidth due to historical limits in our public phone network. This limited audio quality greatly hampers the speech rec engines' ability to "hear" what people are saying. Digits such as "six" or "seven" contain an ssss sound that is particularly hard for the engines to distinguish. This means that recognizing strings of digits, one of the most basic recognition tasks, is problematic. Add in regional accents, where "nine" is pronounced "nan" in some places, and accuracy really suffers. The best hope are interfaces that combine graphics and speech rec. Think of an IPhone application that you can control with your voice.
