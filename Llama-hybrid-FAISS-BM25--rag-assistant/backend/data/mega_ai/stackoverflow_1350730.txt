If you happen to have it handy (and I assume you do), you can use a SQL Server Agent job to make a request to an ASP.NET page that sends the email. Here's some example code: http://nicholasclarke.co.uk/blog/2008/01/16/web-request-from-sql-server-via-c/ Of course, since you're using SQL Server to call CLR code anyway, you could just have that code send out the emails (via System.Net.Mail) rather than requesting a page on IIS to do so. To do this, SQL Server would need: Access to all of the data needed to send the emails Outbound firewall access to send an email CLR code that encapsulates all of the logic needed to know where/what to send.
