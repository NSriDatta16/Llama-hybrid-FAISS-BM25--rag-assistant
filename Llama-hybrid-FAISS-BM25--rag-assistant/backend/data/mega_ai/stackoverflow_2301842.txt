I got it to work (eventually). The following sub did the trick: Private Sub Create_PDF_Click() Dim myPath As String Dim strReportName As String DoCmd.OpenReport "Invoices", acViewPreview myPath = "C:\Documents and Settings\" strReportName = Report_Invoices.[Client Organisations_Code] + "-" + Report_Invoices.Clients_Code + "-" + Report_Invoices.Invoices_Code + "-" + Format(Report_Invoices.[Invoice Date], "yyyy") + ".pdf" DoCmd.OutputTo acOutputReport, "", acFormatPDF, myPath + strReportName, True DoCmd.Close acReport, "Invoices" End Sub Two caveats: The report needs to be opened before printing. Refer to fields by the same name that the report sees it as. That [Client Organisations].Code was [Client Organisations_Code] in the report.
