From mod_rewrite to isapi_rewrite

I have a Modx htaccess file which needs to be rewritten from mod_rewrite to isapi_rewrite 2. Can someone please help me? The following lines need to be changed for isapi_rewrite 2: Options +FollowSymlinks RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} ^.*internal\ dummy\ connection.*$ [NC] RewriteRule .* - [F,L] RewriteRule ^(manager|assets) - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule ^(.*)$ index.php?q=$1 [L,QSA] Many thanks.
