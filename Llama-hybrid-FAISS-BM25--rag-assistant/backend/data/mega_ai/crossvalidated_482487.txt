Your problem really is a named-entity-recognition problem or more generally sequence-labeling problem -- which is as you correctly say a supervised learning problem. To learn the labeling, you need to preprocess the data, i.e., find the entities in the text and assign the ground truth labels. Typically, the BIO encoding (beginning, inside, outside) is used. Here is an example: Buy the newest Space Shuttle T5 from the Space Y Corporation . O O O B-Product I I O O B-Company I I . Once you have the data in such a format, you can use any sequence-labeling approaches (LSTM, LSTM+CRF, BERT+CRF, ...) to fit a model. This repo IMO looks quite good: https://github.com/kamalkraj/BERT-NER
