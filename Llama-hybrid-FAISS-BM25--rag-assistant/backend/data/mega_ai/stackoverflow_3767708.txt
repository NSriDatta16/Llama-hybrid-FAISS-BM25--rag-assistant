WPF drag and drop from a ListBox that has SelectionMode=Extended

I have a ListBox and want the selection-mode to be extended. Also I want have to implement drag and drop functionality. The problem now is, that if the mouse is clicked on a selected item, it will be immediately be selected as single selection instead of waiting to the mouse-up-event for doing this. Due to this behaviour, start dragging multiple items is for the user quasi impossible because always he clicks on the selection to start dragging, the selection changes to the item that is under the mouse and starts the drag-operation with this item. Is there a good workaround for this problem or does even exists an official solution?
