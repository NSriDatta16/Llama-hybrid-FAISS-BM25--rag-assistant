This was bugging me too but finally got it working. Unfortunately, I can't reproduce what I did it but here's my list of actions for your information. The project causing the problem was one I'd downloaded from Apple and tweaked. Interestingly, I could still launch my own projects fine. So, here's a list of actions that I did (note that none of the actions below worked just by itself): - closing the simulator and doing "clear file history" - restarting simulator - rebooting - restarting xcode - resetting the iPhone with Reset Content and Settings However, by the time I'd tried all of the above with a fresh version of the code I'd downloaded - it was working again. Just out of interest, I dragged the project that was causing this problem back to the desktop and it was OK now.
