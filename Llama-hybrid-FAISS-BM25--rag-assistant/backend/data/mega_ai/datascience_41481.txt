Do anomalous input features to autoencoder result in high errors on the corresponding output features?

An autoencoder is trained by replicating each training instance to both input and output. However, when predicting for anomaly detection, will the output error be local to the same output feature(s) that were anomalous inputs e.g. if I have 10 features, and I predict with anomalous input on feature #4, will the high output error be limited to output feature #4 as well, or will high error appear on other outputs? The whole detection becomes more useful if localised to specific features.
