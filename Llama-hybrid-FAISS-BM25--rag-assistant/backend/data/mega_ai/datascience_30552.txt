The task you are trying to perform is called semantic segmentation (or pixel-wise segmentation). There exists extensive literature on the subject and numerous tutorials/online resources to get you started, such as this one Fully convolutional networks (FCN) popularized the core components of state-of-the-art semantic segmentation techniques. They have since evolved into numerous superior, yet related, networks, many of which are covered in the link above. Although the linked website is quite comprehensive, it does not mention mask rcnn , which has performed very well and at relatively fast speeds (~5 fps). It is definitely worth exploring!
