My workplace uses PrintKey , which stays resident in the system tray until you press the print screen button, which brings up the user interface, allowing you to drag a rectangle to capture, save, and print. At home, I use the print screen button, when copies the desktop in to the clipboard, and I paste it in to MS Paint.
