Rather than when to use or not use the language types versus explicit BCL class names, it is more important to know whether or not the type you intend to use is CLS Compliant. Specifically, the unsigned integer types are not CLS compliant because there is no requirement that a language support unsigned integer math. Other than this wrinkle... I would recommend whichever idiom is more in keeping with your organizations code practices. If you fully namespace your type references, then I would continue that pattern with the System.* namespace... (I would also recommend against that practice, though, as it adds reader load without attendant gain in clarity).
