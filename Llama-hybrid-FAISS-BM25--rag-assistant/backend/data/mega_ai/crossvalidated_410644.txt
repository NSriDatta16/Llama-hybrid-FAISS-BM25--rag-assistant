conversion prediction / ROC curve using markov chains for channel attribution

I am currently working on a project on multi-channel attribution, using the channel attribution package from Altomare & Loris (2018) , which uses markov chains for attribution. A walk-through of the methodology is described in this article. My plan was to compare their model with two other ones based on their predictive accuracy (predicting conversion 0 or 1), by analyzing their ROC curves (similar to Anderl, Becker & von Wangenheim, 2016) . However, I do not know or understand the logic of how i can use the output of the channel attribution package which uses a markov model (giving removal effects, transition matrix, attribution weights) to develop a predictive model of conversion, as is commonly done in the literature (and which can be used in the RCOR package). Any help here would be greatly appreciated!
