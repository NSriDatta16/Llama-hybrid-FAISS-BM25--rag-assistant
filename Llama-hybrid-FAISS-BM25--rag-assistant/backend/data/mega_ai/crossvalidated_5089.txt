If your norm is a hilbert space norm (for example root mean square error, also called hilbert schmidt norm in the case of matrices or l^2 norm if you take them as vectors) then obtaining the solution is a first year calculous exercise if you rephrase things using: $c=(\langle Y,X_i \rangle)_{i=1,\dots,k}$ and $A=(\langle X_j,X_i \rangle)_{j,i=1,\dots,k}$ ($c$ is a vector and $A$ a $k\times k$ matrix). The solution to your problem is given by solving $A\theta^*=c$ no need for optimization !
