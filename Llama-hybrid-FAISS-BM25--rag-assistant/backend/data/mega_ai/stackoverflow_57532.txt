Is it necessary to reach 100% code coverage? Indeed, is it even possible under normal (i.e. controllable, testable) circumstances? We often find that using "syntactic sugar" constructions like the using {} block, there are "hidden" code paths created (most likely finally {} or catch {} blocks) that can't be exercised unless some environmental condition (like a broken socket or broken disk) gets in the way.
