How to check memory leak?

Is it possible to check the memory leak without going into the code. I have the application with me and I want to check whether there is memory leak or not. In my present organisation, I check the cpu usage before and after running the application as well as the cpu usage of the process of the application. But I don't think this is the correct method. Please advise me in this regard.
