Javascript draggable div does not trigger scroll

I have a simple Javascript drag function. You can see it here: http://jsfiddle.net/XpAyA/12/ The red #dragger div is draggable. It is nested in an overflow scroll div but it doesn't trigger a "scroll" when it gets over the limit. Probably due to the fact that it is positioned absolute. Is there a way yo fix this? Make the scroll happen when it exceeds the limits? Thank you
