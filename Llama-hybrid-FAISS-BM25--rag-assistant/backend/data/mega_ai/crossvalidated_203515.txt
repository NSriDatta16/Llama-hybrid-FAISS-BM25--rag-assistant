So in general your problem is how to use discrete features. There are many ways to do that, but here is what I would suggest as a first pass. Convert each feature into boolean variables. For example $x_{Main}$ = 1 if street is Main and 0 otherwise and construct a variable like that for every street. The do the same for other variables. If you have a huge number of these new booleans you could eliminate the ones that have for example only a single 1 or only a few ones, or the ones that are all zeros etc... Since you are saying you want to predict the probability of a sale you should use something like logistic regression. Use all these variables (as well as the numeric ones) as your regressors and put a penalty. You should read more about penalized regressions to make sure you know what you are doing but this could be a possible way to go. Of course you could bundle some of these categories together, or figure out which streets are in one district and use district as a regressor etc. But if you have a lot of levels and a lot of data a penalized regression might be a good start.
