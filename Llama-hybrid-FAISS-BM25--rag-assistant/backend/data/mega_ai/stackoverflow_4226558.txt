Prevent ListView from changing selection when mouse moved with button down

I have a ListView with Extended SelectionMode. By default when I press a left button down it selects an item and when I move the mouse cursor (slowly) it moves the selection (as long as the button is still down). Since I am implementing Drag and Drop on top of the list it becomes a little annoying. How can I prevent it from changing a selected item when a mouse button is down? I've tried to say e.Handled=true in the PreviewMouseMove but it didn't help.
