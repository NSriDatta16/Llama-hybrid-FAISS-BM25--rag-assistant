The model from Imperial College is an agent based model . So probably that individual infectiousness will be some factor in further calculations for the probability of transmission during contacts between the different individuals. I could not exactly trace back the description of the model or the methods. There is a lot of referencing backwards in time. In the supplemental information of this reference https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04017 a description is given of infectiousness being either 0 or 1. This infectiousness is used in the computation of the probability for an individual to get infected, which is some sort of weighted sum of several paremeters among which infectiousness of the individuals that one encounters plays a role.
