UpdatePanel driving me insane - Dynamicly Created UpdatePanel Problem

So, I have the following code in Page_Load: updDesignations = new UpdatePanel(); updDesignations.ContentTemplateContainer.Controls.Add(toutLineDesignation); updDesignations.ChildrenAsTriggers = true; updDesignations.UpdateMode = UpdatePanelUpdateMode.Always; divDesignations.Controls.AddAt(0,updDesignations); When I click on a Linkbutton within this dynamically created update panel, the appropriate event handler is called on the server. However, any changes made are not persisted back to the client, and the HTTP response from the update panel AJAX call is always empty: The request is properly formed, and includes the correct form submission information, the response is simply this: Server Microsoft-IIS/5.1 Date Tue, 07 Apr 2009 22:30:57 GMT X-Powered-By ASP.NET X-AspNet-Version 2.0.50727 Cache-Control no-cache, no-store Pragma no-cache Expires -1 Content-Length 0 This is driving me nuts, as this has to be a dynamicly created update panel. What am I doing wrong?
