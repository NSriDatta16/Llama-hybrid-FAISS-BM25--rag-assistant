What's new in iPhone SDK 3.2?

Apparently it is available ( www.apple.com/ipad/sdk/ ), but I can't find a changelog... Not used to apple.com though. Does anybody have detailed information? What I would like to know is : are there any new API or did they only add iPad stuff? Edit : I am not asking for implementation-level details, I would just like to know the features added for iPhone, if any. Do you really think this falls under the NDA? Pragmatically,do you really think Apple would track down, kick-out and/or sue the developer who gives the information? I don't see how it would hurt Apple's interests... Everybody has public APIs, even MS for Job's sake (ah ah - sorry could'nt resist). Well anyway maybe there is somebody authorized to tell the world (somebody from Apple?) somewhere on this Internet... PS. I have no account at Apple, because I know that the previous SDK do not have the APIs I require for my app, so I work on other mobile platforms for the moment. This is why I cannot access the information myself. Edit-2 : Here is some information I gathered on the net: SDK 3.2 beta is not supported by iPhone (only iPad). As far as I am concerned, this settles things up, I am not interested in iPad dev. It is now possible to use VoIP over a 3G connection iCall have updated their app for iPhone and officially announced it . But this is not part of the SDK beta, is it? external displays are supported I am putting this question under community wiki, in case some of you would like to expand this list (keeping in mind that NDA bound developers shall not contribute), or correct false or inaccurate information.
