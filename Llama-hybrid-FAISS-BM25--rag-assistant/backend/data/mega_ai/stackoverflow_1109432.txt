You do not really query datasets in the way you would query a database because they are objects with collections of objects. Rather you would iterate through collections of objects pulling out what you want and then casting this output into an appropriate data type. 'for each' loops are one option. the first google link for 'ado.net datatable' .... http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163709.aspx has what you need about half way down. Obviously you don't care about the ado.net connection parts. This code fragment is maybe more useful - shorter and shows the iteration clearly. http://www.eggheadcafe.com/articles/20030903.asp Alternativley, given the languages you are listing, you may want to ask for a more universal data format ... such as XML as you suggest .... this would be a more language independent format to use. Its easy to publish a new web service method that will return the same dataset as an xml document in a string format ... simply use the to xml method of the dataset, pipe that into an Xdocument and .toString() it ...
