In Gtk, how do I make a CellRendererToggle in a TreeViewColumn with multiple CellRenderers only get toggled when the checkbox itself is clicked?

I have a TreeModel representing a tree of Tag s. Each Tag has these properties, among others: string Name bool Active Tag Parent TagList Children //basically just a List The TreeView has a single column, with two CellRenderer s: a CellRendererToggle for Active , and a CellRendererText for Name . I want them in the same column, because multiple columns gets messy as you get farther down the descendants in the TreeView . My problem is that when I click anywhere in the column, the CellRendererToggle is toggled. This is problematic, because I want to do things like dragging the tags, and renaming them inline. Is there any way to make the CellRendererToggle only get toggled when I click on the checkbox itself, without moving it to a separate column?
