Should I use random fixed mutation or random percentual mutation?

I'm evolving neural networks, partly by mutating connection weights and neuron biases. Right now i'm mutating weights as follows: modification = random() * 2 - 1; // number between -1 and 1 weight += modification But I realised that for smaller weights (e.g. 0.03 ) this modification might be too big. Should I change this code to percentual mutation, like this: // Mutate the weight between -10% and 10% weight = weight * (1 + (random() * 0.2 - 0.1)); Which technique is better? Are there any papers on percentual mutation? Edit: i'm noticing much better performance with the fixed mutation
