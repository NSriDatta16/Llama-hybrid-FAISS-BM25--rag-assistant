Have arrays lost (some) significance? Yes. For many tasks requiring a 'table' of items there now are more flexible and useful solutions like List<> and IEnumerable<> . Have arrays lost their importance? No. They are the fastest form of storage and they are used 'under the hood' in most of the collection classes, System.String etc. So, arrays have become more low-level, and an application programmer will be using them directly less often.
