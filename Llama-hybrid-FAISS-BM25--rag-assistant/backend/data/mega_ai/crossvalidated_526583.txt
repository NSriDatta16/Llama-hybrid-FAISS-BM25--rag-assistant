Logistic regression as a 2-layer neural network?

In the Keras documentation, an example states that a 2-layer neural network with 32 input neurons and 16 output neurons combined with a softmax activation on the output layer is equivalent to logistic regression. I haven't seen a formulation of logistic regression involving neurons before and I am having trouble seeing how to show that they are equivalent mathematically. Can anyone explain or point me towards some resources that might help?
