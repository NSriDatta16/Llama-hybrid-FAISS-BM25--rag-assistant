Yes, you most likely should take those to be 0. Note that you are using a linear model (in kernel space) so you can definitely get values outside the $[0,1]$ range. Practically speaking, if you're interested in discrete output, you would likely be better off just using a classifier rather than regression - this was referred to by (I believe) Scholkopf et. all in their OC-SVM paper as not solving a more general problem than one has to (that was in the context of low density rejection as opposed to full density estimation).
