I don't mean to be discouraging, but I doubt you'll get a very useful answer to this question because there are way too many variables here (a cluster file-system, asynchronous I/O, O_DIRECT , etc.), and unless someone is very familiar with your setup in particular, the best anyone can do is give you vague advice. I guess you should start by trying to determine whether it's the actual write that's slow, or whether it's the invocation of the async callback handler that's taking long. You can try replacing the calls to aio_write with regular synchronous write calls. Also, the write sizes you mention seem pretty small, so why are you using O_DIRECT ? I would think O_DIRECT would decrease performance here, if there are many small writes.
