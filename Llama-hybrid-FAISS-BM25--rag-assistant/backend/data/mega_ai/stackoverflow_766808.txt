How about this (blending a few answers together)? I think it conveys the meaning well and should handle the edge cases (rounding to the next minute) elegantly due to AddSeconds . // truncate to multiple of 5 int second = 5 * (int) (now.Second / 5); DateTime dt = new DateTime(..., second); // round-up if necessary if (now.Second % 5 > 2.5) { dt = dt.AddSeconds(5); } The Ticks approach as shown by Jay is more concise, but may be a bit less readable. If you use that approach, at least reference TimeSpan.TicksPerSecond .
