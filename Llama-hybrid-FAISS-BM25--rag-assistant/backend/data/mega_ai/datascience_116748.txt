Image classification architecture for dataset with 710 classes, 90,000 subclasses, and anywhere from 10-1000 images per subclass?

Been struggling with finding the best approach to handle this scenario, I'm also a novice when it comes to machine learning. I have a dataset of around 700 classes, 90,000 total subclasses, and anywhere from 10 - 1000 images per subclass of the object. For this example, let's say the 1st class is a musical group, and the subclasses are album cover art. I want to be able to quickly match an image of an album cover to which band and album it belongs to, which architecture can I use to handle this? I am not too familiar with working with such large datasets and this kind of class/subclass structure and am a bit stumped. Thank you
