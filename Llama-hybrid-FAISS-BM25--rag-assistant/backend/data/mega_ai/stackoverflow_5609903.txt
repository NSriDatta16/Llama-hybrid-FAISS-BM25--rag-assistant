An elegant solution is to use CSS cascading. HTML: CSS: .c1 { background: #fff } .c2 { background: #eee } .loadimages .c1 { background: url(big1.jpg); } .loadimages .c2 { background: url(big2.jpg); } JS (on load or whenever you're ready): document.getElementsByTagName('body')[0].className += 'loadimages'; Most browsers only load unused images as needed, or load it after the window load event is fired. However, images are also put in the load queue in the order that they are encountered, so even if the JS above is executed on DOM ready, it will still load the images after all the other images that are not cascaded behind the .loadimage class.
