Iphone & iPad - how to exclude a resource from a target?

I have two targets on my project - iPad and iPhone. Some resources, as interface images, are exclusively for iPad and others for iPhone. How do I exclude an image, for example, of being included on a given target. This project of mine was created using that "transition" stuff and groups were created: Resources-iPad and Resources-iPhone. I have organized each resource inside one of these groups. Even so, every final product has both resources. Am I missing something? thanks for any help.
