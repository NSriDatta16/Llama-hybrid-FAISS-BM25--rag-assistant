Variance of linear combination of Normal distributions

A company that develops software received an order for a service to be performed within a week and, in order to decide on the profile of the team of programmers to be used, it should take into account that: The total number of lines of code (commands, instructions) to be developed is approximately 30 thousand. The productivity of your most experienced programmers, in hourly commands, follows a with an average of 50 and a standard deviation of 15. The productivity of its less experienced programmers, in hourly commands, follows a with a mean of 30 and a standard deviation of 10. Each programmer works six hours a day, five days a week. What is the probability that the service will be ready in a week if the team consists of 10 more experienced programmers and 20 less experienced programmers? Solution: Let P be the team productivity, X the productivity of most experienced programmers and Y the productivity of less experienced programmers: $X \sim N(50, 15^2)$ $Y \sim N(30, 10^2)$ $P = 10X + 20Y$ Since P is a linear combination of Normal distributions: $E[P] = 10E[X] + 20E[Y] = 10(50) + 20(30) = 1100$ $Var(P) = 10^2Var[X] + 20^2Var[Y] = 10^2(15^2) + 20^2(10^2) = 62500$ (...) Question: The textbook answer says that $Var(P) = 10Var[X] + 20Var[Y] = 10(15^2) + 20(10^2) = 4250$ . Why?
