Which Publicly Accessible Large Language Models are Very Similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT?

What other large language models exist or will soon exist that are VERY similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT in the sense of being fine-tuned or otherwise specifically created for conversational tasks including question answering? Such models can be free to use or require subscription. I'm preferably looking for models that can give companies API access. I am interested in models with fairly high quality question answering performance in terms of accuracy and not having too many "hallucinations". Here are some examples I am currently familiar with: InstructGPT from OpenAI: https://openai.com/blog/instruction-following/ OpenAssistant from LAION: https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant ChatSonic from WriteSonic: https://writesonic.com/chat Jasper Chat : https://www.jasper.ai/chat Google Bard (Google's soon to be released rival to ChatGPT): https://blog.google/technology/ai/bard-google-ai-search-updates/ ChatGenie via WriteCream: https://www.writecream.com/chatgenie/ YouChat from you.com: https://www.you.com/chat Perplexity AI : https://www.perplexity.ai Bing Chat (literally uses ChatGPT): https://www.bing.com/
