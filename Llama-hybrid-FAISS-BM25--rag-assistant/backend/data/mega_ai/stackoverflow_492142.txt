I wouldn't actually call DAO a "pattern". As I see it, DAO is pretty much what it is -- a Data Access Object", which encapsulates the details of accessing a persistent data store and generally speaking has nothing to do with the database: interface IBlogDaoService { Blog GetBlog(long id); void SaveBlog(Blog blog); } It's clear that implementations can use either DB (in which case it's quite logical to use a Data Mapper), or simple XML file storage mechanism. The Data Mapper on the other hand is more of a pattern, which defines a layer responsible for translating in-memory graphs of objects to the relational structure.
