Is it possible to mine alumni information from FaceBook

Basically, I'd like to extract a list of people that have graduated from a specific university, something like this query provides . I can have an authorized user from the educational organization that mines the alumnis to log in - but it seems to me that even if I get the list, I won't be able to extract much information about these people - to be useful, the app needs to extract things like which city the person lives in, current occupation etc. Can it be done?
