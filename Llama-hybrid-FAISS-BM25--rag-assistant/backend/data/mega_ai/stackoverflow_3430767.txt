A SQL Server reporting services (SSRS) model is likely not a direct replacement for your Table. A Model is used so that end users can write their own reports using a friendly report writer rather than writing complex sql statements (your existing stored procedures.) The model works on underlying tables but it doesn't ETL data from them into a separate storage area. If there were reasons to use the cut down table going back to the source data with your model may do more harm than good. You can't run stored procedures against a reporting model; you can write SSRS reports that call stored procedures though so you could reuse your existing code and just deliver it via SSRS reports.
