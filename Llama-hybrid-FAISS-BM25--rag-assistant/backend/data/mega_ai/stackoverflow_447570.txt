I would very much recommend using swfobject , that takes care of detecting the flash player, embedding the proper code for that browser and gives you a nice way to provide fallback content. Also, it'll look alot cleaner in your code! Like so: SWFObject dynamic embed - step 3 swfobject.embedSWF("myContent.swf", "myContent", "300", "120", "9.0.0"); Alternative content
