I don't think the property value of CacheMode is an enum, I think its an abstract class. So you should have something like: image.CacheMode = new BitmapCache(); There might even be a static instance of BitmapCache somewhere (like on CacheMode). And yes, having an abstract class called ~Mode is a bit weird imo ;)
