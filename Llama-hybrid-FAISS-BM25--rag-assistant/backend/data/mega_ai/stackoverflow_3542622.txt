I would say to write it from scratch although you don't want to... I would make a plain text file that holds the values on the votes and the total number like this- Say there's three votes; A 3 star, a 4 star and a 5 star. Make a file like this... 12 3 Then read it into and array by line... $values = file('rating.txt'); After that get the average... $rating = $values[0]/$values[1]; //Do whatever you want from here To add a vote, just do... $rating = $_POST['rating']; if ($rating > 5) $rating = 5; $values = file('rating.txt'); $total = $rating + $values[0]; $votes = $values[1]++; $data = $total."\n".$votes; $fp = fopen('rating.txt', 'w+'); fwrite($fp, $data); fclose($fp);
