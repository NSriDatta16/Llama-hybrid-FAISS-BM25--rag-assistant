Principal components analysis (PCA; which is related to factor analysis, and sometimes found under the same menus in stats packages) is used to analyze repertory grids - but it tends to be one person's grid at a time. If the user generated the constructs, I don't think you can combine grids because the variables don't make sense over time. Hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) is also used, but again on an individual grid, not on multiple combined grids. This article http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1348/014466501163652/pdf (which I don't think is behind a paywall) describes the use of PCA and HCA in the analysis of a single person's repertory grid before and after therapy. With repertory grids you can give more or less 'starting' information to your respondents. You can have them generate elements, or you can generate elements - you generated the elements (the articles). Often you ask the respondent to generate elements so that they are meaningful (e.g. a person you liked; a person who rejected you). You can provide constructs, or you can ask the respondent to provide constructs - in your case, you asked the person to provide the constructs. You can also vary the number of constructs that are generated - some respondents want to use more, some fewer (i don't think you did this.) As you add more restrictions, you increase the comparability of the grids, but potentially decrease the usefulness. You can only really combine and compare grids where you provide both elements and constructs, but most people would argue that you're not doing rep grids any more. Rep grids are (usually) considered to be a structured qualitative research tool - usually, you do the first stage of analysis on the grids - using something like PCA or HCA, and then you look at the results for emerging themes.
