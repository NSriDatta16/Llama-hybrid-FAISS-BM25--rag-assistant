I haven't used topic models much, but I can say that if you are to apply usual clustering methods to un-normalized document-term matrices (even when the dimensionality of the data is reduced with LSA), you'll see that longer articles will tent to cluster together, just because they have more words. So you may take a look at some of your topics and see if documents inside make sense. Also, try to calculate average length of document per topic and see if the phenomenon I mention takes place or not. Then you can repeat the same on the unit-normalized data and see if the results make more sense or not.
