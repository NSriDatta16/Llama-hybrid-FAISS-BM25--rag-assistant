How to rank Feature importance for ANN classifier?

If a network is trained using ANN classifier, how can we know which feature was most important for predicting the target variable? I mean: How to create a "feature ranking" among the features (from high importance value to low)? I have seen some literature about decision trees/AdaBoost but I am typically interested in Neural Networks especially for classification purpose. To make it more clear, a possible example output is shown in the figure https://pasteboard.co/GKBzS47.png .
