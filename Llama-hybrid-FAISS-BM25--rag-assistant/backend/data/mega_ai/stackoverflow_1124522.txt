XtraDB or InnoDb. Which to choose on a website with high concurrency of reads and writes

We have MySQL 4 master masters and several read slaves of each master running MySQL. We roll with InnoDB, should we be looking towards XtraDB? We have to be able to average many comments a second which typically trigger 10 inserts and 100 reads.
