I think using XML is overkill (shooting sparrows with cannons) while regexps are "underkill" (using a too weak tool, scrubbing floors with a toothbrush). The right balance sounds like it's "the .ini format" or "mail headers with sections". For python there are library docs at http://docs.python.org/library/configparser.html . A brief example: [albus_square] name: Albus Square items: Flowers, Traffic Cone north: lecture_theatre west: library_enchanted_books south: furnesspuff_college I'd assume there's a Java library for this format. As another poster has pointed out, you might have name collision so I took the liberty of adding a "name:" field. The name in the square brackets would be the unique identifier.
