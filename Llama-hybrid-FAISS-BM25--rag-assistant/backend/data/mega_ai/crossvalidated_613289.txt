What is the simpler experiment design and corrections I can use for an adaptative model?

Somebody asked me for help to design an experiment with animals and its statistical analysis for a medical thesis. She wants to "calculate" de sample size, and wants to minimize it. She doesn't have any previous data yet. The model is going to be a linear regression model with four covariates and repeated measures. The participants will be randomly selected at the beginning. No further manipulation. I know that calculating N depends on many subjective things. I would like to suggest her to try with a small N instead, and increase it as needed, with corrections for the p-values. I don't what corrections because some of the data is going to be new but we already know the old one. Something like Bonferroni doesn't sound good because the denominator will increase as fast as the number of analysis. What would be the simplest way to do it? (without bayesian analysis because I don't have experience with it). Maybe keep doing new single experiments until she gets the desired effect? Or maybe duplicate N at every step?
