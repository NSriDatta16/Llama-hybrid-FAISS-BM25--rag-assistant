SQL Server 2008 + PCI Compliance? Pertains to PCI, as well as Symmetric keys!

I've never had to deal with PCI compliance before. I've been reading their documentation and it says I need to protect the credit card number, expiration date and the card holder's name. No storage of security codes ever. In their documentation, it just says protect. Is this saying I need to encrypt these 3 columns in my database? I thought only the number was the data that needed to be encrypted. Either way, I'm fine with. If I need to encrypt all three columns, do I share one certificate and have 3 symmetric keys, or will I only need 1 of each, with that symmetric key being used on all 3 columns? The reason I ask is in the BoL documentation on encrypting a column, the key is named specifically after the column they are encrypting. Thanks for all the help!
