I move images around in 3d, under animated control rather than user dragging, but i am pretty sure that the mechanism for moving them would be the same. first, make just to make sure that the outer canvas isnt getting autosized or something weird like that set it to a fixed width/height. and with the setting of the position of the images within the Viewport2DVisual3D, I used RenderTransform on the image to set it to its new position. cheers Anton
