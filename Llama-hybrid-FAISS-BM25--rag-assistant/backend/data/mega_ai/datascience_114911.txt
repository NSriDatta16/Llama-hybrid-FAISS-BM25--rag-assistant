Logistic Regression using Logisticregression() class

In the documentation of Logisticregression() offered by sklearn library, it states the following note: The underlying C implementation uses a random number generator to select features when fitting the model. It is thus not uncommon, to have slightly different results for the same input data. If that happens, try with a smaller tol parameter. I have two questions regarding this note : What is the meaning of The underlying C implementation uses a random number generator to select features when fitting the model What is tol parameter?
