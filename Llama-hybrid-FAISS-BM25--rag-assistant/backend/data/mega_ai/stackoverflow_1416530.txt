Create UiImage from NSData

Below is code I copied (from this site) and modified only slightly since the original code would not compile. I want to manipulate the byte array for edge detection and eventually simple changes to colors, but first I wanted to get the basic code working. Currently, the system compiles and runs. It displays a badly drawn elephant on screen. When I touch the image, it disappears. Stepping through shows the result of imageWithData as 0x0. I have tried this with both a png and a bmp and same result Any clues to what I am doing wrong ?! ImageViewDrawable is defined as: @interface ImageViewDrawable : UIImageView // I am using the following code to initialize this ImageView ImageViewDrawable * uiv = [[ImageViewDrawable alloc] initWithImage:[UIImage imageNamed:@"ele.png"] ]; -(void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // get and work on pixel data NSData* pixelData = (NSData*) CGDataProviderCopyData(CGImageGetDataProvider(self.image.CGImage)); char* bytes =[pixelData bytes]; // Take away the red pixel, assuming 32-bit RGBA for(int i = 0; i
