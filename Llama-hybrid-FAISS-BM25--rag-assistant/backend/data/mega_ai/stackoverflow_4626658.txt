What version of nunit are you using? There were some problems in the 2.5.7/2.5.8 version that causes nunit-agent to hang at the end of a test. I had this problem and reverted back to an older version of nunit and the hang problem went away. In the release notes for 2.5.9 they show that "602761 nunit-agent hangs after tests complete" has been fixed. I have not upgraded to 2.5.9 yet but that may fix your problem.
