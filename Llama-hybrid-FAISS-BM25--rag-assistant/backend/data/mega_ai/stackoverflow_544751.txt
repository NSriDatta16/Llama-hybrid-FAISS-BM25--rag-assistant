Put in a pre-commit hook that checks the bug comment refers to an open bug, assigned to the user doing the checkin. (SCMBug can do this). Then to make life REALLY interesting, spell check the comments!! The commit comment, and the one in the code. (spell is my buddy) Run the code through a code formatter set to compayn standard; and diff it to the original: if it's not in company offical format: reject the commit. Do a coverage test with the unit test build. Email all mistakes/errors caused to the development team. I left OUT the name of the developer. They know they did it.
