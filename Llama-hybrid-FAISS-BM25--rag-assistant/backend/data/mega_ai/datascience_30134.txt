I now want to analyze the factors which are most contributing to the medical condition If this is your purpose I suggest you plotting covariance matrix for input features. By doing so you will be able to see the correlation of your features together. That may help you diminish redundant correlated features 1 . Moreover, you can plot the correlation of your outcomes and each feature to see their relationship. That helps you figure out which features are correlated or uncorrelated to the outcomes. PCA helps you find major components are needed to describe the phenomena 2 . Neural nets are useful for making a model that can predict for labeled data-sets. For your case, I've not seen any paper but there might be.
