Robert Levy's answer is what immediately comes to mind, after having read your question. If you don't want to create hard dependency on the DI framework from your business layer, you may make the repository a property of the Category object and set this property when you created the repository object in the repo.Get. This feels quite yucky though as you don't necessarily need this reference (if you never lazy load) and also it is "hard coded" i.e not using DI as such. As an alternate you can use deferred resolution as described here http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff660854%28PandP.20%29.aspx This way, when you create a Category object you also get a resolver delegate, that the Category object will be able to call should it need to resolve a repository instance.
