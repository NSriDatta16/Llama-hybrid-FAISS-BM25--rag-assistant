You can consider this as randomly drawing a number on a square and computing the vertical distance to the diagonal. Then this relates to the average of the triangular distribution . If we fill in the formula for the mean of that distribution, with $a = c = 0$ and $b=1$ , then you get $MAE = \frac{1}{3}$ and your division with the actual value $\frac{1}{2}$ makes it a relative error of $\frac{2}{3}$ . Alternative viewpoint, you can also consider the perpendicular distance to the diagonal which is the residual vector in estimating the mean $(x-\mu, y-\mu)$ , where $\mu = \frac{x+y}{2}$ . Another alternative viewpoint, consider that the plot of $(x-y)$ and $(x+y)$ , two values that you use in your computation, is a rotation, shift and scaling of the square.
