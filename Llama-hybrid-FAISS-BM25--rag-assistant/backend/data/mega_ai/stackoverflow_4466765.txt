It should perhaps be mentioned that varArray creates an array of the variant datatype, which is quite different from normal types. It creates a structure in memory that cannot be compared to an object instance (AFAIK). It is expected to be stored as an inter-linked (by pointer) list of nodes. However, the Delphi variant structure is identical to Microsoft's own storage format, which means you can call winapi to achieve the same thing. If you havent solved it yet I would take a look at the COM support libraries inside .NET. Probably under "System.Runtime.InteropServices"". Or look at the variants.pas unit in Delphi and see what WinAPI functions they call.
