Fixed effects or independent models?

Suppose we are running a model, let's say a linear regression model or a logistic regression. Suppose also that we have gathered data for three cities: City A (4000 surveys), City B (5000 surveys) and City C (4000 surveys). We are interested in the outcome variable Y and we have a set of regressors X (not including the city). What would be the best way to fit the model? a model with city fixed effects: Y = X + City_B + City_C (City_A is used as the reference variable); or fit three independent models (one for each city) Les's also assume that we want to add some interactions between the cities and some of regressors. This question comes from a project I have been working on. My rationale so far has been that, given that I expect to add many interactions and that the sample size is relatively large for each city, then fitting independent models could give better estimates.
