Test data generation for neural network handwriting recognition

Can someone share some Octave/Matlab code or algorithm to pre-process a photo taken from mobile camera of a handwritten digit. After pre-processing, the data should have similar characteristics to the MNIST data set digit images. I have a neural network trained using the MNIST data set. Now I want to test my implementation by taking handwritten digit images using a phone camera and saving it on my computer. I want to give this image as input to test my neural net implementation. Thanks in advance !!
