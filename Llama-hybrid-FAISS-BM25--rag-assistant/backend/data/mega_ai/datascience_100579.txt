Having a solid mathematical background is crucial for data science. Someone without solid mathematical background will always use the algorithms as black box models. Mathematical reasoning is needed when you debug your models but also when you want to come up with a creative solution to a problem at hand. Someone without mathematical background will have a hard time to come up with a solution to a real problem when. You gave the example of Principal Components Analysis. Without understanding what eigenvalues and eigenvectors are your will always only superficially understand what your results mean. And you will have to explain it to business people in order to convince them that they should use the given algorithm. If you stand there and always say that this is a magical algorithm that is doing something you will not convince the business people to deploy your system.
