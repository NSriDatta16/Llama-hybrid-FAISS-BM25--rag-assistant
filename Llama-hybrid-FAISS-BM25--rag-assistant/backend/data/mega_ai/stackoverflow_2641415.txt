In addition to Remus's terrific answer, you will also need to understand and be able to implement memory management. If you grew up on Java or .NET, this may be alien to you. Pay very close attention to this part of the tutorials, and practice this by intentionally screwing it up. You need to know what these errors look like and how they behave. Good luck!
