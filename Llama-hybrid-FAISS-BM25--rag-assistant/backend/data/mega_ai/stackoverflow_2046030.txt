Re-naming chart legend in Access 2007

In an auto-generated chart based on a query (I dragged the chart object onto a blank form to start it), the chart itself is displaying and updating properly, datawise, but I want to change the Legend from reading "SumOfAvgOfield1" and "SumOfAvgOfield2" to regular words suitable for final presentations. But I can't find a way to change it!
