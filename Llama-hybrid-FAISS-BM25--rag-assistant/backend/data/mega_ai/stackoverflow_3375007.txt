I also got this error message when "building" a project which didn't have any *.cs files...but we do that fairly often for SharePoint projects which are just XML. the VS project is just to organize some of the XML documents. Long story short the problem was that there was AssemblyInfo.cs file. After adding some assembly info to the project properties, voila! It worked. So I guess, yes, you need a .cs file to actually compile anything, but the AssemblyInfo.cs is enough.
