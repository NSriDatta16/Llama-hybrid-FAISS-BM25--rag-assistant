Charting in web-based applications

What are the various charting tools that are available for displaying charts on a web page using ASP.NET? I know about commercial tools such as Dundas and Infragistics. I could have "googled" this but I want to know the various tools that SO participants have used? Any free charting tools that are available are also welcome to be mentioned.
