How to syntax highlight fragments of code in one language embedded in the source code in another language in Vim?

I have a custom XML file format which can contain blocks of code within certain tags. For example: select * from foo ... How can I get Vim to use SQL syntax highlighting for the text inside tags and use Python higlighting for text inside tags? I know Vim can already do this because it correctly highlights Javascript inside HTML files. I tried inspecting the HTML syntax file but couldnâ€™t figure it out.
