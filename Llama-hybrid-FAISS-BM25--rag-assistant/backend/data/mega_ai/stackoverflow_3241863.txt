Is the table a btree or a heap? Do you have a clustered index on it? If yes, then what column is the clustered index on, and how is the column value computed at insert? Why do you care about fragmentation to start with? Space consideration or read ahead performance? For space, you should skip SQL 2005 and go to SQL 2008 for Page compression . For read ahead, it would be worth investigating why you need large read aheads to start with. Overall, index fragmentation is more of an overhiped bru-ha-ha everyone talks about but very few really understand. There are many many more aveanues to pursue before fragmentation becomes the real bottleneck.
