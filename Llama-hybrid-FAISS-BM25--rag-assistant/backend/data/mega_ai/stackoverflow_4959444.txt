@JK from the info you provided it feels like a timeout issue. I agree with @TroyHunt 2500 files in 15 megs should delploy quickly. In particular the the output showing a delay while applying ACLs (whether or not they need to be changed). If it were me, I would start out doing some non-web deploy health checks. A few thoughts come to mind are the webservers in a domain or workgroup? what does dcdiag show ? what does netdiag show ? are the dev boxes and the prod boxes in the same domain? Is there a chance you are trying to apply users or groups that don't exist any more, are disabled , or come from domains other than the web server domain? It's possible your organization has a domain hierarchy with child domains or domain trusts, that are valid, but communication is blocked in the production data center. I think i would also manually look at the ACLs and see if there are entries that can't be resolved (they show up as SIDS before resolution). HTH, -eric
