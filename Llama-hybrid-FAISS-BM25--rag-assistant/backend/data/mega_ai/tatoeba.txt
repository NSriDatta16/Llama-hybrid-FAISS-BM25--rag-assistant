Tatoeba is a free collection of example sentences with translations geared towards foreign language learners. It is available in more than 400 languages. Its name comes from the Japanese phrase tatoeba (例えば), meaning 'for example'. It is written and maintained by a community of volunteers through a model of open collaboration. Individual contributors are known as "Tatoebans". It is run by Association Tatoeba, a French non-profit organization funded through donations. History and development In 2006, Trang Ho was frustrated that unlike some of their Japanese counterparts, German bilingual dictionaries didn't feature full-text search of usage examples with translations. It led her to imagine her ideal dictionary and to build a prototype hosted on SourceForge under the name "multilangdict." The main focus was already the crowdsourcing of translated sentences: "A Wikipedia type of thing, except people add sentences, not articles." Alongside her studies at the University of Technology of Compiègne, Trang Ho gradually improved her website with a few classmates. She rebuilt the project from scratch twice and rebranded it as Tatoeba. In September 2007, about 150,000 English-Japanese sentence pairs from the Tanaka Corpus — a public-domain compilation released in 2001 by Hyogo University professor Yasuhito Tanaka and maintained by Jim Breen and Paul Blay — were imported into the Tatoeba Corpus. In December 2008, Trang Ho released the first version of the current codebase built around a more flexible data model. The following month, the website moved to the tatoeba.org domain. Over the 2009-2010 academic year, Allan Simon — then a student at SUPINFO — became a core developer of Tatoeba. Together with Trang Ho and other young developers, they made Tatoeba more social: sentence lists, user profiles, private messaging, and Facebook-inspired Wall. They also introduced significant features like sentence linking, tagging, and "translation of translation" search. In November 2010, Tatoeba passed the 600,000 sentences mark. Within a year, the number of sentences added daily had increased almost 50-fold. Between 2014 and 2016, a new team of developers formed around Trang Ho. They mentored students at the Google Summer of Code 2014 and added features to improve corpus quality. Over the 2018-2020 period, support from the Mozilla Foundation as part of the Common Voice project allowed Tatoeba to make its platform more open and user-friendly. Openness Use Users can search for words to retrieve sentences that use them. Results can be filtered by language, number of words, tag, and other criteria. Each sentence is displayed next to its translations and "translations of translations". A comment section facilitates feedback and corrections. Registered users can build downloadable lists of sentences, which are private, public or collaborative. Contribution Tatoebans are encouraged to contribute in their strongest language. They can add original sentences and translate existing ones. They can proofread or comment on other users' sentences, and "adopt" sentences without an owner. Advanced contributors are also allowed to tag, link, and unlink sentences. When the owner of a sentence does not respond to a correction request, only a corpus maintainer has the power to update or delete the sentence. Governance As founder of Tatoeba, Trang Ho has long been the project's BDFL. In 2011, she set up a nonprofit organization to oversee the project. In 2022, she decided to step aside in favor of a small group of experienced Tatoebans. Languages As of February 2025, the Tatoeba Corpus has over 12,600,000 sentences in 426 languages. 66 of these languages have 10,000 or more sentences. Over 1 million sentences have audio recordings. The sentences are interrelated within a graph that has more than 25,900,000 links. 276 language pairs have over 10,000 translated sentences. Operation Tatoeba received a grant from Mozilla Drumbeat in December 2010. Some work on the Tatoeba inf
