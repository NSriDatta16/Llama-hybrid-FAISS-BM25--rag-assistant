ref/out automatically means mutability, and functional programming with immutable values is all the rage these days. Try inserting a call to Dictionary.TryGetValue into a LINQ query. The API requires declaring variables and ruins any 'fluency' in the API. That's not to say this is "the reason", but it is an example of "a reason".
