The basic question is correct - as a forecast goes farther out in time, the confidence intervals become wider - sometimes extremely fast - thus reducing the confidence in the conclusions provided by the model(s). The book Forecasting Principles and Practice has a section on this exact point. That section is: Least Squares Estimation The relevant sections state that t-values and p-values are of "limited interest". Instead, the book covers several methods to evaluate goodness of fit for time series models (RMSE, AIC, AICc, etc.) The authors also created R packages that are extremely good for doing time series work, and I recommend the fpp3 package very highly. The book is available online from the authors at: https://otexts.com/fpp3/
