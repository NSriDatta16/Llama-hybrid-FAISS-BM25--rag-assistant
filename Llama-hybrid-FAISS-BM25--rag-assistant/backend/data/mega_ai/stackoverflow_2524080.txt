Silverlight and RIA Services - The Data sources window does not show anything

So following some of the examples out there I created a new Silverlight Navigation application with RIA services enabled. Built the entity model, added a domain service and tested whether or not I could get some data to the client. This works fine. But many of the examples show off how they use the Data Sources window to simply drag data fields onto a window... in my case however there are no data sources in the data sources window. In the demo's and mix sessions this just appears out of the blue :p Anyway how can I get my DomainService defined in the web project to show up as one of the data sources in the data sources window?
