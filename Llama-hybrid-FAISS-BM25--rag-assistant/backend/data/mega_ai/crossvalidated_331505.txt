How to set up an intercept-only mixed logistic regression in order to test for difference from 50% chance level?

In my experiment, subjects repeatedly had to make a binary choice between A and B, and I want to test if subjects (as a group) differed from 50% chance in preferring A over B. Is there a way to test this using a mixed logistic regression, e.g. with glmer() in R? The intercept only model, if I recall correctly, tests whether subjects as a whole differed from zero. But if I try to recode the dependent measure so that each score is a difference from chance (.5), and then test if that difference from chance differs from zero, then the model won't run because the value of the dependent measure has to be 0 or 1. Is there some other way to do this using glmer() or is there a more straightforward way that I'm overlooking? Does it depend on how many trials are making up the dependent measure?
