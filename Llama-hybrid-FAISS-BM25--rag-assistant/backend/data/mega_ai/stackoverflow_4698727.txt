iOS4.2: TouchBegan does not draw more than one circle per sensed touch

quick question (which might be a no-brainer for most here) :) My code below should draw a circle for every time touch that is recognised but although more than ones touches are sensed only one circle will drawn up at a time. Can anyone see any obvious issues? This method sits in the XYZViewControler.m class. TouchPoint.m is the class that defines the circle. Thanks a bundle for your help and redirects. Chris - (void) touchesBegan: (NSSet *) touches withEvent: (UIEvent *)event { NSSet * allTouches = [event allTouches]; // get all events for (UITouch * touch in touches) { TouchPoint * touchPoint = [[TouchPoint alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, circleWidth, circleWidth)]; touchPoint.center = [touch locationInView:[self view]]; touchPoint.color = [UIColor redColor]; touchPoint.backgroundColor = [UIColor whiteColor]; [[self view] addSubview: touchPoint]; [touchPoint release]; CFDictionarySetValue(touchMap, touch , touchPoint); } [[self view] setNeedsDisplay]; }
