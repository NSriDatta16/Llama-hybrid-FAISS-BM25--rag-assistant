Force IIS7 to suggest downloading *.exe files in "Local intranet" zone

Problem: html file on local server (inside our organization) with link to an exe on the same server. clicking the link runs the exe on the client. Instead I want it to offer downloading it. Tried so far: Changed permissions on the exe's virtual directory to be read and script. Added Content-disposition header on the exe's directory. I can't change settings in the browser. It's intended for a lot of people to consume.
