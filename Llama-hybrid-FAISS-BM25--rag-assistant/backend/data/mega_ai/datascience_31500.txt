It depends on the ensemble model technique. If you are going to use a bagging approach then the term individual models or alternative models is the appropriate. But in the case of boosting methods the appropriate term is weak learner (classifier). Boosting algorithms is a family of machine learning algorithms that convert weak learners to strong ones. A weak learner is defined to be a classifier that is only slightly correlated with the true classification (it can label examples better than random guessing).
