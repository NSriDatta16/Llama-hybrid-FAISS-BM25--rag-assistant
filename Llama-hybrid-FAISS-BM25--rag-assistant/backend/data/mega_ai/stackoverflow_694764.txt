You seem to be caught up in the hype of unit testing, what you will be doing is actually an integration test. Setting and getting back the same value from the same key is a unit test you'd do with a mock implementation of the storage engine, but actually testing the real storage, say your database, as you should, that is no longer a unit test, but it is a fundamental part of testing, and it sounds like integration testing to me. Don't use unit testing as your hammer , choose the right tools for the right job. Divide your testing into more layers.
