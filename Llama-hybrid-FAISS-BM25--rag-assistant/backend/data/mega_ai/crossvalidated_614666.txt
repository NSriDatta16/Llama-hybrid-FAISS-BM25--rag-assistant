Why does relative difference granger cause log difference? (time series)

I've been running Granger causality tests on stationary time series in Python. Testing the same time series with itself gives me p-values of 1 for all tests (i.e. no causality), except for the parameter F test, which returns p = 0 . However, when testing the relative change of a time series against the log change of the same time series (which obviously also doesn't have a causal relationship), I get p-values of 0 for all four tests, in either direction. For small variances on the other hand, I get large discrepancies between the test's p-values. My questions are: Why does the parameter F test return a p-value of zero for two identical time series? Why do all Granger causality tests indicate a bidirectional causal relationship between relative difference and log difference? Why are there so large discrepancies between the p-values of the various tests when the variance is small? To reproduce the result where all p-values are zero, run: import pandas as pd import numpy as np from statsmodels.tsa.stattools import grangercausalitytests time_series = pd.DataFrame(np.random.normal(10, 2, 100)) time_series_relative_change = (time_series / time_series.shift(1) - 1)[1:] time_series_log_difference = np.log(time_series / time_series.shift(1))[1:] dataframe = pd.DataFrame() dataframe['time_series_relative_change'] = time_series_relative_change dataframe['time_series_log_difference'] = time_series_log_difference grangercausalitytests(dataframe, 10) To reproduce the result where the discrepancy between test results is large, run: time_series = pd.DataFrame(np.random.normal(10, 0.1, 100)) time_series_relative_change = (time_series / time_series.shift(1) - 1)[1:] time_series_log_difference = np.log(time_series / time_series.shift(1))[1:] dataframe = pd.DataFrame() dataframe['time_series_relative_change'] = time_series_relative_change dataframe['time_series_log_difference'] = time_series_log_difference grangercausalitytests(dataframe, 10)
