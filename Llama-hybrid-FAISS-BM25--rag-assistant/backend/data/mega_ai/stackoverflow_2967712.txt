Just wanted to add on to what @aioobe mentioned above... In that approach you use HTML to color code your text. Though this is one of the most frequently used ways to color code the label text, but is not the most efficient way to do it .... considering that fact that each label will lead to HTML being parsed, rendering, etc. If you have large UI forms to be displayed, every millisecond counts to give a good user experience. You may want to go through the below and give it a try.... Jide OSS ( located at https://jide-oss.dev.java.net/ ) is a professional open source library with a really good amount of Swing components ready to use. They have a much improved version of JLabel named StyledLabel. That component solves your problem perfectly... See if their open source licensing applies to your product or not. This component is very easy to use. If you want to see a demo of their Swing Components you can run their WebStart demo located at www.jidesoft.com ( http://www.jidesoft.com/products/1.4/jide_demo.jnlp ). All of their offerings are demo'd... and best part is that the StyledLabel is compared with JLabel (HTML and without) in terms of speed! :-) A screenshot of the perf test can be seen at ( http://img267.imageshack.us/img267/9113/styledlabelperformance.png )
