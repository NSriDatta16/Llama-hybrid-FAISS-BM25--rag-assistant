700 lines in a single controller action? Testing has a way of exposing issues in your own code in other ways than the obvious assertions. If something is difficult to test for whatever reason, there is something wrong with the code. When starting to test a project, big or small, the focus should be code coverage. Don't worry so much about edge cases at first (unless the situation calls for it). When starting to test a project I like to start with the models as they are the most straightforward. From there move on to controller testing and see how it goes.
