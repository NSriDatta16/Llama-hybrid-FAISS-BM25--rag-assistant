Shouldn't idLine be v.getId() ? It's good for this value to be as "fresh" as possible so that you aren't reading an old value: in this case, the value of the last row which had probably been lurking in idLine . Hence, getting the value from the view directly is the safest method. Also, the "tag" might be a better place to store information than the id. You can access the tag, and indeed store any number of arguments as tags on any view, without changing the id: title.setTag(rows); and then later: intent.putExtra((Integer) v.getTag()); To store multiple objects (with keys) you can use: title.setTag("rowid", rows); and then retrieve it using: intent.putExtra((Integer) v.getTag("rowid")); and then you could add additional keys if you requirements changed. In any case, the intention of the tag is to store information for later retrieval, whereas the id is meant to serve as an identifier for finding views in a hierarchy.
