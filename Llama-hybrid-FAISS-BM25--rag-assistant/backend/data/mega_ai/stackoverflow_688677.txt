A non-floated element will not have any height if it only contains floated elements. To force the outermost element to stretch down and surround the floated elements it also must be floated. The simple answer to this problem is to float the 'actions' div too- This will extend the background as expected. Adding an extra element at the bottom just to clear the floated elements is unnecessary and not semantic so it should be discouraged.
