Hide/disable/remove/shootintheface office 2007 ribbon programmatically

We are embedding a word control inside of a winforms app, and need to hide and disable the ribbon on Office 2007 and 2010. Is it possible to hide/disable the office 2007/2010 ribbon programmatically using the office interop dlls? Is there another method available to do this?
