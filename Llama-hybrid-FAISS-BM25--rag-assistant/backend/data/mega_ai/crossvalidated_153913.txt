Initial screening of variables

I recently came across an approach where the long list of potential predictors (around 100+) is screened for its explanatory power and basis this initial screening, a smaller set of predictors is arrived at (which is then used for model building) The screening technique adopted is the "Information Value" approach (There has been a query on Information value approach before - Why do we calculate Information value? . And one of the users have provided an easy to understand explanation of the same) However, my question is, in what scenarios would you like to do an initial screening of variables prior to building a model (considering that the model building itself involves techniques for variable selection)? Also, if the issue is with the number of predictors, won't a dimensionality reduction algorithm like PCA suffice? So, in nutshell, what is the value that an initial screening approach like IV provide? Thanks!
