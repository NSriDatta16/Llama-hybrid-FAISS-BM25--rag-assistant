A sample median is defined to be the middle value when the sample size is odd. So, e.g., in a sample of size 5, the median is the third ordered observation (order statistic). When the sample size is even, e.g. 6, the median is the midpoint between the 3rd and 4th order statistic. Under these conditions, it is the average, median or middle value of the 3rd and 4th order statistic. If you want to call it the 3.5 order statistic that could be your definition. I don't think there is such a standard way to describe it.
