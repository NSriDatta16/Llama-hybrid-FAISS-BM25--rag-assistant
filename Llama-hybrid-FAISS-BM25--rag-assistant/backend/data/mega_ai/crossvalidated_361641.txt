So this one does not go unanswered for ever here is @Wolfgang's comment which the OP agreed solved his problem. Your outcome (S_ratio) is a count divided by another count? Then I would suggest to log transform those values. Let's say the ratios in two studies are 20/10 and 10/20. Then the average would be 1.25, which makes little sense. Ratios of counts are not symmetric around 1. Log transforming the ratios solves this issue. Also, log transforming should make the sampling distribution more normal (an assumption underlying the model you are using). The variance is then $\frac{1}{S_{st}} + \frac{1}{S_{sc}}$ Here, as a bonus, is a reference justifying the OP's comment about using REML to estimate $\tau^2$. It is a paper by Viechtbauer entitles "Bias and efficiency of meta--analytic variance estimators in the random--effects model" available here
