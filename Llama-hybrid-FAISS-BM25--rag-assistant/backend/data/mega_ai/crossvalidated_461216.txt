Multivalued feature construction

I have a task of representing a users feature matrix to be input for statistical machine learning classifiers, i have features like gender , age etc but I also have a multivalue feature called as "movies watched" which is essentially another table of movie names watched by that user with a numeric duration, the order of movies does not matter here. Also, movies watched can be from 20 movies to 300 movies. So what is the best way of representing this "movies watched" as a feature vector?
