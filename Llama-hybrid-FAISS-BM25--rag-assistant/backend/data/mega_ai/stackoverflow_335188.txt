Microsoft Word protecting styles using VBA and the "Protect Document" feature

I am trying to limit the styles a user can use in a Word 2003 document. I am doing this by using the "Protect Document" feature. For my situation I may need to use VBA but I am not sure. After I protect the document, I can no longer apply a style to just a single word without it changing the style for the whole paragraph. For example if I tried to change the word 'house' to a new style in the sentence below... There is a house on the hill. Then the whole sentence would become that style, not just the word house. Does anyone know how to get around this using VBA or know what I am doing wrong? Thanks!
