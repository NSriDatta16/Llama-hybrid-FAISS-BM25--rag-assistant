Recursive time series forecasting test set

Problem: I am building a multivariate model for recursive time series forecasting, where the goal is to make a 4-step-ahead forecast. The actual data for the forecasting period is available. As far as I understand the forecast from each successive step is fed back into the model to generate the next step. Consequently, adding this variable to the model would also imply that I must add it to the test set. Ask: What should I add to the test set since the actual forecast values are only available after the forecast itself? Or am I barking up the wrong tree here?
