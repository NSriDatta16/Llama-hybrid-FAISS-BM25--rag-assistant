If you are keeping your view models in the same assembly as your views, one trick I have used to help organize views with view models in addition to a simple naming scheme like {View Name}ViewModel for the view model class is to do the following: Create your view class (Shell.xaml) In the same location, add your view model class (ShellViewModel.cs) Rename the view model class file to be the same name as the view, but append .model to the file path (Shell.model.cs) Edit the project file (either manually or using the power command extensions in VS) Locate the Compile element for the view model class in the project XML document Add a child DependentUpon element whose content is the name of the view class Save changes and reload the project This will cause the view model class to be visually grouped along side the code-behind file for the view.
