Barring the syntax errors, your code seems to work. However, I took the liberty of removing all duplicates, and cleaning it up: first = raw_input("Please enter Plaintext to Cipher: ") k = int(raw_input("Please enter the shift: ")) result = '' for second in first: x=ord(second) x=x+k if x>90 and x 122: x=x-26 result += chr(x) print first print result Also "first" and "second" are really bad names for those variables. "Input" and "letter" is probably better.
