A C# destructor is called when the object is garbage collected, except in a few border cases (if the app is shutting down, the finalizer thread only gets so long, after which it's just terminated). But that means you don't know when it'll be called. It may be a long time before the object gets garbage collected. So you're right, that's a bad idea. However, try/finally is generally pointless too, because a using block will achieve the same thing more elegantly.
