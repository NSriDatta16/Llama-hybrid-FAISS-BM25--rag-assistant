The problem with memory modelling is that in many if not most circumstances there are unspecified deterministic structures/effects in play. For example one would never IMHO use a frequency of 365.25 because what happened 365.25 days ago is never really what is important. Many systems ( such as the # of people going to a clinic ) are driven by hourly , daily habits and monthly habits as we normally don't duplicate what we do from year to year on a weekly basis , although it can happen . Note however that a specific day within a month can be very important and we have even found cases where the week in the month was important and of course month-end effects. This is why subject matter knowledge can be important in setting the software switches to look for specific structure. Additionally events like holidays and special sales days are important. I have dealt with many series ( from economic to physical) that can be characterized by a hybrid of deterministic effects and memory effects. These models are normally more heavily dependent on deterministic effects and usually only slightly dependent on memory (usually short-term memory) . Most times there are level shifts and time trends that need to be identified and conditioned for besides the pulses . I suggest that you use a scheme where you have time series within a set of classes. For example all the readings for hour 1 can be used to predict hour 1 while incorporating a daily total variable as an X variable to help account for a lower frequency. In this example you would have 25 models. As was suggested you need to determine what the minor frequency is ( 24 -hourly in my example) and what the major frequency is ( 7 in my example) .
