Why does my div disappear when i use position:relative in IE6?

I have no margins applied to this particular div, no floats and more annoyingly it works on a different page. Below is the code for the css rule: #prizedraw-fliemore{ position: relative; top: 164px; left: -720px; z-index: 3000; } The div shows up when i use position:absolute but that is useless to me. I have tried display, visibility and nothing i try works. Can someone help me out please?
