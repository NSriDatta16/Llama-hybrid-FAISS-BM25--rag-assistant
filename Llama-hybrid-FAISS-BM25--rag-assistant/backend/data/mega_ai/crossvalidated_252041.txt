It's important to understand that probabilities are really just functions on sample spaces (or rather sigma-algebras to be precise). The way we use language to express uncertainty often leads people to assume that there is some universally "true" probability out there and that it just happens to be unknown. However, there can only be a true probability if there is a universally agreed upon sample space and measure function. Of course, there is never universal agreement about these objects. This situation could be contrasted with "the" probability a coin toss lands heads. In that situation, there are two possible outcomes and everyone can agree that both have equal probabilities. Anyone who volunteers an election probability is really just expressing their thoughts about the set of possible events and how to measure them. But we might wonder who happens to have the best probability. This seems to be the question you're getting at. One formal way to quantify the quality of a probability assignment is to measure the size of the sigma-algebra from which it was derived. This is impossible in practice. Ultimately though, the best way to approach this problem is to start building out a sample space and provide probability assignments to the individual events. To do this, we need to start rattling off all the facts we can think of...like who the possible candidates are, how likely they are to run, how likely they are to win, etc. It's really tough to get information to make informed assessments about these events though. Although organizations like FiveThiryEight and The Upshot do this sort of thing professionally, there's good reason to assume that their probabilities aren't the best available. They primarily use polling data to generate probabilities. On the other hand, gambling websites generate probabilities using polls and betting data. Betting data leverages information from a wide-range of people. This takes into account more information than any one person can come up with. Gambling sites don't explicitly post the probabilities of each party winning but they can (almost) be inferred from the odds they list. Sadly, the next election is really far out. If you go to Paddy Power and look at the odds, you'll see some crazy listings. And if you try to infer probabilities from the odds, you'll see that they're leaving themselves a lot of room for error. Gambling websites just can't make precise inferences about the probabilities this early in the game. It's reasonable to assume no individual could do significantly better.
