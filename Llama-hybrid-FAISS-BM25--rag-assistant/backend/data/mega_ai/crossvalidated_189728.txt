The var.test function (stats package, so you don't need to install or load anything extra) will generate a confidence interval for the ratio of 2 variances. Note however that this interval is very dependent on normality and so will not have reasonable coverage if the data is generated from non-normal distributions. The sigma.test function in the TeachingDemos package will give a confidence interval for a variance based on a single sample (same cautions about normality apply). There may be other functions in other packages that do the same, but TeachingDemos is the one that I am most familiar with. If you are not willing to assume normality then things become more complex. Bootstrapping is one option as long as the sample sizes are large enough. A Bayesian approach based on a reasonable distribution for the data is another possible approach.
