ch as chatGPT or DeepL, are a relatively new field of application. Evolutionary computation Evolutionary computation can be seen as a family of methods and algorithms for global optimization, which are usually based on a population of candidate solutions. They are inspired by biological evolution and are often summarized as evolutionary algorithms. These include the genetic algorithms, evolution strategy, genetic programming and many others. They are considered as problem solvers for tasks not solvable by traditional mathematical methods and are frequently used for optimization including multi-objective optimization. Since they work with a population of candidate solutions that are processed in parallel during an iteration, they can easily be distributed to different computer nodes of a cluster. As often more than one offspring is generated per pairing, the evaluations of these offspring, which are usually the most time-consuming part of the optimization process, can also be performed in parallel. In the course of optimization, the population learns about the structure of the search space and stores this information in the chromosomes of the solution candidates. After a run, this knowledge can be reused for similar tasks by adapting some of the “old” chromosomes and using them to seed a new population. Swarm intelligence Swarm intelligence is based on the collective behavior of decentralized, self-organizing systems, typically consisting of a population of simple agents that interact locally with each other and with their environment. Despite the absence of a centralized control structure that dictates how the individual agents should behave, local interactions between such agents often lead to the emergence of global behavior. Among the recognized representatives of algorithms based on swarm intelligence are particle swarm optimization and ant colony optimization. Both are metaheuristic optimization algorithms that can be used to (approximately) solve difficult numerical or complex combinatorial optimization tasks. Since both methods, like the evolutionary algorithms, are based on a population and also on local interaction, they can be easily parallelized and show comparable learning properties. Bayesian networks In complex application domains, Bayesian networks provide a means to efficiently store and evaluate uncertain knowledge. A Bayesian network is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional dependencies by a directed acyclic graph. The probabilistic representation makes it easy to draw conclusions based on new information. In addition, Bayesian networks are well suited for learning from data. Their wide range of applications includes medical diagnostics, risk management, information retrieval, and text analysis, e.g. for spam filters. Their wide range of applications includes medical diagnostics, risk management, information retrieval, text analysis, e.g. for spam filters, credit rating of companies, and the operation of complex industrial processes. Artificial immune systems Artificial immune systems are another group of population-based metaheuristic learning algorithms designed to solve clustering and optimization problems. These algorithms are inspired by the principles of theoretical immunology and the processes of the vertebrate immune system, and use the learning and memory properties of the immune system to solve a problem. Operators similar to those known from evolutionary algorithms are used to clone and mutate artificial lymphocytes. Artificial immune systems offer interesting capabilities such as adaptability, self-learning, and robustness that can be used for various tasks in data processing, manufacturing systems, system modeling and control, fault detection, or cybersecurity. Learning theory Still looking for a way of "reasoning" close to the humans' one, learning theory is one of the main approaches of CI. In psychology, learning is the process of bring
