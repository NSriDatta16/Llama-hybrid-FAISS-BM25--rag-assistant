As Alecos stated you should take into account all things which might affect time lag between change in the input series and resulting output series. Formally you can think you have a somekind of stochastic control problem, where you assume some market reaction schedule for your input series (price) assuming that ability to produce do not hinder supplying realized demand. One consideration might be seasonality and possibility to use storage/warehouses/inventories as a buffer to adjust changing demand. But inventories keep capital tied to them so there is a cost element there. Regards, Analyst
