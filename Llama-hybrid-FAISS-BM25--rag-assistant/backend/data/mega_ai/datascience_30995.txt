Going off the discussion in the @Andres Espinosa's answer, here is an option that might work for this without any extra gating voodoo. The Nested LSTMs paper, Implementation here . The nested LSTM idea is to build in the idea of a temporal abstraction hierarchy - which in your case could possible capture the current pattern at the first level, and the need to switch between patterns at a deeper level. In addition there is the untouched idea about why your LSTM is not working in the first place. Before doing extra work, maybe it is worth trying visualizing the LSTM activations . In theory, if the LSTM has learned different phases in your input, there would be a different distribution of activations depending on the 'phase' or more significant changes in the hidden state between phases vs within the phase, since it would pay attention to different things depending on the phase, it could be a matter of just more training time. If it is consistently not picking up something that can be visually diagnosed, then it would suggest trying one of the other ideas.
