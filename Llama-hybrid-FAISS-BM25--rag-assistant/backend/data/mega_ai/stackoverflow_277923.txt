Longest running unit tests?

How can we find the junit tests in our suite that take the longest amount of time to run? The default output of the junitreport ant task is helpful, but our suite has thousands of tests organized into many smaller suites, so it gets tedious, and the worst offenders are always changing. We use luntbuild but ideally it would be something we could just run from ant.
