Many people store everything in the AppDelegate and access the data through [[UIApplication sharedApplication] delegate]. If the data are supposed to be persisted, you could also use the NSUserDefaults singleton. If the data are big, maybe you need SQLite. This is for "global" data as you asked. If your view controllers are organized in tree, a better way would be passing the required data from parent UIViewController to child UIViewController.
