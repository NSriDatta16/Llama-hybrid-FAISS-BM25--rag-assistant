Create folders through command line for repository organization (including projects and vendors). Do you mean creating the repository structure by making directories inside the subversion intallation directory? That's very wrong. You have to create the necessary folders via the svn mkdir command and not via filesystem. In /usr/local/svn you have the physical implementation of the Subversion repository, and you must access it only via a client, and never touch it "by hand". For example, using the file:// URL scheme svn mkdir file:///usr/local/svn/projects -m "Parent dir for projects created"
