You could address your hypotheses with two separate linear mixed models. Here is how I would model your questions: attention ~ session + (1|participant) + (1|session) task_time ~ session + (1|participant) + (1|session) This models participant and session with random intercepts to account for the non-independence of measurements caused by repeated measurements on a participant within a session. It also models session as a fixed effect. As long as you treat session as continuous here, a negative slope for session would indicate a decrease in attention or task_time over the four days. Caveats : Though you have a lot of measurements, your replication at the level of participants is low. And 4 sessions is not many either; it's at the point where including it as a random effect is questionable. The simpler approach of just calculating the mean per person per session, and regressing it against session may be better at this small sample size.
