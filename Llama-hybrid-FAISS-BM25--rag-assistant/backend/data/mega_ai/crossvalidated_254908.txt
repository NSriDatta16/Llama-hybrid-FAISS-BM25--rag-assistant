The simplest solution would be to calculate the average difference and its confidence interval as you propose. Another option would be to use a measure such as the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) to quantify the agreement or consistency between the tool and your trusted measurements. Whereas the former gives you an unstandardized estimate of error, the latter would give you a standardized estimate of reliability.
