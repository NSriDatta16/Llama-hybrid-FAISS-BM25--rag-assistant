What is the minimum set of characters I need to ban to avoid XSS

I'm writing a simple website and I appreciate my responsibility to avoid my site being used for XSS however I don't really want to spend much time on a detailed or heavy weight solution. If I was to simply ban a list of characters (that people weren't going to need to describe their favourite sausage anyway) what is the smallest list I could get away with? Users still need the ability to write a paragraph of plain text. So I'll need to keep at least: ' " , . ; : - ( ) in the hope that some of the less grammatically challenged users can apply them accurately. I was going to start with but searching indicated that, on it's own, isn't necessarily enough.
