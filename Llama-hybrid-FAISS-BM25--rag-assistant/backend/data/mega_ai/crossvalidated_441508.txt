what is a Stationary Time Series?

I have encountered this confusion: I know any time series can be decomposed into three parts: seasonal, trend and noise. where seasonal and trend are the non-stationary parts. so I have this time series on internet(below) and it looks like the seasonal part of the previous time series: why this is a stationary time series, isn't this also kind of seasonal time series?
