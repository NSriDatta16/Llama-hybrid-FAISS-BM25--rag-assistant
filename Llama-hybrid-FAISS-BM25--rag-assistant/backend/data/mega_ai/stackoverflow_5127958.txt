What you want is some kind of R console built on rpy2 technology. This isn't too hard to build. I imagine there's some rpy2 interface to R's 'eval' function, so then you just need some python code to read lines and feed them to rpy2.eval(line) or whatever. That would then get all wrapped up in a nice console-style interface with command-line recall and editing etc. When done with interactive R, you'd quit the console with some code (not 'q()'!) and get back your python interpreter. I don't think this thing has been built yet, but similar things have been. The 'manageR' plugin for Quantum GIS (mapping s/w) provides an R console that is launched from python and uses rpy. If you are really set on leveraging ESS for this then you'd need some way of sending ESS's inputs to a listening python process to feed to an R 'eval' function. Bit beyond me.
