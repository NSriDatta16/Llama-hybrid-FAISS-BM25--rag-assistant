Different of features and class and what is relationship?

When I research Machine Learning, I saw: " assume I have 1000 features and 10 observations from two classes as a training set, and 10 other observations as a testing set ". I just think features and classes are the same mean so when I read it, I'm very confused. In machine learning, feature different with classes? or sometimes they have same and different?
