The code that is throwing that exception looks like this ... assuming I've got the right version: if (respCode >= 400) { if (respCode == 404 || respCode == 410) { throw new FileNotFoundException(url.toString()); } else { throw new java.io.IOException( "Server returned HTTP" + " response code: " + respCode + " for URL: " + url.toString()); } } In other words, when you are doing the GET from Java, you are getting a 404 or 410 response. Now when I do the request using the wget utility, I get a 200 response. So my guess is that the problem is one of the following: You happened to make the request when they were suffering from some configuration problem. They have implemented their server to return 404 / 410 for certain User-Agent strings. Other possibilities are that they are doing some kind of server-side filtering on IP addresses or that there is some DNS problem that is causing your requests to go to a different IP address. But both of these seem to be contradicted by the fact that you can access the feed in your browser. If this is the User-Agent, take a look at their terms of service to see if they have a banned certain kinds of use of their site / RSS feed.
