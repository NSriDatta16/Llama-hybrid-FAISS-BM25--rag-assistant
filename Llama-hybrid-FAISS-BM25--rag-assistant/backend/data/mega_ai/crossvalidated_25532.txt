What model should I use for this research?

I am currently working on a project dealing with time series data but I have little experience with time series analysis so I was hoping to get some direction on what kind of exploratory data analysis techniques and models I should be looking at, so that I can read up on my own. I have two weekly time series (movie sales), of which one is a control group. The time series of interest is from a singly country A while the control group is a combination of four other countries. My research question is to examine the impact of an event that happened in country A, using the control as a counter factual to represent actual movie sales in A had the event not happened. What kind of exploratory data analysis techniques can I use, and what possible models are there for me to directly answer this research question?
