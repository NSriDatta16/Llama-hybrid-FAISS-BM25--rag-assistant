Best probability density function to use for the prior of a variance parameter in Bayesian inference

This answer provided some good general advice, but in my specific case I want to create a model of my prior beliefs about the variance of a normally-distributed random variable: $$x \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma_x^2)$$ I want an appropriate parameterized function $f$ for my beliefs about $\sigma_x^2$ : $$\sigma_x^2 \sim f(\hat{\sigma_x}^2, ...)$$ where $\hat{\sigma_x}^2$ is my prior 'best guess'. In the answer linked above it suggests using the Gamma distribution for positive real parameters. However, I read on wikipedia.org that the inverse-chi-squared distribution can be used in Bayesian inference: as the prior and posterior distribution for an unknown variance of the normal distribution. But there is also the scaled inverse chi-squared distribution and the Inverse-gamma distribution so now I am confused which is the best one to use. My application is not rocket science so whichever is the most common and/or most appropriate in general.
