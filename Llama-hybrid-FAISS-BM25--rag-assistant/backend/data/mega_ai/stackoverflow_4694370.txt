There's two things you can try to start out: Check Chris Haas' suggestion above and either add a try/catch to deal with nulls, or specifically watch for it using something like this: if e.mailitem isnot nothing andalso e.mailitem.message isnot nothing andalso e.mailitem.subject isnot nothing then ' Fix case elseif e.mailitem isnot nothing andalso e.mailitem.mesasge isnot nothing then ' Subject isn't set, go ahead and set one. end if Remove the code that does anything and just add some dummy code to replace it (like Dim i as integer = 2) to make sure that Exchange isn't stalling out just by having a transport agent of any kind.
