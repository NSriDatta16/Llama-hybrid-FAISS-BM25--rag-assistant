As always there are several ways to accomplish this. I would probably go with two different controllers for the regular missions, perhaps like this: resources :organizations do resources :missions, :only => [:index, :show] resources :admin_missions end resources :missions, :only => [:index, :show] This would of course result in "...admin_missions..." instead of "...admin/missions..." but I think it is the easiest way to do it. This will use three controllers where MissionsController is called from two different locations but you can check what to display by checking if the params[:organization_id] is present or not. Edit If you decide to use the same controller for all missions and for organizations, here is an example for how the index action could start: def index if params[:organization_id] @organization = Organization.find(params[:organization_id]) @missions = @organization.missions.all else @missions = Mission.all end ... end But if you want to have different views for them, then it might be better to separate to two controllers.
