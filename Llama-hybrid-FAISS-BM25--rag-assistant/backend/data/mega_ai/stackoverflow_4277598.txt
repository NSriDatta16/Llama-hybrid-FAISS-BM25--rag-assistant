Javascript organization strategies for Rails 3

I'm currently working on an application with a lot of javascript code. I'm writing inline javascript code on every of the pages/partials, however most of the code is re-utilized somewhere else. I'm trying to figure a way to refactor these little scripts into something more convenient and maintainable. I'm using jQuery, so I'm not using any of the built-in JS generators. So far I've thought of the following: Just move everything into application.js and take benefit from the new UJS style helpers. This is only a little better than what I have right now because I will end up with a big clunky JS file. Use js_erb gem which provides a way to write javascript source code into app/javascripts and get i18n, HTML templates and compilation automatically. Use sprockets-rails which also seems a good alternative even I have never tried it and I'm not sure if it's rails3 compatible. Do you have any experience/suggestion in such topic?
