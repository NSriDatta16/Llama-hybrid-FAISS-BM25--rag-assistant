How to calculate the confidence interval of the x-intercept in a linear regression? Asumptions Use the simple regression model $y_i = \alpha + \beta x_i + \varepsilon_i$. Errors have normal distribution conditional on the regressors $\epsilon | X \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2 I_n)$ Fit using ordinary least square 3 procedures to calculate confidence interval on x-intercept Taylor expansion (easy to use) Marc in the box method (MIB) CAPITANI-POLLASTRI ( https://boa.unimib.it/retrieve/handle/10281/43053/64388/DECAPITANI_Pollastri.pdf ) First order Taylor expansion Your model is $Y=aX+b$ with estimated standard deviation $\sigma_a$ and $\sigma_b$ on $a$ and $b$ parameters and estimated covariance $\sigma_{ab}$. You solve $$aX+b=0 \Leftrightarrow X= \frac{-b} a.$$ Then the standard deviation $\sigma_X$ on $X$ is given by: $$\left( \frac {\sigma_X} X \right)^2 = \left( \frac {\sigma_b} b \right)^2 + \left( \frac {\sigma_a} a \right)^2 - 2 \frac{\sigma_{ab}}{ab}.$$ MIB See code from Marc in the box at How to calculate the confidence interval of the x-intercept in a linear regression? . CAPITANI-POLLASTRI CAPITANI-POLLASTRI provides the Cumulative Distribution Function and Density Function for the ratio of two correlated Normal random variables. It can be used to compute confidence interval of the x-intercept in a linear regression. This procedure gives (almost) identical results as the ones from MIB. Indeed, using ordinary least square and assuming normality of the errors, $\hat\beta \sim \mathcal{N}(\beta, \sigma^2 (X^TX)^{-1})$ (verified) and $\hat{\beta}$'s are correlated (verified). The procedure is the following: get OLS estimator for $a$ and $b$. get the variance-covariance matrix and extract, $\sigma_a, \sigma_b, \sigma_{ab}=\rho\sigma_a\sigma_b$. Assume that $a$ and $b$ follow a Bivariate Correlated Normal distribution, $\mathcal{N}(a, b, \sigma_a, \sigma_b, \rho)$. Then the density function and Cumulative Distribution Function of $x_{intercept}= \frac{-b}{a}$ are given by CAPITANI-POLLASTRI. Use the Cumulative Distribution Function of $x_{intercept}= \frac{-b}{a}$ to compute desired quantiles and set a cofidence interval. Comparaison of the 3 procedures The procedures are compared using the following data configuration: x a b y 10000 diferent sample are generated and analyzed using the 3 methods. The code (R) used to generate and analyze can be found at: https://github.com/adrienrenaud/stackExchange/blob/master/crossValidated/q221630/answer.ipynb MIB and CAPITANI-POLLASTRI give equivalent results. First order Taylor expansion differs significantly from the the two other methods. MIB and CAPITANI-POLLASTRI suffers from under-coverage. The 68% (95%) ci is found to contain the true value 63% (92%) of the time. First order Taylor expansion suffers from over-coverage. The 68% (95%) ci is found to contain the true value 87% (99%) of the time. Conclusions The x-intercept distribution is asymmetric. It justify a asymmetric confidence interval. MIB and CAPITANI-POLLASTRI give equivalent results. CAPITANI-POLLASTRI have a nice theorical justification and it gives grounds for MIB. MIB and CAPITANI-POLLASTRI suffers from moderate under-coverage and can be used to set confidence intervals.
