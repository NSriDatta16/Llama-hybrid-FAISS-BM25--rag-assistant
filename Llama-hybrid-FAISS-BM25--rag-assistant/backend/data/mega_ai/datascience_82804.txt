How can I make a face verification system?

I'm building a face verification system using face embeddings (of 512 dimensions) from a pretrained Facenet model. For this, if I have some 4 to 5 images for a person, how can I successfully verify a new unseen images as either the same or different person? I think this of one class classification (because of having single class) task, and googled it, but unable to find any reliable sources which suits well for this task. Then, I've trained a SVM classifier with embeddings of a person and also with dummy embeddings of some 4 to 5 persons (so that having positive and negative classes). But it doesn't seem to work well. Please suggest me with a ML algorithm/technique for this task, thank you.
