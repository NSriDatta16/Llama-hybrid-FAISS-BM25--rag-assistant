Time Series-Regression analysis- Monthly Revenue instead of Quarterly revenue

I am studying Time series with Regression analysis. I have data that has seasonality and trend. I am using Dummy variables for seasonality- In this case I am using quarters. I selected Quarter 1, Quarter 2 and Quarter 3 and obtained the following model: $ Revenue= \beta_0+\beta_1{X_{1t}}+\beta_2({X_{S1,t}})+\beta_3({X_{S2,t}}) + \beta_4({X_{S3,t1t}})$ Or equivalently: $ Revenue= \beta_0+\beta_1{X_{1t}}+\beta_2(Qrt1)+\beta_3(Qrt2) + \beta_4(Qrt3)$ However if instead of having the quarterly revenue I have available the monthly revenue how should I analyse this time series? I am confused regarding this question. I do not understand what is suppose to do, if I have the monthly revenue, I think instead of: $ revenue= \beta_0+\beta_1{X_{1t}}+\beta_2({X_{S1,t}})+\beta_3({X_{S2,t}}) + \beta_4({X_{S3,t1t}})$, I should have $ revenue=\beta_0+\beta_1(Jan)+\beta_2(Feb)+\beta_3(March)+\beta_4(April)+\beta_5(May)+\beta_6(JUn)+\beta_7(July)+\beta_8(Aug)+\beta_9(Setp)+\beta_10(Oct)+\beta_11(Nov)$ But I am not really sure what is meant by this question. Can anyone help me on this? Thanks I edited the question to add the following information: I have the following data: The question is: If I have available Monthly revenue, how should I analise the time series?
