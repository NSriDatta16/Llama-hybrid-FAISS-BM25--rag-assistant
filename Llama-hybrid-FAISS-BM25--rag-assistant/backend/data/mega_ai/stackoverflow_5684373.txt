What is the correct way to link to a C library (.a) in XCode?

I found a 3rd party library that I would like to use in an iPhone project. The library is written in plain C. I compiled the library and have added the resulting .a file in to my XCode project. Meaning.. I dragged the file into the IDE and xcode made a reference to it. I am new to xcode so my question is how should I actually link to and use this library? Should I be able to #include the headers accompanying the library and start using this? Do I need to provide xcode with some linker arguments? If someone could point me in the right direction I would appreciate it. Thanks! Update Apparently for my example it really is that easy. After doing the above, I just included the header files into my project and started using the library. It appears to be working great.
