You can do it with only one Neural Network. But your Neural Network should look like this: Input Layer: 34 Nodes(one per your input column) Output Layer: 8 Nodes(one per your output column) You can add as many as and as big as hidden layers you want in the Neural Network. So Neural Network outputs 8 predicted values and each value will be a different regression of the inputs.
