XCode fails to deploy iPhone app to iPhone 3GS

So I built my iPhone app and it runs fine in the simulator so I wanted to deploy it to my iPhone for one last testing round before I go into open beta testing wiht my distribution profile. I did this numerous times already and it has never been a problem. However since the last test run I upgraded both my iPhone (iOS 4) and XCode (Version 4 DP2) so maybe the problem is rooted there. The build process runs fine and successful - after that XCode tries to deploy it to my iPhone and fails with a simple "An unknown error has occured". Stumped by this I took a look in the system.log and here is what it says: Jul 29 17:44:18 Xcode[12893]: AMDeviceStartHouseArrestService (thread 0x120e8e000): There was an error from the device: ApplicationLookupFailed Jul 29 17:44:19 Xcode[12893]: call_and_response (thread 0x120e8e000): GOT AN ERROR 0xe800003a Jul 29 17:44:19 Xcode[12893]: perform_command (thread 0x120e8e000): There was an error communicating with the service agent: 0xe8008001 Jul 29 17:44:19 Xcode[12893]: AMDeviceSecureInstallApplication (thread 0x120e8e000): Could not install package on device: e8008001 Jul 29 17:44:19 Xcode[12893]: Result for ‘/SourceCache/DTDeviceKit/DTDeviceKit-232.24/DTDeviceKit/DTDeviceKit_Utilities.m’ at 468 : 0xE8008001 Jul 29 17:44:19 Xcode[12893]: Result for ‘/SourceCache/IDEiPhoneSupport/IDEiPhoneSupport-45/Classes/DVTiPhoneMobileDeviceIO.m’ at 265 : 0xE8008001 As I am guessing this is a rather uncommon problem (hence the "unknown error") I would be very grateful for any pointers on how to go about debugging this thing. I don't expect a solution or anything (though I would be grateful if anybody encountered a similar problem and helped me out with an exact solution ;)) but maybe some of you have a good idea. Judging by the two lines in the log stating that there was an error from the device and in the communication with the service agent I am guessing it might be a problem in the connection to the iPhone itself - but seeing that synching with iTunes and all the "normal" stuff works just fine I cannot figure out what that problem might be. Thanks in advance for helping me on this. Update So, after looking around I found this on the device console in the XCode Organizer: Thu Jul 29 22:40:00 Roberts-3GS SCHelper[38] : 0x104e60 {port = 0x382b, caller = SpringBoard(42):com.apple.preferences, path = /Library/Preferences/SystemConfiguration/preferences.plist} Thu Jul 29 22:40:22 Roberts-3GS installd[960] : unrecognized status -25293 from codesigning library Thu Jul 29 22:40:22 Roberts-3GS installd[960] : 00503000 verify_signer_identity: Could not copy validate signature: -402620415 Thu Jul 29 22:40:22 Roberts-3GS installd[960] : 00503000 preflight_application_install: Could not verify executable at /var/tmp/install_staging.0DuNfz/landu.app Thu Jul 29 22:40:22 Roberts-3GS installd[960] : 00503000 install_application: Could not preflight application install Thu Jul 29 22:40:22 Roberts-3GS mobile_installation_proxy[961] : handle_install: Installation failed Thu Jul 29 22:40:22 Roberts-3GS installd[960] : 00503000 handle_install: API failed Thu Jul 29 22:40:22 Roberts-3GS installd[960] : 00503000 send_message: failed to send mach message of 64 bytes: 10000003 Thu Jul 29 22:40:22 Roberts-3GS installd[960] : 00503000 send_error: Could not send error response to client So it seems the iPhone was not able to validate the signature of the code signing. I guess I will re-create some certificates and try again tomorrow. I'll let you know how it turns out.
