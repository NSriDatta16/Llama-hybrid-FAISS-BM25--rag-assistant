Selecting Regressors from list for time series

I have been try to get results from a time series problem and I have used fb's prophet algo for that. Now problem is I have to select comb of those regressors giving me least rmse. I used granger causality test but somehow that is not giving as good results as that of combinations for rmse. Any suggestion. One alternative is to perform comb of features, add them as regressors via multiprocessing, which is still a lot. any other way i can remove those features(in this case market time series ecnometric indexes)
