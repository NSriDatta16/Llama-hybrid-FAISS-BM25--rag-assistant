Several ways of placing an image in a QTextEdit

I think this is a very simple question, but when I copy an image I can't paste it in a QTextEdit? Paste is inactive! Also I would like to know how to drag-and-drop a picture. BTW I use the following code in order to insert a picture into a QTextEdit: QTextEdit *textEditor = new QTextEdit(0); QTextDocumentFragment fragment; fragment = QTextDocumentFragment::fromHtml(" "); textEditor->textCursor().insertFragment(fragment); textEditor->setVisible(true); Is it recommended? How do you do this operation?
