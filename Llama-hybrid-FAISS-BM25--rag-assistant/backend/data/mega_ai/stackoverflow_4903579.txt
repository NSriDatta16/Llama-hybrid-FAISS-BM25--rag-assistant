I think your problem is that clenotes.cfg has DOS line endings, which Python is misinterpreting. Try changing this line of clenotes.py config.readfp(open('%sconfig/clenotes.cfg' % System.getProperty('jython.home'))) to read config.readfp(open('%sconfig/clenotes.cfg' % System.getProperty('jython.home'), "rU")) The "rU" tells Python that even though it's running on a Unix system it should be prepared to cope with a file containing DOS line endings. See http://docs.python.org/library/functions.html#open -- scroll down to the paragraph that begins "In addition to the standard fopen() modes...". (Or you could run this command: perl -pi.bak -e 's/[ \t\r]+$// clenotes.cfg -- that will convert it to Unix line endings. In your shoes I would probably do both .) (If neither of the above suggestions helps, the next thing I would try is hitting clenotes.py itself with the above perl command. I don't see how that could be the problem, but if the \r characters are not coming from clenotes.cfg , the .py file is the only plausible remaining source.) (EDIT: Based on your comments on the question itself, I now think it's clenotes.cmd , the shell script wrapper, that needs to be converted from DOS to Unix line endings.)
