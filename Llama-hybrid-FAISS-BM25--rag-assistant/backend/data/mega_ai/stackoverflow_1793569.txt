Just wanted to say that I love your second idea . It looks like it has everything to do with NLP. It seems very interesting to me. IMO, I would go with this one, for sure. But you should also consider the one that attracts you more and not only opinions of others. As for the language to choose, I think you should choose the one that you are more comfortable with. I'm not familiar with libraries but I've seen many NLP things done in Python and Java.
