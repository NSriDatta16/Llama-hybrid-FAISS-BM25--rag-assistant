VB.net Sub Procedure using Parameters

I am trying to create a DisplayAverage sub procedure that accepts 3 integer numbers as parameters. This procedure should find the average of these 3 numbers and display the numbers along with their average in the list box. I know I'm doing something wrong here I just cant figure out what. Private Sub btnAverage_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnAverage.Click Dim a As Integer = CInt(txtone.Text) Dim b As Integer = CInt(txtTwo.Text) Dim c As Integer = CInt(txtThree.Text) Dim average As Double average = (a + b + c) / 3 lstOutput.Items.Add(average.ToString()) End Sub Sub DisplayMyName() lstOutput.Items.Add("David Whitney") End Sub Sub DisplayAverage() Dim a As Integer = CInt(txtone.Text) Dim b As Integer = CInt(txtTwo.Text) Dim c As Integer = CInt(txtThree.Text) Dim average As Double average = (a + b + c) / 3 lstOutput.Items.Add("The average of " & a & " and " _ & b & " and " & c & " is " & average) End Sub Private Sub btnAve_Click(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnAve.Click lstOutput.Items.Clear() DisplayMyName() Dim a As Integer = CInt(txtone.Text) Dim b As Integer = CInt(txtTwo.Text) Dim c As Integer = CInt(txtThree.Text) Dim average As Double average = (a + b + c) / 3 lstOutput.Items.Add(average.ToString()) DisplayAverage() End Sub End Class
