autocorrelation in evaluating time series forecasts

I'm having some trouble wrapping my head around whether using Holt-Winters ETS or an ARIMA model for forecasting sales figures (which are highly seasonal). I'm been using R and the Forecast package -- which already has seen massive improvement from my hand-coded Excel-based ETS and ARIMA models (probably because many background AIC tests are conducted and parameters possibly optimized). In any case, I'm starting with the accuracy() function before I start hand-calculating the accuracy measures myself (so I know more what's going on). I know what most of the measures mean, but I'm afraid I'm not exactly sure about auto-correlation. I know that means the tendency of -- well, I assume the forecast rather than the sample, which is the same for both methods --- the tendency of the forecast to correlate with itself (given lag 1, or lag n, I'm not sure). Is this a measure of accuracy? Or model fit? Or just a 'good to know'? I'm not sure what a large, small, or negative number might mean here. Well, I do -- negative means the forecast is likely to swing the opposite direction of the past --- but how does this judge the forecast accuracy? Thanks for your help -- I have a stack of statistics and forecasting books (Armstrongs Principles of Forecasts and Makridakis, Wheelwright, and Hyndman's Forecasting Methods) --- both are great. Armstrong's is very high level, which is great -- the other explains how to properly execute methods and the reasoning -- but I still find the nitty gritty details of my statistics and forecast knowledge lacking in some fundamentals.
