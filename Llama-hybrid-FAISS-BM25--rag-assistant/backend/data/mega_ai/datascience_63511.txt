MultiLabelBinarizer is an good choice. For sparse features i would say first do some feature engineering on them. If necessary then keep them else discard them. If you keep them then by applying error reduction methods helps a lot. They will fill the sparse features & then by encoding the categorical features you can apply machine learning models on them. I was stuck on features with more sparse values so i followed the above approach. Worked fine with me.
