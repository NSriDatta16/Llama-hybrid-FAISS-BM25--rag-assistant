Basically in machine learning, you can't take a dataset and want to "find any info". You have to specify which kind of info you want. In your case, you could do a complete model trying to predict, using the logo as entry, if the company is recent or old for example. Here you defined your problem. Then you'll need training data, so you'll either have to specify yourself for a huge amount of logo, if the company is old or not, and then your model has some basis to learn, or find a way to automate this process (like browse logos and automatically find the date of creation of the firm to create the training data). This problem is a Classification problem. You can also make Clustering, which would be for example giving the model some logos, and ask it to make groups of logos having the same global look. Wathever your need is, you have to define it clearly so as your algorithm trains in this goal. You cannot just say "give me some informations about the company, the product"
