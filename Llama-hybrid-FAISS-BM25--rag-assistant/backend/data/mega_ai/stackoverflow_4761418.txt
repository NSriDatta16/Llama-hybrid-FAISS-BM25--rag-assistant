While formatting is important, in the end it's your formatting. Do it how you like. The particular style you choose is a personal choice and many styles can be "good". However, any "good" formatting style must be consistent - pick the rules you like and stick to them . It's kind of funny to me how debates rage over things like placing { on the same line as the preceeding code or not, or "cuddling curly braces" around an else . I think only communists place a { on the same line as their if statement. :)
