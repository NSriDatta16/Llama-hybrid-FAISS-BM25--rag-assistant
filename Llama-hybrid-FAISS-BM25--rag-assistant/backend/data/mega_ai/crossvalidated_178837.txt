SVM - can I use the decision function for calculating AUC?

An SVM returns a real-valued prediction for each of the input data samples, which corresponds to its distance from the separating hyperplane. Platt's scaling is often used to output a "probability" value instead. Is there something wrong with using the SVM decision function values to calculate area under the ROC curve, instead of bothering with fitting probability estimates? I find that there tends to be a higher concentration of correctly classified examples, further from the hyperplane - so in practice, using the decision function appears to have value. But are there dangers to this of which I am not aware?
