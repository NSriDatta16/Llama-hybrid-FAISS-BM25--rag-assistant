data size requirements for XGBoost

This is a quick question. If I compare neural network and random forest, the data size requirement is huge in neural network, but a decision tree or random forest can work with less number of records too. Does any such problem occurs with XGBoost as well? Does it also need a lot of data so that it can go in multiple iterations to reduce the error term?
