If you want to be up to date with the new advancements, a good way is skimming through the accepted papers of the major NLP conferences, namely ACL , EMNLP , and the regional EACL, NAACL, AACL. If you want even more information, you can skim through the papers uploaded to the arxiv. One way to do that is via Twitter, by following bots that tweet papers in specific areas. For instance this bot tweets the papers uploaded to the computational linguistics (CL) category. If you just want to check the best approaches when you are to decide how to approach a problem, then a good option is paperswithcode . It is a website with the state of the art in different areas (not only NLP), with rankings of the results for different benchmarks, together with links to the paper and source code. For instance, you can have a look at the machine translation section here .
