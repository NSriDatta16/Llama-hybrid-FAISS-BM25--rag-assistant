Echoing @Dave, statistical tests are to be avoided in this situation, and in general they fail to answer the "how much effect" question. Compatibility (aka confidence; credible intervals for a Bayesian analysis) intervals are called for. These expose the difficulty of the task (i.e., how much you don't know) when N=3 in one of the groups. You can use the proportional odds model (a generalization of the Kruskal-Wallis test) to get confidence intervals for 3 different odds ratios for the pairwise comparisons.
