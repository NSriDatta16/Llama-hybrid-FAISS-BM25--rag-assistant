XSLT encoding problem, questionmarks in result

I'm trying to run an XSLT transformation, but characters like ëöï are replaced by a literal '?' in the output (I checked with an hex editor). The source file has the correct characters, and the stylesheet has: What else am I missing? I'm using saxon as the transformer, if that matters.
