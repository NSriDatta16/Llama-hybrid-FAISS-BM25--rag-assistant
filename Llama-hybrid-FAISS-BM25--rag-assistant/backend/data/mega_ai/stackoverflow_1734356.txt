I think there's some confusion being introduced by the way you've phrased your question. Change tracking within the context of an ORM typically refers to the data . From the responses to the other answers, you're referring to Schema versioning . Whether this is a necessity or not depends entirely on the context of your environment. If you entirely control the database and the webapp, and have the freedom to control deployments to the environments in which they both run - then it may not be necessary. If you're working within a larger system or organisation, management of deployments or changes to both may not be as easy - and so it may be necessary to have your applications work with older versions of the schema for some time.
