Yes, your intuition is right. Logistic regression ( family = binomial(link = "logit") ) is the way to go, but instead of making the dependent variable the rate, make it the number of good and bad eggs (i.e., use cbind(Good.Egg, Bad.Egg) on the left-hand side of ~ ). This is equivalent to recoding the data to have one row for each egg, with the dependent variable being a flag indicating whether the egg is bad or good. Of course, without context , I don't know if this is the specific model you should use for your specific case. I'm supplying an answer to the general problem of binary outcomes.
