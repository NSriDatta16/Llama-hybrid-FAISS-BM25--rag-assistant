I think that you have to draw a finer distinction between properties of a statistical test (alpha, FDR) and properties of a particular result (p-value, Q) The proportion you are considering (%38) is Q, not FDR. It describes one particular result. FDR is defined as the expected proportion of false positives among positives, FDR=E(Q). In other words, if you would repeat the experiment an infinite number of times, compute in each repetition the same proportion you've computed in your example and average across all repetitions, then you will have a single proportion that would be the FDR. From this description it's clear that the FDR cannot depend on any particular p-value (but it certainly depends on alpha). I also suspect that you understand p-value and alpha as equivalents. They are not. Alpha is the probability of a false-positive, a property of the statistical test. A p-value is the probability of observing a particular result assuming its a negative. Hence if you get a small (or large) p-value, it does not say anything about the proportion of false positives. See this question for further elaboration of this point..
