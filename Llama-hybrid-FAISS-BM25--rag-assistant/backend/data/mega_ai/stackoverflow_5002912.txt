You definitely could batch scale those @2x images and save the scaled files to the documents folder. That would save download time, and use the same amount of space as bundling everything with your application, at the cost of some added complexity. I don't think that deleting the original @2x images is possible, however, or worth it even if it were - there's the possibility of moving apps and user data between devices. It would be the best just to choose the right data based on resolution, once you have them both. And I don't see much reason for Apple to smack you for doing this. Oh, and of course, if you really have a lot of data, in the order of hundreds of megabytes, doing two versions of the app might make sense (in the vein of Rage, for example).
