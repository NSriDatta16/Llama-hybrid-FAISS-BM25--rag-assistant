You code seems alright, just a couple of suggestions: Add semicolons at the end of your lines (To avoid any issues). No need for a $(ui.draggable) since ui.draggable is already a jQuery object. . $("ul.searchPage").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui){ var param = ui.draggable.attr('class'); addlist(param); alert(param); } }); BTW= jQuery UI will add a couple of classes to the Draggable object, so you should consider that in your addlist function.
