This is called Dataset Shift setting. This pdf [1] should help you understand several of the underlying issues involved. For the moment however, you can use least squares importance fitting to obtain importance estimates for your training data using your test set (you don't need the test set labels, just the feature vectors) [2]. Once you gain the importance estimates, you can use them as instance weights in libSVM [3]. That should enable you to get a better classifier.
