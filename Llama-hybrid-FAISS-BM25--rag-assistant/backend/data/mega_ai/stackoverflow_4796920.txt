Problem during the insatallation of NS 2.29 on windows

I have to install NS 2.29 network simulator on windows, for which i first installed cygwin. While I was installing ns2 it can not detect xorg-x11-base neither XFree86-base , for which I again installed the X11 package and even installed xcygwin, all the components were installed, but still ns2 can't recognize it. I tried to install ns2 regardless of this than after almost 80 % of installation an error occurred: ./sctp/sctp.h:705:error: extra qualification 'SctpAgent::' on member 'DumpSendBuffer'
