A similar but not the same approach is Bayesian HPO , where a probabilistic model is fit over the HPs (based on their validation performance) and new prospectively good HPs are guessed. So, treating your model as a black-box with HPs as inputs and validation performance as output is not an entirely new thing. Also bear in mind that, in general, extrapolation is not the strongest asset of ML algorithms.
