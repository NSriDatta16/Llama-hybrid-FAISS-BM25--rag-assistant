Hamiltonian Monte Carlo vs. Sequential Monte Carlo

I am trying to get a feel for the relative merits and drawbacks, as well as different application domains of these two MCMC schemes. When would you use which and why? When might one fail but the other not (e.g. where is HMC applicable but SMC not, and vice versa) Could one, very naively granted, put a measure of utility on one method compared to the other (i.e. is one, generally, better )? I am currently reading Betancourt's excellent paper on HMC .
