You are calling *.openFileDialog(foo,bar) right? FileOpenService fos = (FileOpenService)ServiceManager.lookup("javax.jnlp.FileOpenService"); FileContents fc = fos.openFileDialog(null, null); Sorry if this is a dumb question, but until you update your question with source I can't think of much else.
