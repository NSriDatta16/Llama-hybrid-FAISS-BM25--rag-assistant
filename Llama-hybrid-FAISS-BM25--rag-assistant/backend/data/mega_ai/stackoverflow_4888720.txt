DotNetNuke - Pro vs. Community Versions

Our organization is looking to put up a site utilizing DotNetNuke, and according to our consultant (who is less a .Net fan and more of a Joomla fan), there is 'anecotal evidence' that the Community version is crippled in a way that pretty much forces you to get Pro if you wish to have a reliable site. I have serious doubts as to the validity of this claim, but just in case I would be very interested to hear if this is or is not the case, based on use of the product and it's community and professional versions. Specifically, if there are bugs/issues/etc in the community version that are resolved only by upgrading to pro. I apoligize in advance if I posted this on the wrong stack exchange, but figured this was the best bet ;)
