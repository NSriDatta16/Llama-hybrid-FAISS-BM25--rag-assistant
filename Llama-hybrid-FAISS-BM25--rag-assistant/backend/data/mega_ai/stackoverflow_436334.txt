consider using placement new : void Empty() { this->~Foo(); new (this) Foo(); } Your code invokes operator = which might lead to all kinds of side-effects. EDIT in response to the comments. – This code is definitely well-defined, the standard explicitly allows it. I'm going to post the paragraph later if I find the time. About delete – of course. What I meant was ~Foo() , this was an oversight. And yes, Rob is right as well; destructing the object is actually necessary here to call the string's destructor.
