If these files are intended to be read only, put them in a Jar, add the Jar to the applications run-time class-path and access them using getResource(). If the files are intended to be written to (read/write), avoid attempting to save files in a location relative to the application executable(1). This will lead to no end of frustration later. Instead, put the data files in a sub-directory of ${user.home}. The sub-directory is to help ensure that applications do not overwrite each others files. The sub-directory might be based on the package name of the main class of the app., which should be unique to your organization. (1) Neither applets nor apps. launched using Java Web Start are able to discover the location the app. is stored on the local disk. Microsoft has been telling developers for years not to save program settings in the 'Program Files' folder. While an app. is almost guaranteed of being able to write to/read from user home, the tightening of security in recent times means that other locations are much less reliable.
