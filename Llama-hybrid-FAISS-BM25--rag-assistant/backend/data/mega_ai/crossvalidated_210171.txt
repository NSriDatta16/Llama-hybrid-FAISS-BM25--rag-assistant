Logistic Regression Probabilities

I have performed a logistic regression on some data, and the function is: $p(x,y) = \frac{\exp(4.5 + 3.5x - 0.1y)}{1+\exp(4.5 + 3.5x - 0.1y)}$ This also gives you the probability of observing some event $(x,y)$ as I understand it. My question is, what does it mean in this case that probabilities should sum to 1? I.e., if I take various inputs $(x,y)$, and get lets' say 0.4916,0.3379,0.3381,0.289, etc... these don't add to 1, but they are probabilities, so how does one interpret the whole "summing to 1" in this case? Thanks!
