I am writing a pretty simple iPhone app that will play a sound depending on which button is pressed

A... as I learn Objective C. There will be close to 20 button on a view at a time... :) If I use a if/else loop for each button touched, it works great but I consider that to be inelegant and just plain cumbersome. SO, I am using the button.tag to allow me to assign a number to each button then evaluate each button based on the .tag property. As I mentioned before, works great with if/else if loops. But I want to change the tag to a string and then nest it within a NSURL to play a sound. Each button will generate a new tag and consequently a new sound. As reported by the debugger, I am getting Not a CFSTRING and 'out of bounds' messages and upon stepping through, crashes. Fun, but not blue screen. Here is the code in question. I humbly request of the Objective C gurus to lend some insight! int soundNumber = [sender tag]; //soundPick = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d", soundNumber]; //remmed out as an alternative try NSString *soundPick = [[NSNumber numberWithInt:soundNumber] stringValue]; NSURL *aSoundURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:[mainBundle pathForResource:soundPick ofType:@"aif"]]; playSound = [[AVAudioPlayer alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:aSoundURL error:&error]; if (!playSound) { NSLog(@"no Sound for that button: %@", [error localizedDescription]); } [playSound play]; */ Thanks, Neil
