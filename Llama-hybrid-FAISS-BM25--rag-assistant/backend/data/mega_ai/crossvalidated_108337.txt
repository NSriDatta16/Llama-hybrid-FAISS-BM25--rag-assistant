Can I difference after fitting a time series regression model?

Suppose that I have a time series that exhibits a notable trend, and I want to test a hypothesis that a second variable is related to that trend. I fit a linear regression model with that second variable as a predictor, and it accounts for a significant amount of variance. However, there is some part of the trend that it does not account for. I then want to include AR or MA terms to the model to account for the autocorrelated residuals, but ARIMA models assume a stationary series, and visual inspection of the series and an ADF test indicate that the residual error series is not stationary in the mean (i.e., there is some trend left unaccounted for by the regression model). Is it fine to difference after the regression model has been fit to remove this source of non-stationarity, or should one always try and find a regression model that explains all the trend in the data? Thanks in advance!
