By considering the log of the time series, i.e. $$ \{\log{S(t)}\}_{t=0}^{t=T}$$ we have $$ \log{S(0)} + (\mu - \delta^2/2)t + \delta w(t) $$ ( $w(0) = 0$ ). Taking first differences of this series, $\log{S_{t_i}} - \log{S_{t_{i-1}} }$, gives a new series: $$ (\mu - \delta^2/2)( t_i - t_{i-1} ) + \delta( w(t_i) - w(t_{i-1} ) )$$ This new series is independent and Normally distributed, with mean $(\mu - \delta^2/2)( t_i - t_{i-1} )$ and standard deviation $\delta\sqrt{ t_i - t_{i-1} }$. One can use MLE to find the "best" estimators of the two unknowns.
