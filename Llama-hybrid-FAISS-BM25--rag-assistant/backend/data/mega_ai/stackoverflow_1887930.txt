I don't think it possible. Look at javac documentation javac determines whether the class file is out of date. If the class file is out of date, javac recompiles the source file and uses the updated class file. Otherwise, javac just uses the class file. javac considers a class file out of date only if it is older than the source file. Maven compiler plugin (or ant task) doesn't do more than javac does. I strongly recommend using clean target. Not using it might cause a lot of problems especially if you instantly deploy your artifact to production (like. javac relying on file timestamp is fragile, some resources might be filtered etc.) If you have problem with build performace, try to find other solutions - e.g. divide your module into smaller submodules.
