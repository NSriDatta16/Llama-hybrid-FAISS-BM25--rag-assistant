MySQL won't generate in-memory table for BLOB types, as the storage engine doesn't support it. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/internal-temporary-tables.html "Some conditions prevent the use of an in-memory temporary table, in which case the server uses an on-disk table instead: Presence of a BLOB or TEXT column in the table" Which means you should put the BLOB into a different table, and leave other useful data in a BLOBless table so that table will be optimized.
