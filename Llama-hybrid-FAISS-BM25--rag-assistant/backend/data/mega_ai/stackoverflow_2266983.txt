As groovingandi suggests, set a conditional breakpoint within your code at the start of the iteration where the for loop normally gets stuck. You can do this with a command like: dbstop in runscript at 500 if iLoop==365 % where 500 is the first line within the for loop, % and 365 is the iteration causing problems If your script gets stuck without breakpoints, but can continue happily past that point if you use breakpoints and then continue, this normally indicates you've got a sporadic failure that's time-dependent, perhaps a race condition. Perhaps you're writing a file to the operating system, and then immediately afterwards looking at the OS to figure out what the next file's name should be, but your filesystem is cacheing slightly? Things like that have caused similar problems for me. Look carefully at what your code is doing each time round the loop, for anything that might depend on steps before it that might be running asynchronously.
