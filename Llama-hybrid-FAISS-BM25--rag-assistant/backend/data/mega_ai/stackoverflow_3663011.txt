What you need to do is clear the left and right floats in between list 3 and list4. Use the clear:both CSS property to, in effect, create a line break in between floated elements. EDIT I attached jQuery to show you the most elegant way to dynamically produce the effect you are looking for. ul {float:left;} .clear {clear:both;} $('ul').last().prepend(' ')
