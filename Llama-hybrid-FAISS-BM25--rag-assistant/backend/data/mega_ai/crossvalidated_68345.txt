can Dirichlet prior distribution be larger than 1?

This question is related to my quest of clustering the sequences using mixture Markov modeling. I have trouble understanding Dirichlet priors in the context of MAP-estimate (Mixture Markov Models). Namely, my priors end up being (much) larger than one. I have non-informative priors defined as following: $$ p(\theta_n^{j}|a_n^{j})=\frac{\Gamma(\sum_{m=1}^{M}(a_{nm}^{j}+1))}{\prod_{m=1}^{M}\Gamma(a_{nm}^{j}+1)}*\prod_{m=1}^{M}(\theta_{nm}^{j})^{a_{nm}^{j}}, $$ where each $a_n^{j}$ is a M -vector with components $a_{nm}^{j}>0$. j denotes the jth component in the mixture and n is the number of the row of the TPM ( transition probability matrix). Then I use the sum of log(Dirichlet Priors) across each row and each component. The most confusing aspects are: 1) In all literature the Dirichlet prior formula is given as: $$ p(\theta_n^{j}|a_n^{j})=\frac{\Gamma(\sum_{m=1}^{M}(a_{nm}^{j}))}{\prod_{m=1}^{M}\Gamma(a_{nm}^{j})}*\prod_{m=1}^{M}(\theta_{nm}^{j})^{a_{nm}^{j}-1}, $$ (notice the -1 in the exponent term). Is there possibly a typo in the article or can the -1 term be skipped? 2) The article sets $a_n^{j}$ equal to 10% of the corresponding relative frequencies of the TPM of the original counts across all sequences ( if our model has just 1 component). Then, let us consider such example: there are 3 possible states in the Markov Chain, and the n -th row transition probabilities are 0.1, 0.8, 0.1. Let $a_n^j$ be equal to (0.01,0.03,0.06). Then, following the formula, my prior will be ( calculated in R) : according to the first version of formula: 1.961152 according to the second version of the formula: 245.144 This has been computed by defining a function in R: > dirichletPrior The results seem a bit like a nonsense to me, and I do not understand where is my logic faulty. 3) Is "Dirichlet prior" a probability density function or a likelihood function? What would it mean if the result for each row is larger than 1? Are alpha multinomial parameters like I gave in the example, meaningful at all? What do they have in common with concentration parameter? The article I have been referring to is located under the following link: http://www.cs.uoi.gr/~kblekas/papers/C19.pdfâ€Ž.
