This is such an open ended question, but I would start with physical measurements. 1. Are all the machines I think are hosting this site pingable? 2. Are all the machines which should be serving content actually serving some content? (Ideally this would be hit from an external network.) 3. Is each expected service on each machine running? 3a. Have those services run recently? 4. Does each machine have hard drive space left? (Don't forget the db) 5. Have these machines been backed up? When was the last time? Once one lays out the physical monitoring of the systems, one can address those specific to a system? 1. Can an automated script log in? How long did it take? 2. How many users are live? Have there been a million fake accounts added? ... These sorts of questions get more nebulous, and can be very system specific. They also usually can be derived reactively when responding to phsyical measurements. Hard drive fill up, maybe the web server logs got filled up because a bunch of agents created too many fake users. That kind of thing. While plan A shouldn't necessarily be reactive, it is the way many a site setup a monitoring system.
