I think your solution would be to impute the values while using the predict() function. See ?predict.train for more details. You can use na.omit to allow caret to impute values. For example: ## S3 method for class 'train': predict((object, newdata = NULL, type = "raw", na.action = na.omit, ...) from http://www.inside-r.org/packages/cran/caret/docs/predict.train Another solution would be to impute while preprocessing the data: ## S3 method for class 'default': preProcess(x, method = "knnImpute", # or *bagImpute* / *medianImpute* pcaComp = 10, na.remove = TRUE, k = 5, knnSummary = mean, outcome = NULL, fudge = .2, numUnique = 3, verbose = TRUE, ) from http://www.inside-r.org/node/86978
