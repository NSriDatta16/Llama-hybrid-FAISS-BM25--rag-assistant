There are a couple of options here. I assume that your result is a StreamResult that you are creating with a String specifying the destination file path. You might consider opening a FileOutputStream yourself, and constructing your StreamResult with that. Then, when the transformer is done, append the line terminator, flush, and close the stream. In the absence of constraints otherwise, I would use this approach. If you want to re-open the file, as shown in the question, you'll need to use a FileOutputStream constructor that takes the optional append argument. Set this to true to avoid clobbering the result of the transform that was just completed. You might also explore setting the indent output property in your transform, or including the necessary line terminator directly in your template.
