I'm not sure I understand the design correctly, but the first thing that comes to mind is that this is a case of Simpson's paradox : the relationship between pastoral and nr of workers is positive within each year but negative on average across years. If you look at the first image in the link and imagine pastoral is x and nr of workers is y and the different groups of points represent different years - could that be the case? If so, you could try fitting a multilevel model with a random slope of pastoral using year as the random effect grouping variable.
