Supervised learning on large number of dissimilar html documents

Complete newbie here. I have a node script that parses thousands of large html docs and extracts data. My algorithm isn't perfect (the html docs are not similarly structured). I've been reading about supervised learning and other machine learning techniques and was hoping for some guidance. Here's an example input/output: var vector = readFile('file.html'); var desiredOutput = { 'Net Income from herding cats': [ { 2015, '79268' }, { 2014, '79268' }, { 2013, '79268' } ] }; var trainedModel = trainInput(vector, desiredOutput); Example input for file.html &nbsp; 2015 &nbsp; 2014 &nbsp; 2013 Net Income from herding cats $ 79,268 &nbsp; $ 70,080 &nbsp; $ 60,903 This table for is simplified for demonstration purposes. All of these documents are terribly structured and can have 100s of tables. Each table has different formatting. There are no reliable classes or ids to rely on so using jquery/cheerio is not a perfect solution. I've been using a dictionary search to select the appropriate tables and then some regex to extract keys/values. My accuracy is fairly good, but I'd like to make it better if possible. My questions are: What ML technique is applicable for inferring a function based on a set of examples? Is there a preferred library for this?* [Note*] It is not required to be fast as I am not doing realtime analysis. I do not need a UI or data viz. I'm using node but can really use anything if there are better options in python/java.
