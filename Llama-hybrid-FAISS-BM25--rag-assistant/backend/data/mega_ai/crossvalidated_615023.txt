A GARCH model specifies the entire conditional distribution of a time series $\{x_t\}$ at each time point. E.g. an ARMA(p,q)-GARCH(r,s) model looks like this: \begin{aligned} x_t &= \mu_t + u_t, \\ \mu_t &= c + \varphi_1 x_{t-1} + \dots + \varphi_p x_{t-p} + \theta_1 u_{t-1} + \dots + \theta_q u_{t-q}, \\ u_t &= \sigma_t \varepsilon_t, \\ \sigma_t^2 &= \omega + \alpha_1 u_{t-1}^2 + \dots + \alpha_s u_{t-s}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2 + \dots + \beta_r \sigma_{t-r}^2, \\ \varepsilon_t &\sim i.i.D(0,1), \end{aligned} where $D$ is some probability distribution with zero mean and unit variance. Thus the distribution of $x_t$ is $D(0,1)$ scaled by $\sigma_t$ and shifted by $\mu_t$ . Knowing the distribution, you can extract VaR and CVaR. You can do this analytically or by simulation. In the latter case, you generate a large number of realizations from the distribution of the time point of interest and obtain the empirical VaR and CVaR.
