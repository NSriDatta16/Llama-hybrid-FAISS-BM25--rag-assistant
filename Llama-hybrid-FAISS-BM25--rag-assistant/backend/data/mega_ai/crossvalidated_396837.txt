Lagged dependent variable with non stationary time series

I'm doing a regression analysis with non stationary time series. If I run the regression the residuals are auto correlated and non stationary. If i add a lag of the dependent variable (the estimated coefficient is about 0.75 so the dynamic is stable), residuals become well behaved and i have a really high R^2. It's ok to proceed in this way or it's still a spourious regression?Standard errors are still valid?
