Cannot find Function Definition of an Event Observer class in Magento

For anybody who has seen / used Magento, can you please tell me where can I find the following 3 function's definitions of the Catalog Product's save action's Event Observer class:- setBundleOptionsData() setBundleSelectionsData() setCanSaveBundleSelections() Please pardon me, for asking such a silly question, but I am really helpless. Any help is greatly appreciated. The worst part is that these above 3 methods are being used for the product object in a nice way, & they are working too. But where are their definitions? EDIT:- Okay, I can understand that these are used by the "Varien_Object", and these are simple setter functions using the concept of Magic Methods. But can somebody please tell what is the coding flow, when the program counter arrives at such a function, in this case in the Event Observer class?
