Drupal will do a fine job of managing users and associated information about users. It will create a framework that you can leverage to integrate your games into the system. However, the games themselves will likely need to be translated into using the Drupal API, which isn't trivial. Drupal's learning curve can be steep, particularly if you have your own style of doing things. Having said that, Drupal is extremely flexible and is more aptly called a Web Framework than a Content Management System. I suggest you create a test version of your site on a local install and see how it feels to try and integrate one of your existing games into the Drupal framework. You'll know quickly if you like it or not.
