A JSON file doesn't really need to comply with a consistent schema. There can be ragged rows; elements can vary in sequence across rows; any row can have any elements (or none). All in hierarchical-node fashion. So coming up with what you want by ad hoc inspection (reflection) could be pretty dicey. Not to say that any parties involved in using a JSON format couldn't put more structural requrements in place, but then you'd have the schema to start with.
