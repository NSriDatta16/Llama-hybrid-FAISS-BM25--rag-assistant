I come from a computer science background focusing on machine learning. However, I really started to understand (and more important to apply) statistics after taking a Pattern Recognition course using Bishop's Book https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cmbishop/#!prml-book here are some course slides from MIT: http://www.ai.mit.edu/courses/6.867-f03/lectures.html This will just give you the background (+ some matlab code) to use statistics for real work problems and is definitely more on the applied side. Yet, it highly depends on what you want to do with your knowledge. To get a measure for how good you are you might want to browse the open course ware of some university for advanced statistics courses, to check if you know the topics covered. Just my 5 cent.
