You can use the SQLCMD utility to connect to the three different servers / databases and run the stored procedure script. The control script may look something like this: :connect server1 use DatabaseName GO :r StoredProcedure.sql GO :connect server2 use DatabaseName GO :r StoredProcedure.sql GO :connect server3 use DatabaseName GO :r StoredProcedure.sql GO SQL Compare is a great tool, especially for large or complex updates. However, you do have to pay for it. Using a utility like SQLCMD is not quite so elegant, but it is quick and free.
