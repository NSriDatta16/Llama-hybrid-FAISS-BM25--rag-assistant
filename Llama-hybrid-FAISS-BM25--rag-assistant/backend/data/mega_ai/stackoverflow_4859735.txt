fancybox mixed content problem on magento

I am using fancybox for signin/Register links on the top. The site was fully http and certainly client wants to enable ssl and by that https enabled. So here the fancybox ended up in problem. This is what header link phtml code. Hi Guest, ">Sign in or false));?>customer/account/create/">Register And when i click there is no response, after long debugging i found/guess its a mixed content problem. Since am loading a secure page content in unsecure page. How can i load https content on http page using fancybox in magento. Please help me out from this. Thanks in advance.
