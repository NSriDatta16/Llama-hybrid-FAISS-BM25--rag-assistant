Transforming categorical data to vectors

I am faced with a classification problem. One of my features consists of categorical data with 150 factors (these are related to jobs i.e. sales assistant , desk clerk etc). My initial approach was to use the randomForest package (in R) but it appears that it cannot handle more than 52 levels. I have heard about word embedding and word2vec . My question is, would it makes sense to convert my categorical data to vectors, rather than one-hot encoding? Could it affect model accuracy?
