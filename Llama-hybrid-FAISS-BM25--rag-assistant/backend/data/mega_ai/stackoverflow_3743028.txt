I have interesting solution: Do edge detection, for edge pixels extraction. Do physical simulation - consider edge pixels as positively charged particles. Now put some number of free positively charged particles in the stroke area. Calculate electrical force equations for determining movement of these free particles. Simulate particles movement for some time until particles reach position equilibrium. (As they will repel from both stoke edges after some time they will stay in the middle line of stoke) Now stroke thickness/2 would be average distance from edge particle to nearest free particle.
