COVID-19 Shock: Time Series not Stationary Anymore

I am trying to forecast the private consumption for 2020 of a small region based on the national time series of the same variable. With some adjustments I managed to get both the series stationary by taking the natural log and double differentiated the time series. Then I estimated an ARIMA model which worked fine until 2019. However, the value for 2020, already available on national level destroyed everything: due to the COVID-19 shock the national time series isn't by far stationary anymore. Do you have any suggestions to overcome this problem? Any help appreciated
