How to tell SQLexec not to wrap characters?

I'm using Oracle 11g. Also using the spool command to get the output of a query to a file. The problem is that sqlexec is wrapping the characters and making my life miserable. Now under normal circumstances this might be fine however the spool file is on average a 100,000 lines and more so because sqlexec keeps giving me line breaks .... which I don't want. Is there a way to tell sqlexec and/or the spool command to have no line wraps?
