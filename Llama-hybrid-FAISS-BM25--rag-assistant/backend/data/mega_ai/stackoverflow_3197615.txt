Predictable Burst Hosting

I run a Rails web app that generally has moderate traffic (100 requests/hour at most). However, I get a relatively high burst of traffic once every few weeks (50 requests/sec for 2 hours) at a time that I can anticipate. Over the next few months, I expect both the moderate and peak traffic to increase, but their relative magnitudes will likely remain proportional. Where is the best place to host something like this? I've used EC2 in the past to ramp up processing, but are there other options that might be more cost effective (I don't need a huge amount of storage)? What about Heroku, Linode, or Slicehost?
