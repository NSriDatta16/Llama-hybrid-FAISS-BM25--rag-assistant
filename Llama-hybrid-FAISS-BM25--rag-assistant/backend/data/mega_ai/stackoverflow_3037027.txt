Android: OutofMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget with no reason I can see

I am having an OutOfMemory exception with a gallery over 600x800 pixels JPEG's. The environment I've been using Gallery with JPG images around 600x800 pixels. Since my content may be a bit more complex than just images, I have set each view to be a RelativeLayout that wraps ImageView with the JPG. In order to "speed up" the user experience I have a simple cache of 4 slots that prefetches (in a looper) about 1 image left and 1 image right to the displayed image and keeps them in a 4 slot HashMap. The platform I am using AVD of 256 RAM and 128 Heap Size, with a 600x800 screen. It also happens on an Entourage Edge target, except that with the device it's harder to debug. The problem I have been getting an exception: OutofMemoryError: bitmap size exceeds VM budget And it happens when fetching the fifth image. I have tried to change the size of my image cache, and it is still the same. The strange thing: There should not be a memory problem In order to make sure the heap limit is very far away from what I need, I have defined a dummy 8MB array in the beginning, and left it unreferenced so it's immediately dispatched. It is a member of the activity thread and is defined as following static { @SuppressWarnings("unused") byte dummy[] = new byte[ 8*1024*1024 ]; } The result is that the heap size is nearly 11MB and it's all free. Note I have added that trick after it began to crash. It makes OutOfMemory less frequent. Now, I am using DDMS. Just before the crash (does not change much after the crash), DDMS shows: ID Heap Size Allocated Free %Used #Objects 1 11.195 MB 2.428 MB 8.767 MB 21.69% 47,156 And in the detail table it shows: Type Count Total Size Smallest Largest Median Average free 1,536 8.739MB 16B 7.750MB 24B 5.825KB The largest block is 7.7MB. And yet the LogCat says: ERROR/dalvikvm-heap(1923): 925200-byte external allocation too large for this process. If you mind the relation of the median and the average, it is plausible to assume that most of the available blocks are very small. However, there is a block large enough for the bitmap, it's 7.7M. How come it is still not enough? Note: I recorded a heap trace. When looking at the amount of data allocated, it does not feel like more than 2M is allocated. It does match the free memory report by DDMS. Could it be that I experience some problem like heap-fragmentation? How do I solve/workaround the problem? Is the heap shared to all threads? Could it be that I interpret the DDMS readout in a wrong way, and there is really no 900K block to allocate? If so, can anybody please tell me where I can see that? Thanks a lot Meymann
