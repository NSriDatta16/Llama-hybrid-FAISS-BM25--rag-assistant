From the trees attributed to each class's output you can do a tree search on the similarities. You could do it manually, but that would be as tedious as examining the weights on a Neural network. So you want to find the overlaps in the decision tree structures. This can look for various features depending upon the problem. Eg. you can see if there is statistically more preference for certain nodes to be parents of other nodes giving a hierarchical structure. You just search all nodes and find if there is more than average having certain children. Do a distribution test to show its beyond a random chance to have consistently those children and that reveals structure of the problem you analyzed. Best.
