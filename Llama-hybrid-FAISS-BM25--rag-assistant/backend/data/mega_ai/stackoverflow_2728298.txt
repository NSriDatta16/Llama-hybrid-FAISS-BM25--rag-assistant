I have tried to use EquinoxAspectsLoadTimeWeaver into JPa context (with EclipseLink) but it doen't transform the model classes if your EquinoxAspectsLoadTimeWeaver bean declaration is not done into the same bundle than Model bundle. EquinoxAspectsLoadTimeWeaver transform class ONLY for the classes stored into the bundle wich declare EquinoxAspectsLoadTimeWeaver. I have tried the sample http://code.google.com/p/springdm-in-action/ (see Chapter 7) (thank for this sample Lukasz). The declaration of EquinoxAspectsLoadTimeWeaver avoid having the error Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot apply class transformer without LoadTimeWeaver specified But Model classes are not transformed (woven). Weaving into EclipseLink manage for instance lazy mode. For instance if you set into the sample model Contact lazy mode like this : public class Contact { ... @Column(name="last_name") @Basic(fetch=FetchType.LAZY) private String lastName; you will notice that lazy loading is not applied because Model Contact class is not wowen.
