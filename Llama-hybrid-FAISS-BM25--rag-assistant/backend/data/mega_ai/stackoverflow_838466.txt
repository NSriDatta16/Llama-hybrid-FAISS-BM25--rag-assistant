You definately have to rethink tis yes... Why in the name of all that is holy are you abusing group_concat to implode something into HTML from SQL? What happens if there is a " character in the field you're concatting? Good rule of thumb is: Use your database for storage Use your PHP for fetching the data and transforming it to HTML or PDF, or whatever kind of output you want. Also, you might want to read up on using JOINS ? You're now running 2 queries where one with some joins and a well-built where clause will suffice.
