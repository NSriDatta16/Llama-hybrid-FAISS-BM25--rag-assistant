Qt->QGraphicsView->QGraphicsItem resizing

I'm pretty new to QGraphicsView in Qt. As far as I can tell there is no built in way to resize a QGraphicsItem in a scene with a mouse. What I'm looking for is to be able to resize a QGraphicsRectItem by either dragging out the corners or the edges on screen. Is there a simple way to do that? Is there a library or a piece of code somewhere online that implements this functionality? I'm currently using Qt 4.5.1.
