If you are forced to record in 16-bit PCM, then you would have to look at the value of every other byte because each sample will span two bytes. The trick will be to know which byte to look at - I believe it should be the odd-indexed bytes returned in the byte array. Or if you want higher fidelity you could look at both bytes and you would know the output volume within the range 2^15 rather than just 2^7. Since the byte type is signed in Java, you could simply look at every buffer[index * 2 + 1] byte and save the largest one. This would give you the max volume detected over the given sample. As stated in my other answer, you could also take the average of these values, depending on what you are using this number for.
