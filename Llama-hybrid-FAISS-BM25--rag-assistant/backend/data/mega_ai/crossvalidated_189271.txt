All three procedures can yield, if this is of interest, p -values telling the probability that results as far or farther from the usual null hypothesis would occur if chance alone were responsible. Beyond that, each procedure will give a different type of potentially useful information: Point -biserial correlation will yield a coefficient ranging from -1 to 1, summarizing (in somewhat abstract or scale-free terms) the degree of connection between age and smoking status. (Note that the lesser-used "biserial correlation" works somewhat differently: see explanation ). T -testing will describe the mean age difference between smokers and non-smokers in terms of the standard error of such a difference. Logistic regression will yield the difference in (the odds of being a smoker) that is associated with each unit (presumably year) difference in age. Logistic regression can also be used to generate a probability that each person is a smoker, based on age. Thus in a given research situation these procedures may well turn out to be complementary.
