I notice this same behavior when I manually create a datatable and assign it as the grid's datasource. If the data table is empty, all the column header info that was previously set on the grid is lost. My solution to this was to never actually give it an empty table, if I have no rows in my table, at least have all the columns defined. DataTable table = new DataTable("fooTable"); table.Columns.Add("fooCol1", typeof(long)); table.Columns.Add("fooCol2", typeof(string)); table.Columns.Add("fooCol3", typeof(bool)); myUltraGrid.DataSource = table; By never setting the grid to an empty table, you keep your header info.
