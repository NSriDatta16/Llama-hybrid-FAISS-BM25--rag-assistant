Where are your icons located? How do you run a jnlp application inside tomcat? Assuming you don't have a lot of images, you can package them inside one of your packages. Just create a package called com.yourproject.resources and dump some images there. Then the way to access them would be: //define it in some class public URL obtainImageResource ( String nameOfResource ) { return getClass().getResource( "/com/yourproject/resources/" + nameOfResource ); } Do get them with a URL. Then to create the stuff you need: BufferedImage yourImage = ImageIO.read( yourclaass.obtainImageResource( "yourimagepng.png" ).openStream() ); Note some things: In my setup you need to package your images into your jar.
