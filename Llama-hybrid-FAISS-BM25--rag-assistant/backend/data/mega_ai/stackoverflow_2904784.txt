Fastest way to display a full calendar

I need to display a complete calendar (12 months, 31~ days/month) on screen. Currently, I'm using a 12-column grid, with each column filled with a "months" stackpanel. Each "month" stackpanel is filled with 31 (or less) day representations. Each day representation is composed of a DockPanel embedding three controls : a textblock to display the day letter a textblock to display the day number a textblock to display a short message Of course, performances are crushed down when I try to resize the window. Is there a useful trick to allow a fast display of many textblocks ?
