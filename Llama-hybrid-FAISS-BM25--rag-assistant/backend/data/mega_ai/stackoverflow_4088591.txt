The general rule that I follow is that UI validations should be repeated on the server exactly for request forging reasons. On the other hand if someone forges a request and gives some random/invalid ID won't your code simply fail because that ID is not present in your persistent storage (DB) ? If you are worried that someone can make a request that can bypass UI validations and that can be harmful to your system or data, then yes by all means you should repeat the validations on the server even if you need to make DB queries. Generally client side validations are not mandatory. Server side validations are. Client side validations are just an optimization as they don't require a server call, but they are not actually defending you against anything.
