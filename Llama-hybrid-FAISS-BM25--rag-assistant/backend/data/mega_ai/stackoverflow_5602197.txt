Dragging resources between projects in XCode is generally a bad idea in my opinion, even if it is supported. When you drag and drop something in XCode, it doesn't actually create a new copy of that thing, it just adds a new reference to its old location. This can be very bad, because now changing the resource in one project will make the same changes appear in the other. The vast majority of the time this is not what you want. SCM further complicates things, because if you add a resource to Project B by dragging from Project A and then check in the changes and then some other developer checks out just Project B , they will be missing the resources that you "added" to Project B . So instead of dragging and dropping in XCode, I suggest using the Finder or the command line to explicitly copy your resources into the destination project's source tree. Then in XCode just add the copied files to the project the same way you normally would.
