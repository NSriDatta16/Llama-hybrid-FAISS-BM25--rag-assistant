Can I destroy a class instance even if there are still references?

For debugging reasons I want to destroy a class instance which still as references. Is that possible? It doesn't have to be elegant or stable, because this'll never end up in production code. To clarify: Public Sub Main Dim o as MyClass Set o = New MyClass //o is created, one reference DestroyObject o //Class_Terminate is called and the object destroyed //Further code, not using o End Sub //Possible runtime error here (don't care) Is that possible? One way would be to call IUnknown::Release to manually decrease the reference count, but how do I now how often I must call it?
