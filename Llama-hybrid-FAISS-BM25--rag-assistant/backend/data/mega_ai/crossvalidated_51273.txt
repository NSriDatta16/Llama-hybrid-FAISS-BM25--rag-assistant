What is the difference between a neural network and a deep belief network?

I am getting the impression that when people are referring to a 'deep belief' network that this is basically a neural network but very large. Is this correct or does a deep belief network also imply that the algorithm itself is different (ie, no feed forward neural net but perhaps something with feedback loops)?
