The two are very different: Feature Selection indeed reduces dimensions, but feature extraction adds dimensions which are computed from other features. For panel or time series data, one usually has the datetime variable, and one does not want to train the dependent variable on the date itself as those do not occur in the future. So you should eliminate the datetime: feature elimination. On the other hand, weekday/weekend day may be very relevant, so we need to compute the weekday status from the datetime: feature extraction.
