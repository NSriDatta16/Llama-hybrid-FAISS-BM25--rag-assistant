FireBreath is a C++ framework for creating web browser plugins that will run as NPAPI plugins on supporting browsers (Firefox, Chrome, Safari, Opera) and as ActiveX Controls on browsers supporting ActiveX (Internet Explorer). FireBreath relies on CMake for cross-platform project generation and uses a subset of boost. FireBreath was originally written by Richard Bateman ( taxilian ) and released under a dual license structure -- LGPL and new BSD. Version 1.0 was released March 24, 2010 but the framework has grown quite a bit since then and benefitted from a lot of user contribution. Source code can be found on GitHub and the project website -- including user-editable wiki documentation and doxygen-generated class documentation -- can be found at http://www.firebreath.org . Bug reports can be submitted through the jira ticket system . Other StackOverflow users who have contributed code to FireBreath are encouraged (by taxilian) to add their name to this wiki page!
