Mongoid (pronounced mann-goyd) is an Object-Document-Mapper (ODM) for MongoDB written in Ruby. Mongoid as of version 5 is under the control and guidance of MongoDB as the official Ruby ODM. The philosophy of Mongoid is to provide a familiar API to Ruby developers who have been using Active Record or Data Mapper, while leveraging the power of MongoDB's schema-less and performant document-based design, dynamic queries, and atomic modifier operations.
