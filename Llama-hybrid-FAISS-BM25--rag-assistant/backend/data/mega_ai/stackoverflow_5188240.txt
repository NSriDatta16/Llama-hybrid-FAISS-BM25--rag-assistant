Using Selenium to imitate dragging a file onto an upload element

I have a web page that opens a div when you click a button. This div allows you to drag a file from your desktop onto its area; the file then gets uploaded to the server. I'm working with the Ruby implementation of Selenium. By using the JavaScript debugger in Firefox, I can see that an event called "drop" is being passed to some JavaScript code "handleFileDrop(event)". I presume that if I were to create a mock event and fire it somehow that I could trigger this code. If found an interesting article that seemed to point me in a promising direction, but I'm still short of figuring it all out. I am able to pass JavaScript to the page using Selenium's get_eval method. Calling methods using this.browserbot is getting me the elements I need. So: How do I build the file object that needs to be part of the mock drop event? How do I fire the drop event such that it gets picked up as if I had dropped a file in the div?
