Thanks for the question (and reading the Bayesian Choice !). If you consider both equations $$f(x)= g(T(x))h(x)\qquad\qquad(1)$$ and $$f(x|\theta)=g(T(x)|\theta)\cdot h(x|T(x))\qquad\qquad(2)$$ they are not that dissimilar, once the dependence on the parameter $\theta$ is taken into account. Actually, (1) is not meaningful for sufficiency if the densities $f$ and $g$ are not indexed by a parameter. Sufficiency then corresponds to $h$ not being indexed by this parameter. This remark being made, (2) appears as a special case of (2), where $$h(x)=h(x|T(x))$$ The additional conditioning expresses in an informal manner that the density of $X$ is proportional to the joint density of $(X,T(X)$ , which can be written as the marginal density of $T(X)$ , $g(t|\theta)$ , times the conditional density of $X$ given $T(X)$ , $h(x|T(x))$ . This is informal as one needs to define proper dominating measures and the like.
