There are quite a few such measures between probability distributions, each with their own properties and goals. For example, you could use earth mover's distance . If these measures don't emphasize the mean and SD enough for your tastes, you can add the absolute distances between the observed and desired mean and the observed and desired SD as penalty terms when evaluating your neural network. Note that in any case, it makes sense to compare the empirical distribution of your simulated atomic distances to the theoretical normal distribution, rather than using the empirical distribution of a simulated normal distribution.
