I saw from one of your comments that you wanted a login with Remember Me. A simple solution is just to increase the expiration time of $_SESSION (or implement your own session algorithm). However, that is generally considered unfavorable. This is a great article on how you would create a secure remember me: http://jaspan.com/improved_persistent_login_cookie_best_practice The basic idea is: Cookies: Username/Email/etc Token Series The token is changed every time the user loads a page. However, the series remains the same for the entire duration of the remember me period. You would keep a table of the series and the token in a database (possibly MySQL). I'm not very good at explaining it, so I highly encourage you to read the article.
