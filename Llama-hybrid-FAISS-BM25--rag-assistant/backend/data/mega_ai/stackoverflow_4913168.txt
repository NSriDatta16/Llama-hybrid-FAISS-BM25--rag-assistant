Cannot properly rotate a translated UIView on the iPad

I have an UIViewController that has two UIViews inside, whose layout (set in Interface Builder) is something like this (the magenta colored view is the UIViewController default view): and I added the main view to a root view obtaining this effect (by not showing the darker view placing its frame at the bottom): Now when the device rotates, what I obtain is this: whereas I'd like to still hide the darker view. This is the code I use to hide it when it appears (I use it in the viewDidLoad method): - (void)hideAll:(float)time{ CGRect hiddenFrame = CGRectMake(0, 1024, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height); [self.view setFrame:hiddenFrame]; [self.view setNeedsDisplay]; } and it appears to work, but when I call a variant of it when rotating (in willRotateToInterfaceOrientation:duration: ), nothing happens: CGRect hiddenFrame = CGRectMake(0, 748, self.view.frame.size.width, self.view.frame.size.height); [self.view setFrame:hiddenFrame]; [self.view setNeedsDisplay]; What am I missing? have I to set some other view property in Interface Builder? UPDATE It seems to me that the coordinate system does not change after the device has been rotated (ie the origin set in the upper-left corner in portrait mode will become the upper-right after a clockwise rotation in landscape mode)
