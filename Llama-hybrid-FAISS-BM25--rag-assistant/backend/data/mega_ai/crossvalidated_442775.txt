As you presented you are first applying filter1 ( equal weights ) ( 90 day average ) and then you are applying filter2 to analyze/convert/smooth those results. This is akin to creating a cumulative series from a random series and then finding that the best filter to forecast this new series is to difference it. Two rongs don't make a rite ( so to speak !) . The results will be unpredictable and probably useless. You injected "silly" and are using "silly" to extract a resultant/composite of silliness ...where silly in my opinion is ANY assumed filter . By computing an average , albeit a 60 period average , one unknowingly injects autocorrelation into the derived series only to possibly pull it out (detect it) in the second phase. This injection is the basis of Slutsky's theorem .
