A similar but more advanced approach would be BERTScore . It also computes pairwise cosine similarity between (BERT) embeddings but uses greedy matching by only accounting for similarity between the closest tokens: (based on Figure 1 from the BERTScore paper) However, it should be noted that BERTScore is designed to be used for paragraphs and not documents. Another more traditional approach would be doc2vec .
