Can't create grails Criteria query containing a belongsTo relation

I've been trying to create a criteria builder containing a belongsTo relation and have yet to succeed. Consider the following model: class Msg { ... static belongsTo = [user: User] ... } class User { ... Organisation organisation ... } I'm trying to make the following query: Msg.createCriteria().list() { ... user { eq("organisation", organisationInstance) } ... } All I'm getting is the following error ERROR errors.GrailsExceptionResolver - No signature of method: static User.call() is applicable for argument types: (MsgService$_findMessages_closure1_closure6) values: [MsgService$_findMessages_closure1_closure6@afcba8] Possible solutions: save(), wait(), any(), getAll(), save(java.lang.Boolean), save(java.util.Map) I've tried to add different small additions to the criteria query like: join "user" fetchMode("user", org.hibernate.FetchMode.EAGER) But still get the same problem. I even tried to add the following static mapping to the Msg class: static mapping = { columns { user lazy: false } } Still not working. Is there a way to use criteria builder containing a belongsTo query at all? Thanks for your help in advance. Lucien
