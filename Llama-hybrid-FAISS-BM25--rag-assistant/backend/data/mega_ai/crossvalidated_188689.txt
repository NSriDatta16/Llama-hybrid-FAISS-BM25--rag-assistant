You seem to have misunderstood what CV does. CV is an evaluation technique to assess the performance of a given classifier, when the sample size is not large enough to set aside a test set. CV helps avoid overfitting only indirectly by letting you assess the performance of certain parameter configurations of a given classier (such as SVM in your case), and let you choose one with the highest metric of your choice (e.g. accuracy, precision etc). Inner CV is typically employed for that purpose. Given the situation you presented, i would say the performance of your classification system (combination of features, feature selection and classifier) is only 40%, which is what represents the true generalization performance. The 80% precision you noticed is only average metric from across the various folds, if caret behaves similar to typical toolboxes. Perhaps, if you provide the exact code, we can offer more specific hints.
