Are the terms in the diffusion model equation random variables or probability density functions?

Are all terms in the first line(71) of the equation random variables or probability density functions? If they are probability density functions, is there a possibility of obtaining a value that is not equal to 1 when integrating the right-hand side of the equation after all calculations have been completed? Based on the answer given in line 72, it seems that all terms are considered as probability density functions. If so, is it possible to transform them into the probability density function of a Gaussian distribution? in q(x_{t-1}|x_t,x_0), x_t, x_0, x_{t-1} are EVENTS? or Distribution? I feel like I'm lacking some basic concepts in statistics. Can you help me, please?
