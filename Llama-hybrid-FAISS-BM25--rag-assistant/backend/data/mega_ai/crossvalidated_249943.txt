Newbie in Machine Learning, need a strategy

I am new to machine learning. However, I've some experience with python. My question would be kind of "what should I do", sorry for that. Basically, I have a project, and I want to use machine learning there. I can represent the idea like this: The blue box (Design) has up to 15 parameters which can be changed, and each parameter has up to 100 possible solutions (test cases), in total more than billion possible solutions for the design. A Machine Learning (ML) algorithm proposed a parameter set for the design box, a checker (green box) checks if it meets the specifications. Questions: What do you recommend to understand/read/watch before to proceed to the problem? What would you do if you have the same task as I? Which Libraries (Tensorflow, etc.) would you use? (your strategy) Do you know any existed solutions? Feedback, ideas, tips, hints are always welcome!
