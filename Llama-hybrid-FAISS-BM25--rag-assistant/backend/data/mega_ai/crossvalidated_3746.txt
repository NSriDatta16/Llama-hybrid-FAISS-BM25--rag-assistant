Finding the average GPS point

I need to write a program to find the average GPS point from a population of points. In practice the following happens: Each month a person records a GPS point of the same static asset. Because of the nature of GPS, these points differ slightly each month. Sometimes the person makes a mistake and records the wrong assest at a completely different location. Each GPS point has a certainty weight ( HDOP ) that indicates how accurate the current GPS data is. GPS points with better HDOP values are preferred over lower ones. How do I determine the following: Deal with data with 2 values vs. a single value like age. (Find the average age in a population of people) Determine the outliers. In the example below these would be [-28.252, 25.018] and [-28.632, 25.219] After excluding the outliers, find the average GPS point in this it might be [-28.389, 25.245]. It would be a bonus if can work the "weight" provided by HDOP value for each point.
