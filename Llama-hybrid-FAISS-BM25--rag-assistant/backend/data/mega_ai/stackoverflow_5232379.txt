How to save login credentials using Javascript?

I want to add integration with a third-party service to a web application (developed in HTML and Javascript) which targets Android / iOS (and later Windows Phone). Thus I have access to all "modern" features. This third-party service needs credentials and is controlled via GET-Parameters. For example, a request url could look like "http://www.example.org/foo?username=user&password=1234". Changing the third-party service to accept hashed passwords is no option as I have no access to it. As the user does not want to type in his username and password every time he uses the service or starts the application, I want to save his credentials somehow. Now I wonder, what's the best way to do so. I know that real "security" is an illusion here but I do not want to expose the credentials to unnecessary risks by saving them the wrong way. I already thought about several possible ways Plain Cookies: The most straightforward way - is it "secure" enough in this scenario? DOM-Storage: Any differences to cookies in this relationship? Encrypted Cookies: The credentials would be encrypted, but you could easily find out the key when looking at the source code of the page or debugging it. Which one should I choose? Are there any better ways? Is bothering with encrpytion actually worth it when it can be cracked that easily?
