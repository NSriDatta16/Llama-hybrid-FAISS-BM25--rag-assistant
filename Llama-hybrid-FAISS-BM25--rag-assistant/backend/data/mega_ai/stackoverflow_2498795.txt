You could use memcpy: #include int main() { float f = 1.0; int n; memcpy( &n, &f, sizeof(f) ); } I don't think there is an elegant solution to this, but whatever you do, I'd wrap it in a function to make it obvious what I was up to: int FloatToInt( float f ) { int n; assert( sizeof(n) == sizeof(f) ); memcpy( &n, &f, sizeof(f) ); return n; }
