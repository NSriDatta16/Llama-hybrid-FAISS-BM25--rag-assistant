If the only possible results are win/lose, then you are in front of a binary classification problem (so SVM, trees, logistic regression and all of the others can apply). I don't know about scikit-learn in particular, but most machine learning packages will create the dummy variables for you (you only have to provide them with a column containing the labels, and the software will do the job) The idea behind these dummy variables is to separate a categorical variable with $n$ groups into $n$ different binary variables (if the individual in question belongs to the $k$ th category, then the $k$ th dummy variable will be $1$ and the rest will take the value $0$ ) In practice, what is most commonly done is take a "reference group" (normally, the majority group) and $(n-1)$ dummy variables. If all dummy variables are $0$ , the individual belongs to the reference group. Otherwise, it belongs to the corresponding alternative category
