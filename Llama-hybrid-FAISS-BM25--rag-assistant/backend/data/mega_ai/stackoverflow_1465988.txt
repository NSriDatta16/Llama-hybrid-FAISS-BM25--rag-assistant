Capture DragDrop Event of RichTextBox C#

I have a custom RichTextBox Control derived from RichTextBox Control that Windows provides. I am unable to capture the dragDrop Event though the DragEnter event is getting captured, but I dont know why the dragDrop event is not. I have following properties set as true: EnableAutoDragDrop=true; AllowDrop=true; What am I missing ??
