Very good question! I took the liberty to dig into Python's source code, which is a mere command away on properly set up linux distributions ( apt-get source python2.5 ) Damn , John Millikin beat me to it. That's right, PyUnicode_EncodeDecimal is the answer it does this here: /* (Loop ch in the unicode string) */ if (Py_UNICODE_ISSPACE(ch)) { *output++ = ' '; ++p; continue; } decimal = Py_UNICODE_TODECIMAL(ch); if (decimal >= 0) { *output++ = '0' + decimal; ++p; continue; } if (0 See, it leaves all unicode code points Addendum With this in place, you can verify by trying other non-latin-1 characters, it will throw a different exception: >>> float(u"Ä§") Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in UnicodeEncodeError: 'decimal' codec can't encode character u'\u0127' in position 0: invalid decimal Unicode string
