Stability Selection - calculating the average number of selected variables

I have been reading the Meinshausen paper on Stability Selection that can be found here: https://stat.ethz.ch/~nicolai/stability.pdf From what I understand, the method is to carry out monte carlo simulations and for each data subset generated by the fold, fit a lasso model with different alphas (penalisation parameters). I am unsure about what the q term referenced in equation (9) and referred to as the average number of selected variables should be calculated. I believe it should be calculated by finding the mean of the coefficients across all the alphas within a fold and then calculating the mean of this value across all folds. Is this understanding correct?
