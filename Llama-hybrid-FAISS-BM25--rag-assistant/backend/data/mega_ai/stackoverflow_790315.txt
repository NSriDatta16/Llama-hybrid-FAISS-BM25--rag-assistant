Simple SSRS Report

After some reading and posting, I am fairly sure that I want to use SSDS to analyze some data I have. However, I could use some pointers to help me get going. I have a simple SQL Server table: * PKID (Int) * ApplicationName (VarChar) * MethodName (VarChar) * TimeInMs (Integer) * DateTime (DateTime) This table records the length of time it took for various methods to run in various applications. This table could potentially have tens of thousands of rows. I would like to set up the following report: Average length of time for a method to run (Total and per App) for the following periods of time: 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,20,30,40,50,60,120,240,360 Thanks in advance for any pointers.
