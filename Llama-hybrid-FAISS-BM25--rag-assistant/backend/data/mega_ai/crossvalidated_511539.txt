In short, because the average of $f$ is not generally $f$ applied to the average. Here, the macro averaged f1 score is the average of the f1 scores for the two classes, but the f1 score is a nonlinear function (the harmonic average) of precision and recall. Consider: p_1 = precision_score(y_true, y_pred) p_0 = precision_score(y_true, y_pred, pos_label=0) r_1 = recall_score(y_true, y_pred) r_0 = recall_score(y_true, y_pred, pos_label=0) f1_1 = 2*p_1*r_1/(p_1+r_1) f1_0 = 2*p_0*r_0/(p_0+r_0) print( f1_1 == f1_score(y_true, y_pred), f1_0 == f1_score(y_true, y_pred, pos_label=0), f1 == (f1+f0)/2 # the macro-average of the classes' f1 scores ) # all True
