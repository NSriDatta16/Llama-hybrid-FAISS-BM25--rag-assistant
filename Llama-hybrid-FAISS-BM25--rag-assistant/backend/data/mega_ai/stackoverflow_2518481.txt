There are a number of important differences between the simulators and the real devices, some of them are: Enforcement of code signing restrictions on some APIs (can be enabled on the simulator, but off by default) Nuances of opening network connections (its more complicated if you want it to always work on a real device) Performance of storage I/O (i.e. loading/saving data from an SD card) Performance of floating-point math (real device has no FPU, so its slower) General performance (simulator tends to be faster, for the most part) So for 99.9% of your development, the simulator is fine. But you should still test on a real device. Also, please make scalable UIs that dynamically size themselves based on the screen size. Every time I see a device-size-specific UI, it makes me want to strange the developer. (because they either have a zillion builds of their app, it bloat it all the way out with tons of fixed-size graphics)
