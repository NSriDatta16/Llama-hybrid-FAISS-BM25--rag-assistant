WPF Style does not affect certain properties

I've got a Style specified for Paragraph as part of my FlowDocumentReader 's Resources section: I've got a .xaml file which contains my FlowDocument and it has some Paragraph s which are defined as so: Stuff here The problem that I have is that Foreground doesn't apply to the text (it shows as Black rather than LightSteelBlue) and the FontSize does not change when the MyFontSize property is modified. I've checked the property value in the code behind and it is set but it doesn't result in a change in the UI. This seems to only be an issue with the FlowDocument if it is loaded into the FlowDocumentReader at runtime. If the XAML is explicitly placed inside the FlowDocumentReader in the .xaml file, the Foreground is the correct color and the FontSize changes based on the property setting. Ideas? Solved: As I wrote in my answer below, by moving the Style block into the Resources section of the FlowDocument itself resolves the issue.
