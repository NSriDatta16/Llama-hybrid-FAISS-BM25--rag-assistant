How are the local polynomials in LOESS regression joined to make a smooth curve?

I am trying to understand LOESS regression. I've read the Wikipedia and Wolfram articles on it, and the R help for the loess() function. I think I understand now how the local polynomials are derived, each by a weighted regression over a subset of the data points that are all sufficiently close to the point being estimated. What I have been unable to find any explanation of is how a single smooth (here presumably meaning once or twice differentiable) curve across the whole explanatory variable domain is obtained from that collection of polynomials. I have entertained various possibilities, such as: the domain is chopped into a number of separated intervals, each containing a single data point, with the relevant local polynomial applying in each such interval and an interpolation method being used to bridge the space between one such interval and the next; or each of the polynomials is applied across the entire domain and the final curve is an average of these; or the local polynomials will naturally merge smoothly into one another in sequence, as a consequence of some property of the estimation procedure that was not highlighted in the above reading I would be grateful if somebody could explain, or point me to a source that contains an explanation, how a single smooth curve is obtained from the set of multiple local polynomials. Thank you Andrew EDIT: I investigated the suggestion that the curve is piecewise-linear through the fitted points, using the R code below. The differences between the piecewise-linear curve and the loess curve points are of the order of 10^-4 times the fitted values, which is small, but not small enough to be explained as rounding error. I attach a plot of the differences. There's something interesting going on here about how the local polynomials are joined, but I can't find any explanation of what it is. delta
