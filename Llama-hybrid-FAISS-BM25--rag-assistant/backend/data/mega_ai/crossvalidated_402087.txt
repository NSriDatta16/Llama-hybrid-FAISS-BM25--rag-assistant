Converting OR to probabilities

I'm trying to understand some of my data in a logistic regression. I plotted headache (yes/no) vs. age and get an OR of 0.95. Now I realize this means that for every year 'younger', you have a 0.95 less odds of having headache. But I want to convert this into something people (and I) understand. How do I convert this to probabilities? Would I need to create age groups and then somehow convert the OR to RR?
