The "Multiple Error Terms" notation for hierarchical models

I'm seeking clarification regarding notation for Bayesian hierarchical models, specifically the mixed effects model. Consider the following hierarchical model for the outcome of unit $i \in N$ in group $j \in J$ from Gelman and Hill (p.265): $$y_i \sim Normal(X_i\beta + \eta_{j[i]}, \sigma_y^2) \\ \eta_j \sim Normal(0, \sigma_\alpha^2)$$ $X_{(0)}$ is a constant. $X_{(1)}$ is a unit/level-1 predictor. $X_{(2)}$ is a group/level-2 predictor. The authors call this the "regression with multiple error terms" notation but I find this confusing for several reasons. In this model isn't there only one error term ( $\sigma_y^2$ ) that captures the total unexplained error in $y$ ? What then is the other error term in the name "multiple error terms?" If each group is supposed to have its own error, why is $\eta_j$ part of the model for the mean of $y_i$ rather than the error of $y_i$ ? I read this to imply a heteroskedastic model in which the error is decomposed into group-level terms and individual terms like $\sigma_y^2 = \sigma_\eta^2 + \sigma_i^2$ . What, if anything, is multivariate here? Would it be more appropriate to write $\eta_j \sim MVN(0, \Sigma)$ ? If so, would $\Sigma$ have a single parameter $\sigma_\alpha^2$ on the diagonal and zeroes elsewhere or does each element of the diagonal vary (i.e. is its own parameter)?
