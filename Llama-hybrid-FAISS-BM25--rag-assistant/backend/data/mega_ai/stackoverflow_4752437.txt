I would edit your artifact and build paths as follows: Artifact paths: MyProject/bin/Release/*.* => PublishDir Build file path: Successor\Successor.sln Sometimes paths references with '\' or '/' leading into it can cause issues with TeamCity. Updating your artifact path could solve the problem. Obviously, editing the build file path will not fix your problem, but it would be a good idea to go ahead and change this in case you ever edit the configuration. If this change does not help, what do the log files say about the your build results? Did your build results successfully make it into the Project/bin/Releases folder on the build agent? Is there any reference to the artifacts being published or failing to be published in the logs?
