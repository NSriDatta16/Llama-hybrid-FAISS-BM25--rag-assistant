What causes the tendency for two non-stationary time series to be highly correlated to each other?

When two variables are non-stationary, there is a very high probability that they are strongly correlated to each other. For example, $x_t$ and $y_t$ were generated independently and randomly using different seed values. $$x_t = x_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$$ $$y_t = y_{t-1} + u_t$$ set.seed(123) x I can repeat this 10,000 times with different seed values, means, and standard deviations. The correlations are extremely high almost all the time. What is driving this spurious correlation? spuriousRegression
