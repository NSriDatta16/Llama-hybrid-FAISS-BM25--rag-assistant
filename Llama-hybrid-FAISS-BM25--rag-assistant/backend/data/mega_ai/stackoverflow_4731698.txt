This my new MyJtable That is wrong. The table should NOT have an addWidget() method. All updates to the data should be done directly through the TableModel. Then the TableModel will notify the table to repaint itself when the data changes. You should never access the data storage used by the TableModel outside of the TableModel itself. I gave you a complete solution when you asked your other question yesterday.
