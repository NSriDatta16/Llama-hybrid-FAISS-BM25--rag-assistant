SELECT * FROM TABLE WHERE ID = 2 AND NUM > 15 AND NUM where TABLE is the name of your table. In general, given that you're selecting on columns ID and NUM they should probably be indexed for faster retrieval (ie the database doesn;t have to check every row). Although given your table is small it probably wont make much difference here.
