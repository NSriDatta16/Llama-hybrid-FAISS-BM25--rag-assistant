IXmlSerializable already exists in the .NET framework. I would advise you to implement that before going off on your own and re-inventing the wheel. See msdn 1 . As to the reason your code won't compile: The method fromXml needs to return IXmlSerializable. public IXmlSerializable fromXML(XmlDocumentFragment inXml) { throw new Exception("The method or operation is not implemented."); } If you want to return something else, consider using a generic interface. IE. public interface IXmlSerializable { //if this interface is implemented, the object can be serialized to XML string toXML(); T fromXML(XmlDocumentFragment inXml); } public class AwwaTransmissionInfo : IXmlSerializable { public DateTime DateTime = DateTime.Now; public int ItemCount; public string toXML() { throw new Exception("The method or operation is not implemented."); } public AwwaTransmissionInfo fromXML(XmlDocumentFragment inXml) { throw new Exception("The method or operation is not implemented."); } }
