Ask yourself: What data access features do I need, and choose your layer based on that. MS Access is file-based data storage, so if you have more than one user using your app then Access is a bad choice. I would steer clear of MSA and focus on newer technologies. MSSQL is much better, as it is scalable, supports multiple concurrent users, and has additional management tools like backup and reporting services. SQL 2005 Compact Edition allows you to attach the database at run time, great for single instance desktop apps. A third DAC you might want to look at is SQLite also for file-based solutions or desktop applications.
