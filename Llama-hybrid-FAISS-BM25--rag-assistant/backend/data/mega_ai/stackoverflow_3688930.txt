Found it. The "PresentationHost.exe -embedding" will work, provided that you select the .pdb file to be published, which it is not by default. This follows from what I saw before, where the debugger appeared to have symbols then not, once the app actually loaded. To clarify: Go into the Publish tab on the project properties Click "Application Files..." Check "Show all files" Select the .pdb file for the executable to be included. Republish PresentationHost.exe -embedding Attach to process or set the project to run this out of the debug tab Launch the web page in a browser and navigate to the xbap file, breakpoints should be hit now.
