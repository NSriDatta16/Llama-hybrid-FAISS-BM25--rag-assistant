How to split a string into an array

I have a string of attribute names and definitions. I am trying to split the string on the attribute name, into a Dictionary of string string. Where the key is the attribute name and the definition is the value. I won't know the attribute names ahead of time, so I have been trying to somehow split on the ":" character, but am having trouble with that because the attribute name is is not included in the split. For example, I need to split this string on "Organization:", "OranizationType:", and "Nationality:" into a Dictionary. Any ideas on the best way to do this with C#.Net? Organization: Name of a governmental, military or other organization. OrganizationType: Organization classification to one of the following types: sports, governmental military, governmental civilian or political party. (required) Nationality: Organization nationality if mentioned in the document. (required) Here is some sample code to help: private static void Main() { const string str = "Organization: Name of a governmental, military or other organization. OrganizationType: Organization classification to one of the following types sports, governmental military, governmental civilian or political party. (required) Nationality: Organization nationality if mentioned in the document. (required)"; var array = str.Split(':'); var dictionary = array.ToDictionary(x => x[0], x => x[1]); foreach (var item in dictionary) { Console.WriteLine("{0}: {1}", item.Key, item.Value); } // Expecting to see the following output: // Organization: Name of a governmental, military or other organization. // OrganizationType: Organization classification to one of the following types sports, governmental military, governmental civilian or political party. // Nationality: Organization nationality if mentioned in the document. (required) } Here is a visual explanation of what I am trying to do: http://farm5.static.flickr.com/4081/4829708565_ac75b119a0_b.jpg
