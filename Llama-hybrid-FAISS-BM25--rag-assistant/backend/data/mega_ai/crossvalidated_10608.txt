Questions about variable selection for classification, and different classification techniques

I have a question concerning feature selection and classification. I will be working with R. I should start by saying that I am not very familiar with data mining techniques, aside from a brief glimpse provided by an undergraduate course on multivariate analysis, so forgive me if I am lacking in details regarding my question. I will try my best to describe my problem. First, a little about my project: I am working on an image cytometry project, and the dataset is composed of over 100 quantitative features of histological images of cellular nuclei. All of the variables are continuous variables describing features of the nucleus, such as size, DNA amount, etc. There is currently a manual process and an automatic process for obtaining these cellular images. The manual process is (very) slow, but is done by a technician and yields only images that are usable for further analysis. The automatic process is very fast, but introduces too many unusable images - only about 5% of the images are suitable for further analysis, and there are thousands of nuclear images per sample. As it turns out, cleaning the data obtained from the automatic process is actually more time consuming than the manual process. My goal is to train a classification method, using R, to discriminate between good objects and bad objects from the data obtained from the automatic process. I have an already classified training set that was obtained from the automatic process. It consists of 150,000 rows, of which ~5% are good objects and ~95% are bad objects. My first question deals with feature selection. There are over 100 continuous explanatory features, and I would like possibly get rid of noise variables to (hopefully) help with the classification. What methods are there for dimensionality reduction with the goal of improving classification? I understand that the need for variable reduction may vary depending on the classification technique used. Which leads to my second question. I have been reading about different classification techniques, but I feel that I cannot adequately determine the most suitable method for my problem. My main concerns are having a low misclassification rate of good objects over bad objects, and the fact that the prior probability of the good objects is much lower than the prior probability of the bad objects. Having a bad object classified as good is less of a hassle than recovering a good object from the pool of bad objects, but it would be nice if not too many bad objects were classified as being good. I have read this post and I am currently considering Random Forests as per chl's answer. I would like to explore other methods as well, and I would like to collect the suggestions of the good people here at CV. I also welcome any readings on the subject of classification that may be helpful, and suggestions for R packages to use. Please ask for more details if my post is lacking in details.
