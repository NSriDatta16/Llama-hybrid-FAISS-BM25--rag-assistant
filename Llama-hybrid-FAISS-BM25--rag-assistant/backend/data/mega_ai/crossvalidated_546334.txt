While use of skewness and kurtosis as measures of shape can be dubious, there are precise visual and mathematical interpretations for both that provide correct insights and information. These regard tail behavior , rather than shape. Skewness: Let $Z = (X - \mu)/\sigma$ . Let $Z_3 = Z^3$ . Consider the pdf of $Z_3$ , call it $p_3(.)$ . The skewness of $X$ is the mean of the distribution of $Z_3$ , hence it is the "point of balance" of $p_3$ . Now, place a fulcrum at $0.0$ under the graph of $p_3$ . If the skewness of $X$ is $>0$ , then the graph "falls to the right" of the fulcrum. Thus, the right tail of $X$ is more extreme, in terms of mass and/or extremity, than the left tail, where extremity refers to amplification by the third power. A similar definition holds for skewness $ . If skewness is $=0$ it does not imply symmetry, but instead equal leverage of the tails, again as amplified through the third power. Kurtosis: Let $Z_4 = Z^4$ . Consider the pdf of $Z_4$ , call it $p_4(.)$ . The kurtosis of $X$ is the mean of the distribution of $Z_4$ , hence it is the "point of balance" of $p_4$ . If $X$ has a normal distribution, then this point of balance is exactly 3.0. So place a fulcrum at 3.0 under the graph of $p_4$ . If the kurtosis is $>3$ , then the graph falls to the right, indicating that $X$ has greater tail leverage than the normal distribution. Here, "tail" refers to extremity of the $X$ values as amplified through the fourth power. Note that kurtosis $>3$ tells you nothing about the shape of the peak, or even about the probability within a standard deviation of the mean: The graph falls the the right, not to the left. If the kurtosis is $ , then the graph "falls to the left," and distribution of $X$ has less tail leverage than the normal distribution. This of course tells you nothing about the shape of the "peak." (It is certainly not "flat" - the Beta(.5,1) distribution provides a simple counterexample). If kurtosis $=3$ , then the tail leverage of $X$ (as amplified by the fourth power) is the same as that of the normal distribution, but it certainly does not imply that the distribution is normal, or even bell-shaped.
