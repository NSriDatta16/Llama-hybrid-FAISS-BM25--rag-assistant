You say you want the data stored server side and its should be automatically available? You could trick the viewstate into storing its data in session rather than a hidden field by using this technique: http://aspadvice.com/blogs/robertb/archive/2005/11/16/13835.aspx You might find this article interesting as well which shows another technique to store your viewstate server side: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188774.aspx#S6 Despite the initial complexity of getting this set up I think it would be the best solution because then you don't have to change your code throughout, it can still use ViewState as normal without realising this is now saved on the server.
