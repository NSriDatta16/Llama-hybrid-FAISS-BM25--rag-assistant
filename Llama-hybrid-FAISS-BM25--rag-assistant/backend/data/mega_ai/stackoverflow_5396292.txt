You should use Core Data for your app because Core Data is not a database system but rather an object graph management system for creating the model layer of a Model-View-Controller design app (and the Apple API pretty much requires that design pattern.) The model layer is the actual guts of the program. It is where the actual logic central to the utility of the app gets done. Everything else is just an interface to the user, servers or other apps. For example, in your app, your model layer will model of simulate some kind of real-world objects, events or conditions related to a gym workout e.g. workout times, schedules, reps, exercise series etc. All the logical relationships in between these real-world things will be encoded in the data model and no where else. Core Data makes that simple to implement. Once the data model is configured, then all you have to do to finish the app is to slap on one or more interfaces. In your case, it sounds like you want an UI on the device, a JSON interface to a server somewhere and possibly an http server within the app itself running over Wifi. If your data model is already completely configured, implementing each interface becomes trivial and, most importantly, changes made in one interface are instantly reflected in all the others. So, it's good to learn Core Data. In fact it is good to master it. It will let you simply churn out the apps once you become skilled. However, having said all that, don't let the pursuit of an elegant/perfect design get in the way of shipping. Your code can be inelegant and butt ugly and still succeed if you users never suffer for it. Beautiful code that just sits on the developer's drive benefits no one. Make it work with what you know now and get it out the door. You can always refractor later. Core Data does have a learning curve precisely because it is so powerful. If you plan on doing a lot of apps you should take the time to learn it but, again, don't let the learning curve get in the way of shipping.
