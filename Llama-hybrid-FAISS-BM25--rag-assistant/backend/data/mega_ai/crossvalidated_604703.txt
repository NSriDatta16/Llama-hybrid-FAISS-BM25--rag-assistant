A common approach is to consider all pairs of points and count for each pair whether the two points are assigned to the same cluster or to different clusters. This yields four numbers: a = #SS = number of pairs in the same cluster in both clustering b = #SD = number of pairs which are in one clustering in the same and in the other in different clusters c = #DS = in analogy to b d = #DD = number of pairs which are in different clusters in both clusterings From these numbers, different indices can be computed, e.g. the Rand-Index: $$R = \frac{a+d}{a+b+c+d}$$ As the number $d$ is typically quite large, the Rand-Index tends to be close to one, even when the clusterings are considerably different. A more reasonable index is thus the Jaccard-Index: $$J = \frac{a}{a+b+c}$$ There are other ways to define clustering similarity indices, e.g. by means of precision and recall.
