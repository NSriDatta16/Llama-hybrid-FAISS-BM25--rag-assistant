How difficult is it to train a gaussian mixture model compared to other models?

I have finally been able to wrap my head around the mechanics of how to initialize and train a multivariate Gaussian mixture model using expectation maximization algorithm. So I wonder how difficult this GMM and EM task is in comparison to all other common algorithms and models in machine learning. I appreciate any feedback. Thank you.
