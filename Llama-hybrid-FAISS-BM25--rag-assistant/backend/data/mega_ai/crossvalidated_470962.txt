What are good resources for online time series forecasting?

I have a project in which I'm given the state of the order book for a stock every 1ms, and I need to predict the return on the stock 2 minutes in the future using this information. I haven't been able to find good resources on this type of problem: time series forecasting in an online setting. Does anyone have any book recommendations on this? Preferably, the book would be focused on financial time series.
