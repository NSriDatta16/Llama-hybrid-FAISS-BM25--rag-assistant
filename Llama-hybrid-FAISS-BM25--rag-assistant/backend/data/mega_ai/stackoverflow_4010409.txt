This is not a true answer, but maybe a fertilizer .... I share your concerns, as I often run into the same kind of troubles. Excel (2003) does not support charts with a true date axis (where the distance from 01-Feb to 01-Mar is 28 units and 01-Mar to 01-Apr is 31 units). The best approximation I found (for charts spanning more than 2-3 months) is to use an X/Y chart manually set the Minimum and Maximum of the Value (X) scale to the integer representing the first of a month (e.g. 01-Feb-2010 represented by integer 40210) set major unit to 30,42 (average length of a month - Excel can't do variable major ticks) set minor unit to 7 (so I get weeks clear at least) use a custom number format (e.g. "MMM-YYYY") on the X axis Sometimes I tweak the above by temporarily displaying the date as "DD-MM-YYYY" and look how many first-days-of-a-month I hit with my scale, and adjust the Minimum to get an optimum. The longer the date range the less accurate it gets. Hope that helps at least a little ....
