If you want to do feature extraction you should look more into computer vision libraries. Image processing is more in the of the kind of algorithms Photoshop does, i.e. to enhance/improve/transform images, not the retrieval of information out of them. The terms are sometimes uses synonymously though. You might want to check out OpenCV , they provide some feature extractors and it's an easy to use library for C++.
