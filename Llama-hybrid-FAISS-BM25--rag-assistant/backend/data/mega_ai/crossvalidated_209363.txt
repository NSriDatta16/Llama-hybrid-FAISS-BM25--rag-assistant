How to do calculate both causal and diagnostic inferences simultaneosly in bayesian networks?

Consider a simple Bayesian network as given below. Question: How to find $P(S|C,W)$ ? It is fairly straight forward to compute the causal inference $ P(W|S) = P(W|S,R)\cdot P(R) + P(W|S,\bar{R})\cdot P(\bar{R})$ where $ P(R) = P(R|C)\cdot P(C) + P(R|\bar{C})\cdot P(\bar{C})\quad\&\quad P(\bar{R}) = 1-P(R)$ For diagnostic inferences , we make use of the Bayes' theorem as follows $\displaystyle P(S|W) = \frac{P(W|S)\cdot P(S)}{P(W)}$ where $P(W) = P(W|S,R)~P(S)~P(R) + P(W|S,\bar{R})~P(S)~P(\bar{R})$ $\quad\qquad +~P(W|\bar{S},R)~P(\bar{S})~P(R) + P(W|\bar{S},\bar{R})~P(\bar{S})~P(\bar{R})$ where $P(S)$ is calculated in a similar way to $P(R)$ How to expand the relation for $P(S|C,W)$ ? This involves both causal and diagnostic inferences. So how could this be done?
