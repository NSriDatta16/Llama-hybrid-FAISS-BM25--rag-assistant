If the policy dummies were exogenous you could use a VAR-X model and do dynamic multiplier analysis (see Lutkepohl 2005 Chp. 10). But since you are sure that the dummy variable is endogenous you might take a look at the Qual-VAR model due to Dueker JBES 2005, which essentially includes a dynamic probit equation in a standard VAR model. His application is to forecasting, but I don't see a reason why you could not do IRFs as well, as in a standard VAR. You'll have no choice but to do a Bayesian estimation via MCMC as Dueker does. Dueker and others have follow up papers on the Qual-VAR model. Hope this helps!
