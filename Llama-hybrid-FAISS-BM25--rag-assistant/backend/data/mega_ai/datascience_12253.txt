Performance measure: Why is it called recall and sensitivity?

precision is the fraction of retrieved instances that are relevant, while recall (also known as sensitivity) is the fraction of relevant instances that are retrieved. I know their meaning but I don't know why it is called recall ? I am not a native-speaker of English. I know recall means remember, then I don't know the relevance of this meaning to this concept! maybe coverage was better because it shows how many instances were covered...or any other term. Moreover sensitivity is also insensible to me! Could you please help me to associate these words to the concept and have a sense of them?
