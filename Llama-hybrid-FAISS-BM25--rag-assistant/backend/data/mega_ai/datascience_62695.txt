Have you tried normalization or doesn't your algorithm need that? if $x,y then $x^2,y^2,xy,...$ are too small if $x,y > 1.0$ then $x^2,y^2,xy,...$ are too big Many machine learning algorithms need to normalize them as they are in the same scale. $$ x = (x - x_{mean})/x_{std} \\ x^2 = (x^2 - x^2_{mean})/x^2_{std} \\ .. and so on. $$ If you don't normalize them, training may be very slow or not converge. You can utilize the sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler .
