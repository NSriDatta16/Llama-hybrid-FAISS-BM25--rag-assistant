JDBC and ODBC already have what you need. Try looking at cursors, for example this . The syntax will not be as compact as in LINQ for example, but you'll get your rows through which you'll be able to iterate. You might also want to check for object relational mapping , because I assume that's what you are ultimately looking for. Furthermore, you will probably find that LINQ and other approaches work well with single row updates and with simple retrievals, but that for general database work (multiple row updates, complicated retrievals, aggregates, etc) there is nothing like SQL. SQL is and will be the most natural way to communicate to RDBMS, since it is the native language for RDBMS. If you don't want to use SQL you will have to either use a) one of approaches described at here or here . Keep in mind that these are full blown API's which map to SQL and that at the end they are essential no simpler and where they differ in pardigm, usually not as effective (unnatural fro RDBMS). b) Write your own data abstraction layer (possibly using one of the frameworks mentioned under a) providing natural methods for your objects to talk to the database. This way you'll get the best of both worlds and exactly what you need. Although this really shines in larger projects.
