how to select rows and count values from a binary data set in perl?

I hope any of you can help me. I have a data set similar to this: 0100010011 1011100100 0001001100 0101111011 0010000100 1101111011 0000111000 0001000101 1110000010 0001000011 0110111100 1001000001 This example consist in only four 'paragraphs' with three rows each one, with 10 digits per row. My real data is a lot larger, it has 1000 paragraphs with 100 rows each one, with 50 digits per row (all binary data). I need to calculate the number of times that "1" is present per column per paragraph. I have been searching on the web and found this code: #!/usr/bin/perl my @LineTotalsArray; while (my $line = ) { print $line; chomp $line; my $index=0; for my $val ( split /\t/, $line ) { $LineTotalsArray[ $index++ ] += $val; } } print join('=', @LineTotalsArray), "\n"; This works fine for "ALL" the file, it does not differentiate between paragraphs, so it gives me the TOTAL account of "1" per column in the whole data set:4 5 4 7 5 5 5 5 5 6 0100010011 1011100100 0001001100 0101111011 0010000100 1101111011 0000111000 0001000101 1110000010 0001000011 0110111100 1001000001 4547555556 Does any of you have any idea of what can I do in this case? how can i tell in perl, that I want to do "this" operation every, let's say, "three rows"?. Thanks for your help, any suggestion will be welcome!
