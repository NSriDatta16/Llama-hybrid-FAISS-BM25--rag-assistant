Database Storage of Dynamic Methods in C#

How can I store C# methods in a sql server instance to be loaded and run dynamically (at runtime) at a later date? I am about to begin a production test project at work where I would like the appropriate test methods for the product to be loaded at runtime. I have looked at Reflection.Emit DynamicMethod briefly but it is not serializable. Any suggestions or alternative routes would be appreciated.
