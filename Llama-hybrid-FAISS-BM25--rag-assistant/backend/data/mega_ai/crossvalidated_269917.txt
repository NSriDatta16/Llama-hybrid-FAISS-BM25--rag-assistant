People do do what you suggest and include as a moderator something like proportion of women, average age, and so on. The drawback with doing this is that what the moderator tells you is the effect of being enrolled in a study with a high proportion of women, or a high average age, not the effect of being a woman or an older person. If you are happy with that interpretation for your scientific question then go ahead but many people find it less appealing.
