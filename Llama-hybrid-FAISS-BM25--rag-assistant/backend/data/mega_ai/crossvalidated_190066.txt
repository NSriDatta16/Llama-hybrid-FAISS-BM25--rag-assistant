Mitigate autocorrelation in time series with AR(2) process

I have a dataframe with 4000 companies and I have calculated a liquidity measure of each of the company in the dataframe. Liquidity is highly persistent. And my analysis shows that in these indiviual companies in my dataframe depict strong first order autocorrelation. So, as suggested by literature I should transform this liquidity measure of each indiviual company by AR(2). By following AR(2) process equation Where, Ct i is a measure of liquidity for stock i at month t, x is the number of lags included in the autoregressive process, and ut i is the residuals in liquidity for stock i at month t. I am unable to understand how this transformation works, what will be the new values of the each company. What I have to do with the residuals because what I read it says to extract the residual of each and subtract from original series.If I subtract the original value from residual won't it result in predicted value. I would appreciate if you could help me understand this in simple manner. Why I want to carry out this is because I'm applying a liquidity adjusted CAPM to my data.And I have to calculate betas for indiviual companies based on equations of the model as follows Where,β1 is similar to the market beta of the CAPM except for additional term that is realted to the trading cost in the denominator. The remaining systematic risk components are associated with liquidity. β2 represents liquidity commonality, that is, the co-movement between individual stock liquidity and market liquidity.β3 measures the co-movement between stock returns and market liquidity.β4 captures the co-movement between individual liquidity and market returns. For this purpose I have to mitigate the autocorrelation in the time series.
