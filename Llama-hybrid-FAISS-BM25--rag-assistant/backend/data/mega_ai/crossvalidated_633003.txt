Modelling count data with variable upper bound

I have been unable to find references to understand how count data can be modeled where each count observation has an unknown upper bound lying in a particular range. Let's consider the following example so that I can make my problem statement clear: In a study, a statistician is trying to model number of cigarettes each member of an office staff ( $N_{members} = 45$ ) smokes on each day ( $day$ ) through Monday to Friday for four weeks. The predictor variables used to model number of cigarettes ( $N_{c})$ are weight ( $w$ ), gender ( $g$ ) and members' rating on a scale of 0 to 10 about their stress level ( $stress$ ) assessed as soon as they enter the office on each day. It can be assumed that members of the office are very punctual and they reach the office exactly at the same time. All individuals carry their own cigarette packs and they do not share their cigarettes with each other. However, it is known to the statistician that some members carry more packs than others but no one carries more than two packs. The statistician also knows that these packs have at most 10-14 cigarettes and knows the number of packs ( $N_p$ ) each member carries every day. More importantly, members who smoke more cigarettes on an average are expected to drop from the study within few days and those who don't smoke at all are expected to have high compliance with regards to reporting their $N_c$ to the statistician. From the previous question I had asked, I know that Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs) can handle unbalanced datasets. Here is my naive model for understanding how predictor variables might affect $N_{c}$ : fit This model does not account for temporal autocorrelation in $N_c$ across days as well as is not well-informed about the number of data points observed for each member. How can I improve such model to account for count data where each observation has an uncertain upper bound lying in the range of 20-28? This problem is different than what was asked in this question because of variable upper bound.
