You are confounding a notion from classical statistics ("statistically significant way") with Bayesian statistics, which is, generally speaking, a mistake. In a classical framework, your $P(+|G)$ can't go to zero, instead, it goes to whatever the significance level you are testing at is, e.g., 0.05. At that point, $P(+|G) = P(+|F)$ and cancels out of the numerator and denominator in: $$P(G|+) = {P(+|G)P(G) \over P(+|G)P(G) + P(+|F)P(F)} = {P(G) \over P(G)+P(F)} =P(G)$$ as $P(G)+P(F) = 1$ . So... your intuition is correct; at the limit, where the study has no power, it will have no effect on your prior.
