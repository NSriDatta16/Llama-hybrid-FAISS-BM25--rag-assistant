There's an HTTP header called Content-Disposition, which is defined in RFC1806 as follows: 2.1 The Inline Disposition Type A bodypart should be marked inline if it is intended to be displayed automatically upon display of the message.

The MUA might instead present the user of a bitmap terminal with an iconic representation of the attachments, or, on character terminals, with a list of attachments from which the user could select for viewing or storage. In order to put the header message on the xml file, you'd need the access to the server-side. For example using php's header function you could write something like: header('Content-Disposition: attachment; filename="some.xml"'); If you don't have access to the server-side, you could try the following JavaScript trick that I found Googling (not sure if it would work): Save this page
