I would keep everything in one repository and put each project and library in separate root directory of repository (see Planning Your Repository Organization for details). Keep in mind that repository structure do not have to be identical to project files structure on disk. Also I would use svn-externals to share library directories (kept as separate root folders of repository) among various projects.
