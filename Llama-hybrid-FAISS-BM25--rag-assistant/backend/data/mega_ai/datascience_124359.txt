Feature selection methods when input data is continuous but target variable is categorical

I plan on extracting features from a univariate time series, and use a feature selection method to select relevant features to predict a binary target variable via logistic regression. But, I have 2 major doubts: How do I avoid collinearity when selecting features, given these time series-extracted features come from the same signal? Whatâ€™s the best feature selection method to implement, in this scenario?
