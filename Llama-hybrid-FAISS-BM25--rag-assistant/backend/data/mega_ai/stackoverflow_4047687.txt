I would recommend that you don't apply these logic changes in the phtml. You should try to work with the Shipping or Payment method PHP code, either by extending Magento's core methods or writing your own. There are numerous tutorials on the Magento wiki or other blogs on how to achieve this. By editing the phtml directly, you run the risk of breaking when Magento releases patches or upgrades, and it is bad practice in general.
