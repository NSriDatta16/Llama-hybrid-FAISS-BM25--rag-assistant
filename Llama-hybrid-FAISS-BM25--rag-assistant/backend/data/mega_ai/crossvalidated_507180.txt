Non-central correlated normal ratio - distribution of the ratio of two dependent normally distributed variables

I am currently trying to solve a problem in the context of a Bayesian analysis that concerns normal distributions. The situation is as follows. I have an equation that looks like this, where I know that ROE is normally distributed; both mean and variance are known, let's label them as $ROE_T$ and $\sigma$ Â²: $$LTS_0 = \frac{1}{(1+r_e)^{T-1}} \bigg(\frac{(ROE - r_e)B_{T - 1}}{r_e - ROE(1 - k_L)} \bigg)$$ All other variables are constant and do not depend on ROE. From "merging" and rearranging the denominators of the equation and by assuming $T = 2$ , I know that the distribution of the numerator and denominator will both also be normal with the following means and variances. Numerator: $$\begin{align} Numerator &\sim \mathrm{Normal}((ROE_T - r_e)B_{T - 1},\ \sigma^2 B_{T - 1}^2) \end{align}$$ Denominator: $$\begin{align} Denominator &\sim \mathrm{Normal}(ROE_T w +r_e(1 + r_e),\ \sigma^2 w^2), \end{align}$$ where $ w = (k_L-1)(1+r_e)$ , with $w because $ 0 and $r_e > 0 $ I'm looking for the distribution of LTS given that ROE in both the numerator and denominator follows the abovementioned normal distributions. I know the basic math concerning random variables and expectational values, but I can't figure this out somehow, especially because there are normal distributions in the numerator and denominator and I cannot assume that they are independent (in fact, their correlation is perfectly negative since w is always negative and both are determined by ROE). I have looked through articles including Hinkley (1969) and tried to apply the pdf displayed there. The Wikipedia page on ratio distributions has a guide on doing this, but everything I found is not applicable because of the perfect anticorrelation (often, specific denominators and variances become zero in that case). I've been trying to find a solution for a couple weeks now and I am starting to become a little bit desperate. Simulation yields curves that are definetely not normally distributed. I hope it actually exists, maybe someone knows exactly how I could derive it in this setting? I would be very thankful for any guidance!
