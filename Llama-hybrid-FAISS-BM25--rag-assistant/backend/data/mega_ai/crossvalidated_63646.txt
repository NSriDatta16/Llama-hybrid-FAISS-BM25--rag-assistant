How to find patterns and identify changes in them in time series with R

This is my first question on stats, just trying to learn the basics of time series analysis with R . So any good suggestions about learning resources will be highly appreciated as well as the answer to the question. For the data below, let's say it represents number of website visits per day, I would like to find out: What the weekly pattern is (e.g. the highest number of visits occurs on Thursdays, the lowest on Fridays etc.) Automatically detect changes in that pattern (e.g. in 2008 most of the visits occur on Thursdays, but the in 2009-01-04 the pattern changes to something else) Please let me know if I can provide more details. > str(daily) An ‘xts’ object on 2007-02-19 23:32:16/2013-05-05 15:09:17 containing: Data: num [1:2268, 1] 55 32 70 48 75 50 48 46 36 55 ... - attr(*, "dimnames")=List of 2 ..$ : NULL ..$ : chr "cnt" Indexed by objects of class: [POSIXct,POSIXt] TZ: xts Attributes: NULL > head(daily) cnt 2007-02-19 23:32:16 55 2007-02-20 23:58:58 32 2007-02-21 23:40:41 70 2007-02-22 23:01:41 48 2007-02-23 23:53:06 75 2007-02-24 23:47:07 50 plot(daily) Full dataset: https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/65347419/daily.csv
