The temporary flag just indicates that you'd like the write to the disk to be as late as possible . This is quite the contrary you'd want for a log file, as you'd like to get the content of the file written safly to disk so you can access it even in case of a system failure. To quote from the MSDN page fro CreateFile() : Specifying the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY attribute causes file systems to avoid writing data back to mass storage if sufficient cache memory is available, because an application deletes a temporary file after a handle is closed. In that case, the system can entirely avoid writing the data. Although it doesn't directly control data caching in the same way as the previously mentioned flags, the FILE_ATTRIBUTE_TEMPORARY attribute does tell the system to hold as much as possible in the system cache without writing and therefore may be of concern for certain applications. In my opinion, you'd only use it, if it really is temporary data which you are going to delete anyways after you are done with it, e.g. things you'd write to %TEMP% directory.
