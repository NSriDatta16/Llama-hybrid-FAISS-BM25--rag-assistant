This does not directly address your question, but you may want to look at mt_rand() instead. The PHP documentation states: Many random number generators of older libcs have dubious or unknown characteristics and are slow. By default, PHP uses the libc random number generator with the rand() function. The mt_rand() function is a drop-in replacement for this. It uses a random number generator with known characteristics using the Â» Mersenne Twister, which will produce random numbers four times faster than what the average libc rand() provides. From http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.mt-rand.php .
