If you only have two charts I would show the following pair. You are right to want to avoid percentages if some items have several errors, but you can show average errors per item which amounts to the same thing without the misleading impression, and could go over 1 without any need for an explanation of how a percentage goes over 100%. You want to emphasize that: errors peaked in May; the error rate peaked in July; March and June were "good months" with high items and low errors and July was a "bad month"; that type 3 errors are most common; and (if true) the types of error vary between months. I think these do that.
