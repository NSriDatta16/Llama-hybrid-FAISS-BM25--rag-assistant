In addition to making your checkboxes reflect Boolean values your controller owns, rather than own those values themselves, and moving this logic to the controller, you should also burninate most of that copied-and-pasted code. It looks like you're doing the same thing for every case, only really varying the image, so use the same position variable (with the same value) and the same image variable for all the cases. Do away with the if statements. Set the checkboxes' tags in IB, and in your controller's action method for the checkboxes, use the sender's tag to determine which image to show. (Whether you do this with an array or a dictionary is up to you, but you'll have to set it up ahead of time, such as in init , either way.) You may want to make a plist file containing an array or dictionary of image names and load that in your init method. You can have another method that attempts to retrieve the NSImage from a dictionary with the tag numbers as keys and, if the tag is not in that dictionary, uses the tags-to-names dictionary (from the plist file) to get the image name, loads the image using that name, and stores the image in the tags-to-images dictionary for future retrievals. You'll call this method when a checkbox is clicked, passing the checkbox's tag, and handing off the image it returns to your custom view to display. If you are targeting Snow Leopard, you can use NSCache instead of NSMutableDictionary for the tags-to-images mapping. This enables you to set a limit on how many images you keep loaded at a time. By the way, dissolveToPoint:fraction: is deprecated since Snow Leopard. You should use drawAtPoint:fromRect:operation:fraction: instead. Pass NSZeroRect for the source rectangle to use the entire image. Also, if you really do mean for the user to only be able to select one image at a time, you should use radio buttons, not checkboxes. Implement that as an NSMatrix containing NSButtonCells; the easiest way is to create a single radio button, then option-resize it in IB. The cells are what you should set the tags and actions of. Checkboxes would be appropriate only if the user can select multiple images to be combined in some way (e.g., compositing them together).
