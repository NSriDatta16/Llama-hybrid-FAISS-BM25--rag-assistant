LIME visualization outputs padded regions as important - Mel-spectrogram (audio analysis)

I am encoding audios as Mel-spectrograms and using these Mel-spectrograms as input to my deep learning model (Inception-ResNet V2). The input image is of size 256 X 256, made up of a 128 X 64 spectrogram (128 melbands) along with zero padding. Sample input: I am using LIME to visualize the important regions of a Mel-spectrogram. In some Mel-spectrograms, LIME is labelling the padded regions as important, like in this image. So, is this happening because of poor learning or is this a genuine problem with LIME when it encounters padded regions?
