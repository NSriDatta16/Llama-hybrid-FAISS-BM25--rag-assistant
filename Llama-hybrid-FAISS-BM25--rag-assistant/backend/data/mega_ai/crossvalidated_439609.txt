Another interesting measure that can deal with zero actuals: Relative Total Absolute Error: mean of all absolute errors devided by the mean of the absolute actuals. This measure is a MAPE where the sum is moved into the fraction. An advantage is that the RTAE can deal with zero actuals. That said, SMAPE and the RTAE are useful when there are a few zeroes in your time series. If there a lot of zeroes; close to 50% or more, then these measures are not useful to evaluate the forecast. In such a case the best forecast would be zero according to these measures. Here is a reference for error measures when having time series with a lot of zeroes: https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/pg/waller/pdfs/Intermittent_Demand_Forecasting.pdf .
