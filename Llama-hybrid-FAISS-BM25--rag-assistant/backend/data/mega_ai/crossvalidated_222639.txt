what makes neural networks a nonlinear classification model?

I'm trying to understand the mathematical meaning of non-linear classification models: I've just read an article talking about neural nets being a non-linear classification model. But I just realize that: The first layer: $h_1=x_1∗w_{x1h1}+x_2∗w_{x1h2}$ $h_2=x_1∗w_{x2h1}+x_2∗w_{x2h2}$ The subsequent layer $y=b∗w_{by}+h_1∗w_{h1y}+h_2∗w_{h2y}$ Can be simplified to $=b′+(x_1∗w_{x1h1}+x_2∗w_{x1h2})∗w_{h1y}+(x_1∗w_{x2h1}+x_2∗w_{x2h2})∗w_{h2y} $ $=b′+x_1(w_{h1y}∗w_{x1h1}+w_{x2h1}∗w_{h2y})+x_2(w_{h1y}∗w_{x1h1}+w_{x2h2}∗w_{h2y}) $ An two layer neural network Is just a simple linear regression $=b^′+x_1∗W_1^′+x_2∗W_2^′$ This can be shown to any number of layers, since linear combination of any number of weights is again linear. What really makes an neural net a non linear classification model? How the activation function will impact the non linearity of the model? Can you explain me?
