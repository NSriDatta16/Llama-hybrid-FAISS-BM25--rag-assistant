What are the underlying assumptions of MA, AR & ARMA processes, formally & informally and how do we test them?

I am new to the community and have recently started exploring time series analysis. I have seen a lot of answers here speak about how one tends to not focus on underlying assumptions and rather directly jumps to modelling. I tried finding for assumptions for MA, AR and ARMA processes, but couldn't find any formal set of assumptions! I seek for these processes, their formal assumptions with math supporting it wherever possible, some informal version of those assumptions iff they're too technical and a set of tests or procedures to find out whether those assumptions hold. Just as an example , for Simple Linear Regression I'd roughly say(don't know much myself): A linear relationship exists between the dependent & the independent variable -- R-squared The independent variable is uncorrelated with the residuals -- ??? The expected value of the residual term is zero -- ??? The variance of the residual term is constant for all observations -- ??? The residual term is independently & normally distributed -- Omnibus/Jarque-Bera/QQPlot Listing some of the places I have tried so far: https://www.math.utah.edu/~zhorvath/ar1.pdf https://math.unm.edu/~ghuerta/tseries/week4_1.pdf https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive_model#Example:_An_AR(1)_process http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~milos/courses/cs3750/lectures/class16.pdf https://mcs.utm.utoronto.ca/~nosedal/sta457/pacf.pdf
