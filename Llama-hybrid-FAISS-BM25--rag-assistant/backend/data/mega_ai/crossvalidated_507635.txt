Unless you invent clever features as highly non-linear functions of $\{X_1,X_2\}$ , logistic regression will not be able to separate the two classes visualized below. Logistic regression will have to draw the boundary somewhere. Adding powers of $\{X_1,X_2\}$ will not help in this situation. You will need to know the nature of the two classes to introduce features based on the mod() function. On the other hand, boosted trees and random forests will do the feature development for you. Automatically. Carefully.
