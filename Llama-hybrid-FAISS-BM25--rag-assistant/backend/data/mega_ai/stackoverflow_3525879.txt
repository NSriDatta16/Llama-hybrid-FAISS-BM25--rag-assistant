According to Apple ( https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/SafariJSDatabaseGuide/Name-ValueStorage/Name-ValueStorage.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007256-CH6-SW3 ), localStorage support was added in Safari 4.0. According to Wikipedia ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Safari_version_history ), Safari 4.0 was added in iPhone OS 3.0. 2G iPhones did not come with OS 3.0 or later pre-installed. Your iPhone OS version is most likely too old.
