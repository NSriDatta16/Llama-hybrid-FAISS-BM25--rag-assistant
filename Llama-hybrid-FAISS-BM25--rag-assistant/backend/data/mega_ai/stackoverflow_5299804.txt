Readability; you can have ( far fetched, but to illustrate the point ) map (\x -> x * 2) . anotherfunction . anotheragain . itgoesonandon $ [ a lont list ] vs map f . anotherfunction . anotheragain . itgoesonandon $ [ a lont list ] where f x = x * 2 It's matter of taste but in the first case you know right away what function you are mapping, in the second one you have to locate f in the source code, and it might be a few lines away. By the way, I would write map (*2) .... anyway Another example is desugared monadic notation. For example, do a becomes : action1 >>= \a -> action2 >>= \b -> action3 >> action4 a b >>= \c -> action5 c vs action1 >>= a2 where a2 a = action2 >>= a3 where a3 b = action3 >> action4 a b >>= a4 where a4 c = action5 c (there might be an error in that code, but I would never write that anyways )
