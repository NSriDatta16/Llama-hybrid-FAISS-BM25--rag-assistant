What attributes are you adding to the property being displayed in the editor? If you are only using [WebBrowsable(true)], the property will be personalizable for all users. If you only want the property to be set by the admin in the shared scope, you should include a [WebPartStorage(Storage.Shared)] attribute. See MSDN for more detail.
