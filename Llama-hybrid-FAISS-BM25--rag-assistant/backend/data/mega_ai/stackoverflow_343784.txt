What about this approach: For all nodes in the document (I suppose there is not more than one per ), concatenate all relevant data (element names, attributes, values) into a string: // string format is really irrelevant, so this is just a bogus example '!w:keep-with-next@value="true"!w:spacing@w:before="10"@w:after="120"' Do so on alphabetical order, to account for varying document order. Build a collection using these strings as the key and the reference to the respective node as the value. In the process of doing this, when you hit the point that a given key already exists in the collection, you found a paragraph with the same properties. Work with a list of nodes as the collection value, if you want to keep collecting. I can't say how well this would perform, but I guess it is not too hard to implement and find out.
