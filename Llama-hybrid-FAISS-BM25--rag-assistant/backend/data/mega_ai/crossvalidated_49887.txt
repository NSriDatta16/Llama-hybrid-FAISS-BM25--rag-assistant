Appropriate cluster method?

What cluster method would be appropriate for a study with 16 variables both categorial and quantitative? It is a repeated measures observational study. I read in a text that k-means would be best if the data was mostly quantitative although I may have interpreted that wrong. Also, what methods are best for throwing out certain variables prior to performing cluster analysis. I read similar articles to the study I am analyzing, and some opted to do a PCA first, or a discriminant function analysis afterwards to confirm the number of chosen clusters. Thoughts and comments?
