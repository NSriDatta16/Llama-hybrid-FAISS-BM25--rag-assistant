Techniques to reduce data harvesting from AJAX/JSON services

I was wondering if anyone had come across any techniques to reduce the chances of data exposed through JSON type services on the server (intended to supply AJAX functions) from being harvested by external agents. It seems to me that the problem is not so difficult if you had say a Flash client consuming the data. Then you could send encrypted data to the client, which would know how to decrypt it. The same method seems impossible with AJAX though, due to the open nature of the Javascript source. Has anybody implemented a clever technique here? Whatever the method, it should still allow a genuine AJAX function to consume the data. Note that I'm not really talking about protecting 'sensitive' information here, the odd record leaking out is not a problem. Rather I am thinking about stopping a situation where the whole DB is hoovered up by bots (either in one go, or gradually over time). Thanks.
