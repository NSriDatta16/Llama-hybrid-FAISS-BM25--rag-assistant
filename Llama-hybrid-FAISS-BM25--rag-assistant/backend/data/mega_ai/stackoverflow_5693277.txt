If you're working in Interface Builder, you'll find an object in the Library called Flexible Space Bar Button Item. You just drag and place one of these objects in between any adjacent buttons, so that the objects on the toolbar end up ordered something like: button-fsbbi-button-fsbbi-button-fsbbi-button These objects act as springs that keep your buttons equally spaced apart.
