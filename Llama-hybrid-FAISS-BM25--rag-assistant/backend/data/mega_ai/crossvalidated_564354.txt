The intercept in a logistic regression model represents the log-odds of response when all other covariates in the model are equal to 0. A log odds of 0 implies a probability of 0.5. The log odds theoretically needs to $\infty$ so that all responses are 1. Your description of the relation between log odds and probability of response is wrong here and needs to be checked. The first plot is lower because you have plotted the expected log odds as the points and the actual log odds as the line. Change the seed and you'll readily see the effect of random variability in the sample. par(mfrow=c(1,3)) b.5 = scales::alpha("black",.5) plot(z~x1z, ylab = "Log Odds", pch = 19, col = b.5, xlim = c(-5,5), ylim = c(-12,11)) abline(a = 0, b = 2, col = "red") abline(h=0, v=0,lty = 3) plot(z~x1, ylab = "Log Odds", pch = 19, col = b.5, xlim = c(0,10), ylim = c(-12,11)) abline(a = glm.sum $coefficients[1,1], b = glm.sum$ coefficients[2,1]) abline(h=0, v=0,lty = 3) points(x = 0, y=glm.sum $coefficients[1,1], pch = 19, col = "red") text(x = 0, y=glm.sum$ coefficients[1,1], labels = c("Intercept"), pos =4)
