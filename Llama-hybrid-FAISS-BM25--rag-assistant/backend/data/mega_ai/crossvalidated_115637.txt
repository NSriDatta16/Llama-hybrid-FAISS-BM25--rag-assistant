Algorithm to find subsets with high correlation

I have a reasonably large dataset (d) with predictor variables x1...xn and a target variable y. I can use recursive partitioning (such as CART or rpart in R) to find subsets of d with a high (or low) average y. However, I am interested in subsets with a high correlation between x1 and y. For example, suppose that in the subset defined by d[x2>5 & x3 5 & x3 5 & x3 In an ideal world, I would even get to specify the model - i.e. instead of using a linear model y = a*x1 + b, I would like to use a logistic model, since y is binary in my particular dataset. Is there an algorithm that can find those subsets for me automatically? Is this algorithm perchance implemented in R? Thank you!
