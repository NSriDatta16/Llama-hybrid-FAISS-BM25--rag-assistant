Since the Markov chain is regular, there exists a $k$ such that for all states $i,j$ in the state space $P^k(i,j) > 0$. Naturally, a regular Markov chain is then irreducible. Now, since $P^k > 0$ for all $i,j$, then $P^{k+1}$ has entries $$\pi_{ij}^{k+1} = \sum_t \pi_{it} \pi_{tj}^{k} > 0 \,, $$ since for at least one $t$, $\pi_{it} > 0$. This means that $P^{k+1}$ > 0 as well, and so is $P^{k+2}, P^{k+3},...$ The gcd of $\{k, k+1, k+2, \dots\}$ is 1, and thus a regular Markov chain is also aperiodic. Thus, regular Markov chains are irreducible and aperiodic which implies, the Markov chain has a unique limiting distribution. Conversely, all matrices with a limiting distribution do not imply that they are regular. A counter-example is the example here , where the transition matrix is upper triangular, and thus the transition matrix for every step is upper triangular (and hence not regular), but a limiting distribution exists.
