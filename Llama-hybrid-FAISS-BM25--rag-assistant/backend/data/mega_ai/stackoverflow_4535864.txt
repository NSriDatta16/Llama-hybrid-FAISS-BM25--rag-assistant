I'm betting that you do access the HTML. It prints the HTML to the screen, and that HTML includes code that redirects you to a new page. Try outputting an encoded version of the HTML, so that the browser interprets it as plain text: echo htmlspecialchars($html); However, looking at your actual code: please do not pretend to be Google. You are not the Googlebot, so your script should not say that you are. If you include any user agent at all (and I recommend that you do), make it reflect your identity, in case the site owner hits issues with your bot. No need to be shady :)
