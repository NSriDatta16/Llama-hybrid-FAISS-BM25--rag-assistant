This assignment is meant to familiarize you with the idea of hooking up events to HTML objects, with using some of the common operators (multiplication, division, assignment, etc) and to declare functions with parameters, return values, and to use them all together. Consider the following: function alertTotalAmount() { var orderAmount = getOrderAmount(); var shippingAndHandling = calculateShippingAndHandling(orderAmount); var totalAmount = orderAmount + shippingAndHandling; alert(totalAmount); } function getOrderAmount() { return 10; } function calculateShippingAndHandling(orderAmount) { if (orderAmount This would alert the total amount of the order - note however that getOrderAmount returns a static value. This is a quick-and-dirty way of getting things to work. What I leave to you is to research how to take an HTML element such as an input (text box) and get the value of that item, to use as the parameter to calculateShippingAndHandling. You also need to wire up the alertTotalAmount function to the onClick event of something like a button or other HTML element.
