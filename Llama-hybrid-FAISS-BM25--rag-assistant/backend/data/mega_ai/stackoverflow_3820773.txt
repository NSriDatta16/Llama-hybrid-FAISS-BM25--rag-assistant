UIWebView doesn't support authentication at all. Up to iPhone OS 3.1, you could add credentials to the central credential storage and UIWebView would at least work with basic authentication. But starting with iOS 4.0, I don't see any way to use authentication (except cookie or URL based forms authentication).
