In the question title, you said "no prior knowledge of the data". What does this mean exactly? Does it mean: you do not have the prior data, or you have the prior data but you don't have any knowledge on the relationships the parameters in the data have. As for Bayes, you need both the prior data and prior knowledge. Note that you may be able to find the prior knowledge from the prior data (e.g. using some machine learning tools). The prior knowledge is the set of probabilities used in Bayes. Based on this prior data and prior knowledge, you build a Bayes model. Now, when you have new data (from the same population), you can pass it through the built Bayes model and make predictions on the new data. This link may help: Link (I haven't read the whole page; I just googled it and found that there's also some information regarding Bayes and patients.) Hope this helps.
