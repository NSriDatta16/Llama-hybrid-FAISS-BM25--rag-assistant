(Rolling) Evaluation of whole forecast horizon

I have a time series with about 200 to 250 observations (depending on the cross-section) and I do different rolling forecasts. The maximum forecast horizon is 20. I would like to evaluate the forecast for the whole horizon (not just x-steps ahead) at each point in time. Since the literature basically always only evaluates x-steps ahead I am not really sure what the best way to do that would be. My current idea is to calculate different indicators (like RSME) for the whole horizon and take the average in the end. As the training set increases the forecast accuracy should also increase, and therefore I am not sure whether it is a good idea to use the average (or median) or not. Any alternative ideas?
