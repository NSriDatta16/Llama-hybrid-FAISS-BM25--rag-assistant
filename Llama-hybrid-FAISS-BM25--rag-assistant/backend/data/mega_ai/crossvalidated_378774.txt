This is technically possible by reverting the time series, and makes sense given the short actual pre-period (which will most likely not give sufficient power to fit a reasonable model). The interpretation of the fitted model could be tricky though. It should at least not contain any autoregressive components (as this would mean explaining past production based on future production), i.e. only rely on covariates for the prediction. Furthermore, check whether reversibility seems to be a plausible assumption for the given data set in the first place: Could the production time series also have been observed in reverse order? Do we expect that the disappearance of a buyer of the market has the reverse effect as the appearance of a new buyer?
