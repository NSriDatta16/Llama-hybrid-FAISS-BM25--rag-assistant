Bayesian Priors Update: Difference in Mean detection

Suppose I have measures of the life span of mice. I know the true expectancy in the beginning of the experiment - 1000 of days and true variance. At some (unknown) point mice begun to be fed by a new drug. New drug increase or decrease the life expectancy. I would say small effects are more probable than large effects, but mice on drugs can live, for example, 5 times longer, with extremely small prior probability, and it is impossible to live 10 times longer. So I have three models: $M_{increase}, M_{same}, M_{decrease}$. But I am not interested in small changes of life expectancy, so $M_{same}$ means "life expectancy is something within 990-1010". So, I have all the data and need to find a change in life expectancy (it happened once and after this point all mice were under drugs). I can simply check all data points in time series and find the maximum likelihood solution (with a t-test), but I would like to do it in a Bayesian way using, for example, Bayes factors. Which priors should I choose? How to update priors for these models? I could not find conjugate prior with this decreasing trend in the beginning of analysis and with growing "pike" around true value in the end. UPD: I want to fill 2 matrices (dynamic programming) with the Bayes factors between alternative/neutral models. Lets say "model changes at moment $t$". That means that corresponding Bayes factor will be the biggest one (Â± several points). Here is the example for 5 time points, maximum BF at the coordinate (2,5) means "model changed at moment 2 and till point 5 alternative model was preferable". (Actually, that's how I can detect the switch off to neutral model). The problem here is that I do not know the distribution of alternative model, but I know that it has constant mean and variance. time-points 1 2 3 4 5 1 0.5 0.7 0.8 1.1 1.4 2 1.5 1.8 3.6 4.9 3 2.0 3.2 3.9 4 1.8 2.5 5 0.9
