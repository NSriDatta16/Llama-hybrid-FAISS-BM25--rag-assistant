If you going with cheap barcode readers use Code128 . It can encode nearly arbitrary lengths of numbers and/or text (numeric only content hesults in 50% smaller barcodes). If you want to use cameras/phones for barcode decoding use datamatrix . You can put about 1kb of data into a datamatrix barcode. (Edit 2015: QRcode seems to slowly kill datamatrix. So go for QRcode instead of datamatrix.) Wikipedia has very decent coverage on the topic of barcodes . Shameless plug: If you are interested in the way barcodes are encoded and decoded you might want to have a look at the free Python Library huBarcode which implements the most common barcode schemes in pure Python. It is published by my company. Reading barcodes is extremely simple because the scanner simulates a keyboard. So you just have to scan instead of typing. We have several internal web applications which are used on PCs equipped only with scanners and a trackball - no keyboards at all. No special drivers are required for such a setup.
