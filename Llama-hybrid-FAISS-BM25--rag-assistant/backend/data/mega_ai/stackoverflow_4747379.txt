What is the best way to to execute code before a page is loaded

Based on my previous question , in Enterprise Edition Magento it doesn't appear to be a good idea to use any of the available controller events if you are planning on having the full page caching enabled. It looks to be you only want to use these events if you are doing something with the actual page. However, we have built some extensions for Magento that on controller_action_predispatch , we have an observer and from there we grab a parameter in the URL and if it is set correctly we do some additional functionality from there. For example, we have made it so a client can put promo codes in urls for email campaigns and when they click that link it is attached to the customer's quote. We have to look for the parameter before the page is loaded and do our thing. But now that there is this full page caching it isn't working correctly. So is it probably better to not do this with an Observer and just extend the code? Or are there better Observers to do this with. We tried to use HTTP send response before one and got mixed results.
