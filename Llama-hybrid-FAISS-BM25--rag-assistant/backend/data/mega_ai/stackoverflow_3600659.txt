This is why it is so important to turn on the strict and warnings pragmas. The string "@$date1" does not mean what you think it does. It is trying to dereference $data1 as a an array. Because strict isn't on it is treating the contents of $date1 as a symbolic reference. If you had turned on strict you would have seen an error message like: Can't use string ("2010-08-30") as an ARRAY ref while "strict refs" in use at script.pl line 10. You should probably say this instead: system "p4 interchanges -t $branch1\@$date1,\@$date2 $branch2 > changes.txt"; if ($?) { die "saw exit code: ", $? >> 8; } You may also have a problem if you expect $branch1 , $date1 , etc. to be shell variables instead of Perl variables. In that case you should say: system "p4 interchanges -t $ENV{branch1}\@$ENV{date1},\@$ENV{date2} $ENV{branch2} > changes.txt"; if ($?) { die "saw exit code: ", $? >> 8; }
