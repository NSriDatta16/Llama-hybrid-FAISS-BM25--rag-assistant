An alternative very flexible approach is Bayesian. You can implement it in R using JAGS (you will have to go through some steps to download beyond just a package). If you do this, you can specify any correlation structure you want. To structure it this way, you could either 1) treat your spatially correlated outcomes as part of a multivariate normal model (now y has 2 dimensions, the outcome and the space). or 2) Add another random component for space to the model which has its own correlation structure. For example, you could modify this code for (2) and build a random intercept and slope model in R. Each person is indexed by i (say a n x 1 vector) and you also provide another nx1 vector of their spatial index (called site_indicator). You also need to provide the total number of sites. model_RIAS_MVN This is just working code and it will need tweaked, but hopefully you get an idea of the flexibility and how you can specify the correlation structure this way.
