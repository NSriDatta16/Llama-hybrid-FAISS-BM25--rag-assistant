Alright, I have combined @Dimitre Novatchev's idea from this post's answers and @Tomalak's from [XSLT]: Rendering a node sequence as M x N table post. I really liked @Tomalak's solution with $perRow variable and the template to cope with empty cells. With the idea taken from @Dimitre Novatchev answer I'm holding on to $trStartPos . I then calculate $lowerBoundry and $upperBoundry that are used to accumulate all elements that should appear in a row. There might be a more elegant way to do this calculation - please let me know if you come up with one, I would really appreciate it! XSLT Transformation El. name: - El. value: &#160; applied on the following XML A-01 02 03 04 B-05 06 07 C-08 09 D-10 11 12 13 E-14 15 results in the following output El. name: A - El. value: A-01 El. name: B - El. value: B-05 El. name: C - El. value: C-08 El. name: D - El. value: D-10 El. name: E - El. value: E-14
