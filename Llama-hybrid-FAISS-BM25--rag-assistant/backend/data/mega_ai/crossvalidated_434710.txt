At the risk of overreaching, I think you're putting the cart before the horse. Your startup has objectives but no data. The question you really need to answer is: "If my company had data, would it even make a difference?" Unless your companies business model is 100% ML driven, most likely its growth objectives are not initially dependent on strong ML solutions to its problems. ML makes a difference only when you have a consistent , large and high-quality set of features. Whereas your company will be launching and removing new features at a breakneck pace. So, instead of wasting time setting up infrastructure, focus instead on brainstorming the kinds of problems your company expects to solve with data when it does have it. This means working with the product and engineering teams to ensure you are correctly and accurately collecting features for each of your companies verticals. The engineering team's job is to quickly and efficiently deliver features but your job is to make sure that those features are actionable. This means that you need to ensure that their storage and delivery is up to spec for the kind of ML you want to do (for example, how long of a delay between updates is desired?). It also means clearly defining objectives, e.g. KPIs. Whatever ML infrastructure that you build will start at this source of those features and KPIs, and if you get it wrong, it will all be for naught.
