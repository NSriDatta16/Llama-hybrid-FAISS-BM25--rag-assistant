Before asking "what is the benefit", normally the question you need to answer first is "what is the alternative?" CSS tooltips? JavaScript tooltips? Spelling out the entire word every time? Putting the abbreviation in parentheses just once? The first two put you at risk of the various CSS and JS browser incompatibilities. And the third is going to be pretty irritating for both you and your readers when you have the phrase "National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act" repeated 500 times on the page. And the last of those... well, it's pretty much the same as using the or tag, except using the tags lets the browser decide how to render it (usually with a nice tooltip). SEO and accessibility... maybe there's some benefit, but I think you should use these tags because they are the right tags , just like is the right tag for a paragraph and is the right tag for emphasized text. Say what you mean!
