Resource files and satellite assemblies

I am, for lack of a better word, a newbie to Localization and resource files. I am trying to localize an application I am working on and I want to do it using resource files and satellite assemblies, but I can't figure out how to do it correctly. Here is what I have so far: In my project directory: I created the files LanguageText.resx and LanguageText.nl.resx In my project/bin directory: I created the folder "nl" In my project/bin/nl directory: I used ResGen.exe to create LanguageText.nl.resources file from LanguageText.nl.resx file, then I used AL.exe to create the project.resources.dll file. That .dll file is in the bin/nl folder. It assembled ok and now I have nl/project.resources.dll in my project/bin/debug folder as well. My problem is that I apparently do not have a neutral language file or resource embedded in my program, but I can't find any info on how to do that. The only info I can find about embedding resources in this manner is related to satellite assemblies. How do I embed the neutral language resource? Any help or direction is appreciated. Thanks, Mike
