jQuery OnClick not firing my event

I have a jQuery which is like this: $(document).ready(function () { $("#txtAgentName").click(function (event) { alert("I am ready!"); }); }); What I am assuming that this should fire if I click on my textbox txtAgentName. But it is not happening. This is my textbox markup: However, when I am doing this on my Javascript: function ShowTime() { alert(' '); } and calling this ShowTime from my TextBox OnClick event, then it is firing up. Dont know what I am doing wrong here :(
