Given no knowledge of var, include both continuous and dummy

Imagine we have a variable with 5-7 unique values in a machine learning setting. One could argue that given no knowledge, we might convert it into 5 dummy variables, or one might consider it continuous. Dummy would work well when they are clearly distinct categories, continuous would work if it would have a linear relation. But what about doing both? It might feel a bit redundant, but given no knowledge it might be best not to miss out on anything? Or should we do a simple pearson test before running a model?
