Recurrent neural networks sound like the way to go for you. You can find examples of successful RNN training on music to here and here . A soft intro to RNNs can be found here . However as stated by a previous answer, using keras or a similar framework is probably easier for training. Google Deepmind however published a paper on WaveNet a new kind of network which produces state-of-the-art sound synthesis. You can find source with sound samples and music generation here .
