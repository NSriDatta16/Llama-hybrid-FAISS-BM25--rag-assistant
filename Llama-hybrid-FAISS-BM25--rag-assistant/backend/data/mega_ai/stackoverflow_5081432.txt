This is not good prototype for interop. You can two ways to solve this: Change C++ function prototype and return all doubles through parameters (I hope you have source of C++ func) Use IntPtr as described by Rest Wing Returning memory reference would be working properly only in case that the memory was allocated with CoTaskMemAlloc function. Othrwise you will take runtime exception during memory freeing (the CLR always try to free returnning memory with CoTaskMemFree). I think the best would be the first way, it described in Peter Huene's answer.
