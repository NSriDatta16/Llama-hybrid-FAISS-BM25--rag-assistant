Tcl Dev Kit: can't find package starkit

I am not able to wrap the most simple TCL application using TclDevKit5.2 . I on 64 bit CentOS, and here wat uname -a returns: Linux hp1 2.6.18-194.11.1.el5 #1 SMP Tue Aug 10 19:05:06 EDT 2010 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux When typing: /opt/TclDevKit-5.2/bin/tclapp -out wrap empty.tcl (here empty.tcl is an empty file) it generates the ./wrap executable, however when trying to run ./wrap , it reports this: can't find package starkit while executing "package require starkit" (file "./wrap" line 5) Here are the first lines of ./wrap : #!/bin/sh # \ exec tclsh "$0" ${1+"$@"} ## package require starkit starkit::header mk4 -readonly ## # here goes the binary executable .... What am i doing wrong? Where the starkit package is located? Maybe I have to add something to the add_path ? I am using the 21 days trial version of TclDevKit, and here is the log it reported while generating ./wrap : info | Tcl Dev Kit TclApp info | Copyright (C) 2001-2010 ActiveState Software Inc.
