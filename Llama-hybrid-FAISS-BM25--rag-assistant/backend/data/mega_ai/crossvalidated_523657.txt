Am I supposed to do two separate cross validations? One for hyper parameters and one for model parameters?

What is the correct procedure to optimize hyper parameters? I'm doing a 10 fold cross validation to find the best performing xgboost model. I'm then taking the model that performed best and using random search or grid search to optimize the hyper parameters nrounds, eta, gamma, min child weight, and max depth. The results of the optimization always show the original hyper parameters are best. I must be biasing the model to the original hyper parameters through the 10 fold cross validation. Am I supposed to do two separate cross validations? One for hyper parameters and one for model parameters?
