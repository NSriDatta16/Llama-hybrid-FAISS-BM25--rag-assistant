Is this application of strong Markov Property correct?

Let $X_n$ be a DTMC, with transition matrix P and state-space I. Let $Y_m=X_{T_m}$ for $m \in \mathbb{N}$. Define $T_0=\inf\{n\geq0:X_n\in J\subset I\}$ and $T_{m+1}=\inf\{n> T_{m}:X_n\in J\subset I\}$. These are stopping times, so we can use the strong markov property when conditioning on them. The author of the book writes the following: $$P(Y_{m+1}=i_{m+1}|Y_0=i_0, ..., Y_m=i_m)=P(X_{T_{m+1}}=i_{m+1}|X_{T_{0}}=i_0,..., X_{T_{m}}=i_m)=P_{i_m}(X_{T_{1}}=i_{m+1})=h^{i_{m+1}}_{i_m}$$ where $h^{i_{m+1}}_{i_m}=P(\inf\{n\geq0:X_n=i_{m+1}\} I don't understand the two last equalities... I would think that $P(X_{T_{m+1}}=i_{m+1}|X_{T_{m}}=i_m)=P(X_{T_{m+1}-T_m}=i_{m+1}|X_{0}=i_m)$. Any help would be appreciated. P.S: I've posted also at math.SE , but it has received almost no attention.
