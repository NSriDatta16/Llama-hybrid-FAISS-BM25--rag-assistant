Stanfords CS231n has a great python+numpy tutorial. http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/ As for Neural Networks and Keras + Tensorflow, I can recommend the Deep Learning specialization on Coursera. It is free for one week. If you do not want the certificates you can download all videos and stop. If you want the certficates you can enroll in all courses simultaneously and finish them faster than advertised. They assume 3-6h per week for 16 weeks. If you have 6h per day, it is possible to go through a weeks content per day. Andrew Ng speaks clearly and the videos are understandable at 1.5x-2x speed. As for the roadmap, i would suggest to start with python + numpy until you have a basic understanding of array slicing and read up on unknown commands when you encounter them. start a DL course of your choice but do not skip classes. That is I think it is important to know the basics even if you will only use high level frameworks later on.
