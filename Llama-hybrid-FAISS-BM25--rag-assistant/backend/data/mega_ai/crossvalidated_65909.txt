Probability of getting a specific Tetris piece given previous pieces

I'm doing a small reinforcement learning project involving Tetris, just for fun. Considering that each piece has a constant probability of being selected, how can I calculate the probability of receiving a specified next piece , given the record of the previous spawned pieces? (maybe the piece sequence is not independent as I'm using computer-generated random numbers?) My idea is simple: I would like to 'watch' the 'S', 'Z' and 'I' pieces distributions and somehow incorporate those numbers on the players policy, because are key pieces, so i think it would make a difference on the average performance. Any ideas on how I can incorporate the variables? Thanks!
