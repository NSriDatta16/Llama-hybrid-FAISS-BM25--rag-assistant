Can I have an editable PDF form online? Not exactly -- but you can have a normal form (HTML served on HTTP), and in the server-side method that accepts POST requests, validate the user-supplied data, and if all is fine then generate a PDF on the fly and return it as the query's result, email it, store it, whatever. Details all depend on yr server-side language (e.g., if Python, you'd probably use ReportLabs' popular PDF-writing package -- but there are many server-side languages and I'm not likely to know the best solution for your own preferred one, statistically speaking;-). But the general concept isn't all that different in each server-side case, and I hope I've summarized it adequately in the previous paragraph;-).
