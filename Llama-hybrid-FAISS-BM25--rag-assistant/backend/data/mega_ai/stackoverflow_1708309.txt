Can one turn visual studio's 'smart' sql query assistant off?

When creating this query in the SQL querybuilder window in visual studio (2008): UPDATE outgoing_messages SET readstatus = 5 FROM outgoing_messages INNER JOIN connections ON outgoing_messages.connectionid = connections.connectionid WHERE (outgoing_messages.msgreference = '103') AND (connections.providerid = 9) Visual studio knows better and criples it by turning it into: UPDATE outgoing_messages SET readstatus = 5 FROM outgoing_messages AS outgoing_messages_1 INNER JOIN connections ON outgoing_messages_1.connectionid = connections.connectionid CROSS JOIN outgoing_messages WHERE (outgoing_messages_1.msgreference = '103') AND (connections.providerid = 9) Which instead of singling out that 1 record with the specific msgreference and connectionid, it updates tons of records. Now the crazy part is: when using the visual query builder and I drag and drop the query, it results in the exact same query, but now visual studio doesn't mess with it and executes it and all is fine. If I copy and paste it again into a new querywindow, all is crippled again. Is there a workaround for this 'smart' query crippler? (Turn it off for instance?) Thanks! EDIT: p.s. this has been posted as a bug on Microsoft. Please start voting for it ;^) here is the link to microsoft
