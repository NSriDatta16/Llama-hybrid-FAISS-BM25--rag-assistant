Coefficients in a Logistic Regression with Multiple Predictors

i was wondering about the beta (predictor coefficients) in a logistic regression; i know when it's is with one variable, the $\beta$ (ie coefficient) is definitely a logodds ratio, so $e^{\beta_1}$ would be the odds ratio for that predictor, does this remain true for multiple variables with no interactions set? I am having trouble finding answers online and have been noticing that the logistic regression results in changes in the coefficient with addition of the predictors.
