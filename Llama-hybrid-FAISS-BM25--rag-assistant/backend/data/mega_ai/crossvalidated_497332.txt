Pearson Correlations between time and value in a time series

I have two series here mothly data: var1 = {'Month': 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12} var2 = {'Rain': 10,20,5,70,21,65,1,24,56,68} Is it possible to calculate pearson correlations between the two? and use that as m for filtering outliers e.g Mean(Rain) +- m x standard_dev(Rain) . Im new to stats and doing a forecasting problem where I dont want to detect outliers but model them. Please help
