owever, as of 2017, China often sources sensitive emerging technology such as drones and artificial intelligence from private start-up companies. An October 2021 report by the Center for Security and Emerging Technology found that "Most of the [Chinese military]'s AI equipment suppliers are not state-owned defense enterprises, but private Chinese tech companies founded after 2010." The report estimated that Chinese military spending on AI exceeded $1.6 billion each year. The Japan Times reported in 2018 that annual private Chinese investment in AI is under $7 billion per year. AI startups in China received nearly half of total global investment in AI startups in 2017; the Chinese filed for nearly five times as many AI patents as did Americans. China published a position paper in 2016 questioning the adequacy of existing international law to address the eventuality of fully autonomous weapons, becoming the first permanent member of the U. N. Security Council to broach the issue. In 2018, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping called for greater international cooperation in basic AI research. Chinese officials have expressed concern that AI such as drones could lead to accidental war, especially in the absence of international norms. In 2019, former United States Secretary of Defense Mark Esper lashed out at China for selling drones capable of taking life with no human oversight. The focus on "intelligentized AI warfare", pursued by China, suggests a comprehensive integration of AI across all domains (land, sea, air, space, and cyber) for autonomous attack, defence and cognitive warfare. The intelligentized strategy is distinct from traditional warfare, which focuses on network-centric operations, and instead sees AI as a force multiplier that enhances decision-making, command structures, and autonomous capabilities. Unlike traditional warfare, intelligentization leverages AI to create a cognitive advantageâ€”allowing it to process battlefield information better. AI-assisted command-and-control (C2) systems, predictive analytics, and real-time data fusion, enabling accelerated human-AI hybrid decision-making. Autonomous systems, including drone swarms, AI-powered cyber warfare, play a crucial role in this strategy. China is reported to be currently developing wingman drones, robotic ground forces, and optimised logistics to enhance combat effectiveness. The Chinese army (PLA)) also emphasises cognitive warfare using AI-driven psychological operations, social media manipulation, and predictive behavioural analysis to influence adversaries and the importance of dynamic responses where AI enhances hacking capabilities, automated SIGINT (Signals Intelligence) and adaptive tactics. However, despite this focus, some analysts believe China could be struggling to fully realise AI capability within the military environment: a "comprehensive review of dozens of Chinese-language journal articles about AI and warfare reveals that Chinese defense experts claim that Beijing is facing several technological challenges that may hinder its ability to capitalize on the advantages provided by military AI" India A task force for the Strategic Implementation of AI for National Security and Defence was established in February 2018 by the Ministry of Defense's Department of Defence Production. The process of getting the military ready for AI use was started by the MoD in 2019. The Centre for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics was approved to develop AI solutions to improve intelligence collection and analysis capabilities. In 2021, the Indian Army, with assistance from the National Security Council, began operating the Quantum Lab and Artificial Intelligence Center at the Military College of Telecommunication Engineering. With an emphasis on robotics and artificial intelligence, Defence Research and Development Organisation and Indian Institute of Science established the Joint Advanced Technology Programme-Center of Excellence. In 2022, the Indian Navy creat
