Yes, depending on the method. What you are describing above is part of how a Random Forest (a type of ensemble) works. Each tree in the forest is trained using only a subset of the features (see the mtry argument in R's randomForest package, for example). In a Random Forest, each decision tree is also trained on a subsample of the training set, which adds additional randomness, and contributes to added diversity among the base models (trees) in the ensemble. Using a subset of features for each constituent model of the ensemble can also be helpful in stacking .
