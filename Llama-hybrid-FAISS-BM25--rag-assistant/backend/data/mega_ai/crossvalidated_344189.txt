Posterior distribution and MCMC

I have read something like 6 articles on Markov Chain Monte carlo methods, there are a couple of basic points I can't seem to wrap my head around. How can you "draw samples from the posterior distribution" without first knowing the properties of said distribution? Again, how can you determine which parameter estimate "fits your data better" without first knowing your posterior distribution? If you already know the properties of your posterior distribution (as is indicated by 1) and 2)), then what's the point of using this method in the first place? This just seems like circular reasoning to me.
