If you are on Win32 my experience has been that it's hard to beat the regular Windows heap manager provided you enable Low Fragmentation Heap using the HeapSetInformation API. I believe this is now standard on newer versions of Windows. It handles locking using Interlocked* Win32 primitives rather than more simple Mutex/CritSec locking.
