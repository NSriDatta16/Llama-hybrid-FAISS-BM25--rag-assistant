Embedding assembly in C with compiler finding registers for you

When embedding assembly code into a C/C++ program, you can avoid clobbering registers by saving them with a push instruction (or specify clobber list of compiler supports it). If you are including assembly inline and want to avoid the overhead of pushing and popping clobbered registers, is there a way of letting gcc choose registers for you (e.g. ones it knows have no useful info in them).
