Django apps equivalent to Drupal's CCK and Views modules?

Are there any Django apps equivalent to Drupal's Views and CCK modules? I find Django much more flexible and logically organized than Drupal. But I think Drupal's Views and CCK modules are killer apps. They let the webmaster very rapidly to build new data models and queries through GUI without touching the code. These modules are very useful for rapid application development. Do you know any similar apps in Django?
