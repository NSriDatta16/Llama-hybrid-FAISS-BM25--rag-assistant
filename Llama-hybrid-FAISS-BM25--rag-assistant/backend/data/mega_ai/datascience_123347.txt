There are few strategies that you could use to avoid data leakage: Use Cross-validation: For the time series data, use TimeSeriesSplit from sklearn . Link . It will make sure that you are not peaking into the future data. Avoid future data: This kinda make sense. But I am adding it because sometimes we forget to remove those features that are actually based on future data. For e.g. if you're predicting sales for next week, make sure that features do not contain information about sales from next week. Feature selection: Be careful when creating derived features from your raw data. These can easily cause leakage. For instance, using an aggregate function (like mean or sum) over the entire dataset would leak information from the validation/test sets into the training set.
