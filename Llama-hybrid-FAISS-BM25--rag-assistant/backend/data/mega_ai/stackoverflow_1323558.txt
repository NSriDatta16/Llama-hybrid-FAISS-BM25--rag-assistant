Viewstate hidden field so big it makes everything crash

For some reason the viewstate of my application became gigantic (around 14 million characters). It adds around 1 minute of loading time. If the page finally loads (which is not often), the server crashes every time someone send a form because " Post size exceeded allowed limits. " It appeared suddenly. I didn't add any fields, just some javascript on the page. People told me to check viewstate chunking out. Google told me to do this: ... so now instead of a huge hidden field I now have something like 100 very large hidden fields. It's not exactly what I was looking for. Why would .NET do something like this? How can I fix this?
