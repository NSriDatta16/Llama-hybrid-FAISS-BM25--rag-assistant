The ideas behind REST are largely driven by the economics of data transfer, remoteness and architecture neutrality. It is expensive to access a remote resource; you want an architecture that encourages cacheability, addressability and minimalistic semantics. However, for in-process communications, sending data between subsystems within is extremely cheap, and usually amounts to passing a pointer, which satisfies or obviates all three goals. I admit I haven't thought deeply about this, so a return question might be in order: how would in-process HTTP make my life easier?
