How to get FFTW to work in Eclipse CDT on windows XP

I'm trying to get the Fastest Fourier Transform in the West to cooperate with eclipse. I downloaded it from the website (it's a big folder called fftw-3.2.2 filled with other folders with names api, dft, cell, doc, kernel, fdft and more, each filled with .h and .c files). I've tried going to project>Properties>MinGW C linker>Libraries>Library Search Path (-L) and adding the folder fftw-3.2.2. I try to put #include or #include at the top of my code. I can put in a line like 'fftw_plan p ;' and it's fine with it, but whenever I try to use one of the fourier transform functions, like 'fftw_execute(p);' , it gives me the message 'undefined reference to fftw_ececute'. the project refuses to build and run, and i'm stuck. I've looked around here and other places, and everything keeps telling me about libX.a files, but the fftw-3.2.2 doesn't contain any files with the .a extension. How can I get eclipse to work with fftw? I am running eclipse ganymede 3.4.1 on a windows xp machine with the mingw compiler.
