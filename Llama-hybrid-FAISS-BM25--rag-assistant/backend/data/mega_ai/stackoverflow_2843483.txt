After some more googling, i found this post. It seems that "the emulator does not save its state when you close it." Also: Saving State. To test compatibility with other .Net framework environments I just re-implemented some standard Isolated Storage example code for application settings in my Silverlight application. It just works. But note, the preview emulator doesn’t hold state beyond debug sessions – so you can only test state storage in your application session at the moment. from this post.
