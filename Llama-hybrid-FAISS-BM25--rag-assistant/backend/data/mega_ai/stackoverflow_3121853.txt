I wish I could give a definitive proposal, but I don't know enough about your environment. No matter what you'll likely be doing some sort of script kung fu. If it's unix/linux I would set everyone up with SSH authorized keys to poll each others' date +%s command (to get the epoch), average those times with awk or something, and then set the machine's own local date. Or perhaps it would be more secure (and reliable) to have one authoritative machine check everyone's time in the same manor, average it, and then provision itself and every other host to that average. On Windows you'll probably be looking into VBScript and WMI. EDIT: You may run into some weird problems if anyone's clock drifts forward from the average and my guess is about half of them will ;). Future timestamps can be rather strange. It will be up to you to determine how frequently this synchronization will need to occur.
