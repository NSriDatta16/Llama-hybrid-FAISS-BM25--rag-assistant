How does Shuffled-Complex-Evolution-Metropolis algorithm compare to other adaptive samplers (e.g. NUTS)?

I recently heard of the Shuffled-Complex-Evolution-Metropolis algorithm and am curious how it compares to other adaptive MCMC sampling algorithms. Unfortunately I am still learning about optimizing MCMC algorithms so I would appreciate any examples to help illustrate differences.
