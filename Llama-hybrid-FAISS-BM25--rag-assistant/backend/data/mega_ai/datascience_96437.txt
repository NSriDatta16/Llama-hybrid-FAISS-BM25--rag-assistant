I would try to train a neural network with some sort of self-supervised approach, where you take all of your images and you change them in some ways (mess with colors a bit, rotate, rescale, etc.) and the task of the network is to create embeddings for these two to be close together and far from all the other images. The network will probably have harder time to push away more similar images than dissimilar ones. One such self-supervised approach is SimCLR for example. Could worth a try.
