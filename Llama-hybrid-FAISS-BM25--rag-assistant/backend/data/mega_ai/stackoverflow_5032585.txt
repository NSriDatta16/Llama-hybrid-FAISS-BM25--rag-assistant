My bet is that there was a time in which the performance cost of a call to an external method or function WAS something to be concerned with, in the same way that the lengths of variable names and such all needed to be evaluated with respect to performance implications. With the monumental increases in processor speed and memory resources int he last two decades, I propose that these concerns are no longer as pertinent as they once were. We have been able use long variable names without concern for some time, and the cost of a call to external code is probably negligible in most cases. There might be exceptions. If you place a function call within a large loop, you may see some impact, depending upon the number of iterations. I propose that in most cases you will find that refactoring code into discrete function calls will have a negligible impact. There might be occasions in which there IS an impact. However, proper TESTING of a refactoring will reveal this. In those minority of cases, your friend might be correct. For most of the rest of the time, I propose that your friend is clining a little to closely to practices which pre-date most modern processors and storage media.
