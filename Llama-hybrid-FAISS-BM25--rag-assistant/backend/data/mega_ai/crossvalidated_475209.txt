In which scenarios is the exponential power distribution better than the t-student distibution?

I know there are some differences between these two distributions (exponential power distribution does have a cusp at the origin and t-student doesn't), but there are also similarities (heavy tails). I'm wondering for example when dealing with time series and when the normality assumption is violated, which distribution is a better option and why. The situation doesn't have to be strictly connected with time series analysis. I am curious to see other examples too.
