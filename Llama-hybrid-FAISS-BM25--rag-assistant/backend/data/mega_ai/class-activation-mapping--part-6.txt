lows to achieve higher resolution and more fine-grained detail, improving localization. Specifically, for each position in the feature map, LayerCAM evaluates the gradient. The positive gradients are employed as the weights, w k C {\displaystyle w_{k}^{C}} . Namely: w k C ( x , y ) = R e L U ( ∂ y C ∂ A k ( i , j ) ( x , y ) ) {\displaystyle w_{k}^{C}(x,y)=ReLU({\frac {\partial y^{C}}{\partial A_{k}(i,j)}}(x,y))} The activations are then weighted, and the final class activation map is retrieved by summing over the channels. L L a y e r − C A M C ( x , y ) = R e L U ( ∑ k w k C ( x , y ) A k ( x , y ) ) {\displaystyle L_{Layer-CAM}^{C}(x,y)=ReLU(\sum _{k}w_{k}^{C}(x,y)A_{k}(x,y))} This technique offers high-resolution heatmaps, flexible localization and per-location precision, employing positive gradients.
