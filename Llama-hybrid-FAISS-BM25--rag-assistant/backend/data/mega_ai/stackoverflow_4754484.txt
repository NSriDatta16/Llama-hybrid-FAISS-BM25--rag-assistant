You realize that you are doing single axis acceleration checks and you are not ensuring the acceleration is repeated (i.e. shake). In other words, if you drop your phone, your code will think it's someone shaking the device back-and-fourth few times (which is what a shake is) and fire many times a second. So, either apply multi-axis checks against time or simply use the shake UIEvent. All you will need to do is in your UIView (or UIWindow better yet), implement - (void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event making sure the view becomes first responder. This will take care of all acceleration filtering, etc. and app won't be bombarded by all the acceleration noise (you can drop your phone on the table and it won't mistake that for a shake). Go here for doc: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/EventHandling/Conceptual/EventHandlingiPhoneOS/MotionEvents/MotionEvents.html Or: - (BOOL)canBecomeFirstResponder { return YES; } // Now call [self becomeFirstResponder]; somewhere, say in viewDidAppear of the controller. - (void)motionBegan:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { } - (void)motionEnded:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { if (event.subtype == UIEventSubtypeMotionShake) { // You've got a shake, do something } } - (void)motionCancelled:(UIEventSubtype)motion withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { }
