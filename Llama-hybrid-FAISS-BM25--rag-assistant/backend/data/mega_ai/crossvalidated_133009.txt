Why is $E[u] = 0$ in OLS and what is the difference between the error and constant?

How is the constant term in a linear least squares regression different from the error term? Why does the error term have a normal distribution with mean "0" and sd $\sigma$? I mean I can see that the error term has a normal distribution since the values of the dependent variable are spread out unlike logistic regression but I couldn't understand why they must necessarily have a zero mean.
