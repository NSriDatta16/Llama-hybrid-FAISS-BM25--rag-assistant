Interpretation of FIT indices for cfa

I am running a confirmatory factor analysis on a very simple model. It is intended to confirm the structure of a brief rating scale for the evaluation of one social emotional domain. As usual, I split the sample (N = 307) in two parts (i.e., calibration and validation samples) and tested the same model (one-factor solution) on the two sub-samples separately and then re-tested it on the full sample. The fit indices looked very good for the calibration sample, but then when I re-ran the same analysis on the validation sample I obtained these (weird?) values. In particular, chi-square is highly nonsign., CFI is equal to 1, TLI greater than 1 (which I know it is mathematically possible but it never happened to me nor I have ever seen it in other publications), and the RMSEA is equal to zero. I also obtained similar values when I tested the model on the full sample. Am I missing anything? Or I can go ahead and write up the results of the manuscript? Are there other parts of the model I can check to make sure I am not running into some issues? Thanks to anyone who will take the time to help! lavaan 0.6-8 ended normally after 32 iterations Estimator ML Optimization method NLMINB Number of model parameters 8 Number of observations 152 Model Test User Model: Standard Robust Test Statistic 0.413 0.238 Degrees of freedom 2 2 P-value (Chi-square) 0.813 0.888 Scaling correction factor 1.739 Yuan-Bentler correction (Mplus variant) Model Test Baseline Model: Test statistic 229.862 106.486 Degrees of freedom 6 6 P-value 0.000 0.000 Scaling correction factor 2.159 User Model versus Baseline Model: Comparative Fit Index (CFI) 1.000 1.000 Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) 1.021 1.053 Robust Comparative Fit Index (CFI) 1.000 Robust Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) 1.042 Loglikelihood and Information Criteria: Loglikelihood user model (H0) -940.922 -940.922 Scaling correction factor 2.458 for the MLR correction Loglikelihood unrestricted model (H1) -940.716 -940.716 Scaling correction factor 2.314 for the MLR correction Akaike (AIC) 1897.845 1897.845 Bayesian (BIC) 1922.036 1922.036 Sample-size adjusted Bayesian (BIC) 1896.716 1896.716 Root Mean Square Error of Approximation: RMSEA 0.000 0.000 90 Percent confidence interval - lower 0.000 0.000 90 Percent confidence interval - upper 0.098 0.000 P-value RMSEA |z|) Std.lv Std.all F1 =~ Item33 1.000 0.599 0.450 Item35 2.275 0.622 3.658 0.000 1.362 0.943 Item36 1.841 0.481 3.829 0.000 1.102 0.675 Item37 1.473 0.346 4.261 0.000 0.882 0.778 Variances: Estimate Std.Err z-value P(>|z|) Std.lv Std.all .Item33 1.414 0.240 5.886 0.000 1.414 0.798 .Item35 0.231 0.204 1.131 0.258 0.231 0.111 .Item36 1.453 0.250 5.802 0.000 1.453 0.545 .Item37 0.506 0.138 3.665 0.000 0.506 0.394 F1 0.358 0.204 1.758 0.079 1.000 1.000
