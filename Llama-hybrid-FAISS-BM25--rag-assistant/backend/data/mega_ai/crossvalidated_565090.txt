Machine learning for causal inference

I have a multiclass classification problem where the target variable is actually different categories of causes, and the dataset is observational. I know of causal inference, and I would like to learn more about it, but if I do I would need to justify it. So: is it justified to believe that a causal approach would yield more accurate classification results than classical machine learning (ML)? EDIT FOR CLARIFICATION Causal methods should not be used simply because the target variable is called "cause". However, causes are a special kind of target variable, because different causes might not be fully independent due to confounding or mediation. Do such structural considerations affect classification accuracy enough that methods that model them would be more accurate?
