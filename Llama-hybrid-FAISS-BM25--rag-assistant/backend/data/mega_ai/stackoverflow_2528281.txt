Primitive data types correspond to a particular way data is stored in memory. For example, a double and an int are stored very differently in memory, and to upcast from a double to an int involves changing the strategy used to store that data (from a version that stores decimal information to a version that does not). Upcasting the wrapper classes is a different sort of upcasting. In that case, you are changing the type that the wrapper class is being treated as. To continue the example, the Integer and Double wrapper classes are subclasses of Number , which both wrappers can be upcast to. However, Double is not a subclass of Integer . Rather, they are siblings (that is, both extend Number ). Thus, you cannot upcast from Double to Integer .
