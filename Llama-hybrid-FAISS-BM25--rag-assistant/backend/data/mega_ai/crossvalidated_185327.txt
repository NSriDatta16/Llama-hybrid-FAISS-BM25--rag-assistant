Testing for classification significance

I have a two class problem at hand, 160 data samples which were classified with a linear support vector machine. The obtained classification accuracy (test accuracy) is 71% (this is the average over 70 folds). I want to calculate now the p-value for this result, i.e. the probability that this result is purely due to chance. However I have not found a clear (and for my level understandable) description of how to do that, and am not sure if I need more information about the dataset to be able to perform such a test. Any help appreciated
