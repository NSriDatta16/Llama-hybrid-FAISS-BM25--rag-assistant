WebRequest cannot get the request stream

I am trying to make a HttpWebRequest which registers accounts for me. I'm using a loop for it to register new accounts with only 1 thing changing, the username. But for some reason it only works twice, the third time it will reach a certain line calling the function "webRequest.GetRequestStream();" and it will never finish that, it will not throw an error or anything. This is my first HttpWebRequest, and it is very messy. For people wondering, value is a string with the registration 'values' in there. The first 2 times do actually register the accounts, so it does work. public static HttpWebRequest Get() { HttpWebRequest webRequest = WebRequest.Create("http://87.255.55.218/register") as HttpWebRequest; webRequest.Method = "POST"; webRequest.Host = "87.255.55.218"; webRequest.UserAgent = "Hacker"; webRequest.Accept = "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"; webRequest.Referer = "http://yougothacked.com"; webRequest.ContentType = "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"; webRequest.Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.KeepAlive, "115"); return webRequest; } public static void Register(string username) { string value = Value.Replace("replace", username); WebRequest webRequest = Get(); webRequest.ContentLength = value.Length; Thread.Sleep(50); Stream reqStream = webRequest.GetRequestStream(); reqStream.Write(Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes(value), 0, value.Length); Thread.Sleep(50); reqStream.Flush(); reqStream.Close(); reqStream.Dispose(); } What could be wrong?
