By default Razor will encode everything that it writes, not everything in the page. Since Razor things the text inside the P tags are HTML it will not do any encoding to it. Take a look at the following example for a better understanding of the difference: this is a test Paragraph for both Development & Production @{var body = "this is a test Paragraph for both Development & Production";} @body @{var body2 = new HtmlString("this is a test Paragraph for both Development & Production");} @body2 If you render this page you'll notice that the first paragraph does not get encoded, whereas the second paragraph will get encoded as it is encoding the output of a variable. Then the 3rd example will produce the same output as the first as it uses the special HtmlString which assumes that the input is safe. For reference, here is the output from Razor: this is a test Paragraph for both Development & Production this is a test Paragraph for both Development &amp; Production this is a test Paragraph for both Development & Production
