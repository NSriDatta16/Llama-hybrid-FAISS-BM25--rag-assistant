You should look into the "classwt" parameter. This doesn't seem to be what you are directly interested in, but it might give you a sense of what you want to do. See here: Stack Exchange question #1 And here: Stack Exchange question #2 Article on weighted random forests: PDF The basic idea is to weight classes such that rarely observed groups/classifications are more likely to be selected in your bootstrap samples. This is helpful for imbalanced data (when the prior probabilities of different classes are widely different). It seems to me that you want to do something similar, but for recent events (not for certain groups/classifications). A simple way to do this would be to create duplicate observations (i.e. put in repeated, identical rows) for more recent observations. However, this could potentially be inefficient. I do not know of a way to directly weight each observation in R, but I could be unaware of it. You could try looking around for alternative implementations, e.g. in C -- at worst, these could be customized with a bit of coding.
