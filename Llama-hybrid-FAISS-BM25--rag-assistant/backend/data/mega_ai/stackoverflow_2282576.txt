IE jQuery Opacity Anti-Aliasing Issue

I am using jQuery to fade in and out a .png images of links on the home page of http://www.logandwight.com In IE7 and IE8 the text have no anti-aliasing and are all boxy. I've tried messing with the opacity settings and then I tried animating the filter property specifically for IE but nothing seems to work. Does anyone know whats wrong?
