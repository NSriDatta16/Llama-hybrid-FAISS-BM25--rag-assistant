Is it not easiest to just select all fields needed from the table, based on the Field1 value and group on the values needed? So something like this: SELECT field1, field2,...field195 FROM Table1 WHERE field1 = 'A' or field1 = 'B' GROUP BY field1, field2, ....field195 This will give you all rows where field1 is A or B and there is a difference in one of the selected fields. Oh and for the group by statement as well as the SELECT part, indeed use the previously mentioned edit mode for the query. There you can add all fields (by selecting them in the table and dragging them down) that are needed in the result, then click the 'totals' button in the ribbon to add the group by- statements for all. Then you only have to add the Where-clause and you are done. Now that the question is more clear (you want the query to select fields instead of records based on the particular requirements), I'll have to change my answer to: This is not possible. (untill proven otherwise) ;) As far as I know, a query is used to select records using for example the where clause, never used to determine which fields should be shown depending on a certain criterium. One thing that MIGHT help in this case is to look at the database design. Are those tables correctly made? Suppose you have 190 of those fields that are merely details of the main data. You could separate this in another table, so you have a main table and details table. The details table could look something like: ID ID_Main Det_desc Det_value This way you can filter all Detail values that are equal between the two main values A and B using something like: Select a.det_desc, a.det_value, b.det_value (Select Det_desc, det_value from tblDetails where id_main = a) as A inner join (Select Det_desc, det_value from tblDetails where id_main = a) as B on A.det_desc = B.det_desc and A.det_value <> B.det_value This you can join with your main table again if needed.
