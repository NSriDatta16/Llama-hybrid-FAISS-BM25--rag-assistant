Windows Scheme/Lisp Implementation

With the thousands of implementations of LISP and Scheme available I'm having a very hard time finding just the right one to use for Windows development. I learned these languages in school and found them to be very elegant, however, I don't seem to be able to find an implementation that would be suitable for developing code other than in an academic setting. What is a Scheme or LISP implementation with the following requirements? Compiles to native code, rather than compiling to C. Supports multithreading on multiple processors (ie. multiple threads can run simultaneously). Produces 64-bit code. Can be used in Windows without requiring Cygwin.
