I have a table (this cannot be changed) like the following: POST_ID | PARENT_ID | POST_NAME 1 | 0 | Services 4 | 1 | Development 5 | 4 | Magento 2 | 0 | Contact The field, 'parent_id' references post_id to form a self-referential foreign key. Is it possible to write a single query to connect a post and it's parents based on the post_id? For example, if I had the post_id 5 (Magento), could I write a query to produce the following results: 5 | Magento 4 | Development 1 | Services I know this is quite easy to do with multiple queries, however, wish to know whether it is possible with a single query. Thanks :)
