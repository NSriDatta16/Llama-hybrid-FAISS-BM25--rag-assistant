I'd recommend looking at the Microsoft certification docs/books, or just getting a good, general purpose book on C# programming. The books might intimidating to get through, but I think it's worth the time - they'll give you a more broad coverage of all the material, whereas the quiz sites will only give you a selected few things, and might miss something that another quiz covers. I've read books from these publishers, and they all seem to be pretty good: O'Reilly (animal pics on the covers), Apress (black and yellow covers), Manning (books with strange paintings on the covers).
