I feel that banning hypothesis tests is a great idea except for a select few "existence" hypotheses, e.g. testing the null hypothesis that there is not extra-sensory perception where all one would need to demonstrate to have evidence that ESP exists is non-randomness. But I think the journal missed the point that the main driver of poor research in psychology is the use of a threshold on $P$-values. It has been demonstrated in psychology and most other fields that a good deal of gaming goes on to arrive at $P The banning of confidence intervals is also overboard, but not for the reasons others have stated. Confidence intervals are useful only if one misinterprets them as Bayesian credible intervals (for suitable non-information priors). But they are still useful. The fact that their exact frequentist interpretation leads to nothing but confusion implies that we need to "get out of Dodge" and go Bayesian or likelihood school. But useful results can be obtained by misinterpreting good old confidence limits. It is a shame that the editors of the journal misunderstood Bayesian statistics and don't know of the existence of pure likelihood inference. What they are seeking can be easily provided by Bayesian posterior distributions using slightly skeptical priors.
