i just want to tell about my own experience in programming, I'm still newbie though first by using framework you'll get used to their coding style/rule, which is good because most of the framework are deeply thought about how they write their code. in short i get better style and cleaner code Usually framework come with many arsenal (plugins and or library), which you can find in internet, this will reduce your coding time, cut wasted time. In short you can make your own precious time thinking on business process with using open source framework, there's other programmer who already know and probably mastered the framework, then you can easily collaborate with others. in truth i'm not a well organized programmer, but it was before i 'm using some open source framework. perhaps like me you'll get more organized That's all I can share with you for now, i'm not good with writing in english, sorry for that. but the point is i recommend you to use framework Happy coding friend.
