can I use all the predictors (contrast coded as -0.5, 0.5 (except for Education, which is 1, 1, -2 & 1, -1, 0)) in my glmer formula, even though Age is numeric? Yes, there are no particular concerns when including different types of variables in a glmm. From this point of view there is no difference to other types of regression model. I assume my formula would be as follows: > glmer.model=glmer(Correct ~ Familiarity + Age + Gender + Education + Student + (1|PP) + (1|ID), family = "binomial", DemoScore) This model seems to make sense. If all participants saw all questions then you have a crossed design and (1|PP) + (1|ID) is the right way to specify the random structure. Should I also be factoring the Familiarity variable (and therefore contrast code) or convert it into 0 and 1? It's not completely clear what you mean. From your data listed in the question Familiarity seems to be a factor with Yes and No levels. This will be treated the same as if you recode it to 0/1. I initially thought summing the Correct scores for each PP would make more sense, but this does not as Familiarity is for question-by-question. That's correct. Summing or averaging the scores would lose important informaton.
