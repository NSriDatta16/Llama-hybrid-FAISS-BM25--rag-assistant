Custom UITableViewCell with Subtitle style

I used this guide: http://www.bdunagan.com/2009/06/28/custom-uitableviewcell-from-a-xib-in-interface-builder to be able to create my own custom UITableViewCell with a nice background image in interface builder. But I would like the style of the cell to be UITableViewCellStyleSubtitle to still be able to use textLabel and detailTextLabel for my custom cell. Can I in some way set the style of the cell in interface builder? Now only the textLabel is set when using: cell.textLabel.text = @"Title"; cell.detailTextLabel.text = @"Details"; Also I use a transparent image as background, but textLabel has white background. Can I change this in interface builder? Or do you think I should just add my own labels to the custom cell in interface builder and skip the standard textLabel and detailTextLabel? Thanks for your help!
