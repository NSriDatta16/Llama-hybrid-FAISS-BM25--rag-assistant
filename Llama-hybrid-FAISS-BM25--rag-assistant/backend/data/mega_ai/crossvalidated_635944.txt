At present I'll begin by outlining how to do it for the numerator which will at least give you some sense of what's involved, and then I'll see about doing the denominator. Let $Y$ be a random variable distributed as an $\varepsilon$ -contaminated Gaussian (mixture of Gaussians with common center). As in the question, we'll take the contaminating part having $9$ times the variance of the main distribution. That is, $f_Y(y)=(1-\varepsilon)f_X(x)+\varepsilon f_W(w)$ with $X\sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ and $W\sim N(\mu,9\sigma^2)$ . Of course the estimators we're comparing will be based on $n$ such (i.i.d.) random variables, $Y_i, i=1, 2, ..., n$ , but for the moment we just need to worry about the distribution of one of them. Note that $\frac{\text{Var}(s_n)}{E(s_n)^2}=\frac{E(s_n^2)}{E(s_n)^2}-1$ . Similarly for $d_n$ . Presumably this will be where the "-1" terms in the numerator and denominator come from. Now the usual sample variance is unbiased for population variance, irrespective of distribution (assuming the distribution has finite variance). So $E(s_n^2)=\frac{n-1}{n}E(s_{n-1}^2)=\frac{n-1}{n}\text{Var}(Y)$ The expectation, expectation of the square and the variance of a mixture is straightforward, especially when they have a common mean. I think we get $\text{Var}(Y)=(1-\varepsilon)(\sigma^2+\mu^2)+\varepsilon (9\sigma^2+\mu^2)-\mu^2 = \sigma^2(1+8\varepsilon)$ . So $E(s_n^2) = \frac{n-1}{n}\sigma^2(1+8\varepsilon)$ . For the expectation, by writing the integral, we get a weighted average of the two component distribution expectations, each of which comes down to an expectation of a scaled chi-distribution . That is (if I didn't make an error) $E(s_n)= \sigma\sqrt{\frac{n-1}{n}}\sqrt{2}\sqrt{n-1}\frac{\ \Gamma( \tfrac{n + 1}{2} )\ }{\Gamma( \tfrac{n}{2})}[(1-\varepsilon)+3\varepsilon]$ . So $E(s_n)^2=(1+2\varepsilon)^2 \sigma^2 \frac{2(n-1)^2}{n}\left(\frac{\ \Gamma( \tfrac{n + 1}{2} )\ }{\Gamma( \tfrac{n}{2})}\right)^2$ There's a $(1+2\varepsilon)^2$ in the denominator of the image in the question, which is perhaps encouraging, and of course the result is asymptotic presumably the combined $n$ -terms that don't just cancel with another one will go to $1$ . I'll try to come back and have a go at the ratio for the $d_n$ terms later and see whether it's all correct.
