What is the difference between TextGAN and LM for text generation?

I'm new to LeakGAN or SeqGAN or TextGAN. I know GAN is to generate text and let discriminator un-judge-able to real text and gen-text. LM(language model) is the task of predicting the next word and can also be used to generate text.
