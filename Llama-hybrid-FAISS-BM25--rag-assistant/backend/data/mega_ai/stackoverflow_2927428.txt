Superfish and Flash again. Please help

I know there's a lot about this issue but i'm embedding flash like this: (i don't know how t escape code so sorry if it looks weird) var flashvars = {} var params = { base: "." } var attributes = {} swfobject.embedSWF("http://www.zakochaniwfotografii.pl/html5/slideshow/ceremonia.swf", "flashcontent", "932", "450", "9.0.0", false, flashvars, params, attributes); and the flash appears in here div class="imageHolder" id="flashcontent" /div You can see all of it here: http://www.zakochaniwfotografii.pl/html5/fotografia-weselna.php I'm trying to setup my website but only Firefox displays this well. I solved the issue on my index page zakochaniwfotografii.pl/html5/ but here i am embeding flash differently due to a different gallery, so i cannot do it the same on the underpages. I'd appreciate your help, Thank you.
