In Magento, the way to find out what template or block to edit is to 'enable template hints'. This puts boxes around each block on a page, and notes what block and what template generate it. You can enable template hints from the admin under System->Configuration->Developer->Debug. Note that you'll have to choose a website scope on the upper left. The option isn't available in the default scope. One more note that may be helpful - If your site is live already, or other people are using it, there's an option there to limit the template hints to only your IP.
