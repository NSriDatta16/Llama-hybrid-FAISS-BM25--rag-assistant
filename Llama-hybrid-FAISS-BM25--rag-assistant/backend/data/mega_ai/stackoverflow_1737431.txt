3 notifications instead of one

I'm developing simple MVC app in Cocoa/Objective-C. I have a strange issue (or misunderstanding) with notifications and KVO. I have AppController object in MainMenu.xib, hence I implement awakeFromNib method where I register for NSImageView changing its image property. I add self as an observer in the following way: // options:3 equals to new/old passed values in changeDictionary [backgroundImageView addObserver:self forKeyPath:@"image" options:3 context:NULL]; The backgroundImageView is an IBOutlet in AppController connected to NSImageView . In standard observeValueForKeyPath:ofObject:change:context method I just log the received notification. Problem is - when i change the image value of NSImageView I get 3 notifications instead of one. Can you help me with this? Maybe I'm overlooking something in options or in generally registering observer? UPDATE : backgroundImageView is the instance of BackgroundImageView class which is sublcass of NSImageView . I subclassed the latter one for handling drag and drop operations as drag destination. When performDragOperation: is called (the last 'state' of the dragging) it changes the value for image property with setImage between willChangeValueForKey and didChangeValueForKey .
