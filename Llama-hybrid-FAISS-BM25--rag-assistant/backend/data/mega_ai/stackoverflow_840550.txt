The SQL 2003 standard defines a way to do it - not all DBMS implement it, though: ::= VALUES ::= [ { }... ] ::= | ::= | And, after wading through much other BNF, you can find: ::= | ROW | ::= [ { }... ] ::= Which, when translated, means that in some contexts, you can use: VALUES (v1a, v1b, v1c), (v2a, v2b, v2c) to create a table value with two rows and three columns in each row. The INSERT statement is one place you can use the construct. Another is in the FROM clause of a SELECT statement, though showing enough BNF to connect the dots would take more space than SO encourages for an answer.
