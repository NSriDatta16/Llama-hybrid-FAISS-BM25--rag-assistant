Testing if a day of data is an outlier

I have a time series which exhibits a relatively similar behavior from one day to another. I want to know if a specific day of the time series is an outlier in the sense that it significantly differs from a usual day of the time series. I am new to statistical analysis, however I have the impression that this problem can be phrased as a hypothesis testing problem, where the null hypothesis is that this day of data has been generated from a similar model as a usual day of the time series. From the questions on Cross Validated on seemingly related topics like this one: Testing for statistically significant difference in time series? or that one: Hypothesis testing and significance for time series an explicit model for a usual day seems necessary, is that true? If yes, and supposing that I build a good enough model, what would be an appropriate way to test this hypothesis? Are there other ways to tackle this problem? Thanks for your help.
