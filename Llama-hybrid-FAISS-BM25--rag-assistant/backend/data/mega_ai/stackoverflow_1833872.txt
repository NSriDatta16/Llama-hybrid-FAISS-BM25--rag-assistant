The original Windows API was designed in the 1984-85 time frame, over 25 years ago. Hungarian Notation was all the rage, so putting the type of a variable into the declaration was the thing to do. For example, in pure C, there is no way to indicate a 'far' pointer, which is what the LP in LPCSTR indicates, but in 1985, it was very important to distinguish between regular pointers and far pointers. (That importance went by the wayside when 32-bit windows took over in the mid-90s, but the syntax persists...) Also, C doesn't really distinguish between just a pointer to a char and a pointer to a static string. Thus the lpsz types. In the end, it's about bringing a stronger, consistent typing to the parameters than plain C allowed in 1984. As for the WinMain, it's because a Windows program is pretty fundamentally different from a command line program. If you look in the library, you'd probably find a main() function that sets up the parameters and then calls into an extern WinMain function (i.e. yours).
