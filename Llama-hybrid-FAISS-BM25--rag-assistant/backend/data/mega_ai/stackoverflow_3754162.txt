iphone: coding a data compression or zipping agent?

I'm creating a simple service for uploading photographs from an iphone to a web server. However, before the requests is sent, I want the app to compress the pictures (custom format or otherwise) in the background before sending it. Any pointers on how I could go about doing this?
