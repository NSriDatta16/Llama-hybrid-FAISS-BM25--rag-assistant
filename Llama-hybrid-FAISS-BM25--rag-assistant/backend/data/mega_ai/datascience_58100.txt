From your question, I'm not sure what your motivation is, but if you just want to find out which visual features are the most representative for a given class label on a dataset of objects captured from different viewing angles, I would suggest the following approach: For the training process, use pictures from all different angles, shuffle them, and train your CNN. Then, take the test dataset and measure the accuracy as an overall benchmark. In a second step, divide your data according to the viewing angle and measure the accuracy of the previously trained model on each viewing angle. Now, take the angle on which you got the highest accuracy and choose a few images that have been classified correctly. Analyse those images with saliency maps . Subsequently, take a few misclassified images from the angle with the lowest accuracy as well and analyse them in the same way. From the saliency maps, you will get a deeper understanding which visual features cause your trained CNN to predict a certain label.
