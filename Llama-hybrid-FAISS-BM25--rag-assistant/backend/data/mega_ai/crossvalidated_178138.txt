Wald's SPRT (sequential probability ratio test) was not originally formulated as a two group comparison test: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_probability_ratio_test The "bible" for sequential analysis is probably last year's book Sequential Analysis: Hypothesis Testing and Changepoint Detection by Alexander Tartakovsky. It is magisterial and seemingly exhaustive in its coverage of the topic. http://www.amazon.com/Sequential-Analysis-Hypothesis-Changepoint-Probability-ebook/dp/B00MMOIWTS/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1445511005&sr=8-1&keywords=sequential+analysis+tartakovsky That said, last June Columbia sponsored The Fifth International Workshop in Sequential Methodologies which brought together the latest and greatest practitioners in the field. Tartakovsky was on the organizing committee. https://sites.google.com/site/iwsm2015/home See the "Detailed Program" link on the conference website for abstracts and papers. There's probably something there targeted specifically to your question.
