You could project this gigantic domain object into smaller objects containing only the subsets of properties needed and name them according to the scenario they are describing. It's creating some sort of ViewModel if you will. There has to be a specific use case for each case of A = "X" or B = "Y" etc. If you are splitting things up you can define validation rules per ViewModel. Those ViewModels could also contain the visible/hidden settings for your controls.
