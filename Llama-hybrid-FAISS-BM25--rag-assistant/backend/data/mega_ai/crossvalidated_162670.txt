Train neural network for forecasting

I am trying to use time series neural network to predict future values. I have time series data from 2010-2014 and I need to predict the values from 2015-2020 using time series neural network. I am using encog library in java . I read the workbench time-series example, but I am a little confused. I think I should have both the training and evaluation datasets to use the neural network, but in my case I don't have the evaluation dataset because these values will occur in the future. How I can do this?
