Writing process $\zeta_t =\epsilon_t + \eta_t - \phi\eta_{t-1}$ as a moving average, MA(1)

Let $X_t = \phi X_{t-1} + \epsilon_t$, $Y_t = X_t+\eta_t$ where $\{X_t\}$ is unobserved, $\{Y_t\}$ is observed and $\{\epsilon_t\}$ and $\{\eta_t\}$ are white noise sequences, then $X_t$ is an AR(1), we can write $\zeta_t = Y_t - \phi Y_{t-1} = X_t+\eta_t - \phi (X_{t-1}+\eta_{t-1}) = \epsilon_t + \eta_t - \phi\eta_{t-1}$ It then says $\zeta_t$ is stationary and cov$(\zeta_t,\zeta_{t+k})=0$ for $k\geq 2$. Up to this point, I am following. It then says: $$\zeta_t \text{ can be modelled as MA(1) process}$$ I do not follow this part the conclusion. Specifically, if $\epsilon_t$ is not present, that is a MA(1) but it appears to me that $\epsilon_t$ destroys this property. See the bottom of page 5 of http://www.statslab.cam.ac.uk/~rrw1/timeseries/t.pdf (or page 9 of the pdf doc)
