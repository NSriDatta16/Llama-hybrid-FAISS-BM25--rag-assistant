What is the best hosting solution for a classified site using Wordpress

I am creating a website for classified using Wordpress. I was looking at hosting possibilities. I am a little worried about my choice, as with any classified website the big issue is with Storage of images and videos. Mainly, all sites are offering capped storage around 50Gb-100Gb. How do you usually go about this kind of situation, where you know the storage requirement will be more than 50Gb at a certain level of time? Do you just start and then when the day comes you move out? Should delete expired posts? Any insights will be more than welcome! Yous
