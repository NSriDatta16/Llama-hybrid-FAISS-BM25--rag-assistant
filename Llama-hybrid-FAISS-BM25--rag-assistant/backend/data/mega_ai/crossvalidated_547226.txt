Q-value Iteration Convergence in Reinforcement Learning

I just started learning value iteration in reinforcement learning and I am confused about the theorem indicating that the iterations to have an error of at most $\epsilon$ grows with $λ$ is: $$N = \frac{\log \left(\frac{2R_{max}}{\epsilon(1-λ)}\right)}{\log \left(\frac{1}{λ}\right)}$$ Where for the reward, $|r|\le R_{max}$ . How is this number of iteration $N$ derived?
