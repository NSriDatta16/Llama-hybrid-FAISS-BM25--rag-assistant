Most likely, there is nothing wrong with your code or your data. What is happening is that your neural network is starting to act like a so-called "naive predictor" (look it up), meaning that since the NN cannot resolve the problem (cannot resolve any pattern in the input data), the best answer is the previous value. There are a number of techniques to try to solve this (using deltas, etc.) but I have yet to see one work (which does not mean it won't work; just that I haven't seen pre-processing the input data solve the problem). Just my 2 cents...
