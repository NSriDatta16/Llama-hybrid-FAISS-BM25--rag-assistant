Car Driving Behavior: using non-instant transition with a Markov Transition Matrix

I have a dataset on driving behavior/trips (workable example below), with information on the departure location, arrival location, duration of the trip and length of the trip. The states of the location are: work, home and other. I want to model driving patterns of cars similar to a study mentioned below (but then with the inclusion of an extra non-instant transition) in R. I want to use a non-homogeneous markov model where the likelihood of transition into another state depends on the current state and the time of day. From the dataset I have already developed a 15-minute interval markov transition matrix. However, I want to include a drive state (in between the work/home/other states) and a parking state (which is the work/home/other). With the drive time as a non-instant transition to make the behavior of cars more realistic. In this driving state there is a distance and duration for every combination between departure and arrival location. Unfortunately, my experience with markov models is a bit rusty. Example code of the dataset states I am working in R, and ultimately I want to do a markov chain monte carlo simulation to simulate traveling and parking patterns. How would I be able to include (and code) this non-instant transition? In a way that I would also have the travel time and length per possible transition (e.g. work-home)?
