Customize HTML Output of Django ModelForm

I am trying to add multiple inline form items to a page using Djangos ModelForms. I need Select boxes bound to database models. The forms are formatted and placed in a tabular format so I need to display only the ModelForm without ANY surrounding HTML. class LeagueForm(ModelForm): league = forms.ModelChoiceField(queryset=League.objects.all(), empty_label='Manual Team Entry:', required=False) class Meta: model = League exclude = ['league_name'] Template: {% if selected_sport == 1 %} {{ nhl_form.as_p }} {% else %} The problem is I dont want the paragraph tags, nor tables tags or anything at all. I need to have the form nicely sit where I place it without garbling up the surrounding html. Can anyone please point me in the right direction? Thanks
