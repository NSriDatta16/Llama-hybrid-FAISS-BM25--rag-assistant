There are more options than just the two you mention. There are: Adjacency List (the "parent_id" one almost everyone uses) Nested Sets Path Enumeration Closure Table (aka Adjacency Relation) See my answer to " What is the most efficient/elegant way to parse a flat table into a tree? " Or a couple of books: " Trees and Hierarchies in SQL for Smarties " by Joe Celko. " SQL Design Patterns " by Vadim Tropashko.
