, cosplay, fan fiction, anime-influenced music videos, Internet memes, and pornography featuring Overwatch characters and elements. Prior to Overwatch 2's release, fans raised concerns over the sequel's transition toward a 5v5 dynamic. Also predating its release, the sequel attracted both critic and player concerns about whether it would feel like a true sequel with considerable differences from its predecessor. Visuals from the sequel's technical beta were criticized for being too similar to the original game's. A perceived lack of attention toward support players was also noted during the game's beta. In response, Blizzard made efforts to make the support role more enticing to play. Shortly following the sequel's beta period and just weeks prior to the game launching into early access, Kiriko was introduced to the game's playable roster as the first support hero announced in over three years. While the original game was positively received, elements of its related media garnered some criticism. Writing for Polygon in 2022, Cass Marshall wrote that "Overwatch's lore has been in stasis for so long, and its fandom has been so willing to make a meal out of the crumbs sprinkled out over the years, that I feel like the fans' version of the cast is more concrete than the actual canon." Natalie Clayton, writing for PC Gamer similarly opined that "Overwatch has only felt more stagnant as the years go on," as a result of the series' narrative being "almost uniformly backstories, developments happening safely in the past." Clayton added that "relationships never developed or changed. Characters never grew, and the state of the world-at-large was left a static unknown." Marshall cited this lack of significant progression in Overwatch lore, as well as Blizzard's inconsistent updates to it, particularly from 2018 to 2022, as a factor behind the game's declined in popularity. Valorant, Rainbow Six Siege, and Apex Legends were all cited as gaining favor among existing Overwatch players. Developments in Overwatch media also affected in-game player patterns; after Soldier: 76 was canonically revealed to be gay in a comic, his pick rate among players dropped dramatically. However, the pick rate returned to previous levels after around three months. Overwatch 2 was met with positive reception from critics, albeit less so than its predecessor; the game's PC version holds a 79/100 metascore on review aggregator Metacritic. All versions indicate "generally favorable reviews. Some reviewers reaffirmed the game's questionable status as a true sequel, likening the game to more of a remix or update. Players had a more lukewarm reception to the sequel upon its launch, with criticism aimed at its battle pass feature and its formerly-required "SMS Protect" system. Changes made to online character bios following the launch of Overwatch 2 received criticism from fans. On August 10, 2023, Overwatch 2 was released on Steam, garnering an "overwhelmingly negative" rating on Valve's platform which is the lowest rating any video game can get. IGN's Wesley Yin-Poole affirmed that "most of the negative reviews focus on one thing: monetization", detailing that Blizzard received considerable criticism from Overwatch's player base when Overwatch 2 launched in late 2022, due to it auto-updating its predecessor into a free-to-play sequel and "rendering the original Overwatch unplayable". Yin-Poole added that "the backlash revolves around Overwatch 2's free-to-play nature, with heroes in the battle pass, the battle pass itself, and Blizzard's new approach to cosmetics all highlighted as negative changes from the original Overwatch". Scholarship on Overwatch fandom has highlighted the wide range of corporate responses to fan-created content, noting that Blizzard has alternated between supportive and restrictive policies.
