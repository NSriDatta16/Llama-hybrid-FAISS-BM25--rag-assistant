test the features that you require: some features may reside in one class some may reside in the other class some may require both classes from your description it looks like you get to define the features, so you can pretty much justify testing anything you like ;-) if you're looking for minimal TDD efficiency, test only the current feature, and move on . Code coverage is not relevant for TDD; that is a unit-testing metric (of questionable value) [let the downvoting begin! ;-)]
