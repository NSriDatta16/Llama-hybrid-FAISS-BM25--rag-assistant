Reconstruct Markov chain based on the sample paths

Given a sample of small finite sequences of transitions between the states of a Markov chain with unknown probabilities how to find the probabilities of transitions between states? Would computing the naive probabilities be a right (best) method? By the naive method I mean to compute the fraction of transitions that went from a given state to one of the possible states?
