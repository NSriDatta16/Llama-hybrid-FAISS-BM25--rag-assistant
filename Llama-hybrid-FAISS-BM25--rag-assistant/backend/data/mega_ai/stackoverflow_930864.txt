I have found this to be more true of methods than of classes - but I think it's because I'm just not doing it enough: keep it short enough, and questions like these disappear. So, for methods - there have long been questions about whether to initialize all the variables at the top, or to initialize them near where they're used (the answer is near where they're used, fwiw) - but if you keep your methods short enough, it just doesn't matter. Near where they're used is at the top. Same goes, at least in theory, for classes: keep them short enough, and the internal organization just doesn't matter (limiting and impossible case: just one method per class; it's automatically in whatever order you declare). If your classes have so many methods that you're wondering how to organize - think about extracting some methods that belong together into their own class. Smaller is better.
