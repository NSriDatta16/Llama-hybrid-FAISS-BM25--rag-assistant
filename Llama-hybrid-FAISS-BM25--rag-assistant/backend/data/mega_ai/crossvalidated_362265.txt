Confused about maximum a posteriori estimation

I am new to Bayesian statistics, and I just came across MAP. When our prior is a continuous distribution (pdf) on $\theta$ how can we calculate $g(\theta)$ in the numerator? Edit: I assumed $g(\theta)$ is probability but found that $g(\theta)$ in the numerator is actually density.
