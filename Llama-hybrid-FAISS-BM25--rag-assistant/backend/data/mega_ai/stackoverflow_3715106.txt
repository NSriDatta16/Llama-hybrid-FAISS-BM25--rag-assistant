Not unless your the one writing the the code for the data abstraction layer. That's the whole point of it. Any layer above it doesn't need to know what the database type or structure is, or even if there is one. It is a common mistake to start dragging database specific stuff back across the data layer into the business logic. The acid test is that if you changed your database say from SQL to Oracle or MySQL would the rest of the code still work. If not then your data layer isn't doing its stuff correctly.
