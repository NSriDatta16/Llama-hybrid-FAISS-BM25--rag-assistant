If you want to spare bandwidth, you need the client to do the actual transfer to your other host instead. To achieve this, you need to tell your client browser to change the url to load. This can only be done via redirect or similar mechanism afaik. The mod_proxy option will make the data loaded by your server and then dispatched to your client, ending in twice bandwidth use compared to local storage (where you only send to the client). What is the issue with redirection to the image only ?
