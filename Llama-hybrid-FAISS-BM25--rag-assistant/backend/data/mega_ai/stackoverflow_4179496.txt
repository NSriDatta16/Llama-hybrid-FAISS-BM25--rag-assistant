You mean you just want to smooth the edges of an existing bitmapped font? This is easy if your original font is 16x32 and you want to render it at 8x16 or something like that, but if you don't have a higher-resolution bitmap to begin with, smoothing is a highly nontrivial operation involving a lot of guesswork. In that case, I would lookup the 2xsai algorithm (which gives visually-pleasing results for this kind of thing) and first perform it to upscale the font to double resolution, then scale it back down with a area-averaging algorithm (i.e. take each destination pixel from the average of a 4-pixel square). I would also recommend saving your final "anti-aliased" bitmap font and simply using it in your program, rather than performing all this work at runtime.
