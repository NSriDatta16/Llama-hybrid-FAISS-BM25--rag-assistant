How can I extract the residual array from the Scikit Learn PCA routine?

The Nipals PCA algorithm calculates the scores and loadings of a data array iteratively. If only (say) 3 scores and loadings are calculated from a data array with more than 3 variables, there is a residual matrix created (called E). How can I extract this matrix from the SciKit Learn PCA algorithm so that I can create contribution charts?
