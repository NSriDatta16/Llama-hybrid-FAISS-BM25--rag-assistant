Easy way to scroll overflow text on a button?

Does anyone have any examples or resources where i might find information on scrolling text which is too long to display in a button control? I'm thinking something along these lines. Display as much text will fit within the current rect with a '...' at the end to signify overflow. Pause for say 1 second then slowly scroll the text to the right edge displaying the right part of the string. Display as much text will fit within the current rect with a '...' at the beginning to signify overflow. Start the whole thing over in reverse. Is there an easy way to do this using the "core" or built in "animation" frameworks on a certain mobile device? [edit] Iwanted to add some more details as i think people are more focused on wether or not what i'm trying to accomplish is appropriate. The button is for the answers on a trivia game. It does not perform any speciffic UI function but is for displaying the answer. Apple themselves is doing this in their iQuiz trivia game on the iPod Nano and i think its a pretty elegant solution to answers that are longer than the width of my button. In case its the '...' that is the difficult part of this. Lets say i removed this requirement. Could i have the label for the button be full sized but clipped to the client rect of the button and use some animation methods to scroll it within the clipping rect? This would give me almost the same effect minus the ellipses.
