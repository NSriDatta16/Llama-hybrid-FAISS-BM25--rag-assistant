Missing features for classification

I dont have a collection of data which I try and extract features from. I have a set of real world experiments from which features are retreived. If the tests are sparse and I received missing data - can anyone point me to procedures to deal with sparse but pertinent features? I do not care to deal with procedures that add "default" data etc - these types do not relate to real world experiments (in my context). The purpose of feature selection here is like all other classification problems - I need aspects to distinguish the classes/categories apart. Imputation is not a possibility here as the data I get from real world experiments are just that - real - they come from living individual organisms, so imputing them does not make sense. I need the real data from the real individual. Thanks
