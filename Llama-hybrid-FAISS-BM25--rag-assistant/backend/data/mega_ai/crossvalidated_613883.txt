It could certainly have been written more clearly though the distinction you need to make here should already be clear in your mind by the time you're tackling this sort of question, or you're sure to get very muddled. They mean that the population standard deviation ( $\sigma$ ) is unknown. It can of course be estimated from the data, e.g. by a sample standard deviation, ( $s$ ) $-$ note the change of symbol, this change marks the distinction between the parameter and the estimate [1]. However if you're correctly reproducing the question and answer, it does muddle this important distinction itself at one point, which is bordering on the egregious in something that's supposed to be clarifying what's going on. Such slapdash writing in a detailed solution is not okay. The noise in such an estimate has an effect on the behavior of the statistic you'd use if you had the population standard deviation so the distinction matters. This will be explained in detail in a reasonable textbook. $[$ Feel free to skip this parenthetic digression . I think a better answer would be along the lines of ' we don't actually know for certain whether a t confidence interval is appropriate, because there's insufficient information to judge whether the $90\%$ coverage could be attained sufficiently closely in these circumstances. If we assume that we did have such information, we would compute as follows [...] '. They clearly intend that the $n=25$ should be dispositive, but it is not, since the behavior of the interval could, for example, be impacted by substantial skewness in the population of scores -- imagine a test with mostly very easy questions but one or two very hard ones that were beyond almost every student; most students will score just below some very high score (like, oh, some value in the mid-80s , say, representing near to $100\%$ on the very easy questions), but there could be a pretty long tail to the left and a very short one on the right. In that case, $n=25$ (or indeed even substantially more) might not be quite sufficient for our specific purposes, on which we have been given no detail. It's an assumption we're making $-$ likely reasonable, but an assumption nonetheless $-$ that something like this is not the case. If we wanted a one-sided interval such considerations become much more important, because the error in the other tail won't be there to help 'balance out' the error in the tail we use in a one-sided interval. It's less of an issue with a two-sided interval, but the potential problem remains. As a check, I was able to simulate plausible looking scores, with mean and standard deviation like those in the question, where in samples of size $25$ the coverage of " $90\%$ " intervals was around $80\%$ ; lower coverage values would have been quite simple to obtain. $]$ [1]: conventionally, Greek letters are used for population parameters, Latin letters (normally lower case) for estimates.
