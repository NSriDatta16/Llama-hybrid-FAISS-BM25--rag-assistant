Presetting of the filter is nothing more as setting pf postData jqGrid parameter. See the old demo (see the answer ). If one set search:true the filter will apply (see here and here ). Depend on how you organize you pages it can be very simple to preset the filter property of the postData . You can for example include on the corresponding server generated page the inline which define a global variable with the filter and use it in the grid definition. The filter you can set user depended. I suggested Tony (see here ) to include more support for predefined filters. In my vision if would be nice to predefine some probably complex filters and allow the user choose the filter by name. The way seems me especially good for the corporate clients.
