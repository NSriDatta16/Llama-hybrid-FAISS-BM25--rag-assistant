You likely want something like this before the call to .List<>(): SetResultTransformer(Transformers.AliasToBean(typeof(Result))) Where Result is a new class you use to store the subset of columns you want as a result. See also this question: Projections in NHibernate The error you are getting is because without the call to SetResultTransformer, it wants to return an object array. You are then (unintentionally) trying to cast that object array to a list of Sell043Report objects, which isn't possible. Your other option is to remove the call to List<>() and instead deal with the object array.
