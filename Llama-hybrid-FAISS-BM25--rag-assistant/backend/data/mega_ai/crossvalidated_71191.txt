From 'Applied Predictive Modeling., Khun. Johnson . p.78 "No resampling method is uniformly better than another; the choice should be made while considering several factors. If the sample size is small, we recommend using repeated 10-fold cross validation for several reasons; the bias and variance properties are good, and given the sample size, the computational costs are not large. If the goal is to choose between models, as opposed to getting the best indicator of performance, a strong case can be made for using one of the bootstrap procedures since these have very low variance. For large sample sizes, the differences between resampling methods become less pronounced, and computational efficiency increases in performance." p. 78 In addition, given the choice of two similar results, the more interpretable model is generally preferred. As an example (from the same text), using 10 fold CV, a SVM classifier had a 75% accuracy estimate with resample results between 66 and 82%. The same parameters were used on a logistic regression classifier with 74.9% accuracy, and same resample range. The simpler logistic regression model might be preferred as it is easier to interpret results.
