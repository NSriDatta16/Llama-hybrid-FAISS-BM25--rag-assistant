postgresql syntax error

I trying to create this update statement that adds the average runtimes from today into a temporary table. I keep getting the following syntax error: ERROR: ERROR: syntax error at or near "INNER" Position: 22 Query = UPDATE temptbl1 AS T INNER JOIN ( select jobno, avg(elaptime) as avgrun from cmr_runinf where to_timestamp(timestmp, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS') > (now() - interval '1 DAY') GROUP BY JOBNO ) AS source ON T.jobno = source.jobno SET T.todayrun = source.avgrun My statement: UPDATE temptbl1 AS T INNER JOIN ( select jobno, avg(elaptime) as avgrun from cmr_runinf where to_timestamp(timestmp, 'YYYYMMDDHH24MISS') > (now() - interval '1 DAY') GROUP BY JOBNO ) AS source ON T.jobno = source.jobno SET T.todayrun = source.avgrun
