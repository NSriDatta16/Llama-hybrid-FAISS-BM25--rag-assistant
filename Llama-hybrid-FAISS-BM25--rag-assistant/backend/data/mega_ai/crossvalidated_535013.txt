exp(b) negative binomial regression

I am currently running a negative binomial regression, the log of expected counts is not as easy to understand, interpret. So I am wondering if I can, just like in logistic regression take the exp(b), to make the coefficients more interpretable. And if so, how would that be like ? For exmaple in a logistic regression if I have the log odds, I did the following: (exp(model$coefficients)-1)*100 EDIT: the way I interpret the coefficients, ß, in a logistic regression is the following, lets say in my output, ß2 has the following value: 0.223, that means if x2 increases by one unit, then the log odds of y increase by 0.223, or I can just do the following transformation: (exp(0.223)-1)*100 = 24.98, this would mean that if x2 increases by one unit, the odds of y happening increases by 24.98 %. However what I need is a transformation for a negative binomial regression – EDIT2: Lets say in my negative binomial regression output ß2 has the following coefficient: 0.040555, I know that I can interpret it as following: if x2 increases by one unit, then the difference in the logs of expected count for y increases by 0.04055. But I am curious how to interpret it if I take exp(0.040555) I am very grateful for any help
