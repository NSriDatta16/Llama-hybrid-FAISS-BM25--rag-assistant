Some pointers for solution 3: for the GUI part, ExtJS seems really nice. for the storage part, there is a nice javascript library that abstracts different storage backends: PersistJS . Supported backends for PersistJS: flash: Flash 8 persistent storage. gears: Google Gears-based persistent storage. localstorage: HTML5 draft storage. whatwg_db: HTML5 draft database storage. globalstorage: HTML5 draft storage (old spec). ie: Internet Explorer userdata behaviors. cookie: Cookie-based persistent storage.
