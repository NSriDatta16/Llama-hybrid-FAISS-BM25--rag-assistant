NMF and PCA are very similar such that both are factoring a matrix M into WH. However, with NMF, you have the constraint that M, W and H are all nonnegative. In PCA, you can think of W and H as coefficients and eigenfaces then proceed to use the coefficients for facial recognition. In NMF, W and H are coefficients and face profiles (that is, parts of the face). You then proceed to use the coefficients for your facial recognition in the same manner as using PCA.
