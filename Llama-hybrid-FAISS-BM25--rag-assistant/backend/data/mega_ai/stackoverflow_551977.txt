In the case of SQLite, you can make use of the user_version pragma to track the version of the database. To get the version: PRAGMA user_version To set the version: PRAGMA user_version = 5 I then keep each group of updates in an SQL file (that's embedded in the app) and run the updates needed to get up to the most recent version: Select Case currentUserVersion Case 1 // Upgrade to version 2 Case 2 // Upgrade to version 3 Case etc... End Select This allows the app to update itself to the most recent version regardless of the current version of the DB.
