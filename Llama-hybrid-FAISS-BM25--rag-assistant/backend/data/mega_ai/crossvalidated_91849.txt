That's a lot of features to input into a model. Have you thought about redundancy of information within the features? I would suggest dimensional reduction using e.g. PCA or non-linear manifold learning (diffusion maps, Laplacian eigenmaps, locally preserving projections, Sammon mapping, or even SOM, etc.). Would not some of your features also be noisy with little informativeness?
