Appropriate statistical approach?

I have two groups of participants, with injury 1 and injury 2. (categorical). ALL participants are divided in two groups, active or passive. (categorical). All participants have filled in three questionnaires, two about depression and one about anxiety, these are all continuous/numerical. I have two separate research questions, but with a catch. The first two research questions are: 1)Does the active condition result in a lower depression score. (two t-tests, one for depression1, one for depression2) . 2)Does the active condition result in a lower anxiety score . (t-test for anxiety) However, I also want to know if there is a significant difference between injury1 and injury2 in the effects of active on depression and anxiety. So: "3)is the effect of activity on depression and anxiety significantly different for injury2 and injury2? " And that is where I get stuck. My professor keeps pointing me towards logistic regression, but I just can't figure out what tests to run/combine to come to my answer. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I use SPSS If you have a suggestion on how to combine the two t-tests of question 1 into one test, that would be great too.
