Is there a better way of filling a generic List from a SQL DataAdapter?

I have an existing application that uses Active Record for its data retrieval. It's in VB.NET (first time I'm doing VB.NET; I usually work in C#). And I'm building a method to return a List(Of T) of an object. The current pattern uses a SQLDataAdapter to populate a datatable. I COULD add the record to the List(Of T) as I fill the datatable, but there HAS to be a better way to do this. Any ideas? I'm not married to using SQLDataAdapter , if there's a better way that avoids it...
