The clue is "the database principal 's2\killian' does not exist" Any connection uses context change on the database side (eg SETUSER , EXECUTE AS etc) requires that the impersonated user exists in sys.server_principals and/or sys.database_principals. Assuming you use an AD group, not individual logins, then this will cause the same error as above. Outside of any permissions. If you are db_owner, then you can impersonate at the database level. If you can't, then it's because of the previous paragraph. I've always thought that this is an idiotic option for SSRS to have. MSDN says it uses SETUSER which is also deprecated. Ideally, you'd impersonate before connection which is possible for asp.net apps but don't know for SSRS (which is an asp.net app of course) Sorry for lack of "do this and it works" answer...
