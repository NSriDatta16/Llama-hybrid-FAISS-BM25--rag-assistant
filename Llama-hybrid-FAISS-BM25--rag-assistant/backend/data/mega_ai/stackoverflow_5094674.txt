Why not using a big table for keep all the 500 millions of entries? If you use on-the-flight compression (Blosc compressor recommended here), most of the duplicated entries will be deduped, so the overhead in storage is kept under a minimum. I'd recommend give this a try; sometimes the simple solution works best ;-)
