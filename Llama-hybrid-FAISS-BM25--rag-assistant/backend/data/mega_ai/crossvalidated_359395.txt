If volatility was constant, then the impact would have been negligible. Unfortunately (?) volatility is time varying. If by SMA you mean simple moving average then the impact is that once the window moves away from a period its impact on the volatility disappears. Suppose that you had a huge spike in volatility of FB on July 26 2018. If you have 6 months window then in February this spike will not contribute anything into the moving average. This can be an issue if you're interested in tails of return distribution. On the other hand you could argue that what happened long ago is irrelevant. EWMA doesn't have the explicit window size, however it has an effective window size that is linked to its decay factor $e^{-\lambda t}$. So, in February the July spike won't suddenly drop out, but its contribution would have been gradually decreasing as it is further away from the current period.
