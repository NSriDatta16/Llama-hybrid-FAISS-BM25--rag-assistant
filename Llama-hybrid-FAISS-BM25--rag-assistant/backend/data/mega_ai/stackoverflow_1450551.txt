Buffered vs unbuffered IO

I learned that by default I/O in programs is buffered, i.e they are served from a temporary storage to the requesting program. I understand that buffering improves IO performance (maybe by reducing system calls). I have seen examples of disabling buffering, like setvbuf in C. What is the difference between the two modes and when should one be used over the other?
