How to remove registered/added Listeners?

Typically interfaces that let you add listeners also include a remove method something like the following. interface SomeInterface { addListener( Listener) removeListener( Listener ); } This however suck for several reasons. It is possible to pass a Listener that has not yet been removed to SomeInterface.removeListener(). It is also possible to call SI.removeListener() when no Listeners haven registered. One should not be able to call remove before even doing an add. It also means one has to keep a handle of both the Listener and the SI reference in order to remove at some later stage. I have a proposal which I believe works solves the those three problems, however I want to hear from others to learn from their ideas and proposals which might be more elegant than my own solution.
