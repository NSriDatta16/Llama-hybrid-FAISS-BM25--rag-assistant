Embedding multiple, identically named resource (RC) files in a native DLL

For my application (an MMC snap-in) I need to create a single native DLL containing strings that are localized into different languages. In other words, if you were to inspect this DLL with Visual Studio, you would see multiple string tables, each associated with a different locale but containing the same string IDs. The approach I would like to take is to have various subdirectories under my project directory such as "de", "en", "es", etc (i.e. one for each language). Inside each subdirectory would be a file called "Resources.rc" which would be the RC file containing the strings for that language. Having my resources in this structure would be ideal for the localisation team. I have managed to create my various RC files and have added them to my Visual C++ project. They all appear correctly in Solution Explorer in Visual Studio (you basically see five instances of an entry called "Resource.rc", but each entry points to a different file). The problem comes with building my project. It seems that only a single one of the RC files (the one that is specified first in the vcproj file) is compiled into a RES file and included into my DLL. Presumably this is because Visual Studio does not like the fact that the RC files all have the same name. Is there any way to achieve what I want? Thanks!
