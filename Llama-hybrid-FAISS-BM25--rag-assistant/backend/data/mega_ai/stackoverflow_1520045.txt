http://www.toadworld.com/BLOGS/tabid/67/EntryID/267/Default.aspx has info about checking code coverage using the PL/SQL profiler. Some helpful info about profiling on 9i or 10g is included in Metalink Article 243755.1 "Implementing and Using the PL/SQL Profiler" for information on profiling code. Grab the prof.zip from the bottom of the article, it has a profiler.sql which will nicely format your results after a profiling run. More 10g documentation is available here without a MetaLinka account: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/appdev.102/b14258/d_profil.htm If you are running 11g there is a new Hierarchical Profiler documented here: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B28359_01/appdev.111/b28424/adfns_profiler.htm
