General If your app loads very fast get rid off the spash screen. Code generation in the compact framework is not the same as Windows’ code. Jitter is optimized to run fast, not to produce the fastest code. Property is just a function for .Net CF. Silverlight Take as much as you can from Compositor Thread (for callback animations use BitmapCache). Use Canvas or custom popup instead of default one (Popup class) – lack of hardware acceleration. XNA Use DXT format for textures and pack them into 1 file (faster loading and fewer GPU texture switches). For things like game stats avoid using strings( immutable). SpriteBatch.DrawString can take a StringBuilder directly for drawing text. Avoid using/abusing LINQ and foreach (it may causes garbage). Use Jagged arrays( arrays of arrays) instead of 2d arrays.
