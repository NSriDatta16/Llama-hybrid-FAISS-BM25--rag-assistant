There are several ways to accomplish this. A simple way is to simply iterate the rows and columns (2 loops) and pass those values to a proc for storage. Something like (psuedo code): foreach(DataRow row in myDataTable.Rows) { foreach(DataColumn col in row.Columns) { String value = row[col].Value StoreValue(row.Name, col.Name, value); // If you have SQL 2008, then you could use a table value parameter and pass in the entire table to the stored procedure. From there you could do your inserts.
