Is PCA a continuous function of the data?

Suppose that my data are such that a PCA gives a unique solution for the first principal component up to scaling (e.g. my data do not all lie on a circle, or some such weirdness). Is it the case that the first principal component is continuous as a function of the data $X$ ? I.e. if we move one of the $x \in X$ by a small amount $\epsilon$ , then the direction of the first principal component changes by a small amount? If the function is discontinuous, what are the constraints within which it is a continuous function? EDIT: To try and clarify, with some assumptions barring numerical edge cases (some of which are enumerated here ), we can think of PCA $_1$ as a function that takes in some data, $X$ of $n$ observations in $R^m$ (i.e. $X \in R^{n\times m}$ ), and gives back the direction of the first principal component PCA $_1(X)$ . The actual vector is unique up to a scalar multiple, so to be formal we can reduce it to mere direction by, say, defining PCA $_1$ to hand back a vector where the first variable is positive (and if it is zero, then where the next variable is positive, and so on) of unit length. Consider some alternate matrix $X' \in R^{n\times m}$ . Is it the case that for every $\delta > 0$ there exists an $\epsilon > 0$ so that if $||X-X'||_F then $||$ PCA $_1(X) - $ PCA $_1(X')||_F ?
