generate EF model by System.Diagnostics.Process

after read this article i tried generate EF model by System.Diagnostics.Process: Process myProcess = new Process(); var cs = "Data Source=.\\SQLEXPRESS; Initial Catalog=uqs; Integrated Security=SSPI"; myProcess.StartInfo.FileName = @"C:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v3.5\EdmGen.exe"; myProcess.StartInfo.Arguments = "/mode:fullgeneration /c:"+cs+" project:School /entitycontainer:SchoolEntities /namespace:SchoolModel /language:CSharp "; myProcess.Start(); but i haven't get a result, because i can't do well formed arguments string. As I tried, there have many quotes. how to organize argument string?
