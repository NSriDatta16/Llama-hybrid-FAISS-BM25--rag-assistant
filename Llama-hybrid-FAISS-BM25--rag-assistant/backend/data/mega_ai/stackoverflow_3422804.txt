Please install your Magento once again, because at the time of installation, the column "category_ids" were not properly created in this table mainly. This problem sometimes happens with Magento, if not everything is okay (like the Internet Speed & Hosting Server's Bandwidth & others). You may also find some other problems in this Magento installation, because normally if one problem with products arises, some more problems creep up soon enough. Hope it helps.
