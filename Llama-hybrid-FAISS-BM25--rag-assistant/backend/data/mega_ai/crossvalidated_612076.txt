Questions on filtering out predicted boxes during training for YOLO family of algorithms

Does any of the YOLO models use NMS during training ? From going through the papers they only explicitly state that NMS is only applied during inference, unlike Faster-RCNN. Does any YOLO (or other computer vision) algorithms filter out low confidence boxes during training based on some threshold before computing the loss? Are there plus / minuses for doing so?
