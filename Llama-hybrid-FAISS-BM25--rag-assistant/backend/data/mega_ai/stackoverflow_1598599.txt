The right answer is based on how you organize your code. If the mainline is always supposed to be stable/working, then you simply build from that. If you have a branch that is the "golden" branch, then... At our shop, we have three kinds of branches: Mainline // always buildable, always "ready to release once QA is done" Released branches // golden, released and release-able at any time Development branches // where messy surgery gets done (Of course to do this well takes a good vcs. We use perforce, which has awesome branching.) We do our continuous building from mainline and release branches. HTH
