getFilesDir() return your application's privte directory. Camera can't access your private directory. To make wallpaper.jpg accessible by Camera place it in some publix folder. For example like Alex said it can be sd card root. The fixed code would be: File file = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory(), "wallpaper.jpg");
