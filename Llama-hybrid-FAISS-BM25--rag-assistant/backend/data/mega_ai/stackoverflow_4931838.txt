Redirect folder on parked domain to main domain

I am moving a client's site from static HTMl to a WordPress site. This has also involved setting up a new domain. I have the legacy domain set up as a parked domain on my server and can successfully redirect all requests for the parked domain to the main domain. Here is my .htaccess in full: # Use PHP5 Single php.ini as default AddHandler application/x-httpd-php5s .php # BEGIN WordPress RewriteEngine On RewriteBase / RewriteRule ^index\.php$ - [L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-f RewriteCond %{REQUEST_FILENAME} !-d RewriteRule . /index.php [L] # END WordPress # Rewrite from parked domain to new domain RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^parked-domain.co.uk$ [OR] RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www.parked-domain.co.uk$ RewriteRule ^/?$ "http\:\/\/www\.main-domain\.co\.uk" [R=301,L] # All requests hit www.domain.co.uk to prevent duplicate content RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} !^www.main-domain.co.uk$ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://www.main-domain.co.uk$1 [L,R=301] However, I am coming unstuck when I try to redirect requests for specific pages on the parked domain to pages at the main domain. For example, requests for parked-domain.co.uk/html/about_us.html should redirect to main-domain.co.uk/about-us/ I've a hit a brick wall (in spite of many hours of forum-searching) and any help would be gratefully received; this is rage-inducing.
