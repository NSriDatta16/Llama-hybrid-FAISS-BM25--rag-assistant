Richer iPhone Interfaces With Library Components?

My iPhone development is stepping up a notch and I'm looking at the UI. We're thinking of having a few nice interface-y features - things like dragging and dropping images onto one another from a gallery list, or similar. How far does the basic iPhone interface stretch? Do most people create their own interfaces and code, and if so what's the base there? CoreGraphics? OpenGL? I don't want to reinvent the wheel, but neither do I want to take an overcomplicated option if someone's done the work already.
