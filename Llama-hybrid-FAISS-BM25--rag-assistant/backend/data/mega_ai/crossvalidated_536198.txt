Intuition behind predicting probability in reinforcement learning

I'm learning how to implement reinforcement learning to solve classification problem. I understand this is not a common approach and might not return better performance compared to other supervised classifiers. In Sklearn, every model has its own calculation of predict_proba() to predict the probability of each label. Does anyone have any thoughts on how to predict the probability of each label using reinforcement learning specifically using DQN (deep Q-network)?
