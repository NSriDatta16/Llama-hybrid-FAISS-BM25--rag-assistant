Optimal way to rank candidates - concrete statement

I'd like to have some statistical/probabilistic formalisations (solutions..) of the following concrete case I have heard : "Imagine you have a set of candidates to be interviewed for a job. You split randomly this set into two populations, distributed in 1/3 and 2/3. Then you interview all the candidates of the 1/3-set (first third), and then select the best (with the higher score according to your criteria..) of this set, denoted Cm. Then you begin to interview candidates of the remaining 2/3-set.. And as soon as you find a better candidate than Cm, denoted CM for example, you stop the procedure and definitely choose your candidate CM. (If such a candidate doesn't exist in the 2/3-set we take the best of this set) We can say that "on average" CM is our best global candidate (i.e over the whole candidates population), and this despite we did not look necessarily at the whole 2/3-set. How to show that?" I know this statement could be unclear (what does "on average" exactly mean?) or not complete, but this is part of my question, how can we understand it ? Thanks a lot for your lights ! Have a nice day.
