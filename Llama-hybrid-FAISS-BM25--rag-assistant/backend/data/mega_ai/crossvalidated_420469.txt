There are different types of pooling, including MaxPooling and AveragePooling . MaxPooling captures the maximum pixel value in a grid (say z x z) from the entire image and then processes that in output image. Average Pooling likewise calculates the average and processes that in output image. On the other hand, Subsampling chooses a pixel in the grid and replaces surrounding pixels of said grid by the same pixel value in the output image. The output image from these two might look the same (and might have no major changes in accuracy in the Neural Network), however, they are not exactly same.
