Is there a non-parametric form of a 3-way ANOVA?

I am currently in the process of writing a publication about the home range of cat shark species in South Africa. However, I am currently struggling with how to create an interaction model of shark species, maturity level and sex, and their effect on the average travel distance within the study region. I was hoping to gain a test statistic (non-parametric) and p value for each category (e.g. mature male leopard shark, mature female leopard shark, immature male leopard shark, etc.). To do this I have tried a gaussian GLM though this does not give me the output I'm looking for since I'm using 3 fixed factors and no covariates. I've also tried a Scheirer-Ray-Hare test, though this only allows for 2 factors. Does anyone have any ideas of what test I could potentially use?
