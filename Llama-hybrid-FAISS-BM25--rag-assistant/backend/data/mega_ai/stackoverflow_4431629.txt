c# Cache Control in code or IIS 6

When one of my websites is viewed over a mobile 3G network the network operator o2 in this case is rewriting the page and embedding all the styles in-line, this is causing the page to break. As the styles rules are not followed properly. Now I understand from the guys at o2 that I can stop this happening by adding a Cache Control heading of "no-transform" to my site. The problem is that adding this via IIS dosn't seam to do anything. and you cant add the cache control "no-transform" via code in .net as its not one of the system.Web.HttpCacheability options. Any idea how I can get this header in and stop the page being tampered with by the mobile operator.
