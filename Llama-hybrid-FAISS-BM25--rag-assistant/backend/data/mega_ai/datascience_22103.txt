How should values that "don't exist" sometimes be handled as input data?

I'm currently training an agent to learn how to fight in a shooting game. I'm using the bullet positions of the agent's opponent as one of the features. The features "don't exist" when the opponent isn't firing a bullet. What should I substitute the feature with when the opponent of the agent doesn't fire a bullet? Right now, I'm considering using "0", but are there better alternatives?
