Which samples are used in random forests for calculating variable importance?

Each tree of a random forest is learned on a random bootstrapped sample. Consequently, given that the number of trees is large, it is probable that every observation of a data set is used to form at least one tree of a forest and hence there exists no "independent" sample which can be used for evaluating the performance of the random forest. Which samples are used by random forest to calculate variable importance then? In my understanding there is no guarantee that there exists a sample which is independent from forming the trees.
