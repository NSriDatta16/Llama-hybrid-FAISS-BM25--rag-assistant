Collections as decorators in C#

We've been hit with a pretty "obvious" problem while designing a collections infrastructure: suppose you need to implement many (sub)types of collections. One of the aspects is storage-related : list , array etc, while the other is behavior-related : ordered , remove only , observable (the one that fires an event upon every change) etc. Obviously (again), the requirement maps directly to the well-known Decorator design pattern ( list , array ), where the storage-related aspect will be decorated by multiple behavioral ( ordered , observable etc). It would be great to know about something similar that had been already implemented by someone. Hence, if possible - please recommend/refer to any well-maintained third-party library that would meet the requirements, mentioned above. Thanks so far :)
