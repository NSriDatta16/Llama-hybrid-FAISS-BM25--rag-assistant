I add an alternative approach, based on the comments of the OP, to evaluate $p(s_0,a_0,d_0)$ , which is in the previous answer the denominator $A+B$ . As suggested by the comments of the OP: $p(s_0,a_0,d_0)=p(s_0|a_0,d_0)p(a_0,d_0)$ and since the Bayesian network provides $p(s_0|a_0,d_0)=0.6$ we just need the second factor, which is equal to: $p(a_0,d_0)=\sum_{r,c} p(r)p(c)p(a_0|r)p(d_0|r,c)$ ( variables $s$ and $f$ do not enter year because they have only outgoing edges from the set of variables $a,d,r,c$ ) Now this is equal to, since $p(r)=0.5$ , and considering the four cases $(r,c)$ : $p(a_0,d_0)=0.5*(0.6*0.2*1.0+0.4*0.2*0.7+0.6*0.6*0.6+0.4*0.6*0.1)$ And therefore: $p(a_0,d_0,s_0)=0.6*0.5*(0.6*0.2*1.0+0.4*0.2*0.7+0.6*0.6*0.6+0.4*0.6*0.1)$ One can numerically verify that this expression is equal to the denominator $A+B$ in the first answer. Of course one still needs to evaluate the numerator $A$ to get to the final result.
