Is logistic regression the best test for this study?

I have two independent variables (both categorical) and one dependent (categorical) variable. I want to look at the predictive factor or significance of those two independent variables (either separately or combined) on the dependent variable. Is logistic regression the test I need to use? What if I run this same test on three different groups?
