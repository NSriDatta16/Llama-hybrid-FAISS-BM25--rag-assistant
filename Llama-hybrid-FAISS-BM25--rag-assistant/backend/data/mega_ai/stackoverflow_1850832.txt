So, if you declare your contract something like: [WebInvoke(Method = "POST", UriTemplate = "create", ResponseFormat=WebMessageFormat.Json)] int CreateItem(Stream streamOfData); (you can use XML instead) The streamOfData should be the body of an HTTP POST. You can deserialize it using something like: StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(streamId); String res = reader.ReadToEnd(); NameValueCollection coll = HttpUtility.ParseQueryString(res); It's working like that for us, at least. You may want to use a different approach to get the string into an XMLDocument or something. This works for our JSON posts. Might not be the most elegant solution, but it is working. I hope this helps. Glenn
