SVM's dual problem seems to ignore primal feasibility

The primal feasibility is given below: $$ y_i(w^Tx_i+w_0) \geq 1 $$ and is required when solving primal problem. But when we turn to the dual problem, the inequality becomes $\alpha_i \geq 0$ and we seem to have no way of ensuring that primal feasibility is achieved. How does the computer know that only fulfilling $\alpha_i \geq 0$ will definitely ensure $y_i(w^Tx_i+w_0)\geq1$ as well? It really confuses me.
