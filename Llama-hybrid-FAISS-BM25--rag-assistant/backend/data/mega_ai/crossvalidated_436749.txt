When are linear (OLS) models valid when variables are nested

I have data where counselors are nested inside units which are nested inside areas. I would prefer to use OLS regression rather than multilevel analysis because I only have 7 areas (which I am told is too small a sample size for multilevel models) and because no one in my organization is interested in units (of which there are 70). Formally the nesting violates the assumptions of regression I know which in turn negatively effects the calculated p values. Is there a way to know how serious this impact is, that is if it really invalidates using OLS?
