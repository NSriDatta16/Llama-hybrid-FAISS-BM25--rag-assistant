I believe I found the solution in the jQuery documentation: Animates all paragraph to a left style of 50 and opacity of 1 (opaque, visible), completing the animation within 500 milliseconds. It also will do it outside the queue, meaning it will automatically start without waiting for its turn . $( "p" ).animate({ left: "50px", opacity: 1 }, { duration: 500, queue: false }); simply add: queue: false .
