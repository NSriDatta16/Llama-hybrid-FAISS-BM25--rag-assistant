Windsor WCF Integration Facility Async

I'm using Windsor WCF Integration Facility and am curently looking for a way to call a method asnyc. I was considering just using a background worker and doing the work on completion. Is there a more elegant way of doing this, i don't have a good feeling with selected way. I've looked at the following email: http://groups.google.com/group/castle-project-devel/browse_thread/thread/9250110e258ccdcd from Krzysztof Ko≈∫mic. The solution seems great, it is however said it's just a prototype as i understand.
