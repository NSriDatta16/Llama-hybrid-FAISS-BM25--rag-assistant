How to deal with this sequence alignement problem?

Assume the following input sequences. ___JJJJIII___I____OOO0O______HHHHHH_____MMNNN___ AAAAAI_NNNNNNNNNNNA_AAAA_ ___MMMM______A______RR_I______KK_ which corresponds to the following labels: JOHN ANNA MARK How can I build a model that can learn to 'translate' those sequences into the right labels. I've though that a sequence to sequence recurrent network will be able to do this, but the generated sequence I got is nearly random. I've also tried a Connectionist Temporal Classification which seems to do exactly what I want. But the implementation I've tried returns me an empty strings Any working exemple for the previously cited methods ? Any suggestion of an other method to solve this problem ? Edit: seq2seq RNN is rendering something coherent when working (training and testing) with constant length sequences only. (I already tried to pad the other sequences to get the same length ... same thing)
