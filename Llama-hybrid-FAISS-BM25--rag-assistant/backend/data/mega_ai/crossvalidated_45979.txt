Identifying periods of non random behavior in time series

Im looking for some pointers on which topics I should be looking into in order to identify periods (of non fixed length) which deviate from randomness. I have a feeling hypothesis testing may be what I'm looking for though I haven't covered it yet. My stats knowledge is limited hence any suggested books / websites would also be appreciated.
