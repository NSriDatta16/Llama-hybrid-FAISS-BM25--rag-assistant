In regions where abortion is illegal, such data could be used against women in legal cases. Use in surveillance There is a growing interest to use wearables not only for individual self-tracking, but also within corporate health and wellness programs. Given that wearables create a data trail which employers could repurpose for objectives other than health, more and more research has begun to study privacy- and security-related issues of wearables, including related to the use for surveillance of workers. Data is not owned by the users themselves, but rather by the company that produces the wearable device. The user only has access to the aggregated summary of their data, while the raw data can be sold to third parties.
