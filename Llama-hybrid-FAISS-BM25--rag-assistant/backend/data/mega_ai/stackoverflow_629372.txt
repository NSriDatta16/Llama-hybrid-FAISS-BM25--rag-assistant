Solution to remove frames from a website

At the moment I'm working with a booking website that has a frame set. Let's say, 40% is from it's own website, so can be easily altered into a frame less site. However, the actually booking-flow is from another website (also maintained by us) and is meant to "live" on it's own, so that 3rd party websites can buy/use the booking-flow as well. Now my boss wants to have it frame less, but I see problems with embedding the booking-flow properly, because I don't want to touch that at all. What is the best way to deal with it? Use an iframe for the booking-flow only Solve it server-side to web request the booking-engine and alter links or something like that. Use AJAX? but that will impact a lot of code I think. Better solution? Of course there is a time/money issue as well, but I'll take that for granted now.
