Language with similar object use to Javascript/JSON

I've been doing a project at work recently focused on an almost entirely client-driven web site. Obviously Javascript is used heavily, and I've been using jQuery on top of it which has turned out to be an absolute pleasure to work with. One of the things that has surprised me in this is how much I like the JSON object syntax and it's use within javascript (highlighted by jQuery, which uses it everywhere). for those that aren't familiar with it, consider this brief example: function add(params) { params.result(params.a, params.b); } add({ a: 1, b: 2, result: function(value) { alert(value); } }); Of course, this example is extremely contrived but it illustrates the basic usage. The JSON describes an object on the fly, passed in this case as a parameter to the function, and even defines a function within it for use as a callback. I personally find this methodology very easy to use, understand, and produce APIs with (though I know there are those that would disagree with me.) So my question is, is this type of syntax unique to javascript? I know that many languages have JSON parsers (and have used several) but they don't allow for this sort of inlined declaration. And granted, much of what you can do with this syntax can be duplicated via named parameters in various languages and lambda expressions or function pointers (Python jumps to mind), but I still don't find that quite as elegant. Just curious, thanks for any replies!
