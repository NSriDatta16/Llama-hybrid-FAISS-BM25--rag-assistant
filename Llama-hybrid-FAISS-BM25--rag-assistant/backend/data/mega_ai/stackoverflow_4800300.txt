Unfortunately, JavaScript doesn't have much in the way of elegant collection processing capabilities if you have to support older browsers, so without the help of additional libraries, a nested loop like the one you've written is the way to go. You could consider having the values precomputed server-side instead, perhaps cached, and including it in the JSON to avoid having to run the same computations again and again.
