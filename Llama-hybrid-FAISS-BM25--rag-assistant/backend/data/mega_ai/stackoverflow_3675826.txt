Embedding a SWF Video in an AIR 2 HTML App

I've been through the forums for awhile and I can verify that my issue doesn't have to do with transparency or chrome. I have an IFRAME which is in the application sandbox , giving it access to files in app-storage . Dynamic images are loading fine, but my dynamically generated code that is placed in the DOM is not loading the SWF video. I can see the object placeholder, but no video. Are there any requirements to embedding a SWF file, perhaps size requirements (both height and width required)? Given the fact that my content is dynamic and I don't know the dimensions of the SWF file, I currently have two options for embedding: Calculate the height and width of the parent element, and assign those values to the OBJECT params. Use 100% width and height on the OBJECT This might pose problems with the proportions of the SWF file, which I'm hoping can be fixed by the scale PARAM ( http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/127/tn_12701.html ). Please help, I haven't been able to find any helpful guides yet. I have already followed the documentation for embedding from here to no avail: http://help.adobe.com/en_US/AIR/1.5/devappshtml/WS4B441C24-BAE3-4110-91FD-A4E5EEFB2467.html
