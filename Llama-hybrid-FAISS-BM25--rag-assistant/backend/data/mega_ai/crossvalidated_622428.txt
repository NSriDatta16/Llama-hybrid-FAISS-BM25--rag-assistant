How to obtain the standard deviation of several data sets with multiple measurements within each set?

I have done an experiment and repeated the set of measurements 3 times, totalling 3 data sets. In each set of measurements the machine acquired 30 data sets. Meaning that in total I have 90 data arrays (1000 data points per array). In other words, I have a 30x1000x3 3D matrix. How do I calculate the standard deviation of each of the second quantity so that I can obtain a matrix of 1x1000 of the standard deviations? I have attempted the following 2 ways: averaging all values across the z direction, obtaining a 30x1000 2D matrix, and get the standard deviation across the y-dimension to obtain a 1x1000 matrix with the std values. calculate the standard deviation along the z direction, obtaining a 30x1000 2D matrix of std values, and then average these values along the y-dimension to obtain a 1x1000 matrix with the std values. These have the same results, but I have been told by a colleague that this can be done in a better way that considerably reduces the std values, and that this is the right way of doing it. Any idea of how to?
