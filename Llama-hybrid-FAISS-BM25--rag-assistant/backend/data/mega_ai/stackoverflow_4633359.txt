What makes you think you're being locked into a single platform? Did you know that Google's App Engine SDK is open source? Also, there are universities and other organizations who are working on building platforms that will use the App Engine SDK outside of the context of Google? Amazon EC2 is also capable of running App Engine's SDK in a limited capacity. I'd say lock-in is perhaps not the right word to use. Additionally, I believe AppEngine is going to continue to improve as time goes on. Google is the leader of the Internet; they've done great things and will continue to do so. I believe that anyone who sticks with their platform as a service will experience these great benefits in the years to come. If your reasoning for moving is purely academic, I'd suggest starting a new project. Moving off of AppEngine's SDK is similar to switching from one framework to another on an already-built application. Like with any framework or platform, there are dependencies that must be dealt with in order to successfully migrate the app from platform A to platform B.
