C# / Windows Forms: form's paint code not being executed

I posted a similar but less specific question a couple hours ago, but the circumstances have changed. I'm working on a program that transforms graphics, presenting them in a panel in the upper left of the form. It was painting fine earlier, but now isn't and I can't undo, load old version, etc. Previously, the app was unresponsive even to events in the menus, as well as painting. I started a new project and got it up and running, the menus work and I brought over the buttons and stuff. But it still won't paint the axes and gridlines in the panel. I put breakpoints in both the main forms's paint handler and the splitContainer2_Panel1_Paint handler that should be doing the work, but the code here isn't even being executed. I have a timer that's active and invalidating the whole form every 100 ms, so why would the paint event handler not be called? Help? using System; using System.Collections.Generic; using System.ComponentModel; using System.Data; using System.Drawing; using System.Linq; using System.Text; using System.Windows.Forms; using System.IO; namespace TransformerA { public partial class Transformer : Form { /* Initialize parameters */ private bool drawAxes = true; private bool drawGrid = true; private List dispObjects = new List (); /* Initialize form */ public Transformer() { InitializeComponent(); } private void Transformer_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { // Populate available objects listbox string currentDir = Directory.GetCurrentDirectory(); string[] fileEntries = Directory.GetFiles(currentDir + @"\Objects"); foreach (string s in fileEntries) { int start = s.LastIndexOf(@"\"); int end = s.LastIndexOf(@"."); availObjectsListBox.Items.Add(s.Substring(start + 1, end - start - 1)); } // end foreach } /* Paint graphics */ // Paint main form private void Transformer_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { splitContainer2_Panel1_Paint(sender, e); } // Paint graphics panel private void splitContainer2_Panel1_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { Rectangle r = splitContainer2.Panel1.ClientRectangle; //Graphics g = splitContainer2.Panel1.CreateGraphics(); Graphics g = e.Graphics; Pen axisPen = new Pen(Color.Gray, 2.0f); Pen gridPen = new Pen(Color.Gray, 1.0f); g.Clear(Color.Blue); if (drawAxes) { g.DrawLine(axisPen, r.Left + 0.5f * r.Width, r.Top, r.Left + 0.5f * r.Width, r.Bottom); g.DrawLine(axisPen, r.Left, r.Top + 0.5f * r.Height, r.Right, r.Top + 0.5f * r.Height); } if (drawGrid) { // Vertical lines int xVal = 0; int xCenter = r.Width / 2; g.DrawLine(gridPen, xCenter, r.Top, xCenter, r.Bottom); for (int i = 0; i
