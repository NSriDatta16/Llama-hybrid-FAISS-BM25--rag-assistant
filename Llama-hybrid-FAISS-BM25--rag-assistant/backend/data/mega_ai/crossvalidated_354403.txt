You should try multinest: https://arxiv.org/pdf/0809.3437.pdf https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/MultiNest It's a bayesian inference engine that will give you parameter samples for a multimodal distribution. The github link contains multinest source code that you compile and install as per instructions. it also has a python wrapper that's easier to use. The example codes have a prior section which serves to constrain your parameters, and a likelihood section which contains your likelihood. the settings file contains all your settings, and chains folder multinest output after fitting. it will give you samples of your parameters
