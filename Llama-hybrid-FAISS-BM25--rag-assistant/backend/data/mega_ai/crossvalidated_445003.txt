Unfortunately I think the only concusion you can draw here is that your optimization/selection approach failed . For a technically successful optimization (somewhat regardless of the achieved generalization error), cross validation score and test results should be highly and positiviely correlated and that's not the case here. One reason I can think of is that your sample size(s) may be too small. You then get large error (random uncertainty; variance) on the test results and that would de-correlate CV and test set estimates since they are from mutually independent samples and in general lead to estimates being all over the place so that possible trends in the underlying data (true model performance) may be completely masked. Here's an illustration, left to right 20 training + 4 test, 100 train + 20 test, 1000 train + 200 test. The underlying data has 100 features with gradually varying information content, I train linear regression with 10 features, moving those 10 features over my columns to generate the points. Error is root mean squared error, so lower is better. With 1200 cases we get a very clear picture of the prediction quality. With 120, the picture is a bit blurred but we still see differences between the models. With only 24 cases, we cannot be sure of seeing any real differences. My simulation doesn't have any overfitting of the cross validation (yet - because we have not yet selected a model based on the CV results), so CV error is an unbiased predictor of test error (and generalization error). With too small sample size it's nevertheless a bad predictor of generalization and of test error. For successful optimization/selection, CV error needs to be a sufficiently good predictor of generalization error. For testing, test error needs to be a sufficiently good predictor of generalization error. How about other approaches to the feature selection: using the random forest's variable importance? L1-regularizing the regression (LASSO)? If the sample size is too small, the best you can do may be using expert geological knowledge which features you should include.
