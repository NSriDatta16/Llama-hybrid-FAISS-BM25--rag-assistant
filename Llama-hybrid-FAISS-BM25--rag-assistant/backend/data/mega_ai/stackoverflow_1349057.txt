Average developer quality seems to be inversely proportional to popularity of language * ease of use of language. VB is very easy, and is/was widely used. This is because A) there's a demand for coders in popular languages, so every employer has to either lower their standards, raise their pay or go without developers. B) people without a clue can still appear moderately productive in easy to use languages. There are enough libraries and GUI tools that they can slap together something that looks useful, even if it's complete garbage under the hood. There's nothing inherently wrong with VB when used in the domains it was intended for, by people who know what they're doing. The same is true for almost any tool/language.
