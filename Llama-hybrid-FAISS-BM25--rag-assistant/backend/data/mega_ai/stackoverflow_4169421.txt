It looks like you're only embedding one profile (embeds_one :profile). It should be user.profile, not user.profiles. Also, user.profile will return an instance of that document, not an array of many documents. You could do something like this in your controller. user.profile.create(... put any params here ...) In your view you would then display Welcome You also need to change embedded_in :user, :inverse_of => :profiles to embedded_in :user, :inverse_of => :profile To see if the user has a profile or not, just see if user.profile returns nil.
