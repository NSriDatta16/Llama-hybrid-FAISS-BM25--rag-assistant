Interpretation of coefficient in logistic regression

Let's say I have the following model: $$\ln\Big(\frac{\mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | X_i)}{\mathbb{P}(Y_i = 0 | X_i)}\Big) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{1,i} + \beta_2 X_{2,i}$$ Let $\rho = \frac{\mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1 | X_i)}{\mathbb{P}(Y_i = 0 | X_i)}$ . Then: $$\frac{\partial \ln\rho}{\partial X_1} = \frac{\partial \ln\rho}{\partial \rho} \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial X_1}= \frac{\partial \rho}{\rho} \frac{1}{\partial X_1} = \beta_1$$ So if $\partial X_1 = 1$ then $\frac{\partial \rho}{\rho} = \beta_1$ . Similarly, let $\ln\rho^0$ increase to $\ln\rho^1$ after the unit increase in $X_1$ . If this is so, then: $$\ln\rho^1 - \ln\rho^0 = \beta_1 \\ \implies \frac{\rho^1}{\rho^0} = e^{\beta_1}$$ Question Shouldn't it always hold that $e^{\beta_1} - 1 = \beta_1$ when $\partial X_1 = 1$ ? My estimated model returned $\hat{\beta_1} = 0.0326$ and: $0.0326 \neq \big[ e^{\hat{\beta_1}} - 1 = 0.0332 \big]$ How come these two effects are not the same?
