GNU Wget (or just Wget, formerly Geturl) is a program that retrieves content from web servers, and is part of the GNU Project. Its name is derived from World Wide Web and get, connotative of its primary function. It supports downloading via HTTP, HTTPS, and FTP protocols, the most popular TCP/IP-based protocols used for web browsing. WGet supports downloading both separate pages and the complete sites (recursive retrieval), also respects robots.txt . It can also retry if the server fails to respond. Some of the features include: GNU wget has many features to make retrieving large files or mirroring entire web or FTP, including: Can resume aborted downloads, using REST and RANGE NLS-based message files for many different languages Optionally converts absolute links in downloaded documents to relative, so that downloaded documents may link to each other locally Runs on most UNIX-like operating systems as well as Microsoft Windows Supports HTTP proxies Supports HTTP cookies Supports persistent HTTP connections Unattended / background operation Uses local file timestamps to determine whether documents need to be re-downloaded when mirroring GNU Wget is distributed under the GNU General Public License.
