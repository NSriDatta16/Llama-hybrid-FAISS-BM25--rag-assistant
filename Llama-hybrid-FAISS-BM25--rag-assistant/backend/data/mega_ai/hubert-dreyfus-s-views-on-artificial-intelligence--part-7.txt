Dreyfus then moves on to consider Michael Wheeler's "embodied-embedded paradigm" as a refinement of Heideggerian AI. He accuses Wheeler of a "cognitivst misreading" for understanding Heidegger's insight to be the human capacity to use representational equipments external to the body. Instead, "being-in-the-world" is non-representationalist on the most basic level as a background to coping. The mind, therefore, does not "extended" into the background but exists within it. However, this objection has also been challenged by others as resting on an absolute dichotomy between reflective and pre-reflective modes of intentional behavior. Finally, Dreyfus examines Walter Freeman's program of Heideggerian neurodynamics, which sought to provide the material basis to phenomenological concepts in terms of a self-organizing neural "perception-action loop". In this model, relevant brain states are "attracted" to each other, while the brain switches from one equilibrium to another. The resulting dynamic system characterizes the "intentional arc" that affords contextual significance to actions. One complication Dreyfus does not address, however, is that this "neurodynamics of intention" is not distinctive of human intelligence, but as e.g. Freeman (2015) has argued, evolved from "[...] Ordovician period as a tool to prowl first olfactory environments, then environments of other modalities." He concludes by asserting that future AI program must: "model [...] our particular way of being embedded and embodied such that what we experience is significant for us in the particular way that it is [...] with our needs, desires, pleasures, pains, ways of moving, cultural background, etc." See also Adaptive unconscious Church–Turing thesis Computer chess Hubert Dreyfus Philosophy of artificial intelligence Notes References Brooks, Rodney (1990), "Elephants Don't Play Chess" (PDF), Robotics and Autonomous Systems, 6 (1–2): 3–15, CiteSeerX 10.1.1.588.7539, doi:10.1016/S0921-8890(05)80025-9, retrieved 30 August 2007 Crevier, Daniel (1993).
