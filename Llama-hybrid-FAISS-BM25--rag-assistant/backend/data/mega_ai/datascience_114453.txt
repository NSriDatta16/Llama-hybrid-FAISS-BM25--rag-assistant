Hybrid usually implies - symbolic + subsymbolic learning (KG/Rule-Based + ML/DL) Ensemble Learning implies - similar/dissimilar methods competing against each other to reduce error where the models are usually defined in subsymbolic learning (SVM + KNN, Random Forest, etc) where symbolic learning is defined as traditional rule-based methods and sub-symbolic learning as probabilistic methods.
