You can listen to the Window.SizeChanged event, and inside your handler manually set Width and Height back to 1027 and 768. It still allows the user to drag the window's edges to resize, but then the window returns to it's set size. The drawback of this is that the window has a "seizure" whenever the user tries resizing--not the prettiest thing to see. Minimize and Maximize work as normal.
