Short answer: "Very sadly, No (on non-technological grounds)". Long answer: On one hand, Embperl is VERY powerful. If you look at it from purely technological standpoint, it's VERY much worth it. I have not used TT, but I have seen references to Embperl being both faster AND more powerful than TT. However, as you noted, Embperl is not currently as popular as the alternatives (TT, Mason etc...). It is used by less people professionally, and by less organizations. Part of it might be because it is not currently possible to use it with Catalyst using mature code, a couple of obviously new raw modules on CPAN nonwithstanding). So you will have less demand employment wise; and less support from your peers (including on SO - yours was like the second Embperl question ever that I recall). Based on this, I would not recommend considering Embperl unless you have a tangible job opportunity involving that, or employment considerations of choosing Embperl or other system are very small for you. In addition, Embperl is only supported/developed by 1 person, to the best of my knowledge (Gerard Richter). If one of your goals is long-term employment considerations, I am not sure the level of risk associated with the product depending on 1 developer is a good idea long term. HOWEVER, please be aware that, like Mark Twain's, the report of Embperl's death was greatly exaggerated. To be specific, it previously appeared that the development of Embperl stopped completely with development version 2.2.1 in 2006 if you look at the main Apache Embperl site (see now what I meant above about the risk of sole developer?). BUT!!! A bit of digging discovered that it's ALIVE! In 2010, Gerald announced the release of Embperl 2.4 . This includes support for Perl 5.12, as well as some work (unreleased alpha stage) for using Embperl with Catalyst BTW, I have been using Embperl professionally for many years, and am very happy with it as a framework. Thus the "sadly" qualifier. UPDATE : Apparently, there's been some effort to get Embperl to play nicely with Catalyst. If/when that happens and is stable, I would then change my answer to "look at Embperl as an option", although the employment considerations still stand.
