There are plenty of methods you could use, such as PCA ISOMAP MDS Locally linear embedding Assuming that with "Pythagorean distance" you actually mean Euclidean distance (but then there is nothing "custom" as the distance already is defined on any dimensionality), I would simply use PCA. The others are more interesting in much higher dimensions and for custom metrics.
