Clarification regarding odds ratios in logistic regression

I am trying to understand odds ratios (OR) in logistic regression. So far what I read says that "OR is a measure of association between exposure and outcome". I got a kid dental dataset in which the independent variable is disability status, i.e., whether a child has a disability or not (1 for disability and 2 for a normal kid), and the dependent variable is whether a kid gets dental attendance on time or not (1 for on-time dental attendance and 0 for late dental attendance). If I am not mistaken, in the above case, there are two exposure variables: disabled and normal kid, and the outcome is on-time dental attendance or not. If I am right, my question is: Do I need to calculate the OR for each type of exposure variable (i.e. one OR for disabled and one for normal) or is it only one OR value for both values of the exposure variable? If it is one single value, then how could we interpret OR=1.5? Could we say that there is 50% more chance that disabled kids do not (or do) get dental attendance on time? Could anyone help me in understanding the concept?
