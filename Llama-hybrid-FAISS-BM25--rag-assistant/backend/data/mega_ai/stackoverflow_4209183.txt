Instrument the classes with any of the code coverage tools you like (e.g. cobertura, which writes a local file cobertura.ser which can then be used for the report generation in a separate step). Then, instead of running the signed or unsigned (which wouldn't work anyway) Applet directly in the browser, use the AppletViewer environment. The viewer runs the Applet in a privileged environment, without the Java Plugin Sandbox and thus the code coverage tool can do its work and write the report file. Many of the code coverage tools use byte-code weaving and only write their results using a shutdown hook - when the VM shuts down. That is probably not working when used in a browser, since that's a special VM. Not sure, but maybe the Java Plugin starts a separate VM for Applets which is never being shut down.
