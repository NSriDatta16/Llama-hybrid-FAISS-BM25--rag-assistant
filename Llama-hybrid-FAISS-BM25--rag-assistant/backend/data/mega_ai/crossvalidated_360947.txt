If combining makes sense (*) (**), then two things: work with variances and then take square root; a weighted average should be used, just like in the independent two-sample t-test where the pooled standard deviation is calculated as $$ s_p = \sqrt{\frac{(n_1 - 1) * s^2_1 + (n_2 - 1) * s^2_2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}} $$ (*) not enough detail is provided (**) cf. exchangeability
