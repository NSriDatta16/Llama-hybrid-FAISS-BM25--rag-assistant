Adjusting t-stat for rolling mean feature in time series regression?

Say we have a timeseries data $x_t$ and we are trying to predict $y_t$ with the following: $$y_t = \alpha + \beta f_t$$ where $f_r = \frac{1}{3}(x_t +x_{t-1} + x_{t-2})$ . Now, your t-stat is $3$ . How would you adjust the t-stat without running a new regression in order to account for the autocorrelation? I would typically use the correct standard errors to compute this... but is there some sort of back of the envelope adjustment to make to regular standard errors when you have this type of correlation or overlapping features? $H_0: \beta = 0$
