I think you can do this by subclassing the UIImageView and detecting the touchevent and position. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint position = [touch locationInView:self]; } I havent tried this, but seems like this will solve your problem.
