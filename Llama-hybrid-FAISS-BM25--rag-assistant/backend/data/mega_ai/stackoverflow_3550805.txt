If you just want the text to show up there, but not be able to do anything with it, you can do this. File test.sh: echo "Output" ./test2.sh & File test2.sh: echo "Output2" Notice how the first script calls the second script with the & at the end. In this case, "Output2" will be written to the prompt, but it can't be deleted and will have no effect on the next command at all. But if this is something you're doing to grab the user's attention, it would work.
