Um. This list is an "internals" list. To make great engine is to make great "external" list. Look at UE3 for example -- it is here because of great tools. You need tools for world creation, to create optimal packages of resources (it should be in internal list too ;-)), for collision object specification etc. Plus, to add to Organiccat answer you should decide on tech level. You can go for simple sprites or you can want fancy effects (so shaders are needed, and with this you need infrastructure)
