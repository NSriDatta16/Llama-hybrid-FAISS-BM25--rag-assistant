"Sign-arbitrariness" is merely an artifact of how we represent the PCA results. There is no arbitrariness to the PCA itself: the eigenspaces it works with are perfectly well defined. Issues (1) and (3) are advantages of PCA, because they allow one to use subject-matter knowledge and the objectives of the analysis appropriately. Referring to this as "immature" rather misses the entire point of statistical analysis, IMHO, which is to solve real problems in creative and principled ways (as opposed to dumping data into black boxes). – whuber What I don't see here mentioned yet is that many use PCA the same way you'd use a histogram, density plot, or scatter plot: A means to quickly inspect data, rather than a final solution to a problem. PCA is useful for this purpose as the number of dimensions grows, but of course is more informative if care is taken in choosing whether and how to scale. – Frans Rodenburg
