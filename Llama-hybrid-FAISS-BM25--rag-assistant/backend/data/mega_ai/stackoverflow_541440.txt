On the iPhone, apps do not quit unless the user touches the Home button on the phone. So even if there is some valid reason that your app cannot continue, you should not quit. Just put up an alert explaining why you can't do anything - e.g. "Sorry, this application needs to be connected to the internet. Please try again when you have coverage." Then the user can read the alert, and press the home button to quit in the usual way. If the application quits on its own, it looks as though it has crashed.
