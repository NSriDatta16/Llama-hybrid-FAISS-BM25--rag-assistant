It's not common but it does get used in ecology. I've found that the terminology for this family of methods is quite inconsistent between fields, though, and this may be why you have not found it in your literature searches. From wikipedia : This [...] is variously known as standardised major axis (Ricker 1975, Warton et al., 2006), the reduced major axis , the geometric mean functional relationship (Draper and Smith, 1998), least products regression , diagonal regression , line of organic correlation , and the least areas line (Tofallis, 2002). (emphasis mine) Other identical or closely related terms: Deming regression , orthogonal regression , and major axis regression . In ecology, standardised major axis regression is the most common term. Though it also goes by the term Model II regression , at least in the R package lmodel2 developed for this by an ecologist, Pierre Legendre. I've found that this term is completely unfamiliar to statisticians from other disciplines. Here's just a few papers and packages in ecology that use these methods, based on some quick googling. Note that many of these have to do with allometric scaling relationships, where it is of obvious use: Schulte-Hostedde, A. I., Zinner, B., Millar, J. S., & Hickling, G. J. (2005).

Structured interspecific determinants of specific leaf area in 34 species of herbaceous angiosperms. Functional Ecology , 312-319. https://www.jstor.org/stable/2390579?origin=crossref These methods have their downsides, though, and despite their advantages it is sometimes better to use simple OLS. For example, I don't think it's possible to use random effects with these models, and sometimes that is of greater importance than OLS vs. TLS. For another point against them, I quote Edwards et al. (2015) summarising an argument from Smith (2009): [Standardised major axis regression] fits a line through the middle of the data that does not change if the roles of “predictor” and “response” variables are switched; in contrast, ordinary least squares regression yields a different fitted line if the y-axis and x-axis are switched (Warton et al. 2006). However, SMA regression has a different limitation, because substantial natural variation in the response variable [...] will increase the apparent steepness of the allometric slope (Smith 2009). This occurs because the SMA estimator for the slope of y vs. x is the standard deviation of y divided by the standard deviation of x (Smith 2009). It's worth reading Smith (2009) to understand this better. I should add that because the terminology is so variable, it's possible that there are subtle methodological differences that mean that not all critiques in this paper apply to TLS. Edwards, K.
