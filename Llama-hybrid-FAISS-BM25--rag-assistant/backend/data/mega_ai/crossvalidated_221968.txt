Is there a nonparametric test available in R to test for a trend in a binary variable?

I have e.g. the following (n=14) time series data: 0,0,0,1,0,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,1,0 By looking at this time series, it is easy to see that in the first half we have more zeros than ones and in the second half more ones than zeros. Therefore, it is quite probable that there is a trend from value 0 to value 1 in these observations. I have already found the u Test which allows me to test for this trend, but it requires a table to look up the p-value. ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mann%E2%80%93Whitney_U_test#Illustration_of_calculation_methods ) My question now is, if there is any test for this issue (already implemented in a R package) which doesn't require a table to look up p-values. The reason for this is that I am creating a web application (with shiny) that should be as easy to use as possible. Thanks in advance for your help!
