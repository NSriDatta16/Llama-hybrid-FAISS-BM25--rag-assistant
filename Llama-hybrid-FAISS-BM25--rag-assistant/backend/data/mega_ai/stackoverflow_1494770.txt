I am quite confident that this is not possible with standard formating. I suggest to use something like the following (C# like pseudo code). Especially I suggest to rely on string operations and not to use math code because of many possible precision and rounding problems. string numberString = number.ToStringWithFullPrecision(); int index = numberString.IndexOf('.'); while ((index If you like regular expression, you can use them to. Take the following expression and match it against the full precision number string padded with three zeros and you are done. ^([0-9]|[1-9][0-9]|100)\.(9*)([0-8][0-9]{2}) I just realized that both suggestion may cause rounding errors. 99.91238123 becomes 99.9123 when it should become 99.9124 - so the last digits requires additional correction. Easy to do, but makes my suggestion even uglier. This is far away from an elegant and smart algorithm.
