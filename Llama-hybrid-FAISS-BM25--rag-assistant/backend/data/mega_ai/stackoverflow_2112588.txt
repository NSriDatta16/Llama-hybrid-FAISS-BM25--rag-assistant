Problem setting Value for UILabel (iPhone SDK)

I'm reasonably new at the iPhone SDK, so please forgive me if this answer's ridiculously obvious. I have a ViewController connected to a .xib file (they are called FirstViewController) I also have a custom class called MyCustomClass. In this class, I have a method like this: - (void)setTheText { [myLabel setText:@"foo"]; } I want to call this method to set the text in a label in FirstViewController.xib So far, I have done this: Dragged in an "Object" into Interface Builder, and set the class to: MyCustomClass Connected up the IBOutlet 'myLabel' from MyCustomClass to a UILabel in the view. However, when I run the program, and press the button to set the label (which is in FirstViewController.m), something like: - (IBAction)doSomething:(id)sender { MyCustomClass *customClass = [MyCustomClass alloc] init]; [customClass setTheText]; } This doesn't set though. NSLog(@"%@",[myLabel text]); returns (null) Xcode shows no errors or warnings, what could be wrong? Thanks, Michael Additional Info: Interface to MyCustomClass.h: #import @interface MyCustomClass : NSObject { UILabel *myLabel; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UILabel *myLabel; - (void)setTheText; @end
