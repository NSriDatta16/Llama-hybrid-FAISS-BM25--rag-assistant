You have to supply the storage for stole , something like: unsigned char stole[1024]; This will still give a segfault if the user enters a longer string than 1024 chars though, to fix this you can use: scanf("%1023s", stole); 1023 is used instead of 1024 so that there's room for the string terminator.
