A couple of points here: The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin index test is used before factor analysis not PCA. While these two analyses are similar, they are not the same. This has been covered in many posts , but for the sake of this post I'll just note that FA is performed on the covariance matrix, while PCA is performed directly on the data. That being said, the KMO is telling us that you have a very low sample size. Additionally, PCA is generally unstable an inadvisable when your sample size is below about 200-300. You can check this by bootstrapping your PCA . You will most likely see that you get widely different PCs depending on the bootstrap iteration. As far as how you should move forward, instead of using dimensionality reduction, I would suggest some sort of variable selection method when you model your data (assuming that is what you plan to do). A random forest model may be useful considering your sample size-to-variables ratio.
