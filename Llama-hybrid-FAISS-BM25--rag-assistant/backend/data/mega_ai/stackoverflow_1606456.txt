The general uptake of C# in the marketplace has nothing really to do with language features , which I understand are now superior to Java. Adopting C# requires a complete organizational strategic shift in the main: You already have a gazillion Java applications and a host of Java developers. Why switch C#? You'll need new staff and suddenly all of your applications are legacy by definition . This is a huge deal! Undergoing this change puts a huge risk on your company for what may be only slight benefit: why bother? You are used to at least the option of many large providers of operating system and middleware which support your Java ecosystem. This disappears overnight and you expose yourself to a monopoly pricing model (i.e. you are pretty much tied in to Microsoft, to all intents and purposes). Being subject to monopoly pricing is bad! Most organizations would rather have a slight technological disadvantage to avoid monopoly pricing because the pricing will almost certainly take away any extra revenues anyway.
