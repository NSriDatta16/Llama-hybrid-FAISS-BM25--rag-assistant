It's what we call the axiom of object-oriented programming in Java. Every single abstraction in your code is an object. It contains a few things that are applicable to every peace of information you use in your code: equals and hashCode methods to establish an equality theory within the given abstraction (see corresponding javadoc ); toString to represent an object in human-readable (probably, only programmer-readable) format (because most of us still use displays and keyboards); getClass to provide reflection capabilities on the given abstraction; some methods to organize object-oriented runtime (garbage collection, synchronization, etc.). If you learn Java, it is best for you to study the "Inheritance" section of whatever book you use and then try to answer this question yourself.
