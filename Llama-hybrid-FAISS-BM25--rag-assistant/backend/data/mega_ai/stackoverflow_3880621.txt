Sitemap for a site with a large number of dynamic subdomains

I'm running a site which allows users to create subdomains. I'd like to submit these user subdomains to search engines via sitemaps. However, according to the sitemaps protocol (and Google Webmaster Tools), a single sitemap can include URLs from a single host only. What is the best approach? At the moment I've the following structure: Sitemap index located at example.com/sitemap-index.xml that lists sitemaps for each subdomain (but located at the same host). Each subdomain has its own sitemap located at example.com/sitemap-subdomain.xml (this way the sitemap index includes URLs from a single host only). A sitemap for a subdomain contains URLs from the subdomain only, i.e., subdomain.example.com/* Each subdomain has subdomain.example.com/robots.txt file: -- User-agent: * Allow: / Sitemap: http://example.com/sitemap-subdomain.xml -- I think this approach complies to the sitemaps protocol, however, Google Webmaster Tools give errors for subdomain sitemaps: "URL not allowed. This url is not allowed for a Sitemap at this location." I've also checked how other sites do it. Eventbrite, for instance, produces sitemaps that contain URLs from multiple subdomains (e.g., see http://www.eventbrite.com/events01.xml.gz ). This, however, does not comply with the sitemaps protocol. What approach do you recommend for sitemaps?
