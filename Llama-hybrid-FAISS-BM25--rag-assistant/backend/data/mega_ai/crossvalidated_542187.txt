What performance indices are best to compare two time series with different data length . Can you suggest a method to do the comparison in R/Origin

I have two data sets (observed and simulated). Observed data set is the snow depth observed at a location. The simulated is the model simulated snow depth data. These data sets have different lengths. What are the performance indices that can be used to compare the data sets. Can I carry out the comparison in R programing language or in Origin pro?. I have the data set for hourly data for 30 years. It has several peaks. .
