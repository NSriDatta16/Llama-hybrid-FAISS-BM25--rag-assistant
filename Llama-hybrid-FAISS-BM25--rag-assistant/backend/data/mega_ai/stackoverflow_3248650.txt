Unit testing an HTML parser/cleaner?

I'm trying to choose between a couple of different HTML parsers for a project I am working on, part of which accepts HTML input from the client. I've built a simple automated test for each one, to see if they fit my needs. I have a large number of real-life HTML fragments to test, but they aren't enough for testing for safety, since they (probably) do not contain any malicious code. I don't mind reviewing the outputs by hand. My question is, is there a freely available database or list of HTML snippets containing malformed HTML and scripts intended for testing for XSS?
