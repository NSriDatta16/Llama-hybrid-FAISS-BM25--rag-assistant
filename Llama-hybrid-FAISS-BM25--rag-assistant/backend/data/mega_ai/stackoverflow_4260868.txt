Rails & Dragonfly: Cleaning up unused images

I'm working on cleaning up an old Rails 2.3.5 app that uses Dragonfly to store its images. I have a feeling there are far more images in the filestore than records in the database, but due to Dragonfly's less than transparent naming scheme I have no idea how to find out which files in the filestore belong to actual records. Anyone have a good idea how I can clean this up? I'd love to get rid of several gigabytes of unused data.
