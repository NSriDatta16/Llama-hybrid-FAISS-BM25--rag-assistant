Normal distributed problem

There is given that a car has to be repaired after riding 5000 km with it. The driver rides on average 40 km/day with a standard deviation of 7 km/day. The question is how many days can the driver ride with the car so that the chance of riding more kilometers than suggested is My thought process was that you find the $X_n \sim (40, 7^2/n)$ with $n$ being the amount of days and thus unknown. In the standardnormal table we can find that So we know that $(L - 40)/(7/\sqrt n) = -2.31$ . However, we have two unknown variables now. My assumption is that you can rewrite L as 5000/n â€” maybe? The answer on the question is 120, any help is appreciated.
