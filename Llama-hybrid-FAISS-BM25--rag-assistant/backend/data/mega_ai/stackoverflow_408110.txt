How do I check out an SVN project into Eclipse as a Java project?

I was trying to check out a project from SVN using Eclipse. I tried using "Checkout As" to make it into a "Java project from existing Ant script", but the project wizard requires the file to have already been downloaded. Is there a way to checkout the project into Eclipse as a Java project, without having to download it elsewhere first? (I am using Eclipse Ganymade 3.4.1 with Subversive.)
