Interpreting negative difference in mean?

I'm currently doing a meta-analysis, looking at risk factors for the development of a disease. Most of my data has been converted to odds ratios, which I have no difficulty interpreting. However, in 10 of my studies the mean age Â± SD was given between the cases and controls. The summary difference in means was given as: -1.47 [-2.20, -0.74] The cases were younger than the controls, on average, so I understand the reason for the negative value and also that it is statistically significant because the 95% CI doesn't cross zero. With OR, I know that anything above 1 indicates increased likelihood for disease development, however, I'm not entirely sure how I should be interpreting the difference in means (or is there nothing to interpret and I'm being a bit dim)?
