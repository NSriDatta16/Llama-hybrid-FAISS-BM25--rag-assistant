The physical origin of this algorithm is some way to get intuition -- in that case, we have energies of states instead of probabilities and a system which is in a state $x_t$ and can go or not in a state $x'$. Now, isolated system will always go into a lower energy and never into higher and thus the overall distribution would be trivial -- system is stuck forever in a lowest energy state. But when we have canonical ensemble (i.e. system connected to a thermal booth of some defined temperature) our system can get a random kick from thermal fluctuation that will push it up to a higher energy; the resulting distribution would be the Boltzmann's $N_i=Q e^\frac{-E_i}{kT}$ (where $Q$ is a normalisation factor, $k$ a magic constant converting temperature to a sort of an average thermal kick amplitude and $T$ is the system's temperature). So the conditional acceptance part is just an expression of a stochastic nature of the thermal kicks.
