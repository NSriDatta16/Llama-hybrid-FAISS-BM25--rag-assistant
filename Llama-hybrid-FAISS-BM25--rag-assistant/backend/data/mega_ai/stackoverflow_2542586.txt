Because individual variables should be aligned. With your proposed formula, you'd align only the first variable on the stack, leaving following variables unaligned, which is bad for performance. This is also known as "packing" and can be done in C/C++ with pragmas, but is only useful in very specific cases and can be dangerous both for performance and as a cause of potential runtime traps. Some processors will generate faults on unaligned accesses at runtime, which will crash your program.
