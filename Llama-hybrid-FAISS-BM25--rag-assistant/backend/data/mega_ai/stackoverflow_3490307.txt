Ridiculously high latency for iPhone accelerometer and touch events

I'm working on an iPhone game using OpenGL ES. I recently updated my iPhone 3G to iOS4, and ever since the update, when I've been play-testing my app I've been getting very high latency on my accelerometer and touch events -- my phone will often respond a second later than it should, which makes the game unplayable. This doesn't occur all the time -- about half the time the game works perfectly. I've set up the accelerometer following Apple's guidelines; one of my view controllers calls [UIAccelerometer sharedAccelerometer] in its init method and implements the appropriate delegate method which just grabs the x-component of the UIAccceleration object, and I have another view connected to a view controller that detects touches using touchesBegan:withEvent: and the other touch event handlers. I emphasize that this worked fine when I was running 3.1.3. I'm totally stymied. Has anyone run into this problem before? Is this a known bug with the 3G and iOS4? Should I update to CMMotionManager?
