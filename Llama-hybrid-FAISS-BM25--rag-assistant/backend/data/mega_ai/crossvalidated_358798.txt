Time Series Forecasting - Hourly Data

I have data from a call center morning 8 am to evening 8 pm with half an hour intervals. I am trying to perform time series forecasting to predict expected number of calls during the same time frame in the coming days. I have tried using ARIMA and exponential smoothing but they haven't given me any good results. I am not sure how to bring in seasonality into picture as its only 8 am to 8 pm data. But there are almost no calls on the weekends. Is there any other algorithm/technique which I should be trying ? Would really appreciate your help. Thanks I am attaching the screen shot of the data based on time series below.
