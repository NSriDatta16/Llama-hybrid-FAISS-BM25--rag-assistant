cloudmade - draggable marker + collecting the marker coordinates to be stored or used in the application

I would like to use CloudMade mapping in one of my projects. I need to be able to create a draggable marker so users can mark a certain geographic space on the map. I would also like to be able to save the coordinates of the marker in a database. Is that possible with CloudMade and how?
