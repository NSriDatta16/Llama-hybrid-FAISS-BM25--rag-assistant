Generally speaking, having classes that are not naturally ordered creates a more difficult prediction/probability estimation problem. When a binary problem turns into a multinomial/polytomous problem the task is more difficult as more model parameters exist, the effective sample size decreases, and the sample size required to achieve a given predictive reliability increases. If some of the classes are connected, i.e., types of plastic, you can gain information and predictive reliability by using a Bayesian model that has prior distributions for parameters such that you borrow information (assume some similarity of effects) across connected categories. This reduces the effective number of parameters. Sometimes this can be done with Bayesian hierarchical random effects models. When you can assume that all levels of the outcome variable are ordered, everything changes. The effective sample size increases and the number of parameters that matter does not increase with increasing number of outcome categories. Models such as the proportional odds ordinal logistic model come into play.
