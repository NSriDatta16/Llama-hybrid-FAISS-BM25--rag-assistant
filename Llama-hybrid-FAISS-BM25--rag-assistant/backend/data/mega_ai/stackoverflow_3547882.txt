C# How to drag drop a firefox tab to a winform application

In firefox, you can dragdrop tabs to either bookmarks or any text field, but is it possible to drag drop these tab outside of firefox? Also, is there a better way than string vHTMLNames = (string)e.Data.GetData(DataFormats.Html, false); to get a dragdrop of html adress? (It is annoying to have to scan the string to find the adress lost into the spam of text that get returned).
