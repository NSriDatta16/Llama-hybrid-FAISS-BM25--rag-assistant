What structure of data use to communicate via tcp/ip in java?

Let's assume I want to send many messages between 2 programs made in java that use TCP sockets. I think the most convienient way is to send objects like: PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(s.getOutputStream()); ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(ps); some_kind_of_object_here; oos.writeObject(some_kind_of_object_here); ps.print(oos); I want to send, strings, numbers, HashMaps, boolean values How can I do this using fx 1 object that can store all that properties? I though about ArrayList that is serializable and we can put there everything but is not elegant way. I want to send different types of data because user can choose from a variety of options that server can do for it. Any advices?
