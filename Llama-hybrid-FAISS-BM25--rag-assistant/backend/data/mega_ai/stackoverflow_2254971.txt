Locate a td with a specific value using xpath

Consider the following html fragment: One 1 Two 2 I want to use xpath to find the second td ("1" or "2") based on the value of the first td ("One" or "Two). Something like: /table/tr/td[text() = 'One']/../td or /table/tr/td[text(), 'One']/../td Any ideas?
