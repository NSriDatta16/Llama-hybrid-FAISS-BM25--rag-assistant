Since I'm not able to comment (yet) I'll leave this as a separate answer - in case someone, like me, will find this question: For the question from comment "But I want the cloned/dropped element to be in the same position it was dropped. do you know how i can do it?" I've found solution in different SO question, and the answer is to change this line: $(this).append($(ui.draggable).clone()); to $(this).append($(ui.helper).clone()); (change ui.draggable to ui.helper) Hope it helps.
