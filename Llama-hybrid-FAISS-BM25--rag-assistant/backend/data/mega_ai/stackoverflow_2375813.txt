Actually, I was faced to the same choice several months ago, but for real business application, not for educational purpose. My answer is "to spark". Certainly, there are some tricky things like intellisense and includes for pre-compilation. But from my prospective, the benefits are more significant. "Readability" of views is much better in spark. There is more elegant separation into partials (again, my personal opinion). I also found spark way of site localization more natural (MyView.spark, MyView.de.spark, MyView.de-DE.spark with automatic fallback, and the same for master layouts). A plenty of small conveniences - best of all I love ${} and !{} to get html encoding or to avoid it. My application works in medium trust being pre-complied. I would rather say that spark is mature enough to be used in real development. But not perfect.
