In terms of programming, it would mean deleting lines of code. The principle being that you should strive for solutions that are of course correct, but also elegant, simple, etc. There are many benefits of this, but for starters having less code makes your programs easier to maintain, since they are easier for anyone reading them to understand. It can also allow for more flexibility, since when modifying a simpler solution you have less code to change, and can be more confident that your changes have not broken other parts of the application.
