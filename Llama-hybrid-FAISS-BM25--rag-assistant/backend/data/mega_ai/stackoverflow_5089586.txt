You have this in your code update: function(event, ui) { alert("test"); } You've bound an alert method to the update event of the sortable EDIT And if you're question is why you're getting 2 alert boxes and not just 1, it's because the update event fires for all sortable items that were changed. So including the one you dragged, and any others that had to shift position to accommodate it.
