As a newcomer to jQuery, it has to be the jQuery UI plugin, and the themes people have designed to go with it. ThemeRoller lets you quickly adapt themes and play "what if" scenarios with your application as it's being displayed in Firefox. I was able to hugely improve a web application through the use of tabs, accordion sliders, datepickers, and alerts in just a day or two starting from no knowledge of jQuery at all. More experienced web developers will like jQuery's philosophy of "unobtrusive JavaScript", its rigorous leveraging of XHTML and CSS, selectors, and chaining.
