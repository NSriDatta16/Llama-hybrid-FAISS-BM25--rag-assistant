sql server 2005 word breakers language

I have an existing db with Full Text Search in sql server 2005. Word breakers are set in language X. I want to change all of the word breaker languages on all of my full text indexes to language Y. Can someone suggest a way to do this with SQL script. What I have to do now is go to: sql server mgmt studio / my_db / storage / full text catalogs / my_catalog / properties / tables/views / and change Language for Word Breaker property one at the time.
