We use a combination of projects in order to accomplish your grouping goals. We also commonly setup a project "parking" Wiki where links to development cases, technical documentation, systems requirements, user documentation, external links to resources etc. can all be placed. It provides a good "one-stop-shop" for everything related to that project. As part of that Wiki, we would then setup two specific projects. One in relation to the large overall goals/outlines similar to what might correspond to your Project Management charts/whatnot. One in relation to the development tasks of each feature as they are broken down into the smaller and more manageable chunks. You can then, as was mentioned use case linking to both reference the "master" cases in the other project as well as reference the project Wiki itself so that you can quickly and easily get back to all of your project related information which is conveniently in one spot. You can accomplish a pile of different organizational structures using FogBugz, you just have to approach things a little differently sometimes in order to hit each and every situation. Hope that helps.
