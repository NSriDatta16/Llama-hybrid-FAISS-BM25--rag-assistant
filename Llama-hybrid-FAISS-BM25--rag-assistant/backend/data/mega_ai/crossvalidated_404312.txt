How do I find a p value using a T table with a sample size of 200?

A special study is conducted to test the hypothesis that people with glaucoma have higher blood pressure than average. In the study, 200 people with glaucoma are recruited with a mean systolic blood pressure of 140 mmHg and a standard deviation of 25 mmHg. If the average systolic blood pressure for people of comparable age is 130 mmHg, is there an association between glaucoma and blood pressure at the 0.05 significance level? The answer key says from a t table that the p value is .002 but I am confused as to how that is found. The values on the table jump from 100 to 1000 and I cannot find a table with 200.
