How can I have both "firm' and 'year' fixed effect using 'bife' fixed-effect logistic regression in R?

I am running a fixed-effect logistic regression using 'bife' command from the 'bife' R-package. Here, I am trying to have both FIRM and YEAR fixed-effects simultaneously. However, the examples I can find only has one fixed-effect not two or more. Therefore, I set up the function as below and wonder this is correct if I am trying to fix both FIRM and YEAR at the same time by using "FIRM&YEAR" since I still get the answers. bife(Y~ X1+ X2+X3+X4+X5 | FIRM&YEAR, data=DATA, model="logit") May I know whether the form above is correct? Otherwise, may I know what the correct form for this purpose is?
