Is it possible to change pandas column data type within a sklearn pipeline?

Sklearn pipeline I am using has multiple transformers but one of the initial transformers returns numerical type and the consecutive one takes object type variables. Basically I need squeeze in a: data[col] = data[col].astype(object) for the required columns within the pipeline. Is there any way to do it? Note: I am using Feature-engine transformers.
