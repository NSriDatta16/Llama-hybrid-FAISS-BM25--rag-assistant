Is it because when you cast it as base and referencing a variable, you're referencing the int member 'x' as the offset from the start of the 'base' struct? Yes. This technique is sometimes referred to as "type punning". This is used in the POSIX standard library; for example, in struct sockaddr. Usually you declare one as a sockaddr_storage, pass it around as a sockaddr, and manipulate it as a sockaddr_in or _in6 depending on what kind of address is actually stored inside it.
