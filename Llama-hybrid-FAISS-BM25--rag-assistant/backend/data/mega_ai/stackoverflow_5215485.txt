Getting closest coordinates closest to point in array

I have one point (hereafter referred to as the original point) on a grid, say for example, [3, 3] . I also have a set of points that are in the same horizontal and vertical lines as the original point, say, [[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[7,3],[8,3]] . I want some function that will return an array of at most four points: the points closest to the original point in each direction (i.e. left, right, above, below). With the example above, it would return, [[3,2],[3,4],[7,3]] because [3,2] is the closest point on the left, [3,4] is the closest point on the right, [7,3] is the closest point above, and there are no points below. (Order of direction is not important.) Is there an elegant and reasonably concise way to do this, using Javascript/JQuery?
