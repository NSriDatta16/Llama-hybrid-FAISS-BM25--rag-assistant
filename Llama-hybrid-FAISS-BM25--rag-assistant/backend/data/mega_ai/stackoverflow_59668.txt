There are "disk repair" type applications and services that can still read data off a hard drive even after it's been formatted, so simply overwriting with random 1s and 0s one time isn't sufficient if you really need to securely erase something. I would say that for the average user, this is more than sufficient, but if you are in a high-security environment (government, military, etc.) then you need a much higher level of "delete" that can pretty effectively guarantee that no data will be recoverable from the drive.
