Off the top of my head, I don't believe there's an API for it that's common across platforms. You could, however parse the output of the mount command: ~$ mount /dev/disk0s2 on / (hfs, local, journaled) devfs on /dev (devfs, local, nobrowse) map -hosts on /net (autofs, nosuid, automounted, nobrowse) map auto_home on /home (autofs, automounted, nobrowse) /dev/disk1s2 on /Users/nknight (hfs, local, nodev, nosuid, journaled, nobrowse) mount without arguments has roughly the same effect on most *nix-ish systems, though I don't believe the output format is standardized anywhere. I would encourage you to rethink your approach, however. The whole point of network filesystems is that applications aren't supposed to care about them. Consider posting another question explaining what you're trying to accomplish by doing this. Someone can probably offer a superior and more generalized solution.
