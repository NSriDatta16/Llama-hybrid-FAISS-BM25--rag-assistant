When pysvn attempts to perform operations on a repository that you access using https, it needs to validate the servers identity. This is done by calling a function called callback_ssl_server_trust_prompt. By default this function is not defined. You, as the programmer, must supply the trust information, which you do by writing a function that looks at the information in the trust dictionary, and returns a tuple of 3 values (described in the third paragraph of the documentation). Once you have written the function, you make it the callback_ssl_server_trust_prompt by assigning your function name to client.callback_ssl_server_trust_prompt
