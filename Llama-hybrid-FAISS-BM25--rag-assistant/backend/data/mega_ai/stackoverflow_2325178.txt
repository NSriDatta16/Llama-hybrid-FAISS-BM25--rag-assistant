I think this is really a problem of personal preference, so I fired up a thesaurus and looked for synonyms of "Family" (which could be ok in itself). kin, classification, genre, group, kind, subdivision, association, affiliation, alliance, clan, clique, club, coalition, combination, combo, confederacy, confederation, congress, cooperative, family, federation, fellowship, fraternity, gang, guild, league, mob, order, organization, ring, society, sodality, sorority, syndicate, tie-in, tie-up, tribe, troops, troupe, zoo I dropped a few which have a specific technical meaning (like union, ring, pool)... pick what you like best.
