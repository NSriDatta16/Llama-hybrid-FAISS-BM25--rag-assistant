If the entries in A are completely fixed, then you may approach this as a classification problem, assuming that you have enough labeled data to train the model. If the labels can change dynamically, then no. Maybe you can generate and store sentence embeddings of the entries of both A and B. Then, you may either suggest the entries of A with the closest embeddings to the new entry in B or, if the embeddings of A and B are not semantically related, you may find the closest already existing entry from B and suggest its same entries from A.
