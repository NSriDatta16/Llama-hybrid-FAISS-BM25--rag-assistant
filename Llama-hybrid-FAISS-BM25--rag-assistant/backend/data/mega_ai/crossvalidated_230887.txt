I will break this up into two separate questions and answer each. 1.) Given the different philosophical views of what probability means in a Frequentist and Bayesian perspective, are there mathematical rules of probability that apply to one interpretation and do not apply to another? No. The rules of probability remain exactly the same between the two groups. 2.) Do Bayesians and Frequentists use the same mathematical models to analyze data? Generally speaking, no. This is because the two different interpretations suggest that a researcher can gain insight from different sources. In particular, the Frequentist framework is often thought to suggest that one can make inference on the parameters of interest only from the data observed, while a Bayesian perspective suggests that one should also include independent expert knowledge about the subject. Different data sources means different mathematical models will be used for analysis. It is also of note that there are plenty divides between the models used by the two camps that is more related to what has been done than what can be done (i.e. many models that are traditionally used by one camp can be justified by the other camp). For example, BUGs models (Bayesian inference Using Gibbs sampling, a name that no longer accurately describes the set of models for many reasons) are traditionally analyzed with Bayesian methods, mostly due to the availability of great software packages to do this with (JAGs, Stan for example). However, there is nothing that says these models must be strictly Bayesian. In fact, I worked on the project NIMBLE that builds these models in the BUGs framework, but allows the user much more freedom on how to make inference on them. While the vast majority of the tools we provided were customizable Bayesian MCMC methods, one could also use maximum likelihood estimation, a traditionally Frequentist method, for these models as well. Similarly, priors are often thought of as what you can do with Bayesian that you cannot do with Frequentist models. However, penalized estimation can provide for the same models using regularizing parameter estimates (although the Bayesian framework provides an easier way of justifying and choosing regularization parameters, while Frequentists are left with, in a best case scenario of a lots of data, "we chose these regularization parameters because over a large number of cross-validated samples, they lowered the estimated out of sample error"...for better or for worse).
