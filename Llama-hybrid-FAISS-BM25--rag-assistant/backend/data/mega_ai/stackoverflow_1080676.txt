You have to make a new object. There's no way to magically update the existing objects. Read the reload builtin documentation - it is very clear. Here's the last paragraph: If a module instantiates instances of a class, reloading the module that defines the class does not affect the method definitions of the instances â€” they continue to use the old class definition. The same is true for derived classes. There are other caveats in the documentation, so you really should read it, and consider alternatives. Maybe you want to start a new question with why you want to use reload and ask for other ways of achieving the same thing.
