The OpenID identity verification process most commonly uses the following steps: The user enters their OpenID into a field on the consumer'ssite, and hits a login button. The consumer site discovers the user's OpenID provider using the Yadis protocol. The consumer site sends the browser a redirect to the OpenID provider. This is the authentication request as described in the OpenID specification. The OpenID provider's site sends the browser a redirect back to the consumer site. This redirect contains the provider's response to the authentication request. your web app needs to keep track of: -the user's identity URL and the list of endpoints discovered for that URL -State of relationships with servers, i.e. shared secrets (associations) with servers and nonces seen on signed messages. This information should persist from one session to the next and should not be bound to a particular user-agent. hope this helps:D
