How to Characterise These Markov Chains?

I have the following two Markov chains: 1. 2. I'm trying to characterise them. Unfortunately, I have no idea how to "characterise" them. At best, I can tell that chain 2 looks a lot "healthier" than chain 1. I've attempted to search for any documents that explain how to characterise Markov chains, but I've been unable to find any. The best I've been able to do is the wikipedia page on Markov chain Monte Carlo and a wikipedia page on stationary processes. However, the former doesn't seem to offer anything useful in this regard, and, since both chains seem to be stationary, nor does the latter. Am I correct in saying that Markov chain 2 is "healthier" than Markov chain 1, in that Markov chain 1 seems to be more "jumpy" at some points and less "smooth" overall? How can I characterise these chains? I would greatly appreciate it if people could please provide me with some direction, so that I can learn how to "characterise" these Markov chains. I can't seem to find any resources on the matter.
