This approach grates my soul. I think it makes a lot more sense to keep your test code separate from your production code. Many reasons: Theoretically, you should be testing at the interface of your code and not have access to things like the private members behind the scenes. Organization - having all of your tests in a separate project means your main application won't be cluttered with test code. This would bloat the size of your deliverables. Putting everything in one place makes it harder for a team to work on the codebase at the same time (one person on tests, one on the code, etc). Most of all: It just plains feels / smells wrong.
