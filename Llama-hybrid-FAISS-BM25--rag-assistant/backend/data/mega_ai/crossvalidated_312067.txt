Remember you are estimating the slopes. As you state it, the question is not "is the blue line statistically significantly above the other lines", but, "are the slopes really different"? The first question is really about the significance of the intercept and/or dummy variables. Look at the t-stats and values for the three slopes. Roughly speaking, the problem you are asking is not a lot different than this one: "if I measure the average height of 30 students in three different classrooms, is one of the rooms taller than the others with statistical significance?" But, you are substituting "slope of regression line" in place of "height"
