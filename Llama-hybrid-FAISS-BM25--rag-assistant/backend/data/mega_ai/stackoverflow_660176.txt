At a former job, we used a preprocessor to handle this. We declared classes using a simple C++-style syntax, and the preprocessor generated C headers that were basically equivalent to the First Method, but without the #includes. It also did cool things like generating vtables and macros for upcasting and downcasting. Note that this was in the days before good C++ compilers existed for all the platforms we targeted. Now, doing this would be stupid.
