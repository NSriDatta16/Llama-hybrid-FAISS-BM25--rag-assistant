After having a bit of a look at the source, it seems you'll have to do something like this: $.event._dpCache[$('.date-pick')[0]._dpId]._applyRenderCallbacks() or possibly this: $.event._dpCache[$('.date-pick')[0]._dpId]._rerenderCalendar() The $.event._dpCache[$('.date-pick')[0]._dpId] part is used to get the first internal DatePicker object matching the css '.date-pick' , which is needed to access the internal _applyRenderCallbacks and _rerenderCalendar functions. Unfortunately, this does access the internal structure of the plugin, so it is possible it might break when new versions are released, however I couldn't find any publicly accessible way to refresh the calendar.
