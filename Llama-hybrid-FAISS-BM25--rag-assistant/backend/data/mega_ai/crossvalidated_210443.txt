The method discussed in the article you mention is directly inspired from the paper 'Statistical Arbitrage in the U.S. Equities Market' by Avellaneda & Lee (2008). Most of your questions are answered in the Appendix p.44. Suppose we are at the end of trading day $D$. In the Avellaneda & Lee paper the s-score is defined as $$ s = \frac{X - m}{\sigma_{eq}} $$ It is a measure of the distance to equilibrium of the current cointegration residual $X$ i.e. how far away is $X$ (in standard deviation units) from the theoretical equilibrium value $m$ predicted by a mean-reversion model yet to be estimated. In practice, using the notations of your paper and considering a 60-days trailing estimation window, $X$ evaluates as $$ X := \sum_{j=t_1}^{t_{60}} \epsilon_j $$ with $\{\epsilon_j\}$ the regression residuals computed as $$ \epsilon_j = R_j^1 - \left(\hat{\beta}_0 + \hat{\beta}R_j^2\right),\ \ \ \forall j=t_1,...,t_{60} $$ where $\{R_j^i\}$ figures the 60 most recent close-to-close returns of the 2 securities of interest in case of pairs trading. If $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}$ are OLS estimators then it is well-known that the regression residuals $\{\epsilon_j\}$ will be uncorrelated and have zero mean such that $X = 0$ and the s-score becomes $$ s = -\frac{m}{\sigma_{eq}} $$ where the parameters $m$ (stationary mean) and $\sigma_{eq}$ (square root of stationary variance) of the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process $(X_t)_{t\geq0}$ are estimated as follows: Calculate the auxiliary values $\{X_k\}$ as follows $$X_k = \sum_{j=t_1}^{k} \epsilon_j,\ \ \ \forall k = t_1,\dots,t_{60}$$ where the $\epsilon_j$ are the factor model regression residuals discussed above (note that $X = X_{60}$ by construction). Calibrate an AR(1) model to the previous values $$X_{k+1} = a + b X_k + \zeta_{k+1},\ \ \ \forall k = t_1,\dots,t_{59}$$ i.e. perform yet another linear (lagged-)regression to determine $\hat{a}$, $\hat{b}$ (intercept and slope) along with the regression residuals $\{\zeta_{k}\}$,. Comparing the Euler discretisation of the Ornstein-Uhlenbek SDE (see equation 2.3 in your paper) to the AR(1) model above, infer the parameters of the OU process from $\hat{a}$, $\hat{b}$ and the auxialiary regression residuals $\{\zeta_{k}\}$, see original paper. At the end you should end up with $$ m = \frac{\hat{a}}{1-\hat{b}} $$ $$ \sigma_{eq} = \sqrt{\frac{\text{var}(\{\zeta_{k}\})}{1-\hat{b}^2}}$$ The idea is then that, depending on the strength of the mean-reversion signal (= the value of the $s$-score), we decide on day $D$ to buy/sell at tomorrow's open (or close an existing position), see original paper. Obviously, on day $D+1$, based on the new closing prices that you will observe end of day, you will be able to compute a new $s$-score by repeating the steps above (sticking to a 60-days trailing estimation window, which will now contain the most recent return corresponding to day $D+1$, while the oldest one corresponding to $D-61$ will have disappeared). Repeating this on different days allows you to plot a graph where the $s$-score evolves through time as in Figure 10 of the original article.
