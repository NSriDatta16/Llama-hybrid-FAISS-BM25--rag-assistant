vertical align and valign not working on table!

I am dynamically generating a table using AJAX. The structure of the table to be populated is as follows: Name The cell data contains either: an image a div wrapper with anchor tags and paragraphs I tried the following: setting valign="top" (separately) at the table , th and tr levels - it had no effect setting style="vertical-align: top;" (separately) at the table , th and tr levels - it had no effect I don't want to set the align property at the cell level because it will cause too much unnecessary bloat if the table contains several (say hundreds of) rows. How can I force a table to vertically align its cell contents to top (bearing in mind that the cells contain block elements?
