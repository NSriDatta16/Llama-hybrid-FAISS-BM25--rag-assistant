There is no statistical reason this is not allowed, in my view this decision should be based on the ecology. However, you should consider whether the species distribution model is actually any good - do your model evaluation. Also - with the prediction surface you will also have some uncertainty. Lots of two-stage approaches ignore this uncertainty. If you have a full Bayesian analysis then you can use your posterior surface as a prior in the other model. If you are being frequentist and your model is quick to fit you might want to consider bootstrapping as a way to propagate uncertainty.
