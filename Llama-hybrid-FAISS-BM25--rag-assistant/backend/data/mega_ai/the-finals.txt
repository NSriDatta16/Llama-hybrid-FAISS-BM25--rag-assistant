The Finals is a free-to-play first-person shooter developed and published by Embark Studios. The game focuses on team-based matches on maps with a destructible environment, where players (who are divided into a number of distinct classes) are encouraged to use the dynamic environment to their advantage. Gameplay The Finals revolves around players competing in the titular fictional VR combat game show set in the year 2100. This is reflected in the holographic crowds which are seen during gameplay, as well as the commentary provided by the game in the form of The Finals' two hosts making observations about the status of a given team or the game itself. Developer Embark Studios has stated that the game is partly inspired by The Hunger Games and Gladiator (2000). Most game modes feature 2, 3, or 4 teams, each competing against each other in a free-for-all competition. The players choose between the Light, Medium, or Heavy class, with their character model changing to reflect that. Each build has access to a unique arsenal of specializations, weapons, and gadgets. They also each have a different movement speed, health bar and size. Light contestants are smallest, with fast speed and high burst damage, but the lowest health in the game. Medium builds are a traditional soldier class, with median speed, size, and health. Heavy builds are the largest, with the most survivability and health but the slowest movement speed. Each class has unique gadgets and specializations in addition to some universally available gadgets, allowing players to design a set of equipment that suits their play style. The Light build is given specializations related to stealth and movement: the Cloaking Device, Evasive Dash, or the Grappling Hook. The gadgets unique to the Light build also help them evade and flank enemies, including Gateways, Vanishing Bombs and Sonar Grenades, making them "glass-cannon" ambushers. The Medium build features many deployables and equipment that provide general utility, including the Healing Beam, the Defibrillator, the Guardian Turret, and a Dematerializer that can create holes in the terrain that can be seen through, shot through, and passed through. The Heavy build is given powerful destructive tools, such as the Sledgehammer, RPG-7, and C4, as well as defensive measures like deployable Barricades, a wide Mesh Shield, and a spherical Dome Shield. The game mechanics encourage emergent gameplay by the way of the many free variables present. These include highly player-modifiable terrain (both destruction and limited construction), varied weather conditions and time of day (which change between matches), and additional features such as moving platforms or structures suspended in the air. The arenas contain many items that can be picked up and thrown by the player, including but not limited to plant pots, chairs, and tables. Different types of canisters and barrels can also be found both placed around the arena, and suspended in hanging boxes. These canisters can explode to damage the environment, or create various game elements such as fires, toxic gas clouds, glitch explosions that interrupt player gadgets, etc. Entire buildings can be toppled if the correct supports are targeted, and large enough debris can destroy other buildings. The game also allows for limited construction, though this takes the form of deployable cover (such as Barricades), as well as through the use of the Goo Gun, Goo Grenade and Goo Barrels, which create solid, destructible barriers that resemble foam insulation. Additionally, several game elements have interactions with each other, such as smoke extinguishing fires, fire dissipating toxic gas clouds and burning down goo, and smoke hiding toxic gas clouds. Players who are killed are turned into team-colored statues that their teammates can carry and interact with to revive them. It takes five seconds of continuous interaction to revive a player, but Medium-class players may use a defibrillator on a sta
