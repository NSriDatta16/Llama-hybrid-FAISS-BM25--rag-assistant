What are the indexes and padding on the server? You may need to rebuild your indexes with more space in your pages and/or consider which indexes you really need. If you want a quick test try ALTER INDEX ALL ON dbname.dbo.tablename REORGANIZE. Also consider the usage on the production server. In your test it's likely you (or very few) are the only person read/writing. Get an idea for what else is going on in the db while you are doing this insert. If both of those fail, run some monitoring on the production server and see if it's being slammed by other processes.
