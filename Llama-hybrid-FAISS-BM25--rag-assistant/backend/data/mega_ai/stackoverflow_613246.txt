How does Vista Recycle bin work?

I am trying to write a python module to move files to the 'Recycle Bin' on both Mac and PC. Is there a way, only from the commandline (and yes, I mean using absloutly no C#/C++/etc) to move a file into the Recycle Bin, and have it appear as a file trashed by drag and drop (or deleted via SHFileOperation, etc).
