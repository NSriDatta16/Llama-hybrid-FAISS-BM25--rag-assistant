jQueryUI setting options in a variable - syntax for effects

$(function(){ var dialogOpts = { autoOpen: false, height: 400, width: 600, position: ["center", "center"], modal: false, closeOnEscape: true, stack: true, draggable: true, show: "clip", hide: "bounce" }; I'm setting the above options for a jQuery UI Dialog but want to dictate some options for each of the effects, such as speed and number of bounces etc, but I can't find an example of the syntax anywhere. I've tried show: ["clip", 100], and the like but they're not hitting the mark. Can you suggest anything?
