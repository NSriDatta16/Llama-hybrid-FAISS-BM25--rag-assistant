Unfortunately, this is a huge source of pain with the LINQ to SQL designer. I do not know of a way to force visual studio to never add a default connection string when you drag tables or stored procedures onto the design surface. We work around the issue thusly: we never save our dev passwords we never use the default connection string in code when newing up a DataContext we can therefore "safely" ignore the multiple connection strings during sprints that touch the data layer when things die down/become more stable, we delete the connection strings from the data context, either using properties of the designer surface itself or by editing the XML. At that point, it's up to the modifier of the data context to keep up with deleting the default connection strings. Alas, this is not an ideal situation. Hopefully VS2010 will "fix" this issue.
