Should be more like Some Text If you click on the link, the browser will automatically jump the element with id or name "some name" , e.g. Some more text. You will also see that the URL changes. The generic format of a URL is (more or less): :// / ? # The fragment identifier is what you are talking about to and it refers content inside the page. The href attribute above actually contains a URL, a relative one . That means, this URL should be interpreted relatively to the current URL. If you current URL is http://www.example.com/some/path then clicking on the link will lead you to http://www.example.com/some/path#some%20name As already said, the fragment identifier refers to a part in the current page, so the browser does not reload the page but just jumps to that part.
