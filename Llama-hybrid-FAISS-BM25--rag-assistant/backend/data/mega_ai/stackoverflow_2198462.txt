William Todd Salzman's answer covers most points. I have a couple more to add: Make sure the pacakge ProtectionLevel property is DontSaveSensitive If you are working with different shipping environments, then a SQL Server table as a source for the package configurations is maybe not for you, as you will require one central database containing all the connection strings for all the servers. Having worked with package configurations retrieved from the registry, you will need to be aware that these settings are retrieved from the HKEY_CURRENT_USER hive. This has implications for when the package is run through a SQL Agent Job.
