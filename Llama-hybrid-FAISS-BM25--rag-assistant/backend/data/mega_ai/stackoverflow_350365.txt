First off, spend a day with SQL Profiler running in the background. At the end of the day, save the trace data to a file and have the Optimization wizard pour over it and evaluate your current index. That should tell you if changing the indexed fields, sort order, etc. can give you any significant gains. Do not let the wizard make the changes. If the percentage performance gain looks significant (> 30% IMHO), go ahead and make the change yourself. Your index has to be getting on the large side. You may want to schedule a job (overnight, a couple times a week) to do the following: Move data over a certain age to a history table defrag the index recalculate metrics That will keep it speedy once you have tuned the indexes.
