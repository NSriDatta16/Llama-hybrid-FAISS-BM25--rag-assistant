First create an outlet to the items in IB. Then you can modify the methods called by using [myItem setTarget:] and [myItem setAction:]. See target action ETA: Is there any particular reason you want to do it programmatically? ETAA: To do it non-programmatically, make a function with return type IBAction, and argument (id)sender, like so: - (IBAction)myMethod:(id)sender; With whatever implementation you like. Then, in IB, drag an object object from the Library to the MainWindow.xib window, and in the identity window (cmd-6), give it the class that has your function. Then, in the connections window of that object (cmd-5), you can drag from your function name to whichever interface object you want. I strongly suggest you read mac dev on IB . The connections and bindings section will discuss this particular issue.
