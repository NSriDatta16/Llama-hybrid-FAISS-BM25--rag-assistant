Wcf remote procedure calls

I have created a custom release/deployment log application for a large organization. Front end has been implemented in Adobe AIR backed up by PHP using amfphp for communication. Performance has been excellent. Currently, I have been asked to integrate some windows features (i.e outlook calendar, sharepoint). I thought it would be easier going with a native client and I tried creating a mockup in wpf(managed, but still native) and it looks really good. My problem though is on the server side. I had in mind wcf, but to my surprise it is a soap framework(xml) and does not support object exchange between the client and the server. So my problem is how to sent to the client a "user" object as I already do with amphph?
