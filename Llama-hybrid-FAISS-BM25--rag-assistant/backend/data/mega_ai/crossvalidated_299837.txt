Comparing 2 time series with ARIMA

How to statistically compare two time series? After reading the above responses, I realized that what I should be doing for my data is exactly what https://stats.stackexchange.com/users/3382/irishstat recommended. However, I am having trouble determining the correct parameters for the arima(p,d,q) function in r. Could someone provide a detailed tutorial for how to correctly choose these values? I know that the time series need to be stationary, which is simple enough to test. I also know the acf/pacf graphs are used for this, but it's still a bit foggy and I want my statistics to be sound. I have been unable to find a successful guide- most of the walkthroughs I have seen skim over the part of choosing the p,d,q values. EDIT: I've added the 2 time series that I have been working on. The data is sampled bi-monthly for 9 months (excepting Dec, Jan, and Feb). alpha, in this case, is the TN data aggregated by month and year, which allowed me to coerce it to a time series. For our purposes, monthly averages are good enough to display what we are trying to look at. Another important note, these 2 time series have the proper time window, etc., but they are merely examples. They are not the final time series that I will use in the analysis. Final note, the NAs in the first time series caused gaps in the plots, but it is not difficult to apply a gap-filling function, which would generate a plot much like the second. These time series are clearly not models, but simply points stored in the time series format. I believe that using a model is the best way to compare them, but I am not sure. I was also able to decompose the model to remove the seasonal data, and I was curious if it would be better to compare the series with the seasonal component removed. alpha alpha Month Year TN 1 3 2011 2.550675 2 4 2011 2.166793 3 5 2011 1.666279 4 6 2011 1.235067 5 7 2011 1.306130 6 8 2011 1.380530 7 9 2011 1.434623 8 10 2011 1.599755 9 11 2011 2.261617 10 3 2012 2.529887 11 4 2012 1.938779 12 5 2012 1.700785 13 6 2012 1.160013 14 7 2012 1.099877 15 8 2012 1.244322 16 9 2012 1.471384 17 10 2012 1.695036 18 11 2012 1.959646 19 3 2013 2.808547 20 4 2013 2.546227 21 5 2013 2.112756 22 6 2013 1.875753 23 7 2013 1.882885 24 8 2013 2.010292 25 9 2013 1.771419 26 10 2013 1.820127 27 11 2013 2.351775 28 3 2014 3.002976 29 4 2014 2.286398 30 5 2014 2.177926 31 6 2014 1.772718 32 7 2014 1.245376 33 8 2014 1.274671 34 9 2014 1.378657 35 10 2014 1.554602 36 11 2014 1.702360 37 3 2015 2.771875 38 4 2015 2.373219 39 5 2015 2.025162 40 6 2015 1.607793 41 7 2015 1.656044 42 8 2015 1.525059 43 9 2015 1.494547 44 10 2015 1.746673 45 11 2015 1.942351 V1 plot(TNts) Nan_Up_Ag Nan_Up_Ag Date TN 1 2011-04-15 3.3625000 2 2011-05-15 2.8972222 3 2011-06-15 3.6680000 4 2011-07-15 1.8125000 5 2011-08-15 1.5816667 6 2011-09-15 2.5475000 7 2011-10-15 3.4550000 8 2011-11-15 3.9600000 9 2012-04-15 3.5683333 10 2012-05-15 2.6991667 11 2012-06-15 2.0630000 12 2012-07-15 1.6233333 13 2012-08-15 1.4250000 14 2012-09-15 2.3961111 15 2012-10-15 2.9616667 16 2012-11-15 3.8216667 17 2013-03-15 4.6820000 18 2013-04-15 5.6225000 19 2013-05-15 3.5658333 20 2013-06-15 0.4916667 21 2013-07-15 2.8266667 22 2013-08-15 2.9216667 23 2013-09-15 2.7991667 24 2013-10-15 2.5875000 25 2013-11-15 3.4583333 26 2014-03-15 4.6200000 27 2014-04-15 3.9941667 28 2014-05-15 3.4116667 29 2014-06-15 2.8661111 30 2014-07-15 2.2483333 31 2014-08-15 2.0416667 32 2014-09-15 2.1316667 33 2014-10-15 2.6465000 34 2014-11-15 3.2133333 35 2015-03-15 4.1460000 36 2015-04-15 4.1650000 37 2015-05-15 3.6616667 38 2015-06-15 3.0483333 39 2015-07-15 2.8133333 40 2015-08-15 2.4466667 41 2015-09-15 2.1983333 42 2015-10-15 3.0233333 43 2015-11-15 3.3060000 Nan_Up_ts plot.ts(Nan_Up_ts)
