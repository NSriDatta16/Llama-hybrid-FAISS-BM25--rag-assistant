Use of Metropolis & Rejection & Inverse Transform sampling methods

I know that the Inverse Transform method is not always a good option to sample from distributions because it is a analytical method dependent on the shape of the distribution function. For example, the inverse one dimensional Gaussian distribution is impossible to compute, however, the sampling gives good results. I could say that for me, this method is all I need. But, could the MCMC methods ( Metropolis-Hastings or Rejection ) perform better than Inverse Transform? Are the MCMC methods better than IT because they cover more rare events ? Or, are there any other advantages? Some examples could help! Thanks!
