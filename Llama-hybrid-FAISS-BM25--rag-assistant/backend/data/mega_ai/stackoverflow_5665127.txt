Poll applet download progress in jnlp with applet descriptor and in javascript

I have a WebStart applet that I deploy using the deployJava script. The jnlp file looks like this: someApp someCompany someDescription someShortDescription As you can see, my applet is 1x1 in size, so I don't want to display anything with it. It just serves to expose some java methods to javascript. So, if I make a javascript call, for example //javascript code var applet = document.getElementById('appletName'); I get a valid handle to the applet and I am able to call its methods in javascript like this: //javascript code applet.doStuff(); Of course, every applet has the isActive() method defined, so in my javascript code I can check like this if the applet is fully loaded: //javascript code function isFullyLoaded() { if ( !applet.isActive() ){ setTimeout('isFullyLoaded()',1000); } else { //do nice stuff requiring the applet is loaded } } However, as the loading of the applet might take a while, I would like to have a progress indication of its loading. A quick look at Sun (or Oracle, if you are so inclined) shows this: http://download.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/applet/customProgressIndicatorForApplet.html However, this implies that I want to show a loading bar or anything when the applet loads. I dislike applet appearance and that is why I just want to poll applet loading with javascript, like that on some interval: //javascript code alert(applet.getLoadingProgress()); What should I do and should I change jnlp declaration or anything like that. Any pointers or comments would be appreciated. Note that I don't want a custom progress bar, but just a structure so that I can poll progress with javascript during loading. Cheers. Edit: @amol I will bring to your attention that JNLP deployed applets and application, during their loading, call a generic DownloadServiceListener class's method progress(java.net.URL url, java.lang.String version, long readSoFar, long total, int overallPercent) whenever one of the jars required is downloaded. Knowing the total numbers of jars and the number of jars yet to be downloaded will serve as a perfect progress indicatior. I want also to bring to your attention that if you debug the JNLP deployment, you will see these methods being called and logging as network level events. So, my question is how to get a hang of these methods using javascript so i can have some estimate about progress as I don't want the user to look at java console to estimate progress. I don't want to also show an indeterminate progress loader, as it is a breeze to implement that, but no practical use whatsoever.
