The suggestion of @Rspeare is inadequate because it will inflate alpha type-I error rate, similar to experimentwise error rate while doing multiple t-tests (a t-test is after all the equivalent of case 1 regression). If you must conduct multiple case 1 regressions for $\hat{y_t}$, make sure to be more conservative in your alpha level of statistical significance and explicitly report your inflated error rate. Correcting for experimentwise error rate is plausible as well, but I'm nto sure how to do that with time series data. For what it's worth, it seems like you are describing an interrupted time series, where the focus is not the behavior, but rather the effect of the intervention is the focus. Glass (1975) is the standard for this type of analysis with ARIMA models. Also, since you mentioned R, I suggest looking at Hyndaman & Khandakar's forecast package. Also, you may be interested in ARIMAX models, which allow analysis of additional exogenous aggressors in an ARIMA model.
