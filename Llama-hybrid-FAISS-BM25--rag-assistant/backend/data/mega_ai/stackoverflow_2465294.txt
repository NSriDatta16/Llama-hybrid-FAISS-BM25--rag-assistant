MYSQL KEY-VALUE PAIR Viability

I am new to MySQL and I am looking for some answers to the following questions: a) Can MySQL community server be leveraged for a key-value pair type database? b) Which MySQL engine is best suited for a key-value pair type database? c) Is MySQL cluster a must for horizontal scaling of key-value based datastore or can it be acheived using MySQL replication? d) Are there any docs or whitepapers for best practices when implementiing a key-value datastore on MySQL? e) Are there any known big implementations other than friendfeed doing key-value pair using MySQL?
