You might be looking for something more like independent component analysis (ICA). The goal there is to find the statistically independent components in a latent space that generated the observed features. In the standard, linear version of ICA there are just as many independent features found as features in each sample vector, but there are generalizations of ICA to the nonlinear case which act in a manner similar to an autoencoder and can produce latent factor spaces of lower dimension than the original feature space. This may be related to factor disentanglement or for a linear alternative to low-rank representations , depending on your overall goals and linearity requirements.
