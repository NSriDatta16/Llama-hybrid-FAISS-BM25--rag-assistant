Fold-change (or percentage change) is a perfectly reasonable way to want to interpret data, but indeed, just normalizing as you have done creates the issue you've noticed. It's actually worse than just visual interpretation - if you have a model that assumes additive errors, normalizing as you've done causes the errors to become multiplicative. This makes interpretation and statistics much more difficult - after all, a drug that halves your response and a drug that doubles your response have equal effects (in opposite directions), but 200% and 50% don't average to 100%! Fortunately, there's a pretty simple solution: take the log of your data! Here, I've taken the log base 10. Days compound-1 compound-1rep compound-2 compound-2rep 0 2.126359 2.13389 0.586587 0.592177 50 1.646011 1.662002 0.123852 0.082785 100 1.5989 1.620656 -0.5376 -0.46852 150 1.664924 1.684037 0.209515 0.232996 200 1.344589 1.380573 0.075547 0.139879 Then, you can normalize the Day 0 value to 0, if you want (which is equivalent to dividing all your values by the first value in the time course). Since you have multiple replicates for each compound, I normalized to the average Day 0 value for each compound. Days compound-1 compound-1rep compound-2 compound-2rep 0 -0.00377 0.003766 -0.00279 0.002795 50 -0.48411 -0.46812 -0.46553 -0.5066 100 -0.53122 -0.50947 -1.12698 -1.0579 150 -0.4652 -0.44609 -0.37987 -0.35639 200 -0.78554 -0.74955 -0.51384 -0.4495 These values can be directly interpreted as fold-changes in whatever this metric is compared to day 0 for each time course. To compute that, you'd just compute 10 to the power of any element in the table and you'd have the fold-change (which you can convert to a percentage if you like). This approach expresses your data as a fold-change while having your data still make sense - a 10-fold increase would be +1, while a 10-fold increase would be -1, rather than 10x and 0.1x. In fact, this is why log-fold-change is a common metric in chemical and biological studies. This also helps make more visual sense of your data - you can see that the original data is hard to interpret: On the other hand, the log-fold-change graph makes it more clear that while both compounds have similar effects.
