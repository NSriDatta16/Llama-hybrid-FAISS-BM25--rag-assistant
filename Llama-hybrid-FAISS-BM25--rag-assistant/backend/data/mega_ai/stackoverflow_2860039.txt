To hide a web part altogether, set the web part's Hidden property to true. We follow this approach to hide a web part based on the existence/absence of some properties in a user's profile. A hidden web part is still on the page, and takes part in the page lifecycle, but it's not visible to users. If you're still having problems with permissions errors, try catching the specific exception and using that as a test on whether or not to hide the part. Certainly there's more elegant ways to checking permissions, but this approach should be quick and easy.
