interpreting assumption tests for multilevel modelling

I have run a multilevel logistic regression model using the glme package in R. I now need to test the assumptions but I am not sure how to interpret the graphs I get, nor whether I'm doing the correct assumption tests. Some background: my outcome variable is binary (spelling accuracy: 1= correct, 0= incorrect) my predictors are all continuous and are all characteristics of the items (Words) I have 2 crossed random effects: participants (97) and items (20 words used in the spelling task) All participants had to spell all 20 words. My model code is as follows: M1 It's a non-linear model so I don't test for the assumption of linearity (right?) For homogeneity of variance I ran a fitted vs residuals plot plot(M1) This is the outcome, how do I interpret this? It looks like a clear violation but not sure what's happening, or what I can do to fix it. I then tested that the residuals are normally distributed qqnorm(resid(M1), main="Q-Q plot for conditional residuals") qqnorm(ranef(M1)$items$`(Intercept)`, main="Q-Q plot for the random intercept") Which gave me the following: Still unsure how to interpret these, but I think they look relatively normal? Are there any other tests I have to run? And from these tests would I have to transform my data in some way first before using the model? Would really appreciate the help as I am way out of my depth here.
