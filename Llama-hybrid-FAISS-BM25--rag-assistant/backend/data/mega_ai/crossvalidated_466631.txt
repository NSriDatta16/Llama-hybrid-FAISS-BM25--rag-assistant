I think there are really two questions here Question 1: Formula for FDR and local fdr under Lehmann alternatives Note that from the problem setup we have to assume differentiability (existence of densities $f_1$ resp $f_0$ with respect to the Lebesgue measure) for both distributions $F_1$ , resp $F_0$ . Since $F_1(z) = F_0(z)^{\alpha}$ we get by the chain rule that $f_1(z) = \alpha f_0(z) F_0(z)^{\alpha-1}$ . $F_0$ and $F_1$ are mixed at proportions $\pi_0, \pi_1$ to produce $F$ . Further let us recall the definition of Bayesian (or marginal) FDR and local fdr, $$\text{FDR}(z) = \frac{\pi_0 F_0(z)}{F(z)},\;\;\text{fdr}(z)=\frac{\pi_0 f_0(z)}{f(z)}$$ By direct calculation and letting $\pi_1 = 1-\pi_0$ , we see that $$\text{FDR}(z)/(1-\text{FDR}(z))= (\pi_0 F_0(z))/(\pi_1 F_1(z)) = \pi_0/\pi_1 F_0(z)^{1-\alpha}$$ Similarly: $$\frac{\text{fdr}(z)}{1-\text{fdr}(z)} = \frac{\pi_0 f_0(z)}{\pi_1 f_1(z)}=\frac{\pi_0 f_0(z)}{\pi_1 \alpha f_0(z) F_0(z)^{\alpha-1}} = \frac{\pi_0 F_0(z)^{1-\alpha}}{\alpha \pi_1}$$ Now take logarithms of the two expressions and subtract them to get: $$\log\left(\frac{\text{fdr}(z)}{1-\text{fdr}(z)}\right)-\log\left(\frac{\text{FDR}(z)}{1-\text{FDR}(z)}\right) = -\log(\alpha)$$ This is the result we were looking for. Question 2: Why is the local fdr typically larger than FDR? For Lehmann Alternatives, this follows immediately from the preceding display, recalling that $\alpha and that $u \mapsto \log(u/(1-u))$ is strictly increasing. Another case where the local fdr is seen to be larger than the FDR is the following: Let us assume our test statistic is a p-value, so take $F_0$ to be $U[0,1]$ , i.e. $F_0(p) = p, p \in [0,1]$ . Assume the alternative $F_1$ is concave, i.e. its density $f_1$ is non-increasing (if you look at p-value histograms from real data, they will often seem like a mixture of a uniform distribution plus a peak to the left which decreases as $p$ becomes larger). Notice that then also $F(z)$ will be concave. Then by concavity, we may check that: $$ F(p) \geq F(0) + p f(p) \geq p f(p) \Rightarrow \frac{1}{f(p)} \geq \frac{p}{F(p)}$$ Multiplying both sides by $\pi_0$ and noting $f_0(p) = 1$ , we get: $$ \frac{\pi_0 f_0(p)}{f(p)} \geq \frac{\pi_0 F_0(p)}{F(p)} $$ But this of course, is the same as $\text{fdr}(p) \geq \text{FDR}(p)$ .
