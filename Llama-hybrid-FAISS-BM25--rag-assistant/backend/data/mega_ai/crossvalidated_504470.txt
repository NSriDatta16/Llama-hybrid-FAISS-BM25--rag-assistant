How can I infer the precision of my sample?

Let's say I have a survey about the quality of my product. But only 30% of my customers answered. If, for instance, the average rate for my product quality is 7, what can I infer from the real rate? I mean, if 100% of my customers rated the product, would the rate be 10, 0 or actually 7? Is there any way of doing this sort of inference? I checked some other questions, such as what can I infer if my data follows power law? , Given a set of sub-graphs, how to infer the underlying graph? and Non-response rate . And even though the first and last one are somehow related, I don't think, or I'm not sure, I can relate the answer to my problem.
