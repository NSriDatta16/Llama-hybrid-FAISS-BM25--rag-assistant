GLMM Models in R

I want to see if there is a significant relationship between the mating (response variable) and several explanatory variables such as individual number (categorical), leg movement (continuous) and the reuse of individuals (categorical). My data looks like this: Mating ID Replication Shaking 1 M1 R1 10 0 M1 R2 14 0 M2 R1 15 0 M2 R2 12 1 M3 R1 14 0 M3 R2 17 1 M4 R1 19 0 M4 R2 22 1 M5 R1 18 0 M5 R2 16 1 M6 R1 17 1 means mating happened, 0 means did not occur. I am trying to organize the data to apply a GLMM to the data, but have not been able to do it. I followed the model proposed by Crawley for binary response with pseudorreplication but it does not work. The script goes like this: model2 Can somebody tell me what part is wrong and how could I fix it? If you know a better method, that will be really welcomed as well.
