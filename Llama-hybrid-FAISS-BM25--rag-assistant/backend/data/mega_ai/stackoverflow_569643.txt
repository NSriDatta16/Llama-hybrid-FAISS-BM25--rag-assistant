Organization Id Field as a Composite Primary Key

We currently have a system where each client gets their own database when they sign-up. Not surprisingly this is getting out of hand. We are preparing merge all these databases together to a single db. In order to do this we need to note which organization the row belongs. How best is this handled on the database and what pros/cons (Speed, Maintainability, etc) are there to the methods below? Option 1 : Make the Organization Id to all tables and make it part of the primary key (making all keys composite). Option 2 : Add Organization Id to all tables as a column with a Foreign Key to the Organization Table. Option 3 : Something else. We are looking at moving to NHibernate with this move, if that has an effect on what is done.
