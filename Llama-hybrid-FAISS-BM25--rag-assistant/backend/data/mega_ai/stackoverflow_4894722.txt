Specify Order in which Coded UI Tests are executed for TFS Test Agent

I'm trying to setup TFS 2010 Lab Management based Automated Testing system and I have a "Test suite" (Created in TFS Test Manager) with following tests: 1) Start and Login 2) Create group 3) Create user and add to the group These have order specified properly in Testing Center->Plan->(Test suite)->Order column However, when they are executed (on TFS Lab Management Build) by Test Agent they run out of order: 2nd then 1st and then 3rd. Is there a way to make Test Agent run these tests in order? Thanks.
