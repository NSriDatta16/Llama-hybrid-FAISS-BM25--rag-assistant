Can I use PCA with mixed and sparse data types?

I am trying to reduce the dimensionality of a data set of about 100'000 rows and 1'000 columns, in order to cluster the individual observations with k-means. I tried PCA with rescaling (i.e., subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation), but I am not sure this approach makes much sense, because The majority of the variables are not normally distributed (i.e., they follow exponential distributions, or other skewed distributions) Many variables are 0/1 flags, and most of them are very sparse (i.e., 99.9% of the data is 0, and 0.1% is 1) There are many outliers, and it is not always clear if the best way to remove an outlier is by removing the corresponding column or row Is there a better way to reduce the dimensionality than PCA? I also tried linear mapping each variable in the interval [0,1] instead of mean subtraction/sigma division rescaling, and I even tried substituting some variables with the corresponding deciles, but then again I don't know if the combination PCA+kmeans is the best way to perform the clustering in this case.
