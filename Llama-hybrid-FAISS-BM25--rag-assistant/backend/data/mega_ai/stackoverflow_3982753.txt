If what you want is to merge cells you should create a Macro and the use a function to achieve such task. Try this code: Public Sub xlsSetMsgAndCombineCells(xlSheet As Excel.Worksheet, _ sCol1 As String, _ sCol2 As String, _ irow As Integer, _ sValue As String) ' Combine specified cells and set a message Dim xlRange As Excel.Range Set xlRange = xlSheet.Range(sfxls_RA1(sCol1, irow), sfxls_RA1(sCol2, irow)) With xlRange .Merge .FormulaR1C1 = sValue .Font.Bold = True .VerticalAlignment = xlVAlignCenter .HorizontalAlignment = xlVAlignCenter End With Set xlRange = Nothing End Sub
