Initialising global variables in VBA

In Excel 2003, how can I declare global variables and initialise them only once, ie when the workbook is opened? I have some parameters that are used by a few macros: paths to input files, basically. At the moment, my code looks like this: global path1, path2 as string sub initPaths path1 = 'path\to\file1' path2 = 'path\to\file2' end sub Then, whenever I need to use file1 or file2 in a subroutine or function, I insert a call to initPaths . But this seems rather inelegant; I'd like to be able to set the paths only once rather than repeatedly.
