MLE2 (in R): I can't find the right starting values

I am trying to fit several MLEs on a small dataset. I have managed to get it done for all my potential models except for this last one. This last one is actually the model that I expected to be the best model, because it was the best model when I did the whole thing using GLS. To start, here is the data: dat $rate pred $prey mass Here is the function that contains the equation: CM = function(N0,a,h,tt,P,m, S, al) { a = a/(1+m*(P-1)+a*h*m*(P-1)*N0) h=h*S^al N0 - lambertW(a*h*N0*exp(-a*(P*tt-h*N0)))/(a*h) } And here the model: model = function(eaten, initial, attack, handling, time.exp, pred.no, interf, mass, allometric) { if (attack And finally the code to fit the model cm3 = mle2(model, start = list(attack = .02, handling = .02, interf=0.02, allometric = -0.2), data = list(initial = dat $prey, eaten = dat$ rate, pred.no = dat $pred, mass = dat$ mass ), fixed = list(time.exp = 1) ) I have tried many different starting values and they all ended up with error messages like: non-finite finite-difference value [2] or initial value in 'vmmin' is not finite I guess that either "attack" or "handling" returns an invalid value but I am not sure how to fix this. Any ideas or suggestion are really appreciated.
