If you have classes like Node , Graph and Edge , and their implementation is not too large, it makes perfectly good sense to define them in one and the same .cpp file. After all, they are meant to be used together. In C++, a package like this is called a component. Usually it makes more sense to think in components than classes, since C++ is not only an OOP language and classes are not always the preferred way do things. If you want to learn more about the preferred way to organize code in C++, I recommend Large Scale C++ Software Design . BTW: Making a library out of these classes really seems overkill.
