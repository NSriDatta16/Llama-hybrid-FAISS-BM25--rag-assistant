package 'rms' - singular information matrix encountered

I am trying to fit a binary logistic regression model using only one predictor. After consulting a loess plot I decided to use restricted cubic spline to fit the curve (with default 4 knots). Using 'rms' package: lrm(y ~ rcs(x), data = data) however I encounter the following problem: singular information matrix in lrm.fit (rank= 3 ). Offending variable(s): x''' x'' Error in lrm(y ~ rcs(x), data = data) : Unable to fit model using “lrm.fit” Why am I getting this issue? and how do I solve it? (N=61829), Min=-29000, 1st Qu.=0 , Median.=300 , Mean=7260 , 3rd Qu.=6190 , Max.=240000
