Reinforcement Learning in NLP for chatbots

Is anyone aware of any successful implementation of reinforcement learning for NLP. I am looking to for chatbots which can learn automatically. Tried searching internet but found very few articles like Reinforcement Learning For Natural Language Processing - Medium or papers like A Survey of Reinforcement Learning Informed by Natural Language . But none of them provides a robust code which shows that it is working. Kindly suggest.
