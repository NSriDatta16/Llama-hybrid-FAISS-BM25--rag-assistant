Two seasonal periods in ARIMA using R

I'm currently using R to predict a time series with these instructions: X As you can see I've data each hour, and I chose the seasonal period of 24 (one day). I would like to improve my forecasting using an additional seasonal period in order to include the seasonal component of the week (seasonal length of 7*24=168 data) Is there any method for this? How do you do it? UPDATE: I've read this (your) blog page, maybe can I use the external regressors to simulate a second seasonal period?
