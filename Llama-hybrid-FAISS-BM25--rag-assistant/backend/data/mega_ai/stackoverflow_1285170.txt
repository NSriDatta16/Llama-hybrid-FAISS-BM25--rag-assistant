So, you're asking why not just pass the user and password in directly function addUser($name='',$password='') { etc My guess is that the code you show is an example of future-proofing, the idea being that the User class might do something a lot more detailed in the future, or get the credentials from some other source, rather than having name and password passed to its constructor. It's an idea of separation of concerns, some bit if code is responsible for assembling the suer data, the addUer function merely uses the stuff it needs. In large programs it really helps to have these kinds of organisation - on the surface it might appear to be adding complexity but when you start to think like this it enables you limit the number of pieces you need to keep in your head. Also you might imagine breaking up the overall programming task so one person looks at the User class, another does the addUser. They can work independently. Silly in this tiny case, but in the real world very beneficial.
