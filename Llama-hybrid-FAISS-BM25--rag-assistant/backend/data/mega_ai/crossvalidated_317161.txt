Scales correlate negatively, but average correlates positively!

I have a total relationship quality variable constructed as the mean of three other scales. Each of these three (family, friend, and spouse) scales is significantly negatively associated with an outcome in a simple regression; however, when I combine them into the total relationship quality, the total relationship quality is non-significantly positively associated with the outcome in a simple regression. What gives? Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 17.386 3.638 4.779 3.02e-06 *** family/friend qual -2.648 1.251 -2.116 0.0354 * --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 5.599 3.983 1.406 0.161 above plus spouse 1.289 1.383 0.932 0.352
