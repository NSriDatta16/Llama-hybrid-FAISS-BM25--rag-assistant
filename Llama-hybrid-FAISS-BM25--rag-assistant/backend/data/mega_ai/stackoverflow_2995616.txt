I would't make the regex to specific, that increases the change of accidentially letting real numbers that don't match your expression pass to the end user. I would just use a simple regex like this: (\d+-){3}\d+ btw: why did you include \D at the beginning? The . is not part of the creditcard number, right? Edit: Just found this regex \b(?:\d[ -]*?){13,16}\b at this site: http://www.regular-expressions.info/creditcard.html You should read the paragraph "Finding Credit Card Numbers in Documents"
