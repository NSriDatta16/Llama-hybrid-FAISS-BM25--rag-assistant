A list of dictionaries (e.g. [{"type": "text", "name": "field_name", "value": "test value"}, ...]) would be a usable structure, if I understand your requirement correctly. Whether object are better in this case depends on what you're doing later. If you use the objects just as data storage, you don't gain anything. Maybe a list of field objects, which implement some appropriate methods to deal with your data, would also be a good choice.
