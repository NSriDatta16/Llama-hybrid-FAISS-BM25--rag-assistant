Drupal Module Development: How to Communicate between form_submit and page handler functions

I am writing a module and I need to retrieve values set in a form_submit function from a page handler function. The reason is that I am rendering results of a form submit on the same page as the page handler. I have this working, but I am using global variables, which I don't like. I'd like to be able to use the $form_state['storage'] for this, but can't since I don't have access to the $form_state variable from the page handler. Any suggestions?
