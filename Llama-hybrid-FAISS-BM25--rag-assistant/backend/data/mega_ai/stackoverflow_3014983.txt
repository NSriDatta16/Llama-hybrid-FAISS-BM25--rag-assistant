You will need to create function to translate user agent data into common names of browsers For example, $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] could return Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; ?; Windows NT 5.1; *rv:*) Gecko/* Firefox/0.9* is firefox or Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.55 Safari/533.4 is Chrome The details provide you with the rendering engine, code base, version, os, etc... I'd suggest using preg_match and/or a list of known browsers is you want to do something like echo browserCommonName($_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT']); to output "Google Chrome". browserCommonName($userAgent) would need a list of known browsers. edit: just noticed get_browser buit into php does this, my bad for not reading the thread.
