Rave reports snags if no printer installed

I've been testing some D2006 code using Rave reports on a virtual machine and have found the app hangs when I generate a PDF report if there is no printer installed. The hang occurs here: exception message : The application seems to be frozen. main thread ($108): 005c5e62 +106 MyApp.exe RpRPTF SimpleTextWidth 006198f7 +31b MyApp.exe RpMemo TMemoBuf.GetLine 0061a44a +086 MyApp.exe RpMemo TMemoBuf.MemoLinesLeft 005cba28 +014 MyApp.exe RpBase TBaseReport.MemoLines 00672e8e +072 MyApp.exe MyAppReports PrintReportParagraph 00677f73 +acb MyApp.exe MyAppReports PrintSummaryReportBody 0066b208 +010 MyApp.exe MyAppMainForm TMainForm.RvSystemSummaryReportPrint 005c6f35 +015 MyApp.exe RpBase TBaseReport.PrintEvent 005c8066 +03a MyApp.exe RpBase TBaseReport.Execute 0060a299 +125 MyApp.exe RpSystem TRvSystem.GenerateReport 0060a52a +07e MyApp.exe RpSystem TRvSystem.Execute 0067d364 +0ac MyApp.exe MyAppReports DoPrintSummaryReport 0067d64d +1d5 MyApp.exe MyAppReports ProduceReports 0066e966 +1e6 MyApp.exe MyAppProcessing ProcessMyAppData 0066ab9b +0d7 MyApp.exe MyAppMainForm TMainForm.DoProcessData and no doubt is something to do with a page width of zero confusing the code that is calculating how many lines it can fit across the page or some such. The thing is I'm writing a PDF - not printing - so I can't see why not having a printer should trip this code up (Acrobat Reader is installed). If I install a printer it behaves. Why do I need a printer installed (the app could be installed on a workstation without a printer installed - having an error message that says: "You can't generate a PDF report unless you install printer" seems a bit clunky) ?
