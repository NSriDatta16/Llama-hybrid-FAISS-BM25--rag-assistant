A mixture distribution is a distribution made up of components which are themselves other distributions. The distribution is a mixture of its components. The simplest case is the finite mixture , of which you give an example in your question. $f(x) = p_1 f_1(x) + p_2 f_2(x) + ... + p_k f_k(x)$ $F(x) = p_1 F_1(x) + p_2 F_2(x) + ... + p_k F_k(x)$ where the mixing proportions $p_i$ sum to 1. You can conceive of a mixture as first choosing a component with probability $p_i$ and then being generated from that component (indeed, that's a way to simulate from mixture distributions). Here's the mixture you describe (with $\mu_m=50$ and $\sigma=5$): Is a multi-state model a mixture model in general? That depends on what you're looking at/how you frame it. If you look at the unconditional state (unconditional on earlier time), then it could be framed as a finite mixture of degenerate distributions (representing the states). The paper itself states it quite explicitly (if framed slightly differently), right in the middle of the three paragraphs you pointed to: This is essentially a dynamic variant of a finite mixture model, in which there is one mixture component corresponding to each value of the multinomial state.
