This is identical to a common distribution in physics called the Fermi-Dirac distribution, which describes a situation called Fermi-Dirac statistics . In a certain setting in physics, the average number of particles with an energy $\epsilon$ is $$ \bar{n}_\epsilon = \frac{1}{e^{(\epsilon -\mu)/kT}+1} $$ where $\mu$, $k$, and $T$ are physical parameters that probably aren't so important to you (the chemical potential, Boltzmann's constant, and the temperature). Its trivial to reinterpret this as probability density function for the energy of a particle.
