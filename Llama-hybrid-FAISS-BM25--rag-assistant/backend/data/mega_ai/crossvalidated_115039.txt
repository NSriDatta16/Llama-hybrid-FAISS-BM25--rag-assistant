1) I don't think it is possible because it seems that your statement about human eye being able to separate them is incorrect. E.g. I can separate the points from your red and orange curves in a different and more plausible way by hand as follows: My green and magenta curves look far less volatile and far better separated than your red and orange. 2) If you still think you can do it correctly by eyeballing, then the only way out is to quantify that skill somehow.
