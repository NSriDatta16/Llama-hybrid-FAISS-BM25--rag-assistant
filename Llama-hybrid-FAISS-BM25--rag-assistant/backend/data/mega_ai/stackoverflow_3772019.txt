Start at the start. The similarities between PHP and C++ will take about half an hour to get through ("this is an object, this is a loop, ..."), and there are subtle differences which will kill you if you're not paying attention during that half hour. Learning C++ will take months to years, depending what you mean by "learn". It's just not a worthwhile optimisation.
