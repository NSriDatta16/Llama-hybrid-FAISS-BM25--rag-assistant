The most applicable "Design Pattern" is Observer. The reusable functionality you want to develop can be implemented as simple observers of Control, which subscribe to some subset of Control events. Fortunately, Windows Forms Controls implement many events, making it possible to add functionality from outside the class almost as easily as from within, by the usual sub-classing. For example, you could add drag and drop support by implementing an observer that subscribed to DragOver and DragDrop (and possibly DragLeave) and performed the appropriate actions based on the DragDropEvent data. This is an excellent technique to consider, as it allows you to develop such functionality once and add it to many Controls.
