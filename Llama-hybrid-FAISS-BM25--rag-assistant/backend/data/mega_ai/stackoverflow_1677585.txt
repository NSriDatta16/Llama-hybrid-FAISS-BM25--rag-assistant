Pruning a static library in c++

I am trying to expose a single well defined class by building a static library and then shipping the built library with a few header files that define that class and the interfaces needed to use it. I have that working but the problem I am running into is the library is gigantic. It has every single object file from the whole project and all I need is a subset. If I make a simple main.cpp file and include and use that single class then I get a output file that is only as big as the 20% of the library I am using. Is there a way to tell the linker to start from a given place and prune everything else like in the executable case? EDIT: I forgot to mention that I am using gcc on cygwin and linux (though I would like a solution that worked with visual studio as well, we generally use that for development but deploy primarily on linux)
