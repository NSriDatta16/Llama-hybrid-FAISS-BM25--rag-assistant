Remember that there are different kinds of non-stationarity and different ways on how to deal with them. Four common ones are: 1) Deterministic trends or trend stationarity. If your series is of this kind de-trend it or include a time trend in the regression/model. You might want to check out the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem on this one. 2) Level shifts and structural breaks. If this is the case you should include a dummy variable for each break or if your sample is long enough model each regimé separately. 3) Changing variance. Either model the samples separately or model the changing variance using the ARCH or GARCH modelling class. 4) If your series contain a unit root. In general you should then check for cointegrating relationships between the variables but since you are concerned with univariate forecasting you shoud difference it once or twice depending on the order of integration. In order to model a time series using the ARIMA modelling class the following steps should be appropriate: 1) Look at the ACF and PACF together with a time series plot to see wheter or not the series is stationary or non-stationary. 2) Test the series for a unit root. This can be done with a wide range of tests, some of the most common being the ADF test, the Phillips-Perron (PP) test, the KPSS test which has the null of stationarity or the DF-GLS test which is the most efficient of the aforementioned tests. NOTE! That in case your series contain a structural break these tests are biased towards not rejecting the null of a unit root. In case you want to test the robustness of these tests and if you suspect one or more structural breaks you should use endogenous structural break tests. Two common ones are the Zivot-Andrews test which allows for one endogenous structural break and the Clemente-Montañés-Reyes which allows for two structural breaks. The latter allows for two different models. An additive outlier model which accounts for sudden changes in the slope of the series and an innovative outlier model which takes gradual changes into account and allows a break in the intercept and slope. 3) If there is a unit root in the series then you should difference the series. Afterwards you should run look at the ACF, PACF and the time series plot and probably check for a second unit root to be on the safe side. The ACF and PACF will help you decide on how many AR and MA terms you should be including. 4) If the series does not contain a unit root but the time series plot and the ACF show that the series has a deterministic trend you should add a trend when fitting the model. Some people argue that it is completely valid to just difference the series when it contains a deterministic trend although information may be lost in the process. Never the less its a good idea to difference it in order to see have many AR and/or MA terms you will need to include. But a time trend is valid. 5) Fit the different models and do the usual diagnostic checking, you might want to use an information criterion or the MSE in order to select the best model given the sample you fit it on. 6) Do in sample forecasting on the best fitted models and calculate loss functions such as MSE, MAPE, MAD to see which of them actually perform best when using them to forecast because that is what we want to do! 7) Do your out of sample forecasting like a boss and be pleased with your results!
