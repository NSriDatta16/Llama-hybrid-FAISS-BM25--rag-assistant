I also came across this problem when working on a forecasting project. First say you are doing a grid search of your hyper-parameters and you have a set of parameters you want to test. Because this is a time series dataset, we want to always predict in the future. Now depending on how many "folds" you wish to do, you can compute the CV error like so: pick a choice of hyperparameter fit for the first month and "validate" on the second month compute your error fit on the first two months and "validate" third month compute your error continue doing this till you have fit on n-1 months and validated on nth month compute your average CV error Do this for each hyperparameter in your search space. Choose the one that gives the least CV error. After you have chosen the hyperparameter, you can fit the model on all the data except the month that you want to forecast for. Use the fitted model to forecast for the required month. HTH.
