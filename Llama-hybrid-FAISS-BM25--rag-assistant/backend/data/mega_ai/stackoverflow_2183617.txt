Criteria API returns a too small resultset

How is this possible, I have to following criteria Criteria criteria = getSession().createCriteria(c); criteria.setResultTransformer(Criteria.DISTINCT_ROOT_ENTITY); criteria.add(Restrictions.eq("active",true)); List list = criteria.list(); The size of list is now 20. If I add a max results to the criteria, Criteria criteria = getSession().createCriteria(c); criteria.setResultTransformer(Criteria.DISTINCT_ROOT_ENTITY); criteria.setMaxResults(90); criteria.add(Restrictions.eq("active",true)); List list = criteria.list(); .. now list's size is 18! I don't understand how the resultsets size can be smaller after defining the max results, as the amount of rows is smaller than the defined max. This sure seems like a bug, or is there again some weird aspects of hibernate that I'm not aware of?
