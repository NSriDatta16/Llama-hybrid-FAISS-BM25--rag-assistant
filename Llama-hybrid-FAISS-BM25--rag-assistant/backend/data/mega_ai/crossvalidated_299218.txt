Here are three suggestions. If your total counts are known, then this sounds like binomial regression to me. Say you have for observations $i=1,\ldots, n$ the response count $y_i$ (in this case it's your number of successful nests), and your predictor $x_i$ (in this case it sounds like it's time, so $t$). Binomial regression assumes that each $Y_i$ follows a binomial distribution with known $n_i$ and a parameter $p_i(x_i)$ that depends on your input. Typically people use logistic regression, which is a special case of this, where $n_i = 1$ for all $i$. But this doesn't have to be so. In your case $n_i$ is changing and seems to be around $50$ or $60$. You can also use a beta regression if you don't want to assume that your total nests $n_i$ are known. In this case your response variables would be proportions. Finally, if you are interested in modeling just the number of total nests, then you can run a Poisson regression. Poisson random variables don't have an explicit upper bound
