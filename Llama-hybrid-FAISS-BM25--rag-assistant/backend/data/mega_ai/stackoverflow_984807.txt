What kind of error are you getting when you hit our WCF service? So asmx is working but not WCF? One thing you need to pay attention is that in .NET 2.0, the web services (asmx) supported both SOAP 1.1 and SOAP 1.2 messages. However, basicHttpBinding in WCF handles only SOAP 1.1. So if you're sending SOAP 1.2 messages from your iPhone client to the WCF service with basicHttpBinding, this could very well be the problem you're having. In order to support SOAP 1.2, you need to use wsHttpBinding or create a custom binding pretty much the same as basicHttpBinding but you specify the message version to be SOAP 1.2.
