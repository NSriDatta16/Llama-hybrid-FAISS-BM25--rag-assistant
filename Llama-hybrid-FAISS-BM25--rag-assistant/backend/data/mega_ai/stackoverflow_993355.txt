Easy! Create three forms Add code to custom-draw everything on those three forms Add logic to handle the user clicking and dragging anywhere on any of the forms, such that the window is moved normally until it comes within a certain distance of another one of your own forms (or the edge of the screen), in which case you would snap the window position to that edge. I look forward to your follow-up questions...
