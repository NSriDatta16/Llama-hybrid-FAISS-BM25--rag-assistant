How can I access the classes loaded by Java Web Start when dynamically compiling code?

I am dynamically compiling code in my client application. When I start the application with Java Web Start I get an exception. The exception only occurs when it is run through Java Web Start. //The exception evolver.core.model.change.execution.ExecutionException: Compilation failed! DynamicComparator.java:2: package evolver.core.model.i does not exist import evolver.core.model.i.IDefaultObject; ^ DynamicComparator.java:9: cannot find symbol symbol : class PropertyBag location: class DynamicComparator PropertyBag b2 = new PropertyBag(dob2); ^ The PropertyBag above should have been provided by the JNLPClassloader as it is part of one of the files that are downloaded by JWS The code that causes the problem looks like this. public static int compile(String javaFileName) { ByteArrayOutputStream os = new ByteArrayOutputStream(); PrintWriter w = new PrintWriter(os); int res = com.sun.tools.javac.Main.compile(new String[]{"-d", "./", javaFileName}, w); if (res != 0) throw new ExecutionException("Compilation failed!" + "\n\n" + os.toString()); return res; } Any help will be very appreciated!
