Logistic regression | varying exposure variable

I have some data where I follow some people for 365 days. I have a response variable that is either 1 or 0 . The response variable is an event that may or may not happen between day 1 and day 365 . If the event happens ( 1 ), I know at what day it happens. I've been doing logistic regression with success. Now the data has changed, and some of the customers suddenly have varying exposure (less than 365 days). For example, some people we'd only follow for 180 days. I still know if an event happens before the 180 days (of exposure), but if any event happens after the 180 days is unknown. My manager says that I can still do logistic regression, I just have to take into account the varying exposure, that is, include the exposure as an explanatory variable in the model. This just feels wrong to me, and I say that this is what cox regression/survival analysis is made for, but I can't really argue for why it is wrong to do it the suggested way. Is my manager wrong, and if so: could somebody please explain why?
