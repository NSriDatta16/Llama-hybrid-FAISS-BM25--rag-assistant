There are correlations regarding the creation dates or maybe the geographical zone, but if you keep the study in a similar time frame, you shouldn't lose something important. There is a correlation loss as long as there are links between individuals and the environment (ex: time and place). If there are no links between individuals, I don't see why it is not meant to make an aggregate. In addition, most models need random data to find statistical straits, one exception is time series because the models learn from sequential data that couldn't be randomized for obvious reasons. It would be very interesting to know the reason why an aggregate loses its statistical straits (apart from the time frame).
