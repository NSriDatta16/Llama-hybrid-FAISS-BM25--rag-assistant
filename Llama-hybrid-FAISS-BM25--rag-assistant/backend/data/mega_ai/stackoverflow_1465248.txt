Who is responsible to look into client reported issues

In our organisation we deliver products to different product lines depending on the requirements. in short the same application is customised according to customer requirements and delivered. After deploying the application sometimes we got some issues logged by client. My question comes here. who is responsible to look into the issues and solve it Programmers Testers Management is asking Testers to have a look into the issues and solve them. But the testers don't have the chance to look into the code. is it feasible to ask the testers to go for the issue resolution and end up wasting time doing nothing thus delaying the solution to the customers.
