I see no problem. For every target, create a specific folder with files for this target. Now create a group in Xcode for every of those folders and drag each of the new Settings.bundle directories to the corresponding group. When adding the bundles to the project, make sure that every bundle is only built (included) for its target by checking the appropriate box.
