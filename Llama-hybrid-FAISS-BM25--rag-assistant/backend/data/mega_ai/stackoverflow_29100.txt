How are you generating tests from specifications?

I came across a printed article by Bertrand Meyer where he states that tests can be generated from specifications. My development team does nothing like this, but it sounds like a good technique to consider. How are you generating tests from specifications? How would you describe the success your having in discovering program faults via this method?
