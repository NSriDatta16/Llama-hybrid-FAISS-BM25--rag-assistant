If you use the /k argument, you can add a single line to execute a change drive and change directory. For instance: C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe /k "d: & cd d:\storage" Using & you can string together many commands on one line. Edit: You can also change drive with the cd command alone "cd /d d:\storage" . Thanks to Adam Mitz for the comment.
