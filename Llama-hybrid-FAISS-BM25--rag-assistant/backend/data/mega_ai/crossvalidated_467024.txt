Why the Neural Network started to perform worse after I scaled the dataset using MinMax?

Data I was trying to classify using NN (it was generated using sklearns' make_blobs method): The model I used import tensorflow as tf from tensorflow import keras model = keras.Sequential() model.add(keras.layers.Dense(10,input_shape=(2,),activation='relu')) model.add(keras.layers.Dense(20,activation='relu')) model.add(keras.layers.Dense(1,activation='sigmoid')) model.compile(loss='binary_crossentropy',) history = model.fit(X,y,epochs=100,verbose=0) The results (f1 score) after training neural network 100 times on the unscaled and scaled (MinMax) dataset Why network's performance worsened after I scaled dataset? I'd thought that scaling data would result in a better performance, not a worse one.
