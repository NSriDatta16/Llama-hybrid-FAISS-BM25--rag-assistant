Elegant jQuery replace on mutiple values

Im using .replace() with jQuery to remove different strings from an img URL: src = src.replace("/_w", ""); src = src.replace("_jpg", ""); src = src.replace("_jpeg", ""); src = src.replace("_png", ""); src = src.replace("_gif", ""); As you can see its pretty primative and not very clever, is there anyway I can replace this with something a little more elegant. Essentially the url will always be 1 of the following: http://local.com/images/_w/image_jpg.jpg http://local.com/images/_w/image_jpeg.jpeg http://local.com/images/_w/image_png.png Is there anyway I can write a .replace() to remove the /_w/ then remove all characters between the last '.' in the URL and the last underscore?
