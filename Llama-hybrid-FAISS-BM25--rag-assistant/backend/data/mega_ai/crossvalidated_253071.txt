You can train an exemplar classifier, when you have only single positive and a lot of negatives (which could be randomly sampled, i.e. when working on images). The idea is to learn from negatives, "what your positive is not", as you do not have enough positive data instances. If handcrafted features and shallow methods will be enough for your application, you can have a look at Malisiewicz et al.'s Exemplar SVM paper. Their source code is in Matlab. The idea is based on linear SVM classification, and you can easily do it using scikit's SVM package. However, you should write your hard negative mining code after training classifier. If you have chance to get a few more positive data instance (~ tens of), ensemble of exemplar classifiers will perform better than single exemplar classifier. In addition, the number of negatives should be at least a few thousands. Another approach is to learn an exemplar CNN. If you do not have experience in deep learning, it might be a bit more tricky. But, you can check following reference, exemplar CNN .
