Depending on the algorithm, and whether the bottleneck is in your php code or in the database, you could try using a php compiler, like for example facebooks hiphop: http://developers.facebook.com/blog/post/358/ Since you don't have a lot of traffic, but instead one algorithm that is run once, and that has to be faster, you probably need the php compiler (like the one I've linked), NOT an opcode cacher (like bcompiler or similair), since that only helps when running a lot of scripts. All an opcode cached does is speed up the parsing of scripts, but in your case that happens only once per 5-second run of the script and is probably no the bottleneck. A compiler however, translates your php code to native assembly, which, even if not becoming as fast a c equivalent, is still averagely 2 times faster than runnning in PHP. Again, this depends on your design. If the script just waits for the database most of the time of those 5 seconds, compiling won't help you much. What kind of algorithm are we talking about here?
