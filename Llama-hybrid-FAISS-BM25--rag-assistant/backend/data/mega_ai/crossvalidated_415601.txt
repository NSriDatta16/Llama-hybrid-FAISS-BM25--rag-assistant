Theory building with Factor Analysis

I have a dataset with 95 predictors and a binary response. Many of the predictors have high correlations, so I did Factor Analysis and identified 29 latent factors (most of which make logical sense). From these scores of the fit, I ran a Logistic Regression on the binary response which is satisfactorily significant. My question is: Is it ok to then look at the values of coefficients of the significant factors, then look at how the original predictors are correlated to the factors and infer a theory? For instance, is it ok to see that Factor1 is positively correlated with the positive value of the binary response, and the original predictors 1 and 3 are positively correlated with Factor1, but predictor 2 is negatively correlated with Factor1 so... then infer a theory as to why. Somehow this feels contrived. I am trying to chain correlations back to the original predictors. Thank you.
