How to present features for time series data to a regression model?

I just want to preface this post with the fact that I have absolutely no idea what I am doing and just starting to dip my toes into this field. I have this system that fires an alert whenever certain feature thresholds of the system are crossed. When an alert is fired, we have people with highly specialized domain knowledge look at those features and its current state and previous states and then bucket the triggered alert belonging to either events A, B, or C. Right now, I am tasked with removing this manual process by automating this with a machine learning model (I wish it was as simple as hardcoding IF/ELSE statements). So, I have this data set with F number of features (I narrowed it down to these features because these were what the specialists with domain knowledge recommended) but I also want to feed to my model what these features looked like H hours ago. My question is how should I represent these F features for each H hour (where each hour represents the state of the system at that particular time)? Should they be their own "unique" feature (meaning I will end up feeding FxH features into my model). For example, this is what my current dataset looks like below. Every record in my dataset represents the state of the system (the "state" of the system would be defined by the features) during an alert at a given time interval (these intervals are set 1 hour apart). How do I show my ML model all feature values for all time intervals for each alert? Do I need to transpose my dataset such that each row represents 1 alert and all of its time intervals? alert_id time_interval feature_1 feature_2 1234 0 00 0.06 1234 1 12 1.15 1234 2 15 0.98 1234 3 12 0.00 1234 4 00 0.00 1234 5 00 0.00 5678 0 00 0.00 5678 1 00 0.00 5678 2 00 0.00 5678 3 18 1.32 5678 4 34 -1.05 5678 5 12 0.52 9123 0 00 0.00 Side question: would a simple model such a random forest, logistic, or SVM be appropriate for this?
