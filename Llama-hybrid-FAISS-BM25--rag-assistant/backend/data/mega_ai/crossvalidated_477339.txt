Test time series performance across subjects against chance

I'm wondering if anyone had any advice on testing where (if at all) the average of several time series deviates against chance. That is, I have an output from an SVM, computed at several time points, and I want to determine the times at which the SVM performs better than 50% chance across six subjects. Therefore, I have 6 time series that are the performance output of the SVM and I want to determine the times at which (on average) these differ significantly from chance. I was initially thinking of doing something like a cluster-based permutation test, where I created a distribution with a mean of 50 and tested my time series against this, shuffling the data each time and then looking at significance at the cluster level, but I can't see anyone doing this, so I'm not sure that this would be correct. Any help and input is always very much appreciated! Maybe I'm overlooking a simple solution, but my brain can't find it right now.
