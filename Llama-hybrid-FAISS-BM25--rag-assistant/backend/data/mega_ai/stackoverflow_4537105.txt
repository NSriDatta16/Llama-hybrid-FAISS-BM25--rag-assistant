Using Amazon S3 API For iPhone

I'm able to upload files from iPhone using ASIHTTPRequest wrapper for an application which allows simple storage to my account. The question i'm concerned about is, could distributing the access keys along with the application be a good idea? what is the best way to deal with it in terms of security? are the keys i use sniffable via monitors over https? any suggestions over it will be appreciated.
