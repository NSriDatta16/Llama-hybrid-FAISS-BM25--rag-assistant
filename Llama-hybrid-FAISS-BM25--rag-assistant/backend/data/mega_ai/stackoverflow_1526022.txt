The mystery is solved; I thought I was only mapping FierceDragon , but no, I was mapping Dragon too, both to the table Dragons . Not sure why NH did that particular thing in this case, but clearly the fix is to, you know, not map separate classes to the same table. Or if you do, at least give NH some way of distinguishing between the two in the DB.
