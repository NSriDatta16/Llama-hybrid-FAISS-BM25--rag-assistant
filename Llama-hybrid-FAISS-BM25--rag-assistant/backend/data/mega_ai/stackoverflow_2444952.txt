As long as it takes. A LOT depends on * Where the DNS Server is that you talk to * Whether the DNS server has the value already cached * Whether ther everse mapping mas to a proper DNS server that is also operational (or the retrieval times out). In general, for end users, you can expect easily 200ms - the user may be at the other side of the world. I would actually assume anything up to 2minutes to be possible in case of DNS reachability issues. Within a lan, you should normally have an answer within milliseconds. Two digit, maximum (10ms or so). In general, synchroneous may be a REALLY bad idea here - but a lot depends on what the application actually DOES.
