In what scenario will a decision tree intuitively perform better than a random forest?

I was asked this question in an interview, not convinced about what the answer will be. In what scenario (or under which conditions) will a decision tree (intuitively) perform better than a random forest? What I understood is the interviewer wanted a theoretical scenario where DTs will outperform RFs. I mentioned sample size but he was not convinced with the answer. TIA for the help.
