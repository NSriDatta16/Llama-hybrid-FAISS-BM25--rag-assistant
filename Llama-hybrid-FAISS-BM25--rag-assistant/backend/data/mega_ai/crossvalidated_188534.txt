There are clustered bootstrap approaches, including percentile-t and wild. See Cameron & Miller, 2015: A Practitioner's Guide to Cluster-Robust Inference . One thing I don't see mentioned in the Cameron & Miller article, but I see no reason why it couldn't be applied in the context of clustered data, is to modify the cluster bootstrapped percentile-t approach by using a variance-stabilizing transformation, as discussed in Tibshirani, 1988: Variance Stabilization and the Bootstrap . Another option derives cluster-robust variance estimates on the basis of estimating separate regressions for each cluster. See Ibragimov & MÃ¼ller, 2010: t-Statistic Based Correlation and Heterogeneity Robust Inference , although I've seen a slide deck where Cameron cautions that this approach is no good if there is any cross-cluster correlation (such as time fixed effects in panel data scenarios).
