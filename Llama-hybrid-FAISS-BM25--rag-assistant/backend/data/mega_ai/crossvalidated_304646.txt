So you have a Markov chain $M$, which converges to some stationary distribution $\mu$. This means that $x^TM^t\approx \mu$ when $t$ is large enough. When you run MCMC, you first have to wait for convergence to the stationary distribution. After it converges sufficiently, you sample your first point. It sounds like you're suggesting to uniformly sample from the set of points you get after sufficient convergence. This would work, so long as you have plenty of samples. This is because any finite recurrent Markov chain will spend $\mu_i$ proportion of time in state $i$, so picking a point uniformly at random is equivalent to sampling from the stationary distribution. However, your samples will always be a little correlated, since if you pick two samples that occur one after the other, they are definitely correlated.
