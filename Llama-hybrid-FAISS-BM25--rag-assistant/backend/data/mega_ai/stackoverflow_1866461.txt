Why should I not try to use "this" value after "delete this"?

In this paragraph of C++ FAQ usage of delete this construct is discussed. 4 restrictions are listed. Restrictions 1 to 3 look quite reasonable. But why is restriction 4 there that I "must not examine it, compare it with another pointer, compare it with NULL, print it, cast it, do anything with it"? I mean this is yet another pointer. Why can't I reinterpret_cast it to an int or call printf() to output its value?
