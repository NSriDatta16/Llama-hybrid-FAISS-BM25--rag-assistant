The solution here is so simple, it's annoying that dev's do anything else. Respect the browser setting. If it says English then by god it's English. If you absolutely must, then simply add a button at the top to pick something else. Then, and ONLY then, do you override the browser. If you think your way is better. Stop, have someone slap you. It's not. Repeat as necessary. Get rid of those web splash pages that ask for someone's country. Just show your normal page, based off of the browser defaults, and see item 2 above. I have yet to run into a site where it actually matters. update: a few years later and there is now a reason to do this. In 2013 the UK instituted policies surrounding cookies that website operators need to respect for sites based in that country that are serving pages to visitors from that country. So pay attention to the laws in the countries you are hosted in. IF you happen to have a site that really is served by multiple servers across multiple countries, then you can probably detect which one of your servers is really closer to serve from. If you can't, just stop the redirecting madness and then don't try and make a determination for them.
