I use Maven . The structure that Maven promotes is:- src/main/java/org/myname/project/MyClass.java src/test/java/org/myname/project/TestMyClass.java i.e. a test class with Test prepended to the name of the class under test is in a parallel directory structure to the main test. One advantage of having the test classes in the same package (not necessarily directory though) is you can leverage package-scope methods to inspect or inject mock test objects.
