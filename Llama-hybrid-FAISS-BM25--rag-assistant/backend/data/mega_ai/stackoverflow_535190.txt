Adding new methods to LINQ to SQL generated classes

I am new to LINQ. I just dragged all my database tables onto the designer in a LINQ to SQL dbml. All my relationships are correct and look nice in the designer. I am able to pull data using simple LINQ code. I want to add my own methods now but don't want to blow away my changes if (when) I need to regenerate my dbml. I am guessing I just create a new class file and setup partial classes of the generated classes. Is this correct? For example, I have a generated class called SystemUser which contains the columns SystemUserId, Username, Password, PersonId, SecurityQuestionId, SecurityQuestionResponse . I want to add a method called void Authenticate() and a new property called bool Authenticated . Basically I want to pass in a username and password to Authenticate() and set the Authenticated property based on finding a matching user, etc. Where and how would I do this?
