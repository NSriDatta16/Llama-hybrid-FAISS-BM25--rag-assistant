Should I keep discovery and validation samples separated also for subanalysis and stratification?

I am conducting an analysis on RNAseq data on two populations sampled from different geographical regions. I used population A as discovery (about 120 samples and 150 matched controls) and population B as validation (about 100 samples and 100 matched controls) to find differentially expressed genes in cases vs controls and to build machine learning predictive models. Cases can be further stratified according to clinical characteristics (i.e. disease severity, current therapy, organ involvement); this of course reduces the sample size in each population or produces unbalanced datasets. For instance, in population A we may have 20 cases with "active disease" and 100 cases with "remission", while in population B we may have 30 "active" and 70 "remission" cases. Here is the question: -Would you keep the two populations separate and apply the same discovery-validation strategy albeit with a reduced sample size? OR -Would you merge the two populations increasing the overall sample size reporting the results as "exploratory"?
