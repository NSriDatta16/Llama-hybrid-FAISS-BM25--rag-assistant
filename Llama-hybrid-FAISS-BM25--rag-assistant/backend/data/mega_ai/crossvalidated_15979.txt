How to find confidence intervals for ratings?

Evan Miller's " How Not to Sort by Average Rating " proposes using the lower bound of a confidence interval to get a sensible aggregate "score" for rated items. However, it's working with a Bernoulli model: ratings are either thumbs up or thumbs down. What's a reasonable confidence interval to use for a rating model which assigns a discrete score of $1$ to $k$ stars, assuming that the number of ratings for an item might be small? I think I can see how to adapt the centre of the Wilson and Agresti-Coull intervals as $$\tilde{p} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{x_i} + z_{\alpha/2}^2\; p_0}{n + z_{\alpha/2}^2}$$ where either $p_0 = \frac{k+1}{2}$ or (probably better) it's the average rating over all items. However, I'm not sure how to adapt the width of the interval. My (revised) best guess would be $$\tilde{p} \pm \frac{z_{\alpha/2}}{\tilde{n}} \sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n{(x_i - \tilde{p})^2} + z_{\alpha/2}(p_0-\tilde{p})^2}{\tilde{n}}}$$ with $\tilde{n} = n + z_{\alpha/2}^2$, but I can't justify with more than hand-waving it as an analogy of Agresti-Coull, taking that as $$\text{Estimate}(\bar{X}) \pm \frac{z_{\alpha/2}}{\tilde{n}} \sqrt{\text{Estimate}(\text{Var}(X))}$$ Are there standard confidence intervals which apply? (Note that I don't have subscriptions to any journals or easy access to a university library; by all means give proper references, but please supplement with the actual result!)
