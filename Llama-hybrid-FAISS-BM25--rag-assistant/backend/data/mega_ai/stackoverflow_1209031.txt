oAuth ASP.NET Membership Provider

Are there any recommended resources for implementing a custom membership provider that uses oAuth? The goal would be to have users to log into my ASP.NET MVC application using their existing oAuth credentials. After the user is authenticated, I'd then like to leverage the built-in ASP.NET authorization features. Thanks.
