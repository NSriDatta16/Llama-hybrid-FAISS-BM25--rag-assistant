As an aside, doing the "#ifndef" trick is appropriate for headers used by other people (like the standard headers). If you need the #ifndef for a "private" program, then you are doing it "wrong". That is, you can and should organize headers within a project so they are not included more than once. One reason that this is helpful is that keeps headers you think you have deleted from popping up again. Since you can't control how public headers are used, this trick is reasonable for public headers. This trick is completely unnecessary for private headers.
