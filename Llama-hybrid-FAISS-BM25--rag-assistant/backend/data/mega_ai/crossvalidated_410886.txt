In Bayesian setting, you are considering the prior distribution of $\theta$ , this does let you use Bayes theorem and calculate the conditional probabilities. In frequentist setting you end up with estimate that depends on the observed data. In frequentist setting you are not "marginalizing out" the data unless you observed the whole population, otherwise this is still an estimate given single sample. So I would argue that this intuition is not correct.
