instead of DATABASE_TYPE_ID BIGINT not null, it needs to be DATABASE_TYPE_ID UNIQUEIDENTIFIER not null, I would strongly advice you to use NEWSEQUENTIALID() as a default instead since you are using it as a clustered index because it won't cause page splits and thus fragmentation, see here how to use it http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms189786.aspx
