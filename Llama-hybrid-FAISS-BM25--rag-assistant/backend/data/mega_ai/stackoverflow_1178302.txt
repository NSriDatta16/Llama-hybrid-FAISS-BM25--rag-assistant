Perl has a "use strict" directive that enforces some (but not this particular) best practices. Why not add a -strict option on javac that enforces such best practice conventions on the code being compiled? This could still allow the use of .jar or .class libraries that don't follow the standard but enforce it on anything new being compiled (.java)... Or better yet, turn it on by default and provide a -relaxed directive to turn off the enforcement, thus encouraging everyone to follow the standard more closely without penalizing those that, for whatever reason, can not.
