C# - Get values of static properties from static class

I'm trying to loop through some static properties in a simple static class in order to populate a combo box with their values, but am having difficulties. Here is the simple class: public static MyStaticClass() { public static string property1 = "NumberOne"; public static string property2 = "NumberTwo"; public static string property3 = "NumberThree"; } ... and the code attempting to retrieve the values: Type myType = typeof(MyStaticClass); PropertyInfo[] properties = myType.GetProperties( BindingFlags.Public | BindingFlags.Static | BindingFlags.DeclaredOnly); foreach (PropertyInfo property in properties) { MyComboBox.Items.Add(property.GetValue(myType, null).ToString()); } If I don't supply any binding flags then I get about 57 properties including things like System.Reflection.Module Module and all sorts of other inherited things I don't care about. My 3 declared properties are not present. If I supply various combinations of other flags then it always returns 0 properties. Great. Does it matter that my static class is actually declared within another non-static class? What am I doing wrong?
