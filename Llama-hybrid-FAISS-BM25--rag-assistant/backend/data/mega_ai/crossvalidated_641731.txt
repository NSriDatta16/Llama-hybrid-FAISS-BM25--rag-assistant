Analyzing mediation, under the broader heading of "causal inference," can be tricky. This answer by Robert Long is a superb, concise introduction to the directed acyclic graphs that help clarify your understanding of the subject matter in a way that informs your modeling. For a remarkably helpful introduction to causal inference in general, read Causal Inference: What If by Hern√°n and Robins. It develops the essential concepts through simple examples "without models" and builds from there through increasingly complicated scenarios. Its 13 pages of references provide many resources for more detailed study.
