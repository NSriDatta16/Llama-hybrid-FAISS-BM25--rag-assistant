Okay, found out how to do this elegantly and with a flair. I am voting for @bstahlhood's answer as the answer as it is partially what I needed to know..however, this subroutine in place of the one I submitted above is how I fully fixed it. - (UITableViewCell *) getCellContentViewForIconRow:(NSString *)cellIdentifier { ResortsListViewController *resortsListViewController = [[ResortsListViewController alloc] init]; NSMutableArray *categoryArray = [resortsListViewController getCategoriesForLocation:[[locationData objectForKey:@"theid"]intValue]]; [resortsListViewController release]; MainAppDelegate *mainAppDelegate = [[MainAppDelegate alloc] init]; CGRect CellFrame = CGRectMake(10, 10, 100, 40); UITableViewCell *cell = [[[UITableViewCell alloc] initWithFrame:CellFrame reuseIdentifier:cellIdentifier] autorelease]; int x = 10; int y = 10; int ctr = 0; NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager]; for (NSString *category_name in categoryArray) { if (ctr As you see I also changed the CGRECT inside my loop to fix the horizontal spacing: CGRect Label1Frame = CGRectMake(x, y, 30, 30); as @bstahlhood suggested. I had forgotten CGRrect commands handle the startpoints and width instead of startpoints and endpoints inside the cell area. that is why I thought I had to use x+40. As stated, it is now corrected. I also changed this the heightForRowAtIndexPath to better balance the look of a 30x30 pixel image. The label above starts my subview 10px across and 10px down from the inside of the cell, so it just makes sense to ensure that the cell is 50px vertically and not 60px so there is exactly 10px on top and 10px on bottom of the icon. -(CGFloat)tableView:(UITableView *)tableView heightForRowAtIndexPath:(NSIndexPath *)indexPath { if (indexPath.section == 2 && indexPath.row == 0) { return 50; } } So, even though I solved my own problem prior to the posting by @bstahlhood, I am giving him the vote for the correct answer as it was correct. I also wanted to point out that I wish more people would post fixed code after their issue was corrected so that others having the same issue would know what (exactly) they did. That is why I posted this code.
