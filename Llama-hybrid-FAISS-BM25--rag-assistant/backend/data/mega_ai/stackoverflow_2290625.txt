Well, there's the right answer, and my answer. :-) The right answer is drag-and-drop. There's some code for that floating around the Android source for the Music app, but it's outside my skill level with touch events right now. In the one case I wanted this feature, I created a list using up/down buttons to let the user resequence. Ugly, but it works. Using a context menu, as you indicate, can certainly be made to work, but if you can spare the on-screen real estate, putting the buttons on will be easier. You might even consider toggling the button visibility on/off via an option menu, if having them on-screen the whole time will be unpleasant. And, someday, I hope to make a drag-and-drop ReorderableListView as a reusable component...but I wouldn't hold your breath. Maybe somebody else has one that I haven't run across yet.
