Saving data for related Tables with foreign key - Entity Framework

I am having trouble saving my entities to the database using EntityFramework. I have to tables, Player and Address. The Player table has a reference to the Address table by means of an AddressId foreign key relationship. So Player.AddressId points to Address.AddressId. Now when calling the following code, I get an error that says: "A dependent property in a ReferentialConstraint is mapped to a storage-generated column" public override int CreatePlayer(BizObjects.Player player) { var entity = new EntityFramework.Player(); entity.PlayerId = player.PlayerId; entity.FirstName = player.FirstName; entity.LastName = player.LastName; entity.Gender = player.Gender; entity.BirthDate = player.BirthDate; entity.DisplayAge = player.DisplayAge; entity.Level = player.Level; entity.PlayingHand = player.PlayingHand; entity.BackhandType = player.BackhandType; entity.PlayingStyle = player.PlayingStyle; entity.Description = player.Description; entity.UserId = player.UserId; entity.Address = new Address(); entity.Address.AddressId = player.Address.AddressId; entity.Address.Line1 = player.Address.Line1; entity.Address.Line2 = player.Address.Line2; entity.Address.City = player.Address.City; entity.Address.State = player.Address.State; entity.Address.ZipCode = player.Address.ZipCode; _entities.AddToPlayer(entity); _entities.SaveChanges(); return entity.PlayerId; } I am new to using EF. Any pointers is greatly appreciated.
