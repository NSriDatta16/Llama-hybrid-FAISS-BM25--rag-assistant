How to measure marginal effect of interdependent variables on a binary outcome?

My data represents observations on a possible sequences of events that may lead to a positive outcome (y). Each event (A, B, C, D) is dependent on the previous event; for D to occur C must occur, for C to occur B must occur, for B to occur A must occur. Some example rows to illustrate: A B C D y 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 I'd like to measure the relative impact of each event on the probability of y. For example, I'd like to be able to make statements such as "Event B increase the probability by 10% compared to if only Event A occurs. However Event C only increases the probability by a further 1%". I've considered using logistic regression. However, I have a concern that due to the inherent collinearity in the data the regression coefficients will not be reliable to infer from. What possible methods could I use/explore?
