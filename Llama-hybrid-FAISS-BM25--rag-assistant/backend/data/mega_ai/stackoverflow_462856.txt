Perforce, Projects shared among multiple Solutions

UPDATE : So it turns out that we may have found a bug in Visual Studio 2003 (I know...no surprise). We found out that if the solutions were added to the repository using Visual Studio (using Add Solution to Source Control) everything went fine...go figure. So we're converting our VSS repository (if it can be called that) to Perforce and we're running into issues with projects included in multiple solutions. Our repository might look like this... //Depot DevMain Solution1 Project1 (Builds to a DLL) Solution2 (Has Project1 as a project reference) Project2 Solution3 (Has Project1 as a project reference) Project3 When using the integrated Source Control in Visual Studio for Solution2 it complains that the projects are not under the current solutions folder and we may want to move it. Because multiple solutions reference Project 1 we can never organize it where one solution won't complain... Is the best practice to just build Project1 to DLL and store it in a Lib folder? Or is there a better way? Thanks.
