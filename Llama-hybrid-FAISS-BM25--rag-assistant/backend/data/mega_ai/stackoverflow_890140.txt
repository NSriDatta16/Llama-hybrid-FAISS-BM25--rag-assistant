Matt, I don't think you are going to be able to test your non-java GUIs with Java libraries. That being said, you could take a look at AutomationAnywhere (.com) and see if that fits your needs. This tool is very robust and very expensive, which may not be an issue if your company is going to pay for it. You might try a free trial out and see what you think. Good luck, -Robert
