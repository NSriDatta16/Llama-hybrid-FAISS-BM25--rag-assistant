How accurate does my machine learning model need to be?

Is there any way to determine upfront how accurate a model should be before it's worth putting into production? Just aiming for the highest accuracy possible doesn't tell us anything about the money a company would save with a 75% versus 80% model. Say we needed to predict the number of mechanical failures. If the national average is 100/year but our company is getting 125, how accurate does our model need to be (how many correct predictions does it need to make) to get our company back down the national average?
