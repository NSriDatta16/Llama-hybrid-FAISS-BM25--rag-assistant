How to understand dates in ARIMA model output in R

I am trying to fit ARIMA model into my stock's Price Closing from 02 Jan 2013 to 31 December 2016. I am trying to find a quick way to it because there is a lot many companies I have to apply on and then I landed to auto.arima function. Now my predictive output is I can't understand the dates. Here is my program: stockdata And here is my final output when I plot my forecast: Anyone can please help me fix this if the modelling is wrong or can tell me about those dates would be really helpful. P.S. I am not in data science and totally Noob.
