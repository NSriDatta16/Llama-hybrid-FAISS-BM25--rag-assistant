How to extract string from custom characters using JavaScript?

If I have a string between 2 square brackets that I have created on a page, how would I go about storing that value in a variable and deleting the square brackets? Example [String I want] So I'm left with var mystring = "String I want" UPDATE: It appears I can't reply to any of you. SO must be acting up. Anyway this is what I am using var wholeParagraph = $('.comment-body p'); var rating = wholeParagraph.substring(wholeParagraph.indexOf('['), 1+wholeParagraph.lastIndexOf(']')); alert(rating); Doesn't seem to work?
