Probability based on average/historical data

I have ten years of data, which I have averaged. Is it possible to calculate the probability that a future point will be less than a threshold based on my data? For example, say the average is 0.065. How can I calculate the probability P that a future data point will be less than 0.1? I am looking at daily data points, where each day is an average of the daily data for the previous ten years. I understand I may need something other than the average, like a distribution or something, but I do not know what that is. Depending on how specific an answer is, I can look up equations and formulas. Thanks.
