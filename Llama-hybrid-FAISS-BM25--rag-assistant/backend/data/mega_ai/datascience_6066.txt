Text classification: Choosing training and testing set for each category

I am very new to machine learning. I have a text classification problem in hand. I have a tagged dataset of around 750 documents( short texts), categorized manually into 16 buckets. I want to train a classifier on this data. I know that there should be a training set and a test set (an option could be 80-20 ). In my understanding, this should be for the complete set( 80% of my 750 documents- training, 20% of 750 documents - testing ). 1. They should be randomly generated or is there some condition for category? ie. if category A constitutes 60%,category B 5%, C 7% etc. how to choose the training set?
