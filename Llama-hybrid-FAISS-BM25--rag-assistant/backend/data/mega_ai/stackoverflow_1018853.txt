Why is the use of alloca() not considered good practice?

alloca() allocates memory on the stack rather than on the heap, as in the case of malloc() . So, when I return from the routine the memory is freed. So, actually this solves my problem of freeing up dynamically allocated memory. Freeing of memory allocated through malloc() is a major headache and if somehow missed leads to all sorts of memory problems. Why is the use of alloca() discouraged in spite of the above features?
