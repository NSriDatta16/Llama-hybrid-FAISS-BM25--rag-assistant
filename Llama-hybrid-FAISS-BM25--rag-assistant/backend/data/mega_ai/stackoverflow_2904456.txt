The main problem of contemporary cryptography is not finding algorithms but whole concepts and approaches for different situations (but of course the algorithms are continually improved too). We have today Symmetric algorithms (AES) Asymmetric algorithms (RSA, ECC) Key exchange (Diffie-Hellman-Key-Exchange, Shamir's no key protocol) Secret sharing (intersection of n-dimensional planes) Cryptographic hash functions (SHA) Some have proven insecure and were improved DES due to a much to small key-space MD5 and some are broken Merke/Hellman knapsack cryptosystem Monoalphabetic subsitution Naive Vigen√®re Which particular algorithm is chosen is often a question of available resources (elliptic curves need smaller keys that RSA algorithm for comparable safety) or just of standardization (as tanascius pointed out, there are competitions for such algorithms ). Totally new trends usually start when a whole class of cryptosystems has been shown vulnerable against a specific attack (man-in-the-middle, side-channel) or scientific progress is made (quantum cryptography). Of course, there is also steganography which doesn't attempt so conceal the content but the existence of a secret message by hiding it in other documents.
