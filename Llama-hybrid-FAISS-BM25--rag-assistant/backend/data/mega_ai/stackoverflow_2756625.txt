Do I have to clean custom properties (Expandos) on window.onunload event?

In one article I have seen that it may be good to clear all expandos on window.unload event to prevent memory leaks. I cannot understand why to do this. Isn't the browser cleaning all the DOM and its relevant resources of it once you leave the page anyway? Thanks, burak ozdogan
