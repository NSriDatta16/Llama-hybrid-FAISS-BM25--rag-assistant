Assuming your image is a bitmap and loaded into the TImage you can use the following procedure TmyForm.Button1Click(Sender: TObject); var mybmp:TBitmap; begin mybmp:= TBitmap.Create(); try mybmp.Assign(Image1.Picture.Bitmap); Image1.Picture.Bitmap.SetSize(Image1.Width,Image1.Height); Image1.Canvas.Brush.Bitmap := mybmp; Image1.Canvas.FillRect(Image1.BoundsRect); mybmp.FreeImage; finally FreeandNil(mybmp) end; end; Some notes: If you save the image after titling it you will save the titled version not the original. Image1.Canvas and Image1.Picture.Bitmap.Canvas are one and the same, that's why you need to resize the bitmap before painting on the canvas. If you try and assign the bitmap in the TImage to the brush without assigning it to another bitmap object first like so Image1.Canvas.Brush.Bitmap := Image1.Picture.Bitmap you get an exception "not enough storage".
