Correlating multiple readings from different sensors for the same variable

I have three sensors measuring the same parameter. Of these, one sensor (D) is more accurate than the other two which are both of the same type (B). I want to use sensor B for my experiments and then use some correlation to get an estimate of what sensor D would've measured - something along the lines of lm(D ~ B, data = experiment1) I have time series data from one experiment during which all three sensors ran over the same time period (D, B1 and B2). Now since there would be two measurements for each measurement by sensor D (one from each B1 and B2), I'm not sure how to model that. I'm not sure how to "mathematically" describe this problem but here's a some sample data (first six observations for each sensor). tme pm2.5 type 1: 2017-10-01 21:00:00 1.09096000 B1 2: 2017-10-01 21:00:59 1.09915000 B1 3: 2017-10-01 21:02:00 2.45066000 B1 4: 2017-10-01 21:02:59 858.76800000 B1 5: 2017-10-01 21:04:00 2290.21000000 B1 6: 2017-10-01 21:04:59 2285.36000000 B1 7: 2017-10-01 21:00:00 0.00478904 B2 8: 2017-10-01 21:00:59 0.01266030 B2 9: 2017-10-01 21:02:00 0.01089970 B2 10: 2017-10-01 21:02:59 336.47300000 B2 11: 2017-10-01 21:03:58 924.33600000 B2 12: 2017-10-01 21:04:00 988.95300000 B2 13: 2017-10-01 21:00:29 4.00000000 D 14: 2017-10-01 21:00:59 4.00000000 D 15: 2017-10-01 21:01:29 4.00000000 D 16: 2017-10-01 21:01:59 4.00000000 D 17: 2017-10-01 21:02:29 4.00000000 D 18: 2017-10-01 21:02:59 1150.00000000 D
