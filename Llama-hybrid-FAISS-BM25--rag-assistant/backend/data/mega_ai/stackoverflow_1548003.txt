XCode: Static Analyzer doesn't work if C/C++-Code used in project

with XCode 3.2.1 Apple delivered a built-in Clang static analyzer. I am working on an iPhone project which uses some C-Code (one .h and .c file). When running Build and Analyze , Clang refuses work. The build results window just says Build Succeeded . Any ideas how to get it running with C/C++-Code? Regards, Norbert
