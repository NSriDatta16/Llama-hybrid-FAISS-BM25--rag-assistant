Michael's answer above is spot on (or the link he points to is). Here are the steps I had to take to get it to work: Have an ad-hoc certificate for which the device UDID is checked. Install that cert by dragging it onto the XCode icon. On the project, create a distribution configuration and set your build params to the appropriate device | distribution. Right now, we build for Device 3.0 | Distribution. My project did not include an Entitlements.plist file - I had to add it by selecting from the menu File | Add File | IPhone OS | Entitlements, and call the new file Entitlements.plist The new plist file has only one row - set the value of that row to unchecked. In the project build configuration, in the line for Code Signing Entitlements, enter the Entitlements.plist filename as the value. In the Code Signing Identity, select the ad-hoc certificate identity (though I have found that you can also use your distribution certificate identity) NOW BUILD :) Deliver the resulting app file plus the ad-hoc cert to the person who gave you their UDID. Should work :).
