I'm not aware of any way to load multiple strings atomically, but there are a couple of things that you can do to make the process more efficient: Call CComboBox::InitStorage before adding items to pre-allocate memory Use InsertString instead of AddString to prevent triggering a sort on each addition (assuming the CBS_SORT style is enabled)
