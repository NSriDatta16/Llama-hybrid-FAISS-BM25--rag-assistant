I would base your decision on how much granular control you want to have over the elements of your application and whether or not you wish to make use of the MVC design pattern i.e. if you have several developers working on this project and you wish to follow a convention. There are many drag and drop controls (GridView, DetailsView) bundled with Web Forms that are great for creating report based web apps quickly that don't exist with the MVC Framework. Using MVC will likely increase the development time of your project. Lack of ViewState is not a reason to pick MVC over Web Forms. If you understand ViewState it is possible to create an app with Web Forms that has little or no ViewState. A simple Google/Bing search will help you find out how to disable and/or reduce ViewState. I like to use MVC for greater control over HTML (especially for heavy AJAX websites) and for the design pattern convention. If you haven't yet heard of it, I also recommend taking a look at "Crystal Reports".
