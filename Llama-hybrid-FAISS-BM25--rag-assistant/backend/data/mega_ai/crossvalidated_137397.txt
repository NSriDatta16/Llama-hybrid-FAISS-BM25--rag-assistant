Let's pay close attention to the definitions: Mean is defined as the sum of a collection of numbers divided by the number of numbers in the collection. The calculation would be "for i in 1 to n, (sum of x sub i) divided by n." Expected value (EV) is the long-run average value of repetitions of the experiment it represents. The calculation would be "for i in 1 to n, sum of event x sub i times its probability (and the sum of all p sub i must = 1)." In the case of a fair die, it is easy to see that the mean and the EV are the same. Mean - (1+2+3+4+5+6)/6 - 3.5 and EV would be: prob x p*x 0.167 1 0.17 0.167 2 0.33 0.167 3 0.50 0.167 4 0.67 0.167 5 0.83 0.167 6 1.00 EV=sum(p*x) = 3.50 But what if the die were not "fair." An easy way to make an unfair die would be to drill a hole in the corner at the intersection of the 4, 5, and 6 faces. Further let's now say that the probability of rolling a 4, 5, or 6 on our new and improved crooked die is now .2 and the probability of rolling a 1, 2, or 3 is now .133. It is the same die with 6 faces, one number on each face and the mean for this die is still 3.5. However, after rolling this die many times, our EV is now 3.8 because the probabilities for the events are no longer the same for all events. prob x p*x 0.133 1 0.13 0.133 2 0.27 0.133 3 0.40 0.200 4 0.80 0.200 5 1.00 0.200 6 1.20 EV=sum(p*x) = 3.80 Again, let's be careful and go back to the definition before concluding that one thing will always be "the same" as another. Take a look at how a normal die is set up and drill a hole in the other 7 corners and see how the EVs change - have fun. Bob_T
