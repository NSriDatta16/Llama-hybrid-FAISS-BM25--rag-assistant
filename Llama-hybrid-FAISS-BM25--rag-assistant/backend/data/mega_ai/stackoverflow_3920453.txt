Custom memory allocator/manager in C ? which approach?

I looking for some (custom) memory managers/allocator written in c and went through some articles, - Some Links : IBM - Inside memory management Valgrind - How to Shadow Every Byte of Memory Used by a Program Stack Overflow Question - Write your own memory manager ned Productions - nedmalloc Homepage Two-Level Segregate Fit (TLSF) - Website Wikipedia - Dynamic memory allocation Fourmilab - The BGET Memory Allocator I have to sandbox a small web-server using any available one and I have no problem in writing wrappers for thread handling / allocation scheme. Apache WS uses memory pools for handling memory and the pools are not persistent, it is per-request basis. Can you guys suggest something? Some good / best approach to this problem ? My requirements are as below ;- (Bounded Response Time) allocation and de-allocation has to be known in advance, i.e some constant cost O(c), where c is constant. Fragmentation from heterogeneous allocation/de-allocation sizes or sequences should be handled, I can write the schema / wrapper to provide the same. Truly appreciate you help and ideas!
