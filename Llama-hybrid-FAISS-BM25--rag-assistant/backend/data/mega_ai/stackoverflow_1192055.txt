textarea occasionally missing in $_POST but content_length always correct?

A strange bug has popped up on a server running a fairly active site. Server: Apache/2.2.3 (CentOS) PHP: 5.2.6 eAccelerator 0.9.5.3 While using multipart forms, occasionally data sent from a textarea will be missing in the $_POST We know the data was sent because content_length shows a reasonable size over 1K All other input fields in the form are properly received. It is NOT browser specific and happens on IE/Firefox/Chrome. Works nearly 99% of the time, only fails 1 or 2 times on average for every hundred posts made. On very rare occasion we've been able to reproduce it ourselves so we know data is being sent, just not processed by either apache/php All of these settings have been checked and are reasonable in php.ini: memory_limit max_input_time upload_max_file_size post_max_filesize in httpd.conf LimitRequestBody TimeOut Would love to hear other ideas what this might be. I cannot find any known related bug for PHP.
