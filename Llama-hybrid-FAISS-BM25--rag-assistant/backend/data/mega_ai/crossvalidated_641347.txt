Given your example you assume that A "listens" to C , or in other words C predicts A : C -> A Confounder In this setting, when you talk about a confounder B means that B influences both C and A . For example, you want to predict the effect of education on salary. In this case, your B could be things like socioeconomic status or other demographic factors (gender, age, etc.). Having rich and influential parents may make it easier for you to get access to top universities, which may get you access to higher paying jobs; but having influential parents may also give you access to higher paying jobs regardless of your education: C A In statistical models, you can control for confounders by adding them to your model, in which case those predictor variables are also often called covariates . I have seen these terms used interchangeably. Mediator On the other hand, a mediator is the mechanism that explains the relationship of a predictor variable on the outcome. For example, you are applying treatment ( C ) to a plant seedling which increases its growth ( A ), however, in reality, C positively influences the soil microbial community ( B ), which directly affects the plants' ability to take up nutrients faster: C -> B -> A For mediation analysis see here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mediation_(statistics) Edit to address Graham's comment below Be aware that when you think that a variable acts as a mediator you likley don't want to include it into your model together with your predictor variable as it might cause unstable estimates and incorrect standard errors due to collinearity with the predictor. In Pearl's "The Book of Why" he even goes to say that: ... mistaking a mediator for a confounder is one of the deadliest sins in causal inference and may lead to the most outragous errors. The latter invites adjustment; the former forbids it. Moderator In the hypothetical example above, a moderator could be soil water status. Depending on soil moisture ( M ), the relationship of treatment C on growth A depends, or is moderated by soil water content. The moderator in this sense, represents an interaction effect . This could look something like this (probably not formally correct): C -> B*M -> A You could test whether or not a variable acts as a moderator by including it as an interaction term in your statistical model. Note: What I presented above, are overly simplified examples and if you are really interested in a clear treatment (pun-intended) of this topic, you should look into Judea Pearl's work ( http://bayes.cs.ucla.edu/jp_home.html ). I'm looking for a simple, hopefully easy-to-explain reason why I would use one of the four over the other. I hope given those examples, it is clear that you cannot really "use" any of those in your analysis. You can identify them in your scientific model and then account for them in your statistical models.
