There's probably a easy way to do this using PHP / Magento code, but if you want to look directly at the database: Try something like this: SELECT entity_id AS categoryID, value AS categoryName FROM catalog_category_entity_varchar WHERE attribute_id=111 But attribute_id might be something other than 111 for you. Take a look at the table to see.
