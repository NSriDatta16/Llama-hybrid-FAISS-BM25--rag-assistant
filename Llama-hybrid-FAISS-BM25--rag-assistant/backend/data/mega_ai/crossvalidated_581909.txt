Although the concept of random sampling is central to much of statistical theory, in practice it is rare. For example, in surveys involving humans, it is usually not practical to contact most people, let alone to compel them to participate if randomly selected. Consequently, many alternatives exist to random sampling. A sample that is not a random sample is known as a non-random or non-probability sample. Specific types of non-random sampling include quota sampling, convenience sampling, volunteer sampling, purposive sampling, and snowball sampling. It is common practice to use as much randomization as possible when employing these techniques, in the hope that the resulting sample approximates the qualities of a random sampling. Nevertheless, when significant randomization does occur within non-random samples, they can have properties that are closer to random samples. For example, with s quota sampling, if randomly contacting people and continuing to do so until all quotas are met, this approach can lead to a sample that is approximately random (Seymour Sudman, Applied Sampling, Academic Press, 1976). In practice, nearly all samples are non-probability samples. For example, in the case of political polling, some people are not contactable, and others refuse to participate. As a result, all political polls are convenience samples. This is true of just about all samples of living organisms. You may read more on this at this link
