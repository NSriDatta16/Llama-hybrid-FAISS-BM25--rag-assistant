GoogleMock from Google or Isolator++ from Typemock. Isolator++ is a mocking framework which works with several UT frameworks. You don't need that as part of a UT framework (you can instrument binaries and get coverage in VS). Isolator++ has VS integration AFAIK. Like you are saying this is very common, so it will be hard to not find it in mainstream frameworks. The continuous build system should support your framework if you really want that (TeamCity supports a couple of them for example). Otherwise you can always wrap it with some scripts. Not sure what you require here. HTH.
