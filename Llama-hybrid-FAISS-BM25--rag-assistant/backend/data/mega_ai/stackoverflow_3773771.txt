This should work on pretty much every SQL dialect: SELECT last_name, first_name FROM names WHERE last_name IN ( SELECT last_name FROM names GROUP BY last_name HAVING COUNT(*) > 1 ) It will give you a result set like this, though: Smith Jack Smith Joe Smith Anna Sixpack Joe Sixpack Eve The most elegant solution for displaying this in the desired format IMO is to just re-arrange the result set programmatically in the client application instead of pulling all sorts of obscure SQL stunts; something like (pseudocode): for each row in resultset if row[last_name] <> previous_last_name print newline, print last_name print ' ' print first_name
