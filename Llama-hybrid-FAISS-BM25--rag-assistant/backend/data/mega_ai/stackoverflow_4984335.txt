VIM: dynamic runtimepath per module.vim and slow startup

I'm using VIM 7.1 on Debian. I have 9 plugins that I load via pathogen.vim. It takes around 8 sec's to load which is quite slow since this is in non-GUI/xterm mode. I ran vim -V and it shows that each module is being searched for in multiple directories. Initially, ftoff.vim, debian.vim and other "system" related .vim files are searched for in ~/.vim/ and then in /usr/share/vim/vim71/ - I fixed this by moving my .vimrc to .vim/vimrc and: export VIM=/root/.vim, within .vimrc i did a set runtimepath=/usr/share/vim/vim71 But now, when the modules load, they alter this runtimepath and when pathogen loads it's even worse. Is there a way to specify a hash of module-name to dirPath so that this error prone lookup is avoided? Or a way to manually specify runtimepath on a per module basis within vimrc? Here is an example of my runtimepath after pathogen loads my modules. Obviously, any further loading of a module invovles searching all those pathnames before locating the right path. runtimepath=~/.vim,~/.vim/bundle/Align294,~/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim_-_Elegant_buffer_explorer,~/.vim/bu ndle/The_NERD_Commenter,~/.vim/bundle/The_NERD_tree,~/.vim/bundle/pathogen,~/.vim/bundle/vim-addon-mw-utils, /.vim/bundle/tlib,~/.vim/bundle/snipMate,~/.vim/bundle/SuperTab,~/.vim/bundle/surround,~/.vim/bundle/taglist ~/.vim/bundle/Align294,~/.vim/bundle/minibufexpl.vim_-_Elegant_buffer_explorer,~/.vim/bundle/pathogen,~/.vim bundle/snipMate,~/.vim/bundle/SuperTab,~/.vim/bundle/surround,~/.vim/bundle/taglist,~/.vim/bundle/The_NERD_C mmenter,~/.vim/bundle/The_NERD_tree,~/.vim/bundle/tlib,~/.vim/bundle/vim-addon-manager,~/.vim/bundle/vim-add n-manager-known-repositories,~/.vim/bundle/vim-addon-mw-utils,/var/lib/vim/addons,/usr/share/vim/vimfiles,/u r/share/vim/vim71,/usr/share/vim/vimfiles/after,/var/lib/vim/addons/after,~/.vim/bundle/snipMate/after,~/.vi /after,~/.vim/bundle/snipMate/after
