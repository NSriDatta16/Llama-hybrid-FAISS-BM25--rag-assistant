This is something quite easily determined with a very simple test page. You can only store one value per key, and the values are not cleared when the cache is cleared. (I've just tried Firefox so far ...) You can store a list of values in a single key by writing your own function to do it: function addToPersistentList(listName, value) { var val = localStorage[listName] || []; val.push(value); localStorage[listName] = val; // THIS DOES NOT WORK } edit oops it only supports stored strings; crap. OK well if you have json2 you'd do this: function addToPersistentList(listName, value) { var val = localStorage[listName] ? JSON.parse(localStorage[listName]) : []; val.push(value.toString()); localStorage[listName] = JSON.stringify(val); } Of course this causes issues if you want to store dates etc.
