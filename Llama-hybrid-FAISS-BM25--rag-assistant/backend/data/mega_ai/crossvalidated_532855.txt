You haven't provided much information within your post but I'll try to answer just based on the title. optimization is a fancy way of saying "make it better" - this could refer to reducing variance (i.e. solving for over-fitting), reducing bias, or simply making your model more accurate. Pruning in keras refers to removing unnecessary neurons and weights from a deep learning model. It's a way to make neural networks smaller, faster, and more efficient. Pruning also refers to a specific method to reduce over-fitting in a random forest model (which is different from pruning in keras ). regularization is a method to solve for overfitting , like you mentioned. It may help to clarify where your confusion lies.
