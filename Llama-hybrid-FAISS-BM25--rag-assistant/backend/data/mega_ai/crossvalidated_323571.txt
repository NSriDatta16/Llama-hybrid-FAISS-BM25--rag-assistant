How to classify M multivariate time series into K known categories?

I have $M$ stacks of multivariate time series ($N$ variables sampled over $T$ time points), and each of the $M$ multivariate time series is associated with one of $K$ known classes. My goals are: (1) being able to predict to which of the $K$ classes a given multivariate time series belongs; (2) determine what is the subset of $N$ variables that contributes the most to each of the $K$ classes over the $M$ multivariate time series. EXAMPLE I have $M$ different trials, each of them storing the recorded activity of $N$ neurons ($N$>1000) while the animal is either moving one finger (class $K_1$) or another (class $K_2$). As such, each of the $M$ trials is associated with either one or the other class. My goals are: (1) to predict which one of the two fingers the animal will move given the recorded activity of the $N$ neurons. (2) identifying which are the subsets of neurons that are responsible for the movement of either one or the other finger.
