Regular expressions are a pretty fragile tool to use for this kind of problem, especially if there's any risk at all that a table's cell content could be another table. (In that case, the first tag you find after a start tag may not actually be closing that element but a descendant element.) A much more robust way to tackle problems like these is to parse the HTML into a DOM and then examine the DOM. The HTML Agility Pack is one that people seem to like.
