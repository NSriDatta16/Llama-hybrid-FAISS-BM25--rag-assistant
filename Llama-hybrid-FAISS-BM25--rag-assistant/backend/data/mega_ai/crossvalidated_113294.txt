Does GARCH($p$,0) make sense at all?

I wonder if a GARCH model with only "autoregressive" terms and no lagged innovations makes sense. I have never seen examples of GARCH($p$,0) in the literature. Should the model be discarded altogether? E.g. GARCH(1,0): $$ \sigma^2_t = \omega + \delta \sigma^2_{t-1}. $$ From the above expression one can derive (by repeated substitution) that $$ \sigma^2_t \rightarrow \frac{ \omega }{ 1-\delta } $$ for all $t$, if an infinite past of the process is assumed. In other words, GARCH(1,0) implies homoskedasticity and thus the "autoregressive" term, and indeed the whole model, becomes redundant. Edit: My argumentation in the paragraph above was imprecise and likely misleading. The point I was trying to make (and John's answer below helped me realize and formulate it better) is that whatever the initial conditional variance is, after a long enough time the conditional variance will stabilize around the level $\frac{ \omega }{ 1-\delta }$. However, it will at the same time obey the law of motion $\sigma^2_t = \omega + \delta \sigma_{t-1}^2$. The two can only be reconciled with $\omega=0$ and $\delta=1$. The latter implies constant conditional variance. Hence, GARCH(1,0) only makes sense when $\omega=0$ and $\delta=1$, which means the whole GARCH model is redundant as the conditional variance is constant. (End of edit) Of course, when estimating models in practice, we do not have infinite past; but for long enough time series this approximation should be reasonably representative. Is this right? Should we never use GARCH($p$,0)?
