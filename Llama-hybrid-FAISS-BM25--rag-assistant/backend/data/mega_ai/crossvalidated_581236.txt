How to design AB test for mean of means

I want to conduct an A/B test in order to measure the impact of an offline voucher promotion to our company's collection rate. We are trying to incentivise customers to not miss an instalment by offering this voucher to every customer who won't miss a payment for a specific period of time. Question 1: We are planning to set Collection Rate as a primary metric. Specifically, the average of each customer's collection rate during the experiment. Is this an apropriate metric and also is it correct to assume that this is a continuous metric since I am measuring the mean of binary distributions(missed/ didn't miss payments). Question 2: What is the most appropriate formula to calculate minimum sample size? Question 3: How to define the AB test duration. From the material I found, business cycles is the practical approach but this is less relevant and/or difficult to define in my case. In that case, should the duration of the experiment be equal to the period needed to unlock the voucher offer? Or twice that? Is there any empirical or theoretical approach? Edit: typos
