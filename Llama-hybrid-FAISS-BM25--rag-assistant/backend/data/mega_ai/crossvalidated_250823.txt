How many layers of a neural network are needed to get 0 training error?

Is there a general formula for this? I read (no of inputs + no of outputs)^0.5 + (1 to 10). to fix the constant value (last part, 0 to 10), use trial and error and find the optimal no of hidden layer neurons for the min MSE. but I was wondering if there was a more specific formula.
