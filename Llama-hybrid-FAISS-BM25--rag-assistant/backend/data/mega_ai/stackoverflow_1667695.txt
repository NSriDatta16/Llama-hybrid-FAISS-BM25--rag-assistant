What if my process is too long for transaction timeout duration?

I would like to know what are the best practices, if you have a quite long lasting process that ends up with a transaction timeout and which should definitely be possible to rollback if any exception is thrown within? Imagine that all along the application set timeout duration is quite enough but for such a specific one it is not long enough. How do you overcome scenarios similar to this? Do the people kind of simulate transactions to solve this or re-set timeout duration only for this process... Any other ways that are safe? Thanks, burak ozdogan
