Coordinates as model features

My goal is to predict the taxi demand depending on location and time in NYC. Hence, among other variables my dataset contains coordinates. My question is, can I use them as a predictor for my models? Clearly, for linear regression I cannot include the coordinates in my model. But what about random forests ?
