How to Handle Data vs Visual Representation Granularity Mismatch in Line Chart?

A bit simplifying here but I'm facing a problem with granularity when representing data in Time/Value format visually as a Line Chart . Where let's say, the Value is Balance of a bank account. The minimum granularity permissible for display on Line Chart is by minute. However, data as shown in table below may change multiple times within a minute. For example, in the minute of 9:03 in the table below. Time Value ------- ----- 9:01:30 100 9:02:40 200 9:03:10 1000 9:03:20 200 9:03:50 300 9:04:10 400 9:05:20 500 What's the best way to represent such data with granularity mismatch? A couple of approaches I've considered - To show only the last value for a given minute (300 in this case as last recorded value for 9:03). However, this way I will miss the fluctuations that happened within that minute? To use average of all the points within a minute. However, this may be confusing as the user may not be able to match changes in balance with corresponding transactions. Please suggest any common algorithms / techniques to handle this kind of problem?
