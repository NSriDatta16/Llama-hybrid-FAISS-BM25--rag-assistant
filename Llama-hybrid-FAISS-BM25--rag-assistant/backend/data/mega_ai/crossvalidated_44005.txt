Poisson regression with both response and explanatory variables as counting

I’ve got the following variables: Response: number of quota units leased (in and out) by fishers. Explanatory: number of quota units own by fishers. I fitted a GLM (Poisson), but I’m not totally sure if it’s right, considering that the explanatory variable is count as well. I’ve found examples of Poisson regression just with categorical and continuous explanatory variables, but not with counting variables. So: Am I right using Poisson with my data? If not so, what alternative do I have? The residuals variances of my model are not homogeneous. I understand that Poisson regression allows face this problem, or should I pay attention to this issue and solve it (using weights, for example)? Any help would much appreciated, Cheers
