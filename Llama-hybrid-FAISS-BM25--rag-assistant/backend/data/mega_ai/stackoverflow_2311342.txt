I don't like it. If I see a link I expect it to open a browser window when clicked. More standard would be to have a little "edit" button/icon next the label. You could get away with having a link-style "(edit)" after the text, that would also look quite normal rather than suggesting a browser is involved. e.g: Organisation: | Acme Dustbins (edit) | or Organisation: | Acme Dustbins| (edit)
