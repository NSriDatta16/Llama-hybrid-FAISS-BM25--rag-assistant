K-Lipschitz for the Wasserstein GANs

I am trying to follow this blog for Wasserstein loss for Generative Adversarial Networks: From GAN to WGAN . Actually, I am trying to follow the logic behind the K-Lipschitz continuity. This post in order to describe it, make use of a function a $f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ which is K-Lipschitz if: $$|f(x_{1}) - f(x_{2})| \leq K|x_{1}- x_{2}|,$$ with $x_{1}, x_{2} \in \mathbb{R}$ to be scalars. How this function can be transformed for the needs of GANs where the input is not a scalar. How K-Lipschitz is transformed in multiple dimensions?
