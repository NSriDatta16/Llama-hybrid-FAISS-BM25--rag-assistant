Low-dimensional binary classification datasets

If one would like to study aspects of neural networks (say, in an academic paper), and would like to experiment on binary classification of vectors in low-dimensional space (say dim=2 or dim `` generic" enough to be considered representative for an academic study of neural net behavior.
