QTreeView with drag and drop support in PyQt

In PyQt 4 I would like to create a QTreeView with possibility to reorganize its structure with drag and drop manipulation. I have implemented my own model(QAbstractItemModel) for QTreeView so my QTreeView properly displays the data. Now I would like to add drag and drop support for tree's nodes to be able to move a node inside the tree from one parent to another one, drag-copy and so on, but I cannot find any complete tutorial how to achieve this. I have found few tutorials and hints for QTreeWidget, but not for QTreeView with custom model. Can someone point me where to look? Thank you.
