#pragma once specifies that the file will be included (opened) only once by the compiler when compiling a source code file. This can reduce build times as the compiler will not open and read the file after the first #include of the module. If you don't #pragma once , the file will be opened each time it is needed and compiler will stop parsing it on #ifndef BOOST_ASIO_HPP , if it has been defined.
