No, it does not matter that $r_{daily}$ and $r_{monthly}$ have different volatilities, if you recognise this will largely be taken into account in the value of $\beta$. I assume $r$ takes a value of $0.01$ for an increase of 1%, and a value of $-0.25$ for a fall of a quarter. I suppose you could turn $r_{monthly}$ into an average daily return rather than a cumulative return by using $\frac{r_{monthly}}{d}$ or $\sqrt[d]{1+r_{monthly}}-1$ instead, where $d$ is the number of (trading?) days in the month, but the main effect would be to multiply $\beta$ by about $d$. Better still would be to look at $\log_e(1+r_{daily})$ and either $\log_e(1+r_{monthly})$ or $\frac{\log_e(1+r_{monthly})}{d}$ although, for $x$ close to $0$, $\log_e(1+x)\approx x$ so it may not make much difference. A much more serious issue is autocorrelation . Your model suggests there is autocorrelation (the change in a day is regressed on what has happened the previous month). But because your $r_{monthly}$ values are clearly autocorrelated with each other (they overlap), I would expect you to find autocorrelation of the residuals, and that may reduce the value of your model.
