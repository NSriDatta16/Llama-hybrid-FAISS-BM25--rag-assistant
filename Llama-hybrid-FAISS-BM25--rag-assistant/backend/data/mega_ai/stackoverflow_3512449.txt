SQL Server 2005 and up has something called pivot , but it is still not one command and you need to know the values in the Time sold column. You can use a dynamic pivot approach as demonstrated by Itzik Ben-Gan in his Inside Microsoft SQL Server 2008: T-SQL Querying book Example create table #test (Item char(1), TimeSold varchar(20)) insert #test values('A','05/2010') insert #test values('B','04/2010') insert #test values('C','03/2010') insert #test values('A','04/2010') insert #test values('A','05/2010') SELECT * FROM (SELECT Item,TimeSold FROM #test) AS pivTemp PIVOT ( COUNT(TimeSold) FOR TimeSold IN ([05/2010],[04/2010],[03/2010]) ) AS pivTable
