Rails has always ignored the select argument(s) when using include or includes . If you want to use your select argument then use joins instead. You might be having a problem with the query gem you're talking about but you can also include sql fragments using the joins method. Project.select("name").joins(['some sql fragement for users', 'left join companies c on c.id = projects.company_id']) I don't know your schema so i'd have to guess at the exact relationships but this should get you started.
