How to make an Ant task to sign and pack200 all my JAR files?

My JAR files must be signed for a webstart application. It would be nice to also have them packed to minimize the download time. I'm trying to configure an Ant task to automatically do it during the deploy of the application. Since the pack process reorganizes the jar internal structure invalidating the signature, the Pack200 documentation recommends a 3 steps process: Repack the JAR with pack200 Sign the JAR with jarsigner Compress JAR jar with pack200 generating an .jar.pack.gz file Ant has a default signjar task, and Sun published a Pack200 ant task . The problem is that Sun pack200 task just operate on one file at a time and the repack operation must specify an output file. I believe it should be a fairly common operation, but my ant file is becoming overly complex and there's too many temporary files. Time to beg for the wisdom of the community: Is there an easy or, at least, standard way to pack and sign all my JAR files?
