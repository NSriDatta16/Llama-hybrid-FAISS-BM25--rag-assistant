With dummy coding, $\{0,1\}$ , for each IV, the 4 cells would take on the values sad/low: $\mu$ sad/high: $\mu+\alpha$ happy/low: $\mu+\beta$ happy/high: $\mu + \alpha + \beta + \gamma$ So, the intercept of the model is just the average for the sad/low group, the effect for being in the high group is $\alpha$ , the effect for being in the happy group is $\beta$ , the the interaction (the deviation from the addition model) is $\gamma$ . This can be interpreted either as the amount of "error" in the additive model for the 4th cell, or as the change in the "slope" as you move from one value of one of the IV to the other value. (Symmetry makes choice for the IV irrelevant in this case, but there usually is a better contextual choice for explanatory purposes with real data sets.) With effects coding, $\{-1,1\}$ (assuming a balanced design), the 4 cells would take on the following values sad/low: $\mu - \alpha - \beta + \gamma$ sad/high: $\mu + \alpha - \beta - \gamma$ happy/low: $\mu -\alpha + \beta - \gamma$ happy/high: $\mu +\alpha + \beta + \gamma$ In this case, $\mu$ is not the sad/low group, but the overall (grand) average. Thus, $\alpha$ is the half the difference of the measured effect between low and high (added to one and subtracted from the other). The $\beta$ is the same but for sad/happy. This leaves the interaction effect to be half the distance that the "slope" would shift if the additive model doesn't fully capture the nature of the data.
