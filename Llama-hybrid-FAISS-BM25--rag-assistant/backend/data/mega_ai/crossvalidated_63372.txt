How to model multivariate time series

I have a set of $n=1000$ samples of 4 dimensions (multivariate) where each measurement obtained from GPS tracking data is taken at a time interval representing spatial coordinates $(x,y)$, velocity. So, the data set contains 5 columns (another dimension for time) of 1000 tuples. Since there are 4 correlated vectors, then there should be 4 variables in the model each representing a measurement. I am really struggling to determine: How to begin modelling with multiple inputs and single output Which model to choose? Does the modelling choice depend on the probability distribution? If so then what is the relation? Should it be linear or non-linear models? Illustration with a small example will really be helpful.
