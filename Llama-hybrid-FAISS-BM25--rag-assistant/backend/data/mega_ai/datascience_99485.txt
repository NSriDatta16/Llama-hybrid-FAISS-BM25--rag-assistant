Theoretical differences between KPCA and t-SNE?

I (think I) understand the underlying principles of most dimensionality reduction methods (MDS, IsoMap, t-SNE, Spectral Embedding, Diffusion maps, etc...). Some of the algorithms I use the most are Kernel PCA (with a gaussian kernel) and t-SNE. My question is, do you know some theoretical reasons when to use t-SNE or kernel PCA? Do you know which are their relative strengths/weaknesses are? Are there some known cases where one is better than the other? Do their results have different characteristics (I have noticed that KPCA tends to preserve the density of points, while t-SNE spreads the points with more or less uniform density)? This type of thing...
