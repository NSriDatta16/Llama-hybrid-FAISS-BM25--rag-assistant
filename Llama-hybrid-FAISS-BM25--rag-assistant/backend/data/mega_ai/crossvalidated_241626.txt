Using Hodrick-Prescott filters for analyzing and forecasting business time series

I have many time series data at work. Some are annual, some are quarterly, and some are monthly. I am exploring Digital Signal Processing (DSP) as a complementary approach to ARIMA and other methods. As a first step I am taking Hodrick-Prescott filter (HP Filter) for trend removing and forecasting. I am using R for my work. How do I use HP filter for forecasting? What are the drawbacks that I should be aware of? I read many positive and negative reviews of HP Filter. I would like to get a concrete suggestions.
