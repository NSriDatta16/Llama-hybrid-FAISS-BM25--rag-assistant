Is this possible yes, but only with red5, no. You will need to write your own library or use something like Xuggler. Red5 does not encode or decode audio or video data, so it is not able to merge or manipulate your stream in the way you would like. Also be aware that if you do use a library to gain access to the audio stream, you will need to pay close attention when merging so that you don't get hiss'es and pops in your output audio. A more involved method, than the one below will be needed for more than two streams: private short[] mixSamples(short[] samples1, short[] samples2) { short[] mixedSamples = new short[samples1.length]; for (int s = 0; s Short.MAX_VALUE ? Short.MAX_VALUE : sum); } return mixedSamples; }
