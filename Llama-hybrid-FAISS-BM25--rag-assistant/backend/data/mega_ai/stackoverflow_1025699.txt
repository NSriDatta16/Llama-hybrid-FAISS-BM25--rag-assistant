Hidden Features of VHDL

The original question was: What are some really useful but esoteric language features in VHDL that you've actually been able to employ to do useful work? The original question was deleted, and I was just answering. I think this is an interesting question, especially when you compare VHDL to other (normal) programming languages. Disclaimer: I only did few trivial examples in VHDL. But what I especially liked, when compared to other programming languages (which is probably not what you are asking about, but I think just for these things every programmer should know VHDL a bit): The ability to have several different implementations (architectures) of a single interface, and exchange them easily. The low-overhead parallelism inherent to the language model. It sort of reminds me of dataflow languages.
