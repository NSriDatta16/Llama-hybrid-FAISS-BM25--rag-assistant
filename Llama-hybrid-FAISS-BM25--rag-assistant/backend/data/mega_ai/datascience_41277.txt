I am unsure on how to do this statistically apart from using the slope. However, there are some interesting ways to think about time series in a given time period to find similarity. You could do as follows: Use the characteristics of the signal in a given time window and construct an n dimensional vector. You could use similarity measures or distance measures like cosine, manhattan etc to evaluate the similarity between them.
