Crude difference vs effect size

Let's assume I have two groups of animals with the following weights and the average difference of 8 kilograms: Could you explain in layman's language, how the calculate difference differs from the effect size? May I say something like that: A statistical test/technique adds uncertainty to the difference, meaning that it allows me to make inferences about the same difference in the whole population?
