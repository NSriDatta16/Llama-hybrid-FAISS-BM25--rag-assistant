MySQL has a CSV storage engine , that might do what you need, if your files are CSV files. Otherwise, you can use mysqlimport to import text files into MySQL. You could create a wrapper around mysqlimport, which figures out columns etc. and creates the necessary table. You might also be able to use DBD::AnyData , a Perl module which lets you access text files like a database. That said, it sounds a lot like you should really look at using a database. Is it really easier keeping table-oriented data in text files?
