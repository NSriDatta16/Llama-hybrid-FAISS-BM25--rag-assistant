I'm not sure to understand all the ins and outs of your problem, however here are a few suggestions that might help: Are the 60 sensors significant enough to make a prediction? Probably not. Maybe you could detect which ones are the most relevant first in order to have clean data and improve prediction results. 100ms might be too precise for predictive ML models. In addition to that, you can't replace a seal if your prediction comes in 300ms. You will want to size the problem to a human or physical realistic scale. Maybe having minutes containing the average or the max value of the 100ms set of values? Maybe hours? Therefore, some study about chain reactions of your problem could be necessary to have the right time scale. Like any other industrial problem, sensors' sensitivity may differ from one machine to another and there could be noise that alter them. If it is the case, you could also check if the sensors behavior are similar from one machine to another and set acceptance range, and reduce the noise to have comparable values between machines.
