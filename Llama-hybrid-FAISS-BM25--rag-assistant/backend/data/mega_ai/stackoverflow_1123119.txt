print is the same as x; x/1s 0x1234 -- will print out that location in memory as a string, if you keep hitting carrage return, it will print the next line... etc... If you want to monitor something continually, use display/ with the same format specifier as x (print). "display/1s 0x1234" then every time you break via a breakpoint or a single step, you will see the information you configured print out .. updated etc...
