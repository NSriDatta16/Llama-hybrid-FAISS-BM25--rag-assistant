How can I store more than 5 MB on an iPhone web app?

I am working on a magazine/portfolio application that is intended to be readable offline, saved as an icon on the home page. This is using a lot of images, but while I can keep the images down to a respectable size (200 KB or less, with alterations for iPhone vs iPad) the amount for the page surpasses the 5 MB limit for a web app cache. I have tried the cache manifest, but if the device is turned off or I clear the cache (which I do a lot while developing) the information is gone forever (and does not get resaved if I visit the bookmarked site while online again). I am exploring the use of base64 to store the smaller icons in a CSS file, but am not sure about how to build a local storage database for the other information (backgrounds, images, text, etc) that will be persistent without being tied to the Safari cache. Is this even possible? (The project is intended to be an open source publishing engine, so more people can create digital 'zines for the iPad.)
