In the TFS Administration Console, go to Build Configuration, and create a new Controller (and probably a new Agent). You can create a Build definition in your project in VS or Team Explorer, point to a project to build, select a workspace etc. Think of the build controller as the scheduler, and the agent as the thing that does the actual work, you can have several agents (if you want) that perform builds, and can be configured separately (if desired). Personally we have one agent, since most builds only take a few minutes we've not had any issues, you can check the build backlog from VS/Team Explorer and play around with the options as desired!
