What is the best data storage type for a triangular array?

Is there an Array or Data Type (eg ) that supports the arranging of values (specifically strings) into a triangular shape like this... 1 2 3 4 5 6 In my above example, each of these numbers holds a value of 2 characters of a string. If my string was "Hello I am a cat" , it would be split up into "He ll oI am ac at" . I want my program to store these values in an array similar to the triangle above - how could this be achieved? Is there a way to have the values moved around (e.g. 1=2 2=3 3=4 ).
