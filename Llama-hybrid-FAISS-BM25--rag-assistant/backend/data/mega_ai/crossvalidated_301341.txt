Characteristic polynomial in time series

I was reading some notes and something made me confuse about characteristic polynomial in ARIMA model. Suppose that I have the following AR(2) model $$x_t=0.6x_{t-1}-0.8x_{t-2}+\epsilon_t=x_t(1+0.6B-0.8B^2 )=a_t$$ Now came the doubt, for me the right way to find the roots should be use the form $$1+0.6x-0.8x^2=0$$ but in some notes I found $$x^2 +0.6x-0.8=0$$ It's not the first case the right way?
