Mutual information measures the independence between two random variables and is maximal when these random variables covary [T. M. Mitchell, Machine Learning. McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math](Available: http://www.worldcat.org/isbn/0070428077 ). I am however not sure whether I understand your question correctly. Is n the total number of clusters? (You used the term number of documents). If there are many clusters and items that you are comparing do not covary in many/most of them, then mutual information will be low in most of them and by using the mean (average) you might consequently get small values as results. Possibly changing the way that this problem is represented or using a different measure might allow you to analyse your data phenomenon better.
