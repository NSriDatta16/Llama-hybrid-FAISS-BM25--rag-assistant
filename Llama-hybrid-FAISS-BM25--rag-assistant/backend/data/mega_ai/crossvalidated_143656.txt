I recommend the following resources (for some of those, you would need to do some detective work, obviously). I agree with @Innuo that PLS regression and pls R package are worth the look. For Python: This part of the curated list ; also this part of the same list ; this page from the documentation . For R: This part of the same list ; CRAN Task View: Machine Learning & Statistical Learning . I think that the following resources might also be quite helpful: this relevant discussion on CV, this technical report on multi-output learning via spectral filtering, this page on Output Kernel Learning, and this excellent tutorial on multi-target prediction.
