vector support machine - margin?

I'm trying to understand SVM (Support Vector Machines) and there is a single technicality I don't understand. In Wikipedia (and several other literature), the margins are described by the equations $$\vec { w } \cdot \vec { x } - b = 1$$ and $$\vec { w } \cdot \vec { x } - b = -1$$ Wikipedia states these equations holds with a normalized or standardized dataset. What does it mean to be normalized and why must the equations be equal to $-1$ and $1$ ? I also don't understand what $\vec { x }$ is in that case? Is $\vec { x }$ the nearest point to the separating hyperplane? Any help is appreciated.
