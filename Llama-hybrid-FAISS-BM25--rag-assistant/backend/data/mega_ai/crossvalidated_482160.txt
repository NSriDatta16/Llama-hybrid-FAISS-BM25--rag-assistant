Characteristically, seasonality can be addressed as a simple dummy variable or variables. Assume, for example, we are living in a factory town which pays every two weeks on Friday. As a result one would expect to see significantly more spending occurring on Pay Days and following days thereafter (likely an exponential decay pattern, as an example of a distributed lag model). A more sophisticated look at seasonality is under the guise of a noise model, that can be addressed in the error-in-variables frame (see for, example discussion here, https://www.jstor.org/stable/2285991?seq=1 ). The cited reference includes a time series analysis perspective.
