This information is stored in the registry in the key "HKEY_USERS\S-1-5-21-616815238-485949776-2992451252-3228\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer\User Shell Folders". The "S-1-5-21-616815238-485949776-2992451252-3218" is the GUID of the user. You need to get this GUID to find the corresponding key and read it. In this example they use SHGetFolderPath function you mention and there is a list with all special folders which might be helpful. NOTE: Microsoft discourages to use the registry key, since it is still there just for backward compatibility
