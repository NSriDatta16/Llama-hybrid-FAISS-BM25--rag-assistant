Ruby only supports case conversions on the letters A – Z and a – z . The reason for this is simply that case conversions for other letters aren't well defined. For example, in Turkish 'I'.downcase # => 'ı' and 'i'.upcase # => 'İ' , but in French 'I'.downcase # => 'i' and 'i'.upcase # => 'I' . Ruby would have to know not only the character encoding, but also the language to do that correctly. Even worse, in German 'MASSE'.downcase is either 'maße' # "measurements" 'masse' # "mass" In other words: you need to actually understand the text, i.e. you need a full-blown AI, to do case conversions correctly. And I myself have actually accidentally constructed a sentence once, which was undecidable even for a human . In short: it's simply impossible to do correctly, which is why Ruby doesn't do it at all . There are third-party libraries, however, like the Unicode library and ActiveSupport, which do support a somewhat larger subset of characters.
