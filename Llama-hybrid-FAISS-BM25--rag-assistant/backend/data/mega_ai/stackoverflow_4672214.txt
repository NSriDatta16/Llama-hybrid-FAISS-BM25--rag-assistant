Someone on the NH Users list gave me the answer: public class FeaturedCarFinder : QueryOver { public FeaturedCarFinder(int maxResults) { Where(c => c.IsFeatured); Take(maxResults); BuildProjections(); TransformUsing(Transformers.AliasToBean(typeof(CarViewModelMessage))); } private void BuildProjections() { SelectList(l => l.Select(c => c.IsFeatured) //... ); } } Very similar to using DetachedCriteria as a base class, but note the use of QueryOver (i.e. the two type-argument version) rather than just QueryOver as the base class.
