Query for lucene search result

I have a storage of news with the following fields (Title, Body, NewsDate) I need a best query with the following criteria 1) title is more important but less than date 2) date should be compare to the current date if the date of a document is near the current date it is more valuable (NOTE: It doesn't mean that sorting descending on news date cause there maybe results that their title and its body is more relevant but its older) this is just another factor for searching and i think it needs custom sorting 3) body has is in the third place Any solution ?
