Yes I know that an FPGA is not a processor. An FPGA is is a type of processor, but it is not a type of CPU. Most FPGAs only have volatile storage so you have to update them whilst they're on. This doesn't mean that you can change their operation any time you want. That's dynamic reconfiguration and only supported by a subset of FPGAs.
