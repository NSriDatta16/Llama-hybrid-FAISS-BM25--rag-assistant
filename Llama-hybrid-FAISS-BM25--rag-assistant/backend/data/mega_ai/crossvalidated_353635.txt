Comparing population averages while accounting for changes in composition

I have two populations (i.e., men / women) with different average measurements (let's say height). I observe the combined average of their height decreases. I also observe the proportion of women increasing. I want to account for the how much of the decreased average height is due to the increased proportion of women, and how much of it is due to other factors. How best do I do this?
