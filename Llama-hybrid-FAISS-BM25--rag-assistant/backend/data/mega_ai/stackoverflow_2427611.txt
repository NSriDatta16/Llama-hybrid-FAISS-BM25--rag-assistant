No, not without requiring your users to be sufficiently technically-savvy to give a script or component embedded on the page advanced permissions. (Granted this mostly means saying "Yes," but to a scary-looking prompt. If they've received any advice on the subject, they're going to say "no.") You can do this with signed Java applets and the like ( this question relates to this discussion; basically you want to create a file on their system), but the odds of your users allowing them to run with high privilege are lower (I'd've said) than their being able to handle drag and drop. I don't think I've ever thought of drag and drop as being a technically-savvy operation. :-)
