I guess you are getting the generic List type instead of the element value. This is because Eval returns the ToString() result and ToString() on a List returns the type. There are several things you can do. One is nest another repeater and bind it to the events property. This is the most clean solution in theory although in this case I doubt it is worth it. Another thing you can do is accumulate the events property as a string. it can be done like this: var qListCurrentMonth = (from feed in doc.Descendants("item") select new { title = feed.Element("title").Value, description = feed.Element("description").Value, events = (from ev in feed.Element("events").Elements("location") select ev.Attribute("city").Value).Aggregate((x,y) => x+ " " + y) }); The Aggregate method will accumulate the collection in a single instance. If you have more than 5 events per line average you'd better use StringBuilder as an accumulator (there is overload of Aggregate) for performance reasons (I am sure you know about string vs StringBuilder and performance). Since you are using .NET 3.5 I would advise using ListView instead of Repeater... like always. Also in this case a GridView may be better since you are representing a table. Finally - please follow the .NET convention and use PascalCase for property names (i.e. Events instead of events)
