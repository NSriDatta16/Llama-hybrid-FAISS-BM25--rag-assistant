I understand your point, and the closest thing I can think of is the SLIDINGSPANS spec. It provides a model stability analysis over the data set. With SLIDINGSPANS, you specify the length and the number of sub-spans, start, etc., and the X-13ARIMA-SEATS program compares the different features of seasonal adjustment from overlapping sub-spans of the time series data. To learn more, see the reference manual of the X-13ARIMA-SEATS: https://www2.census.gov/software/x-13arima-seats/x-13-data/documentation/docx13as.pdf
