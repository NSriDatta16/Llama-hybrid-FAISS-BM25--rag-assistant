The big difference between the two approaches is that your t-test only looks at the bivariate relation between $drug_a$ and $hormone_b$, while your linear regression includes control variables ($hormone_a$ and $age$): your t-test says: on average, people using $drug_a$ have less $hormone_b$. But, as you correctly point out, this doesn't mean that there is necessarily a causal relationship from $drug_a$ to $hormone_b$, there could be other factors in play (for instance if older people on average have less $hormone_b$). effects in a linear regression are partial effects, keeping all other variables equal . The positive value of the $hormone_a$ coefficient means that people of the same age and same $drug_a$ status that have higher $hormone_a$ levels will (on average) have higher $hormone_b$ levels. However, if only people who take drug_a have positive hormone_a values, a better estimate of the relationship between hormone_a and hormone_b could be obtained by taking this fact into account, eg. by fitting the following model, in which $homone_a$ only has an effect when $drug_a$ is 1: $hormone_b = \beta_0 + \beta_1 drug_a + \beta_2 (drug_a \times hormone_a) + \beta_3 age$ And this brings us to the problem of correct model specification, which is always a problem in linear regression. For instance, how do you know the "correct" model is $hormone_b = \beta_0 + \beta_1 drug_a + \beta_2 hormone_a + \beta_3 age$, and not eg. $hormone_b = \beta_0 + \beta_1 drug_a + \beta_2 \exp(hormone_a) + \beta_3 age + \beta_4 age^2$... If you do not know the "true" correct specification, the results of linear regression are unlikely to give you the true effect of treatment. If what you want to estimate is the average treatment effect , there is a whole bunch of other methods you can use.
