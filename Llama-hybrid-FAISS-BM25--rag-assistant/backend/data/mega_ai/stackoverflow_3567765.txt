Can you develop a new CMS as good as some other ones that have been around for years and hundreds of people have worked on it's development? That's a question I always ask myself at the start of every website buliding project. There is surely a good open source platform that meets your requierments and that you can improve. I suggest these: Liferay : for large organisations and advanced projects it's written in java. I personally love this CMS. Big places like NASA use it and my company used it for a project, it was great. Plone : Same as above - language = Python EZPublish for large organisations but not as advanced as Liferay - language = PHP Joomla and drupal for normal websites.
