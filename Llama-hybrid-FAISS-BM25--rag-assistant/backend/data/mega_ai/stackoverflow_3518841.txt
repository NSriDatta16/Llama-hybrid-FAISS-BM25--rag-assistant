Checking in an Eclipse project into SVN

I want to checkin a Dynamic Web Project I created in eclipse into svn. Can someone tell me which files I have to check in and which one I should not? The idea is to be able to check out the project using the New Project Wizard so that I can create the Dynamic Web Project again. More specifically here are the files/directories I have in the project -- src WebContent build dist build.xml .project .classpath .settings/ The build directory is not supposed to checked in obviously. What about the other ones? I am guessing all the . files should not be checked in either. Can some one verify this? What is this dist directory and the .settings directory? Also where does eclipse store the Server information (tomcat)? I don't want to check it in either. EDIT: I initially checked in all of the above except the build directory of course. When I checked out the project from inside Eclipse it did not prompt me to create a new project since the .project is there but Eclipse was creating a JavaEE project or something instead of the Dynamic Web Project. Did anyone else run into this behavior? ** EDIT 2 ** Found it! Turns out I should not check in the following -- .project .settings/ .classpath Once these 3 are removed the New project Wizard works as expected and everything is fine.
