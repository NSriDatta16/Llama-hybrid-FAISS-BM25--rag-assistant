relationships between 3 variables

I have 3 data sets. one is the water level of a lake at 15min intervals, one is the water level of a pond next to the lake (also at 15min intervals) and one is the wind speed over both the lake and the pond. I want to try and determine if there is a relationship between 1) the changing lake level and the level of the pond. 2) if there is a relationship between the wind speed and the lake height 3) if the wind is effecting the lake weather this is translating to a delayed influence on the pond level. is there anything (like time series analysis) or something beyond plotting a basic r curve that i can do to determine the strength of any relationship present? Any advice would be greatly appreciated Thankyou!
