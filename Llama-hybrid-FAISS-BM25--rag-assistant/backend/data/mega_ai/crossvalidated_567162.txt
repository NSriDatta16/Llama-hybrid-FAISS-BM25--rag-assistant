Closed form for a markov chain, where transition probabilities depend on $n$?

Let $A_n$ be an event whose success probability $P(A_n)$ depends on the size, $n\in \mathbb{N}$ , of a given sample. Let $d$ be a fixed positive integer. For the problem I am working on I can assume a sequential sample and derive - via a geometric argument - the following recurrence relation: $$ P(A_{n+1}) = P(A_{n+1}|A_n)P(A_{n}) + P(A_{n+1}|A_{n}^c)P(A_{n}^c)\\ = P(A_{n}) + 2^{-n}(1 - P(A_{n}))$$ with the initial conditions $P(A_d) =0$ , $P(A_{d+1}) = 2^{-d}$ . I am interested in whether it is possible to obtain a simple closed form expression for $P(A_n) = P(A_{d+k})$ ?
