My Idea is that those option in neural network toolbox is for avoiding overfitting. In this situation the weights are specified for the training data only and don't show the global trend. By having a validation set, the iterations are adaptable to where decreases in the training data error cause decreases in validation data and increases in validation data error; along with decreases in training data error, this demonstrates the overfitting phenomenon.
