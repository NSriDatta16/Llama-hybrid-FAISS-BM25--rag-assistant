Point estimation is the application of an estimator (a statistic) to the data in order to learn about a certain population parameter. This parameter may be a fixed number as seen by classical or frequentist statistics or it may be a random variable itself as in Bayesian statistics. Common methods of point estimation are ordinary least squares, maximum likelihood, the method of moments or Bayes' estimators. For further information see: Lehman, E.L. and Casella, G.
