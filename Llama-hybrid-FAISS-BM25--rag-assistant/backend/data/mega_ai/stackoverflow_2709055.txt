There are dozens of different ways to store data. It completely depends on what data. Is it: Just a couple of configuration values? Use the built-in Settings library. Machine-wide configuration? Use the registry. Transactional? Use a relational database. Related but not transactional? Use a lightweight database like SQLite or SQLCE. Structured but not related? Use XML or JSON files. Somewhat structured and high in volume? Use a NoSQL solution like MongoDB. And so on... there are different solutions for every storage requirement and many projects make use of more than one at a time.
