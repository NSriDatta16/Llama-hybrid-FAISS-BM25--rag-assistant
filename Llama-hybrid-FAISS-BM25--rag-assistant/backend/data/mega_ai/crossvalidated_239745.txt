Can we average the data first before updating its gradient while doing mini-batch gradient descent?

Say we are doing mini-batch gradient descent, the common way of doing so is by calculating the overall gradient of several samples and then update the parameter. Can we average the samples passed in first and then conducting the gradient update on this "averaged data"?
