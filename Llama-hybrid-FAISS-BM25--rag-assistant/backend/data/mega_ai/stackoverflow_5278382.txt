HTML text field over canvas element

I have been playing around with text in the canvas, and although it is easy to draw, it is not easy to interact with. I began implementing keyboard press functionality to update text on the canvas, but then gave up when I realized I would have to incorporate cut,copy,past and undo functionality. Is there anyway to "float" html elements on top of eachother? For example can I float a text field ontop of certain parts of my canvas, disable the border and set the color to the canvas color? Thank You
