Speech recognition (SVM) different signal lengths

I am developing a small project on speech recognition, the idea is to classify sound sources by Support Vector Machines. My dataset consists on 45 signals, however, they all have different lengths, therefore, the features that I want to use, spectrograms and cepstrogram (I want to perform image recognition with them), have different lengths. My questions are: How should I use my features? Is it possible to use different length vectors? (considering each spectrogram as a vector). Should I sum horizontally the spectrogram in order to have the same length for all the vectors (Which would be the vertical dimension). Should I take some statistics as features such as variance, mean, etc.. I am beginner in machine learning, I apologise if the question is very basic. Thank you. This project is inspired by: https://ai.googleblog.com/2018/10/acoustic-detection-of-humpback-whales.html?utm_campaign=The+Batch&utm_medium=email&_hsmi=87523675&_hsenc=p2ANqtz-_RDZ6yQxRIXaYszorX89TPZBykHQl5bIny7AOpg1BvpGReVZ6qBobeFFjWZ0u1GmCE5GkY&utm_content=87523675&utm_source=hs_email&m=1
