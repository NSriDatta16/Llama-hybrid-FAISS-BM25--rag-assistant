This is a "find the mistakes" question. When you see "accident", think Poisson, not Bernoulli, process. The process average "p" needs a rate of occurrence: .05/workday. It is not a "Probability". The H0 and H1 as stated, call for a Type1 Risk. Let's make it 5%. And the question becomes: What is the largest number of accidents in the past workyear that would have you reject H0? Using the Normal Approximation, the answer: 10 There follows â€¢If less than 20 accidents are observed in 365 work days, then reject the null hypothesis. "20" is a mistake; it should be "11"; but, in any case, less than "18". The test question is then modified.
