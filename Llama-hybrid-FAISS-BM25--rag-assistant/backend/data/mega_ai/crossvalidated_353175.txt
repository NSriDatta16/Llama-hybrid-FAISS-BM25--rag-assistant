Yes, the implication works in one direction: $ Y(t) = Y(0)\ \rm{[Relative\ Change]} = Y(0) [X(t) / X(0)] = [Y(0) / X(0)] X(t) = Const\ X(t) $ $ \Rightarrow $ time series $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ are perfectly correlated... This does not work in the opposite direction though. If $ X(t) = 0 $ and $ Y(t) = X(t) + 1 $ then $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ are perfectly correlated but any percentage change in $X$ is infinite.
