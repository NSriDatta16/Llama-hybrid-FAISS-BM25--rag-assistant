The differences between the Stata PCA methods and the conventional methods used in R or SPSS are: 1. Scaling eigenvectors/components Stata rotates eigenvectors. Whereas, R or SPSS PCA-rotation methods normally rotates after scaling eigenvectors by the sqrt of the eigenvalues to produce the component loadings more typical in factor analysis. 2. Convergence stopping criteria (tolerance) The other difference is that Stata, rotations convergence stopping criteria (tolerance) is 1e-6 for varimax rotation (according to Stat's rotatemat function manual), while in R the default is 1e-5 , and in SPSS the default is 1e-14 , if I am not mistaken. After addressing these differences, I was able to get identical loadings and an identical rotation matrix in R. R and SPSS varimax rotation function by default perform Kaiser normalization. However, varimax rotations on eigenvectors directly seem to be unconventional. See the discussion titled Is PCA followed by a rotation (such as varimax) still PCA? . Addendum Each PC is orthogonal (uncorrelated). However, rotating PCs has neither orthogonal loadings nor uncorrelated components once the rotation is done. This is what has happened in the Stata codes. To obtain uncorrelated components a special scaling is needed, such as dividing the components by the square root of the corresponding eigenvalue (eigenvalues are the variances of the corresponding PCs), which is the default scaling method in R and SPSS.
