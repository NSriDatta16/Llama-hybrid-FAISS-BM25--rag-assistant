Following from your comment... Why would I want to create multiple trees per iteration? Multiple trees per iteration may mean that the model's prediction power improves much faster than using a single tree - as an example, think of prediction power of an individual tree of depth 10 vs the prediction power of a random forest consisting of 5 trees of depth 10 (obviously in general, and not in edge cases where overfitting is present). This could mean that fewer boosting rounds are needed before the model becomes "optimal", although time/resources savings made by using fewer boosting rounds may be consumed by the time/resource needed to construct many random forests. Isn't the point to make tree, correct for errors and repeat? No. The point is to make an estimator , correct for error and repeat. The estimator used in each round is not necessarily a tree; xgboost allows the user to create a linear model, a decision tree, or a random forest. And for each iteration, I am making 3 trees? Yes. Each iteration will produce a random forest with num_parallel_tree of trees.
