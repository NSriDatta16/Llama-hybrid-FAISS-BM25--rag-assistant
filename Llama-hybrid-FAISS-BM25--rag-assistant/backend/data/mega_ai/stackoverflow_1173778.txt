Have you considered using something like Lucene.NET for your indexing? Lucene.NET does a very good job in dealing with offsets for paging. The Document instances that you return from your search could contain the key values for the individual records or you could store enough information to represent the visual aspects for each search result for each item, as well. When the user pages, you just adjust your offset. Things like query caching and optimization are built-in. I pulled down and compiled a few weeks ago and had a POC to build the index, add and remove items from the index, and return results in just a few minutes by cobbling the samples together. I much prefer using a dedicate index for indexing, leaving the database to work more as a dedicated storage medium - but that is my personal preference. If you decide to check it out, pull and compile the source from their SVN. The "stable" version is a bit outdated. Edit: Here is a brief example on paging with Lucene.NET: Paging using Lucene.net
