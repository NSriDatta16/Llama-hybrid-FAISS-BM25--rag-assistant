Stop CNN model at high accuracy and low loss rate?

I train my CNN model with a large number of epochs, with each epoch I print the training loss and accuracy, but there is a lot of high and low in these two metrics, I want to do early stopping with for example loss at 0.2 and accuracy at %95 or more because I get this at more than one epoch, my question is: 1- is early stopping done on train set or validation set? 2- if on validation set, should I print validation loss and accuracy for each epoch with with a train set loss and accuracy? 3- can you give an idea to do early stopping with a piece of code but not in keras, because I use tensorflow not keras?
