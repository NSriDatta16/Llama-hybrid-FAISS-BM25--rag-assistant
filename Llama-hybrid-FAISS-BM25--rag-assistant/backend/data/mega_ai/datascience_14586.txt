Future of deep learning (compared to traditional machine learning)

What do you think will be the future of deep learning? A lot of people talk about deep learning and I can see that it provides various possibilities. For instance, this question gives a nice explanation. What's the future of deep learning? Will it become the main branch of machine learning or will the other branches of machine learning remain relevant as well? And what about different fields of research? Will it be more suitable for certain applications (like natural language processing) and less suitable for some other types of applications? I'd love to hear your views on this, both from a practical as from a scientific point of view. Any practical experience or research that can help to resolve this question? More specifically: should we introduce deep learning in our company?
