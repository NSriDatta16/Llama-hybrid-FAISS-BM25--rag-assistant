How to plot a set of densities in 3D using R?

I need to plot, in 3D, a set of densities associated to a time series. More precisely, I would like to be able in R to build an image close to this example: This image is taken from 1 . The transparency plays an important role as let us see the trajectory of the "measures" in the x-y plane. Any help will be greatly appreciated. 1 : Juban and Kariniotakis, "Uncertainty Estimation of Wind Power Forecasts", presentation at EWEC 2008 - 01 April - Brussels, Belgium.
