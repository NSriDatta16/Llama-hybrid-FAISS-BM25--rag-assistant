There isn't many books dedicated specifically to MANOVA, one which gets good reviews on amazon is [Applied MANOVA and Discriminant Analysis] by Huberty & Olejnik. If you want a book with the mathematical details, you would need a book on theoretical multivariate analysis like Rencher (one chapter) or T W Anderson .
