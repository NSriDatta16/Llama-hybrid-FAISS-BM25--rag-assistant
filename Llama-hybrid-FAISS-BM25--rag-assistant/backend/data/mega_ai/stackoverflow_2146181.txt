Bit of a mine-field as MS word counts are considered wrong and unreliable by profesionals who depend on word counts -- journalists, translators, and, lawers who are often involved in legal procedures where motions and submisions must be less than a specific number fo words. Having said that this article- http://dotnetperls.com/word-count describes a pretty good regex algorithm implemented in C# -- but should be faily easy to transalate into php. I think his small inaccuracies are based on two factors -- MS Word misses out words not conatined in "regular paragraphs" so footnotes, text box and table wrapped words may or may not be counted. Also I think the EVIL smart quotes feature messing with hypens may affect the results. So it may be worth changing all the 'el-dash' and 'em-dash' characters back to the normal minus sign.
