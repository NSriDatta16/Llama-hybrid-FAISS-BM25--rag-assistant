You could write a little Open Data Table to send out a normal YQL html table query and stringify the result. Something like the following: select * from {table} where url="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=yhoo" and xpath='//div[@id="yfi_headlines"]/div[2]/ul/li/a' Retrieve HTML document fragments Peter Cowburn You could then query against that custom table with a YQL query like: use "http://url.to/your/datatable.xml" as html.tostring; select * from html.tostring where url="http://finance.yahoo.com/q?s=yhoo" and xpath='//div[@id="yfi_headlines"]/div[2]/ul/li' Edit: Just realised this is a pretty old question that was bumped; at least an answer is here, eventually, for anyone stumbling on the question. :)
