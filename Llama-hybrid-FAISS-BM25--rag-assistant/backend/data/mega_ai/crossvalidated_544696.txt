Here's what I understand of your situation: You have a forecast, a regression model that you evaluate monthly, of your storage needs for "y" months, that uses the data over the previous year from the current month. Once and awhile, someone deletes a chunk of data and suddenly the slope of the line changes dramatically from the usual forecast. This change in the slope effects capital expense planning for however long it takes for the point to run its course through the model. Your resistance to throwing out the data is appropriate. You have decisions to make a-priori. How to define and handle outliers. Outliers can be defined based on business and/or statistical definitions. I am going to make the assumption that the outliers you are concerned about are simply "obvious". Once found, we investigate outliers to see if they are generated from a real data generating process, then we handle them according to our a-priori decided upon procedures. These procedures can be anything from 'trimming' a certain percentage of data points from one or both edges of data, to replacing the value, to controlling for the specific outliers, changing the model so it uses a different underlying distribution, or changing the model so it uses a different central tendency. One way to handle the outliers after they are investigated, assuming the outliers are relatively infrequent, is to add them as a predictor in the model. Each outlier gets an entire predictor. The predictor would be a seperate column that would predict one for the data point that is the outlier and zero otherwise. Once controlled for, they will not pull the slope of the model anymore. This procedure has several advantages, one being that no data are thrown out or changed to some other value. Some disadvantage include taking extra time to model the outlier and having to re-specify the model each month as the column of the outlier moves through the modeling year window. However, any action with outliers will require extra time in modeling, which is a necessary step in cleaning the data. Also, if I understand correctly, you're respecifying the forecast each month anyway. Example Regression formula: memory_capital = ... + mem_usage_nov + mem_usage_dec + outlier_column1_dec + ...
