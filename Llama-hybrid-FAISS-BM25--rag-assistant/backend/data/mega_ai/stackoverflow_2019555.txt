I have done 5 dojo migrations now (from 0.2 -> 1.4) over the last few years. Although the API does not change, you will often have coded in workarounds that no longer work after upgrading. Things I have noticed: quality in 1.4 is VERY good and worth upgrading to (even from 1.3) although the API does not change, little things that are not public often change slightly (diji.Tree itemNodeMap -> itemNodesMap in 1.4) build options are usually added each release but not always publicised - strage really as they are always useful improvement since you are 1.1.1, you should change all your set attribute calls to 'attr' - this could take a while to do. As for commercial support, you could try Sitepen
