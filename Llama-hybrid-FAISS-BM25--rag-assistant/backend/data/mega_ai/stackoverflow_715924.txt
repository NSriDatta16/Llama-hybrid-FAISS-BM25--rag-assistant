In php you can access all parts of the URL using the parse_url() function http://php.net/parse-url Edit: My apologies guys, although my example works and is fine for server-side generated urls, you are correct in the context of this question. Fragments are not a method I use extensively, although I do use parse_url quite often so it popped to mind immediately. To give some value added content to this particular question, I would use jQuery for the task of revealing the comments that were hidden originally. It's easy to use and has some slick animations if you're looking for that sort of thing. e.g. $(document).ready( function() { $("a.toggleComments").click( function() { $(".comment").toggle(); return false; }); }); .comment { display: none; } Some text that is shown by default. Toggle Comments A comment paragraph, originally hidden
