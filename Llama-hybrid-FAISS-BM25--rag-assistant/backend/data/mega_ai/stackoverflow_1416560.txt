HSL Interpolation

If the hue component of my HSL color is in degrees, how can I correctly interpolate between two hues? Using (h1 + h2) / 2 does not seem to produce desirable results in all cases. Here are two examples that illustrate why: Let: red = 0° yellow = 60° blue = 240° (red + yellow) / 2 = 30° (orange) (yellow + blue) / 2 = 150° (blue green) (red + blue) / 2 = 120° (green) As you can see, averaging red and blue produces green instead purple/magenta! However, if we let: red = 360° yellow = 60° blue = 240° (red + yellow) / 2 = 210° (blue green) (yellow + blue) / 2 = 150° (blue green) (red + blue) / 2 = 300° (magenta) Now, red and blue produce the expected color, but red and yellow produce a blue green color! In what way can I interpolate the hue component of the color so that the result matches what would be expected of mixing actual paint? Thanks!
