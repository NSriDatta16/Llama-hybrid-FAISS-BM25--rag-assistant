I can see three problems with code you posted: 1) You aren't escaping your path string correctly 2) You need to pass the /c argument seperately to the path you want to execute 3) You are assuming every machine this code runs on has a c:\windows installation I'd propose writing it as follows: string cmdPath = System.IO.Path.Combine(Environment.SystemDirectory,"cmd.exe"); System.Diagnostics.Process.Start(cmdPath, "/c");
