Longitudinal data on a prognostic model

I am struggling to analyze longitudinal data on a prognostic model. I used a multivariate Cox model to select predictors at time1. I also have measures of these predictors at time2 (the event of interest), but only in those observations that had the event (I don't have data at time2 of those observations without the event). So, I was wondering if I could add more power to my prognostic model but leveraging data of those predictors at time2. However, I am afraid that I cannot as I don't have data on those observations without the event of interest. Many thanks!
