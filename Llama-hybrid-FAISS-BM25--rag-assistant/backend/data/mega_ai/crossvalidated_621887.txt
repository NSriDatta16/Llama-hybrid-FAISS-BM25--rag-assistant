Conditional likelihood with missing values

I want to estimate a logistic regression model on a panel data (subject-time) with subject-fixed effects. $$\log(p_{it}/(1-p_{it})) = \alpha_{i} + \beta x_{it} + \epsilon_{it}.$$ To do so, I want to maximize the conditional likelihood function to overcome the incidental parameters problem. The specific issue that I face is that within each subject there are some observations that are not collected. I do not know how many are not collected, but I do know that all the observations that are not collected have the outcome variable as 0. Below is a pictorial representation of the context - The question I have is, what will be the direction of bias in the coefficient estimated from the collected data, why and, are there any approaches to correct the bias?
