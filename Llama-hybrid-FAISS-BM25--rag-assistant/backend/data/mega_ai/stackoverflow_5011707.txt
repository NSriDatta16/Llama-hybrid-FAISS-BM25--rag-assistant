Selecting the last child elements of a div without looping

Here's a quick one. I'm trying to get better at writing selectors for jquery because I seem to be relying on loops far too much in order to get things done. In this particular example, I want to add the "Absolute" class too all of the divs that have the ganttview-block-container class except the last one in the parent ganntview-blocks div. HTML: Javascript: $("div.ganttview-block-container").addClass("Absolute").addClass("Opacity"); $($("div.ganttview-blocks")).each(function () { var thisDiv = $(this); thisDiv.children("div.ganttview-block-container:last").removeClass("Absolute"); }); My javascript/jquery accomplishes this goal correctly but it seems so inefficient. I'm confident there's a more elegant way of getting this done... perhaps even in 1 line. Can anyone help? Thanks!
