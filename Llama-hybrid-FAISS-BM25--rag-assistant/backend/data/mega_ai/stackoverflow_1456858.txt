Instead of making the divs with class "blue" higher - and thus revealing the drop down - why don't you show() the paragraphs with class "subtext" themselves instead? Have them set to display: none by default, and use JavaScript to reveal them. You'll need to set them to position: absolute also, so they don't push any content down.
