Feature selection before neural network classification

I have a training set of 87 samples and 9480 variables. My predictors are continuous and my response variable is binary. I'd like to use the caret package in R to tune a neural network classification model on my data. In order to do this, I first have to reduce the size of the predictor-set with feature selection to make it computationally feasible, correct? Lets assume that is correct. Then the question becomes "which feature selection method?". If I were to do RF-RFE using the rfe function in caret, for example, I would get an optimal feature set specific to random forests and not necessarily optimal for neural networks. Any advice?
