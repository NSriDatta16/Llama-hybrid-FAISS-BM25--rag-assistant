From the documentation of np.convolve : "mode{‘full’, ‘valid’, ‘same’}, optional By default, mode is ‘full’. This returns the convolution at each point of overlap, with an output shape of (N+M-1,). At the end-points of the convolution, the signals do not overlap completely, and boundary effects may be seen." By contrast, whatever neural network library you're using does not have this behavior as the default.
