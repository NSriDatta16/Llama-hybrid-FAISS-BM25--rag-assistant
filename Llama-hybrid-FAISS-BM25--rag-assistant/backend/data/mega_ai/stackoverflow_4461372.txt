As per the Javadoc of the getClass method : The actual result type is Class where |X| is the erasure of the static type of the expression on which getClass is called. For example, no cast is required in this code fragment Here, the value for |X| in your code snippet is MyClass , hence instance.getClass() is assignable to only Class or Class . The reason for this specific wording is because when you say that for this variable having type T where , there can be multiple classes which extend MyClass and hence capable of satisfying the T extends MyClass criteria. Without runtime information there is no way of knowing which concrete implementation subclass of MyClass was passed in the method. Hence to provide a generic solution, it returns since that would hold true for any subclass of MyClass irrespective of what class instance is passed in.
