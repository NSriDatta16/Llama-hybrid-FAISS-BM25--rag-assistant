Can you do Logic Programming in Scala?

I read somewhere that Pattern Matching like that supported by the match/case feature in Scala was actually borrowed from Logic languages like Prolog. Can you use Scala to elegantly solve problems like the Connected Graph problem? e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/20100214144956/https://www.csupomona.edu/~jrfisher/www/prolog_tutorial/2_15.html
