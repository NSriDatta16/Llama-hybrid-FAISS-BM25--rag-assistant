I give you a personal opinion, not supported by any other fact that my personal taste. Writing help files was useful in the past, where everything was new and online resources were scarce. Today, most computer users learn by direct exploration. Contextual help in the form of Tooltips is great and strongly encouraged: it gives hints for this explorative learning. What about help documentation with a lot of links to click around ? well it's apparently great, but used very seldom I guess. In most cases the user can obtain answers with a proper google search. Moreover, this kind of documentation is expensive . It cannot be written by a developer. You have to hire or allocate specific people for this, with technical writing and clarity as relevant skills. If I had to manage this decision, I would provide full docs only for those features that are very esoteric and special (I would say unique) for your application. I would in any case tend towards an online tutorial, instead of contextual help files. This has the additional advantage to provide information about how difficult is to use your application, and what are the most requested hotspots (by evaluating the hits and referrer search queries to your online docs).
