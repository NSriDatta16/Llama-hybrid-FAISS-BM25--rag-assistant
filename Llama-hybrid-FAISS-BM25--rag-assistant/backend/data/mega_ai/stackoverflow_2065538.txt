Pure .NET application are able to link even Silverlight 3.0 assemblies, just try it out. It's only that they do the marketing for that feature now for 4.0. ;-) However I experienced some minor issues with that (seems some Func<> / Action<> delegates were not compatible). Also Silverlight 3.0 assemblies are not optimized when you choose that compiler option. What you can do is to add existing source code files in your project as links . But it's surely a pain to maintain when you have a lot and often create new or remove source code files. You can't link complete folders yet. :-/ The Visual Studio tools for the RIA services (the current Microsoft RAD approach for Silverlight LOB apps) use T4 to copy entity class code from the .NET project that runs on the web server which hosts the web service over to the Silverlight project. For me that doesn't feel like a clean approach. But maybe you're not as boneheaded as me and can check to see if you can leverage that functionality for your purpose.
