Go to Definition Fails - Visual Studio 2008

I'm writing a C++ application in Visual Studio 2008. It has a lot of defined structures in several header files, such as: #pragma pack( push , 1 ) // align on a 1-byte boundary typedef struct myStruct_tag { /* ... */ } myStruct_t; #pragma pack( pop ) // end 1-byte boundary alignment In a source file, these defined structures are used as such: void MyFunc( void ) { myStruct_t * myStruct = NULL; myStruct = (myStruct_t *)malloc( sizeof(myStruct_t) ); /* and so forth and so on... */ } Even though it successfully compiles with 0 errors and 0 warnings, sometimes when I right-click a custom data type (such as in MyFunc ) it gives me an error: The symbol 'myStruct_t' is not defined. Then I click OK to close the dialog box and press Ctrl + Alt + F7 to rebuild the solution. It builds without any errors or warnings, so I know that it is finding the definition of myStruct_t when it compiles, but it cannot find it when I try to use the Go to Definition feature. The only thing that occurs to me is that this application has a lot of defined structures, single-byte aligned, but that shouldn't make a difference. Does anybody know how to fix this?
