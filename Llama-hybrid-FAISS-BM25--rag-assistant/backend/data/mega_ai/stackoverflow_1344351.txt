I studied Java at university, and did c# at work. You will find the Sun Java API (Javadocs) to be very informative and will help you dearly. You can find it here . This website should be the first to consult if you need a query, as it is brief, and up-to-date - similar to the MSDN Library for c#. Also, Java has a strong community who will be willing to help @ the forums . Finally, I think its best to learn Java through practice and experimentation over theory. You will need a good IDE to start you off and there are plenty to choose from. Eclipse and Netbeans are notable Visual Studio contenders, but personally I prefer JCreator (albeit the version with intellisense is not free). It maybe text based, but you have greater control IMO. If you are going to create GUI applications, then you should learn about swing. Again, the guys at sun provide excellent tutorials on the matter. There are also books: Java in a nutshell is a nice book. Click for google preview . Java: the complete reference By Herbert Schildt is one I would highly recommend. Google Preview .
