Anyone have an idea what i must do? Two usual approaches: Add client-side (JavaScript) form validation so that for the majority of people, an error will pop up before they've submitted the form rather than later, on the server side, by which time the upload will have been lost. Give each form instance a unique ID. When a file is uploaded on a form with an error, store that file on the server and record in the database that the form with that ID has an attached file. On the second-chance form, include the ID as a hidden field, and visually indicate that the uploaded file has been remembered. On submission, drag out the remembered file and attach it with the new submission.
