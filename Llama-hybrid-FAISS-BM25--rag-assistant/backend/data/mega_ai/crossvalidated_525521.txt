How to transfer the residuals to the uniform margin for copula-GARCH model in R?

I am studying the copula model in finance. To the best of my knowledge, I need to fit the GARCH model to my data (to each time series). Then, I need to get the residuals for each. After that, I need to transfer the residuals to uniform margins to fit the copula model. My question is, how to do the latter step using IFM by Joe, in R? I found a code where the author used pobs function to find the pseudo-observation. here . However, in some papers, the authors used IFM of joe. To the best of my knowledge, IFM is different from pobs function. Edit based on the comment of @RichardHardy (thanks a lot) To the best of my understanding, the following code used to estimate the margins distribution (if not should I estimate the margins of residulas?): uspec Then, I can check the standardized of margins and transfer them to copula using the following code: Z. U. . So, to use IFM method of Joe, I can use U. to transfer the standardized residuals to copula data. Is that correct?
