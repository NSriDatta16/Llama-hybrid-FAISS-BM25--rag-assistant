If I understand correctly, it should not be surprising that these numbers are very different. I think you are not comparing what you think you are. From you data I gather you are comparing: The arithmetic mean of the stock price: (sum of prices / n) The arithmetic mean of: (price * the frequency with which that price was observed) Take row 1 for example. The value 3 was observed 4 times out of 16, or 25% of the time. You took 25% * price (3) which = .75 and labeled .75 as the expected value. Why would .75 be the expected value? According to your frequencies, the expected value will be greater than 3 68.75% of the time and a value less than 3 will be observed 6.25% of the time. Therefore, I would say it is highly unlikely to observe a value of .75. The mean (.76) at the bottom is the mean if you repeated the above for each row, summed the values, and divided by n (16). If you want to calculate the average expected value, I recommend you use a simple linear regression with price as your independent variable y and time as your dependent variable x. From there, you can take (sum predicted value y-hat /n) to get the average expected value.
