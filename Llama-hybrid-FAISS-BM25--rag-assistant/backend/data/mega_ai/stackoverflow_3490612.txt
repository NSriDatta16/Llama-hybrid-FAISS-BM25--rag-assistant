Both have their storage requirements in their respective documentation: MySQL: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/storage-requirements.html Postgres: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/interactive/datatype.html A quick comparison of the two don't show any flagrant "zomg PostGres requires 2 megabytes to store a bit field" type differences. I suppose Postgres could have higher metadata overhead than MySQL, or has to extend its data files in larger chunks, but I can't find anything obvious that Postgres "wastes" space for which migrating to MySQL is the cure.
