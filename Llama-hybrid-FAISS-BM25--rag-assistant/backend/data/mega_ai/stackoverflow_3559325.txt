The easiest way is to put the progress indicator above (atop) the search field and leave them as separate views. It used to be that view z-ordering would give unpredictable results and weren't encouraged. That's not been true for several OS X versions, now, so if it looks good and behaves as expected, I say go for it. The harder way would be to subclass NSSearchField and muck around according to the goodies found in the Control and Cell Programming Topics for Cocoa guide.
