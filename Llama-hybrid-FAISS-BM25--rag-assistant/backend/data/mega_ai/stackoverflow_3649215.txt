Perhaps there's a way to create a versioning and partitioning mechanism even in MSSQL: Versioning : If a value is changed, the old value is marked as is_active=False and the new value is inserted. Then, you bulk delete values every week, which will cause less fragmentation overall. You can use a view to filter only the is_actvie=True values. Partitioning : I'm not sure what the best partitioning scheme would be best here. Since some values have a long lifespan, I think partitioning by time will not do the trick. Perhaps partitioning by key is better. This way, at least, you can try to defragment each partition separately, and the degradation is better contained.
