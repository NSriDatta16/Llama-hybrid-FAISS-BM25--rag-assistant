Most anachronistic practices are probably due to the way statistics is taught and the fact that analyses are run by huge numbers of people who have only taken a couple of basic classes. We often teach a set of standard statistical ideas and procedures because they form a logical sequence of increasing conceptual sophistication that makes sense pedagogically (cf., How can we ever know the population variance? ). I'm guilty of this myself: I occasionally teach stats 101 and 102, and I constantly say, 'there's a better way to do this, but it's beyond the scope of this class'. For those students who don't go on beyond the introductory sequence (almost all), they are left with basic, but superseded, strategies. For a stats 101 example, probably the most common anachronistic practice is to test some assumption and then run a traditional statistical analysis because the test was not significant. A more modern / advanced / defensible approach would be to use a method robust to that assumption from the start. Some references for more information: How to choose between t-test or non-parametric test e.g. Wilcoxon in small samples Is normality testing 'essentially useless'? For stats 102 examples, any number of modeling practices have been outmoded: Transforming $Y$ to achieve normality of residuals for getting reliable $p$-values vs. bootstrapping. Transforming $Y$ to achieve homoscedasticity instead of using a sandwich estimator, etc. Using a higher-order polynomial to capture curvature vs. cubic splines. Assessing models intended for prediction using $p$-values and in-sample goodness of fit metrics like $R^2$ instead of cross-validation. With repeated measures data, categorizing a continuous variable so that rmANOVA can be used or averaging multiple measurements vs. using a linear mixed model. Etc. The point in all these cases is that people are doing what was taught first in an introductory class because they simply don't know more advanced and appropriate methods.
