log4J with java applet and java plugin2

I have a java applet application running with java plugin2. The applet configuration is using a JNLP file, as supported by the next-generation java plugin architecture. Sun states that you should not use Class.forName in the context of a java webstart (or java applet) application. But I guess Log4j is doing it to configure the loggers, according to my log4j.properties configuration. So I'm getting a lot of nesty exceptions which I'm almost sure is related to this. Is it possible to change log4j behavior not to use Class.forName? I'm actually using slf4j backed by log4j. If I change to logback will I have the same kind of problems?
