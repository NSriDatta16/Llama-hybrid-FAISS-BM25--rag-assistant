There are multiple options if you want to extract insights from your data, some of which are: Python or R : If you are comfortable in either of the 2 languages, you can easily generate visualizations in them. I cannot speak for R as I don't use it but in python there is a library called Dtale which automates exactly what you want. Just import the data into the function and it will generate multiple stats and visualizations for you. PowerBI or Tableau : No code solution for visualizations. ALthough I don't know how these can magically generate stats or visualizations! But it is extremely easy for you to do so as these tools require a drag and drop functionality. However the problem is not the tool but rather the large dataset size. If you have sufficient memory then there's no issue but if you are limited by your RAM then you would have to use batches to perform your analysis. Also there are some python BigData libraries that can be used. Either way what you want can easily be done. Cheers!
