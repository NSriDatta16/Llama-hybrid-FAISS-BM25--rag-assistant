Is Bayesian structural equation modelling better than maximum likelihood with smaller sample sizes?

Does using the Bayesian estimator to complete SEM in Mplus mitigate some concerns with a limited sample size ( $n=120$ )? I.e. is this approach preferred over using the traditional ML estimator with associated $p$ -values?
