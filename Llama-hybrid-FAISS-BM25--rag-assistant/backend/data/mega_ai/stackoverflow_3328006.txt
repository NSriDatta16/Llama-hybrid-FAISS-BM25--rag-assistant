Without exception, cross platform development tools are always technically inferior to platform specific tools. They simply cannot take advantage of the each platforms strengths. They always lag behind the platform specific tools in the best of circumstance. Choosing to use cross platform tools because of training or supposed flexibility or career planning almost always ends up in inferior products. The tradeoff is seldom worth it. You can't replace organization with constant study with technology. I advise clients to use cross platform tools only when cross platform capability is a core function of the app itself. The DHTML/Javascript tools are not very popular. If you search Stackoverflow itself for them you will see just a few dozen questions for each cross platform tool and half of those will be "is this any good?" type of questions. Apple will never allow development for Apple products on non-Apple platforms. They do not wish to lose control and they don't have the business model to support it. If you want to write for the iPhone and "go deep" then Objective-C and the Apple API are really the only way to go. I would give similar advice for the Droid or any other platform. Learn the tools and the API made for that platform. The time spent learning upfront will pay off quickly in superior products.
