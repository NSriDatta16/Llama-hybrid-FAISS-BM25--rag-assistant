How to Compute Mean Ratios and Their 95% Confidence Intervals in a Bayesian Model

I am working on a Bayesian model using the brm function from the brms package in R, and I am interested in comparing mean responses of different groups. Specifically, I would like to calculate the mean ratios of responses, along with their 95% confidence intervals. I know how to calculate the odds ratios and mean differences, but I'm not sure how to go about calculating the mean ratios. The Model and Data Here's the model I used for demonstration purposes: library(brms) # Create a variable as a proportion of the max Sepal.Length with interval [0, 1[ iris $Sepal.Length.Percent Sepal.Length / max(iris$Sepal.Length + 0.0000001) # Fit a Bayesian model with a Beta distribution mdl What I've Tried I used the emmeans package to get the expected marginal means and odds ratios, as well as 95% confidence intervals for those estimates. library(emmeans) > emmeans(mdl, pairwise ~ Species, type = 'response') $emmeans Species response lower.HPD upper.HPD setosa 0.628 0.598 0.658 versicolor 0.744 0.718 0.773 virginica 0.867 0.848 0.888 $contrasts contrast odds.ratio lower.HPD upper.HPD setosa / versicolor 0.580 0.473 0.697 setosa / virginica 0.257 0.207 0.319 versicolor / virginica 0.444 0.346 0.547 > emmeans(mdl, pairwise ~ Species) $emmeans Species emmean lower.HPD upper.HPD setosa 0.522 0.399 0.655 versicolor 1.066 0.917 1.206 virginica 1.878 1.716 2.066 $contrasts contrast estimate lower.HPD upper.HPD setosa - versicolor -0.545 -0.735 -0.349 setosa - virginica -1.360 -1.573 -1.143 versicolor - virginica -0.813 -1.036 -0.586 What I'm Looking For I want to find a way to calculate (or extract) the mean ratios, not odds ratios or mean differences, along with their 95% confidence intervals. Any guidance on how to achieve this would be much appreciated! Edit: Ideally, I would like to find the least cumbersome solution, for instance with a function from emmeans .
