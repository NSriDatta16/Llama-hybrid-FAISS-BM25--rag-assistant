WHICH weight matrix are shared in RNN and which change upon Time?

In my opinion there are basically 4 weight matrix in the RNN. SO there are different names given in different scenarios but let me point out what I know about RNN in very simple terms. Please correct if wrong. Let us look at this image. H : State matrix. Which is the one responsible for the decision at any point of time. It's the only one that changes and records the Memory in the network. With each input at state time t, it'll change and get passed on to the next cell. In the end, it is basically used for prediction in a classification task. Wx matrix or the Input Weight Matrix which will get multiplied to the Input at each time step. It is common for every time step. Wh or the Hidden State Matrix which get multiplied to the H and changes the state. ( obviously after using the input multiplication and activation function). It is also same for each time step. Wy or the Output Matrix which is responsible to give an output at each time step for Multi-out model like Named Entity Recognition after getting multiplied by the State Matrix: H . It is also shared. I want to know if my understanding of RNN is right or wrong. Also, if I have to explain it to a new person, can I say that these tokens/ Inputs are passed in Sequential manner because the diagram is just an illustration and parallelism is not possible because the results are dependent on the previous step and the State has to change before you pass in a new input?
