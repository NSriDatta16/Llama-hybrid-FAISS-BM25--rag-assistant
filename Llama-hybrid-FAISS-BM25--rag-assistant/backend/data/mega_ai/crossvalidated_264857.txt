Logistic Regression (while containing a misleading name) is usually a classifier. This means that is is trying to use 'predictors', as you called it, or input features to classify an outcome variable- most commonly a binary outcome variable. The way Logistic Regression does this is by creating a linear boundary function which separates the space of inputs into two. Then it classifies everything on one side as class A and everything on the other as class B. To answer your question: Logistic regression does not necessarily find a linear correlation, if that is what you mean, or any linear (or sinusoidal) relationship between the inputs and the output. It simply tries to find the "best" linear boundary function which splits the data into class A and class B. I will try to explain what "best" means. Best is defined as minimizing a cost function which represents the distance between $$1/(1+e^{-w^{T}x})$$, which is a logistic function, and the true value of the corresponding outcome variable of x (Note that w is what logisitc regression is optimizing for and x is the input).
