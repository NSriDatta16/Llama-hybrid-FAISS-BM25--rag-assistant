Magento - possible to have multiple tables for a single model?

trying to set up a config file for a custom module - do I need to have a unique model for each 'resourceModel', or is it possible to have multiple table entities per model? Is it possible to get something like this to work: ... Namespace_Module_Model module_mysq4 Namespace_Module_Model_Mysql4 table_1 table_2 table_3 ... .. and then dynamically switch between the tables through the model? and related: Anyone know what the possible children of the are and their properites? I've seen 'entities', 'associations' and 'items' - thx
