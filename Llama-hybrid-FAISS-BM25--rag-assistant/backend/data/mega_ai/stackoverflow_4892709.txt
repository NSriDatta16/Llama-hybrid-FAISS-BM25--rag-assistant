As Adam points out, you can create a navigation controller programmatically but you can also do it in Interface Builder to cut down on code. I prefer this, it's analogous to instantiating the controller and setting some of its basic properties. In Xcode, double click on your MainWindow.xib file. This will open it in Interface Builder. In the library, find "Navigation Controller" among the objects list. It should be a black arrow tab pointing left on an orange background. Drag it into the tray or into the window representing MainWindow. Click on the view of the navigation controller (the view should be highlighted). In the inspector, give a valid xib file name in the NIB name (you can leave off .xib"). This sets the root view. You might need to create a new UIViewController class in XCode with its xib just for the purpose of this exercise. Again in the inspector, find "class name" and enter the name of the UIViewController class associated with your xib file from 3. Back in XCode, in the header of your app delegate file, declare something like IBOutlet UINavigationController nc . You can make an associated property and synthesise it if you like. Head back to Interface Builder, and in the tray right-click (i.e. CTRL+click) the navigation controller. Drag from "new referencing outlet" over to "File's owner". You should be able to choose nc from the list of outlets. And that's that. Compile and run. I've probably missed something. Anyone reading this, please feel free to correctly correct my answer. There are plenty of tutorials on YouTube that explain this far better than I did.
