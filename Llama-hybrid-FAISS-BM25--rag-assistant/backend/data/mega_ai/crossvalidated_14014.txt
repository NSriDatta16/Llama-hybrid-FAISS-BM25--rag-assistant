Many of the books and the online introductions to machine learning provide a bit of introduction to their needed probability within their content, so I would start with one or a few books to that kind. Off the top of my head I can think of Statistical Pattern Recognition (may be because I learned EM there) and The Elements of Statistical Learning . My real advice would be the Statistical Data Mining Tutorials by Andrew Moore. That was the site that bridged the gap I had before I started my PhD (coming from an engineering background). I know you said you are not asking about a web site, but do have a look at the Probability for Data Miners there and the other Probability slides before you decide. And have a look at the Gaussian Mixture Models for EM. Is it required to go through a book and do hundreds of exercises? I don't think so. Probability calculations in machine learning tend to cluster around a few well known paths. Having a strong grasp of the Gaussian single and multidimensional distribution and studying a few explanations of EM should get you pretty far. And linear algebra. You will need a lot of linear algebra.
