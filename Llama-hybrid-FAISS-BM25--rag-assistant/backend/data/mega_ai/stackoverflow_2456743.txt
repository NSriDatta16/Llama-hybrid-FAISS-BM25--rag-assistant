Author name won't be in $_GET. As your code stands, you only use it as the link title. It is no where in the address. Try this instead: &authorname= "> It would be better to re-request it from the database using the author_id though. EDIT: To explain the problem in more detail. You have two pages, the new.php page and the viewauthorbooks.php page. You're sending users from the new page to the view page using the link you posted, right? The problem with that is, your link assigns one variable in get. Here's the query string it would generate: viewauthorbooks.php?author_id=13 What that will do is send the user to viewauthorbooks and place the value '13' in the $_GET variable: $_GET['author_id'] . That is why the author_id is there and displays on viewauthorbooks. However, authorname is never passed to viewauthorbooks, it isn't in $_GET['authorname'] because you never set $_GET['authorname'] . If you want it to be in $_GET , then you need your query string to look like this: viewauthorbooks.php?author_id=13&authorname=bob You can accomplish that using the new HTML code for the link I posted above. Look at it closely, there's a key difference from the one you have now. However, it is generally discouraged to pass data through GET, because the query string is displayed to the user and it leaves you open to injection attacks. A better way to do this would be to use the author_id you are already passing to viewauthorbooks.php to retrieve the authorname from the database again. You can use the same code you used on the new.php page.
