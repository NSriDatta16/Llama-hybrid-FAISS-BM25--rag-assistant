Never never never never never hardcode /sdcard in an Android application. First, it's wrong on Android 2.2+. Second, it's wrong on other devices as well. Always use Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() for the root of external storage. Is there any functionality in Java1.5 to know available space of the SDCard like java 1.6? android.os.StatFs has what you need.
