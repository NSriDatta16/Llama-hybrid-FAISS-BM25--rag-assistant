Android opengl vertex array

Simple question that i've always pondered about. When I first got into opengl I had to find a way to draw "tiles" or a bunch of triangles with 1 opengl draw call to improve performance vastly. I did that by putting all the vertices into an array and drawing the array. One problem that occurred was whenever I scrolled the tiles, I would see random placed pixels showing on and off depending on how much I scrolled the map. Around 5-8 on a 10x10 map. Now, I got back into opengl again and and this time I drew using GL_LINE_LOOP instead of GL_TRiANGLES. This never occurred to me back then but what I see when using GL_LINE_LOOP is all the triangles but when it finishes(it goes from bottom left to top right, so top right) there is a line connecting where I ended and where I began. Would the cause of those random pixels be because of this? Or does this have nothing to do with it. Does that line connecting the end and beginning appear because of GL_LINE_LOOP mode or does that also have nothing to do with and have to do with the way I created the map?
