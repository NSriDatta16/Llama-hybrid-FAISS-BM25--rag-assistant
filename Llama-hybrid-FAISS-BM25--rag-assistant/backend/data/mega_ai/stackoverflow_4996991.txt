That means, at line 36 of DocReader.java file, you are trying to invoke an API from an object but the object is not being created yet. So, the solution is to create an instance of the class first before making that API invocation. UPDATE My hunch tells me the NullPointerException happens at docExtractor.getParagraphText() because the docExtractor doesn't get initialized properly. Instead of swallowing the exception, print the stacktrace to figure out the actual problem, like this:- try { ... } catch(Exception exep) { exep.printStackTrace(); // do this }
