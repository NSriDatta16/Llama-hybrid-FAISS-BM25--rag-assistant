Detect constant (zero-slope) sections in a noisy step function

I have data that has the shape of a step function, which is obstructed by noise. I would like to identify the sections with constant slope in it. The noise does not necessarily have 0 mean, and the steps are not always abrupt. Also, the points on the x-axis are not equidistantly spaced. I was thinking about trying one-sided differentiators (like here ) but not sure if they would work with non-equidistantly spaced data. I feel like some sort of a global approach based on optimization would be an elegant way to solve that but so far I couldn't come up with one.
