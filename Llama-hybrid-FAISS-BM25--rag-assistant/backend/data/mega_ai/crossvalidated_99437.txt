You don't really use breaks with logistic regression, but rather continuously plot $X$ vs fitted probability that $Y=1|X$. In general the only variable for which discontinuous breaks exists is time (because events happen that immediately alter one or more variables) and age (because of legal mandates at ages 16, 18, 21, 65 for example).
