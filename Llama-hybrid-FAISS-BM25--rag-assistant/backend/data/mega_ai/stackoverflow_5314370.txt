Why pass by pointer? I think it is better to pass a reference (if the map shall be modified within the function) or reference to const otherwise void calculateAverage(const multimap & q) { // this function wont calculate the average obviously. I just wanted to test it int averageH; int averageP; int averageF; int averageG; averageH = (q.count("Happy Feet")); averageP = (q.count("Happy Feet")); averageF = (q.count("Happy Feet")); averageG = (q.count("Happy Feet")); };
