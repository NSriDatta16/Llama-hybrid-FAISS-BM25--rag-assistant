Time series data is a collection of transactions for a specific bucket of time. It is often incorrectly/inefficiently analyzed as a cumulative. For example total ticket sales for a movie start at zero and then increase. If you analyze the actual new tickets sales per day or per week you can then get a useful model. Daily Forecasts can always be presented for the cumulative while improved understanding/predictability can be found at the actual observed data level. I suggest that you start to examine the data in the dis-aggregate. If you wish you can post your data in a csv column format and I will address that for you.
