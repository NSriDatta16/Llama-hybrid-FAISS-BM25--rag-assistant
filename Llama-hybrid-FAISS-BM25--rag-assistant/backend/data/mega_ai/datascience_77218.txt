Think about the future. Software development. Even though now you can get away with average programming skills in the future more and more of what now is machine learning and data science will be abstracted away and accessible via simple API calls. Take a look for example at FastAI almost everything is abstracted away and even tough pytorch is underneath you do not even need to know to achieve good results. Of course experts will be always needed but his will be a minority. Data science will be a simple tool kit in a software engineers knowledge base.
