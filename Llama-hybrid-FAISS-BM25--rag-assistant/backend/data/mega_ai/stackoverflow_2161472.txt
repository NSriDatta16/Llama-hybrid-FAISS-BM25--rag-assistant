Blocks simply do not stretch horizontally to accomodate their child content, at all; never have.(1) That's something that only happens in the vertical axis.(2) Logically, both dimensions can't be stretchy; one has to be fixed (wrt parent). In CSS, the width of a block element in normal flow is derived solely from the parent (minus paddings, margins, borders), and then the height follows on from that, seeing how much content you can fit in the block's width and flowing it. The background image can appear in a confusing place that misleads you to what is actually happening because of this quirk of CSS: For documents whose root element is an HTML "HTML" element or an XHTML "html" element that has computed values of 'transparent' for 'background-color' and 'none' for 'background-image', user agents must instead use the computed value of the background properties from that element's first HTML "BODY" element or XHTML "body" element child when painting backgrounds for the canvas, and must not paint a background for that child element. Such backgrounds must also be anchored at the same point as they would be if they were painted only for the root element. This is a nasty hack put in place because people were used to putting backgrounds on ‘body’ and having it fill the viewport, even though the element itself does not represent the viewport. (1) except in a few special cases, like float and position: absolute elements without a declared width . (2) unless you deliberately stop that by setting height / overflow .
