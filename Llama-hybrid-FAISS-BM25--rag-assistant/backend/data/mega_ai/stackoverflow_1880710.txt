You get this problem because you are re-using the cells shown. This is the right way to create your cell because otherwise you'll use to much memory. First of all, remove the following from the if-case. Put it right beneath: onButton = [UIButton buttonWithType:UIButtonTypeCustom]; onButton.tag = 1; onButtonView = [[UIImageView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0, 0, 30, 50)]; onButtonView.tag = 2; onButtonView.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"NotSelected.png"]; [onButton setBackgroundImage:[onButtonView.image stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:0.0 topCapHeight:0.0] forState:UIControlStateNormal]; [cell addSubview:onButton]; [onButton addTarget:self action:@selector(toggleButton:) forControlEvents: UIControlEventTouchUpInside]; [onButtonView release]; What you are doing is you are trying to get a cell by "dequeueReusableCellWithIdentifier". This means that if the cell does not exist yet, ( if (cell == nil) ) it will create a cell. You are only setting the button image when the cell should be created. If you set it after the if-case, you will always set the image to "not selected" even if your cell isn't nil. Start off with that, it might fix your problem.
