Edit: Looking at your error message: Fatal error in MPI_Cart_coords: Invalid communicator, error stack: MPI_Cart_coords(130): MPI_Cart_coords(MPI_COMM_NULL, rank=3, maxdims=2, coords=0x6a9010) failed MPI_Cart_coords(74).: Null communicator it looks like the communicator for MPI_Cart_coords is null. Scanning back, this is initialised by the call to MPI_Cart_create ~5 lines above. From the MPI_Cart_create man page (my emphasis): DESCRIPTION MPI_Cart_create returns a handle to a new communicator to which the Cartesian topology information is attached. If reorder = false then the rank of each process in the new group is identical to its rank in the old group. Otherwise, the function may reorder the processes (possibly so as to choose a good embedding of the virtual topology onto the physical machine). If the total size of the Cartesian grid is smaller than the size of the group of comm, then some processes are returned MPI_COMM_NULL, in analogy to MPI_Comm_split. The call is erroneous if it specifies a grid that is larger than the group size. Looks like this may be your issue.
