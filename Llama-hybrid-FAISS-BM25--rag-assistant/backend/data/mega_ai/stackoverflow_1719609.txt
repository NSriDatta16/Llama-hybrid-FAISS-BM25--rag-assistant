The memory allocated in your process's address space will be contiguous. How those bytes are mapped into physical memory is implementation-specific; if you allocate a very large block of memory, it is likely to be mapped to different parts of physical memory. Edit: Since someone disagrees that the bytes are guaranteed to be contiguous, the standard says (3.7.3.1): The allocation function attempts to allocate the requested amount of storage. If it is successful, it shall return the address of the start of a block of storage whose length in bytes shall be at least as large as the requested size.
