I think standard scaling mostly depends on the model being used, and normalizing depend on how the data is originated Most of distance based models e.g. k-means need standard scaling so that large-scaled features don't dominate the variation. Same goes to PCA. About the normalization, it mostly depends on the data. For example, if you have sensor data (each time step being a variable) with different scaling, you need to L2 normalize the data to bring them into the same scale. Or if you are working on customer recommendation and your entry are the number of times they bought each item (items being variables), you might need to L2 normalize the items if you don't want people who buy a lot to skew the feature. Personally, I think if the variables are well-defined, their log might result in losing interpretaility. So if you get good looking clusters without the log transform, I'd stick to it.
