How to compare a Log-Log regression models with a Support Vectors Machine model (SVM)?

I have developed a log-log model which gives me a rmse of 0.1. I want to compare the results with a SVM model. In the SVM i didn't initially use the log transformed variables. RMSE from the non-transformed predictors is 3.9. If i am to compare the two models, should i use the transformed variables in SVM and then compare that rmse with that of the linear model or is there a way to back-transform the rmse from the linear model to compare it with the SVM model. Regards
