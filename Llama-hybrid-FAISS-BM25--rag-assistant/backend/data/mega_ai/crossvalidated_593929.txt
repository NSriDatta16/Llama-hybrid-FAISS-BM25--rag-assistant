This situation is common for example in Neuro imaging or genetics. The common recommendation there is to use linear regularized models such as ridge regression, elastic net, linear SVM or linear gaussian process. Often it is NOT recommended to tune parameters or try many models, because with such a small sample size, The model selection bias due to vibration effects is more dangerous than having sub optimal lambda. Also all these linear models perform very similar anyway. The core problem is not that you don't have enough data to fit your models, but that you don't have enough data to estimate if they are any good or which approach is better. PCA is closely related to ridge regression and L2 penalization, so running PCA regression or those regularized models also won't produce much of a difference. And again, you don't have enough data to detect model improvement that is not large.
