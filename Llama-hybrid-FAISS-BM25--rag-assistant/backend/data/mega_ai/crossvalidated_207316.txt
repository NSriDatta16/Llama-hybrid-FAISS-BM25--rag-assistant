How to choose an optimal dimension reduction factor in LSA processing

I'm performing a K-Means clustering on a 400.000 text dataset. After eliminating useless chars and removing stopwords, I get a dictionnary size of around 42000 words. So before doing the clustering, I apply a LSA/TSIDF preprocessing to reduce dimensionality of my count matrix My question is how do you choose an optimal dimension reduction factor? I've read on some paper that usually LSA allows a good dimensionality reduction by approx. 100-300. So basically, should I choose a new matrix with features dimension between 133-400 ?
