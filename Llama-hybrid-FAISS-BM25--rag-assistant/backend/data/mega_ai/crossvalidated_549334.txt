Probability of defeating a dragon in one turn rolling a 20 sided die

In math class we were asked an optional problem I can't solve on my own: You are fighting a dragon with 250 hit points and are rolling a 20 sided die to deal damage. The dragon takes damage equal to the number rolled on the die with 2 exceptions: If you roll a 20 you deal no damage (dragon is immune to critical damage) and if you roll a 1 you break your combo and the dragon kills you immediatly. You roll until the dragon is defeated or you roll a 1 and break your combo. What is the probability of defeating the dragon? My mathematical approaches included calculating the expected damage per roll $$ E_{ w }= \frac{ \sum_{ n=2 }^{ w-1 }{ n } }{ w } $$ where $$ E_{ 20 }= 9.45 $$ and then tried calculate the probability of not failing in the minumum number of rolls required to defeat the dragon but in the end that led me to a probability so low anyone would consider it 0 and didn't seemed right to begin with. I did understand that the problem is a lot more complex than it seems, since the probability changes drastically with the number of rolls before any other roll and their results. Through empirical testing with a small python program, the probability of winnng came out to be only about 25%, which surprised me, given the chance of dealing damage is 90%. How would you correctly tackle the problem and even leave it "parameterized" so the HP of the dragon and number of sides on the die could be changed?
