Your syntax is absolutely wrong. rand_number doesn't contains methods and yet tries to do conditions. If you want to do random numbers you should try the Random class like this : Random random = new Random(); int numberToFind = random.nextInt(2); You should take a look at the Java naming conventions , it helps to have a clean code that any java developer can understand in a second. For example, start your classes names with an uppercase.
