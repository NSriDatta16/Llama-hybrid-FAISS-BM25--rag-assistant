WPF Organization Tree/Chart Control or hookup?

Q1. Which would be the best resource or tutorial to setup a simple WPF Organization Chart or Tree for an organization object (self referencing).I would like to have a button when clicked which would show an organization chart (hierarchical) tree of the various departments and sub-department.I'm looking for a base to start code + control. Q2.Are there any report software like Crystal Report or WPF that could render something like that?
