From Gdrive, GMail Drive is a Shell Namespace Extension that creates a virtual filesystem around your Google GMail account, allowing you to use GMail as a storage medium. so this is simply a virtual drive. There is a way to access virtual drives from c#, using System.IO.IsolatedStorage . And check out this Performing Isolated Storage Tasks for How to use isolated storage from your application. Note: I dont have any experience with gdrive before. So it may or maynot work.
