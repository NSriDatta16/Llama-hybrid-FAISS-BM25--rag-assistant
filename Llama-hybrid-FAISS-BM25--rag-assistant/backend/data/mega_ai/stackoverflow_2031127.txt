Alemjerus is correct, you don't have access to what you're looking for. The behavior you mentioned in reply to his comment is the default behavior of certain browsers. For instance, with the stackoverflow textarea for this entry, if I use Safari and drag a file into it, it places the file's path into the textarea. With firefox 3.5, on the other hand, it attempts to open the file with the browser. Basically, the "drag and drop" functionality you're attempting to implement is something thats handled by the browser and OS on the client machine -- you can't use Javascript for this purpose.
