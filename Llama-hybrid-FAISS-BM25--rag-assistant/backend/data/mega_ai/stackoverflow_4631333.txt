Separate groups of objects based on their properties

I want to separate an array of my custom object into several arrays, based on the values of their two properties. The struct looks like this: struct MyStruct { public string Person { get; set; } public string Command { get; set; } } Now, if I have an array with a few objects: {Person1, cmd1} {Person1, cmd3} {Person2, cmd3} {Person3, cmd2} {Person2, cmd4} I want to be able to place them into one array for each person, that lists all of the commands for that person: {Person1: cmd1, cmd3} {Person2: cmd3, cmd4} {Person3: cmd2} I hope I've made it clear with my descriptions. I would assume that there is an elegant way to do this with LINQ, but I have no idea where to start.
