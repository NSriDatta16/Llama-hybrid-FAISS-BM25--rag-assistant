How to calculate the Bayesian posterior analytically and by simulation?

I am working with this model: Prior: $P(\lambda)$~ N(0, 1), only the positive part likelihood: $P(x) = 1 - e^{-\lambda x}$ or $P(\vec{x}|\lambda)=\prod(1-e^{-\lambda x})$ Posterior: $P(\lambda|\vec{x})$ What is $P(\lambda|\vec{x})$ ? I have something looks like this: My understanding is that $P(x)$ is always a density function. In here, my model is NOT a density, it is a exponential cdf. So, I am a bit confused. Is my model wrong, is this possible? Thanks!
