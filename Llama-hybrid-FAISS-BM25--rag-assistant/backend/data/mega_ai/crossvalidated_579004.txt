In a sense Bayesian methods do not need to be validated other than assessing lack of fit (just as frequentist methods must consider lack of model fit). Model fit if often best assessed by using posterior predictive distributions to generate new dependent variable values and comparing the new distribution with what was observed for Y. But Monte-Carlo simulations are very useful for demonstrating how Bayes works and for learning about the differences between frequentist and Bayesian. Bayesian simulations are different and are insightful. Consider a standard frequentist simulation: assume the unknown effect is zero and see how often you bring evidence (say p All of this is demonstrated in detail, with R code, at https://www.fharrell.com/post/bayes-seq
