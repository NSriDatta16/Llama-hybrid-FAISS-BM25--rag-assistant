What are you using the TreeSet for? Do the contents change often? Are you trying to be efficient in terms of speed, or disk usage? Reading and writing to a File is very slow compared to memory, and keeping the file and memory versions in sync might be challenging if they change often. Maybe it makes sense to use a database. There are several lightweight databases such as derby and sqllite which can be embedded in your application. Databases are designed to worry about the memory vs. file issue, and if you have >1Gb of data, maybe it makes sense to organise it.
