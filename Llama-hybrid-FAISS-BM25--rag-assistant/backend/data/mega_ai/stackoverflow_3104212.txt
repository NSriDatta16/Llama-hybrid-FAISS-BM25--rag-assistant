You can't . IP addresses are not bound to any geography, more than that they are handed out by different organizations on each continent, but there's no restriction on were one can use that IP, so an American ISP can choose to use their IP in Europe if they want. The only thing you can do is use a GeoIP database where a company have manually noted were each IP address/network is, and these is usually just where a main router is probably located. The end user usually get different IPs by DHCP every time they log on so the IPs are rotated between different customers. Note that any GeoIP database may be utterly wrong on some IP addresses as well. There's no perfect way to know for sure where any IP or user is sitting. You cannot even be 100% sure about the country they are in.
