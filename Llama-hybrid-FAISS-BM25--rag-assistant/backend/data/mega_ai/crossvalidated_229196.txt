I have been unable to have R perform mixed effect logistic regression with appropriate weights to my liking. By appropriate, I mean with weights scaling as discussed by Pfeffermann et. al. (1998) . There's just too much going on for lme4 to bother with the sampling weights. I know that this sounds like the end of the world to R users (can you believe that something is not implemented in R ???), but as of mid 2016, the solutions seem to be gllamm in Stata (written, for goodness sake, back in 2001) -- see http://gllamm.org -- where you can specify anything, at the cost of convoluted data reshaping and management -- and SAS PROC GLIMMIX .
