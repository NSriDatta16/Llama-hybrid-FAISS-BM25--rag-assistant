This is a question of cost and benefit, the closer you try to get to 100% the more expensive it will be. There is also the UI layer, if this is in a technology that is difficult to test, you could program this layer such that it is as thin as possible, and then only test it manually. Depending upon your situation you could drop testing pass-through layers and generated code. Note that it is not just a question of code coverage but how you test, it may be better to have many tests on a limited part of the code and a lower code coverage.
