What is the significance of logistic regression coefficients?

I am currently reading a paper concerning voting location and voting preference in the 2000 and 2004 election. In it, there is a chart which displays logistic regression coefficients. From courses years back and a little reading up , I understand logistic regression to be a way of describing the relationship between multiple independent variables and a binary response variable. What I'm confused about is, given the table below, because the South has a logistic regression coefficient of .903, does that mean that 90.3% of Southerners vote republican? Because of the logistical nature of the metric, that this direct correlation does not exist. Instead, I assume that you can only say that the south, with .903, votes Republican more than the Mountains/plains, with the regression of .506. Given the latter to be the case, how do I know what is significant and what is not and is it possible to extrapolate a percentage of republican votes given this logistic regression coefficient. As a side note, please edit my post if anything is stated incorrectly
