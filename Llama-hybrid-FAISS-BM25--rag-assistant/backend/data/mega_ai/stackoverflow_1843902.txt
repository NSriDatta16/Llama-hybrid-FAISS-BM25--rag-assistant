It would be nice if they had included a more reduced example, but this Introduction to AHAH in Drupal , along with this post on adding dynamic form elements using AHAH should cover pretty much all you need (which, unfortunately, is quite a bit). The way CCK does this (mainly in content_add_more_js() in content.node_form.inc) is a bit more convoluted, as they need to cater for the generalization for different field types, as well as adding some extra stuff to allow for smooth tablesort Drag&Drop functionality. So unless you need the latter, I'd rather not use it as an example, as it gets a bit confusing ;)
