If you are speaking about easy deployment of java applications, use JNLP. The only thing user has to do in this case is to surf to URL. If you wish to do it without any user participation I believe the solution depends on target platform: Use SSH for Unix platforms WNI or telnet for windows platforms. To make the solution more portable you can run wget THE-JNLP-URL on target machine using SSH for unix like platforms. I do not know built-in command like wget for windows. But you can implement this in VBS or JS and then invoke the script using cscript over WMI or telnet. Good luck.
