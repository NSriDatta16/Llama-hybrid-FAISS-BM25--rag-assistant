I am interested by the promise of better speed and easy parallelisation using different architectures. For that reason I will certainly watch Julia development but I am unlikely to use it until it can handle generalised linear mixed models, the has a good generic bootstrap package, a simple model language for building design matrices the capability equivalent to ggplot2 and a wide range from machine learning algorithms. No statistician can afford to have a fundamentalist attitude to the choice of tools. We will use whatever enables us to get the job done most efficiently. My guess is I will be sticking with R for a few years yet, but but it would be nice to be pleasantly surprised.
