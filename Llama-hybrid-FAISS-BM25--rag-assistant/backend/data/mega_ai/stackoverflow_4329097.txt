How do I parse a log from a game with regex and/or linq?

I'm looking for the most elegant way to parse this. I'm just hitting a wall when it comes to my regex knowledge and maybe a regex is not even the best answer? I have three example sentences to give an example of what I want to do. I want to to parse these into four parts. Attacker, attack-type, damage and target. Gandalfs's heavenly wrath DISMEMBERS you! The Holy Prelate's slash wounds Frodo. Your divine power decimates the evil Warlock! Attacker: One or several words that are always first and the words can be identified by either being "Your" or end in 's. Attack-type: One or several words that can only be identified by that they are between the "attacker" and the "damage". Damage: One or more (rare but exists) words that are unique and limited. I have a list with possible words. {"wounds", "decimates" etc}. They do not exists anywhere else so no risk that the attacker is named "wounds" or something like that. Target: One or several words that can be identified that they are all the words after the damage.
