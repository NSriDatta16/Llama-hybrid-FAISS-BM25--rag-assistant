Advice for a C, CUDA, & ANN Newbie?

I'm a business major, two-thirds of the way through my degree program, with a little PHP experience, having taken one introductory C++ class, and now regretting my choice of business over programming/computer science. I am interested in learning more advanced programming; specifically C, and eventually progressing to using the CUDA architecture for artificial neural network data analysis (not for AI, vision, or speech processing, but for finding correlations between data-points in large data sets and general data/statistical analysis). Any advice about how I should start learning C? As well as ANN/Bayesian technology for analyzing data? There are so many books out there, I don't know what to choose. Since CUDA is fairly new, there doesn't seem to be much learner-friendly (i.e. dumbed-down) material for it. Are there learning resources for CUDA beyond the NVIDIA documentation? Further, what resources would you recommend to me that talk about GPGPU computing and massively parallel programming that would help me along?
