While the screen is touched, there will be touch events. There are also touch up and touch down events. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touchesBegan"); } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touchesMoved"); } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"touchesEnded"); } Then just register your controller as the touchController .
