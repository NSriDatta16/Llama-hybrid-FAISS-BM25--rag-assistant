CoreData NSFetchedResultsController Empty Section Display

I would like to show a fixed number of sections in a table view with a Fetched Results Controller as the data source. If you image the contacts app where sections organised by the alphabet, it will not have a header for B if there are no contacts in that section, so the section headers you see are A then C. I would like to display a section header in my table (for B), but without any rows. an empty section in effect. Can NSFetchedResultsController do this for me?
