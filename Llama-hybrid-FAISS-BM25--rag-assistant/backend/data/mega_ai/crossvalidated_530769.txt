Permutated Sequential MNIST is introduced in the " A Simple Way to Initialize Recurrent Networks of Rectified Linear Units " paper from 2015 which has Hinton as a co-author. Sequential MNIST: "classify the MNIST digits [21] when the 784 pixels are presented sequentially to the recurrent net" Permutated Sequential MNIST: same thing with "a fixed random permutation of the pixels of the MNIST digits" Permutated Sequential MNIST is not a real dataset, it's just a transformation of the MNIST dataset to evaluate recurrent neural networks.
