Hourly predictions MAY depend on anthropormorphic activity These might include what day of the week it is what month your are in what level changes have occurred what trend changes have occurred what days of the month exhibit statistically usual effect what recent activity has been *arima structure" what week of the month you are in holiday effects before, on and after long weekend effects EDITED AFTER @Whuber's question about replacement values . As a small example consider a time series containing 10 values 1,9,1,9,1,9,1,9,na,9 and we wish to estimate the missing value at time period 9 . We initially set (without loss of generalization) the missing value to 0 . We form a useful model which suggests an anomaly at time period 9 suggesting that the observed value (0) was 1 less than what id should have been thus the replacement value is a +1 . The model is here and here . The suggest adjustment to the initial value of 0.0 is the complement of the estimated intervention effect (+1) Essentially the arima structure provides a clue to the recursive process thus exposing/highlighting the size of the "unusual values".
