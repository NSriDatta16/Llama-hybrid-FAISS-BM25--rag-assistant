There is no WYSIWYG editor for rails. You can edit HTML templates in a WYSIWYG editor, save them, append an ERB to the file name, and add in the code to make it function. That's not the same as WYSIWYG editing of a rails view though. However, it sounds like what you're saying is you want to make something that looks pretty, and you feel that you need a WYSIWYG editor in order to be able to do that. I would encourage you not to think that way. My opinion, for what it's worth, is that you're much more likely to create a beautiful design if the code underneath is, in fact, beautiful as well. Working in a WYSIWYG interface almost always results in terribly sloppy code that is quite hard to work with later on. You can definitely make amazing looking pages from raw code, you just need to work with a preview window open so you can get rapid feedback. If you're on Mac a great IDE to use is Coda . It has preview, file browser, and terminal built in, so it's quite easy to get rapid feedback on how your code is "looking".
