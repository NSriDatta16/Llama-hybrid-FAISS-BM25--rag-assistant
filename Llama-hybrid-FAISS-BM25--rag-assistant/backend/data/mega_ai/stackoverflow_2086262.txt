I know this question is ancient, and you've probably long ago found an answer, but hopefully this info might still be useful to someone. I had this same problem with MySQL v5.1, and couldn't solve it in a good way. I ended up manually installing the service directly after running the config instance wizard. e.g. mysqld --install NameOfYourMySQLService --defaults-file=your_ini_file.ini then manually starting the service, which I did through C# using the following code (except all the ugly retry stuff snipped to protect my fragile pride) ServiceController[] services = ServiceController.GetServices("127.0.0.1"); foreach (ServiceController service in services) { if (service.ServiceName == "NameOfYourMySQLService ") { service.Start(); } } or if you're doing it in a batch file just net start NameOfYourMySQLService Hope this helps someone.
