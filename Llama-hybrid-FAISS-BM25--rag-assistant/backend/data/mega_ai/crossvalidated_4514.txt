What you are looking for is termed a covered edge reversal , which preserves Markov equivalence of directed acyclic graphs. A proof of equivalence is given in Lemma 1 of A Transformational Characterization of Equivalent Bayesian Network Structures , by Max Chickering. The relationship between Markov properties and factorisation is well established in the theory of graphical models, for example Theorem 5.14 of Probabilistic Networks and Expert Systems .
