Seasonal adjustment is the process of removing a nuisance periodic component. If you have a time series with small deviations in it, the true trend can be masked by the seasonal component. Therefore, it may be beneficial to remove this seasonal trend. A nice overview of this can be found in the matlab tutorial: http://www.mathworks.com/help/econ/seasonal-adjustment-1.html Without any further information on what you are modeling it is impossible to tell you if seasonal effects will matter. For example, assume your time series has a fluctuation of 1000 units, now assume the seasonal effect only accounts for 0.01% of this. At that point it probably is not important to model and remove the season component. On the other hand, if the seasonal effect accounts for 80% of the fluctuation then you do need to model and remove it.
