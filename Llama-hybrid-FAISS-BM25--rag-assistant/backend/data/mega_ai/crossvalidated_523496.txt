Can we know which variables are certain Principal components are made of in PCA?

In PCA, if we have a x1+b x2+c*x3 = y, say we get 2 principal components(d1,d2) out of x1,x2,x3. Can we know which of the x1,x2,x3 and in how much magnitude were used to create the d1 and d2? If not, how is PCA useful for determining which variables affect your outcome when all you get is a mishmash of original variables?
