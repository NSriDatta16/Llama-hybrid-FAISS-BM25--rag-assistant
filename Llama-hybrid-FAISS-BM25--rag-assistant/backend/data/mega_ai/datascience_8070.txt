How to visualize categorical data over time?

I'm visualizing results from lab tests. Most of these results are numerical and therefore easily communicated using line graphs, where the x-axis is time and the y-axis is determined by the range of possible values, like [0, 100] . EDIT: To be clear, I'm not measuring frequency. I'm displaying an individual's lab test results for one specific test (like cholesterol) over time. Since most people don't get more than 1 or 2 lab tests a year, most people's graphs will have less than a dozen (x,y) values. I'm less sure how to visualize this information when the y-axis values are categorical: Sometimes the possible values are themselves ranges. A test value will be something like 2-6 , meaning that the value falls between 2 and 6 â€” and that's all we need to know. Would it make sense to graph these values with something like error bars ? Or would it make more sense to graph the average of the range (in this case, 4) as a regular line chart? The other types involve categories which are non-numerical. Sometimes these are ordinal. In the ordinal case the categories might be something like [none, few, moderate, many] . Does it make sense to just assign an index to each [0, 1, 2, 3] and use a standard line graph? If not, what would make more sense? Lastly, non-numerical, nominal types. These are categories with no clear rank hierarchy, like colors: [yellow, orange, red] . In this case, I think it might be misleading to use a standard line graph, because it would imply that certain colors are "higher" or "better" than others. What would be appropriate?
