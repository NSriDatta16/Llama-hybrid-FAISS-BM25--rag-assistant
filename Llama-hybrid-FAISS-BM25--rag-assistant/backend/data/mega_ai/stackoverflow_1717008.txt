The fourth paragraph down in the blog post below indicates that it will be available for VS 2008 SP1: ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 1 Released As mentioned in the roadmap and elsewhere, ASP.NET MVC 2 will run on both ASP.NET 3.5 SP1 and ASP.NET 4. We will be shipping ASP.NET MVC 2 in the box with Visual Studio 2010 and be making a separate installer for Visual Studio 2008 SP 1 available via download.
