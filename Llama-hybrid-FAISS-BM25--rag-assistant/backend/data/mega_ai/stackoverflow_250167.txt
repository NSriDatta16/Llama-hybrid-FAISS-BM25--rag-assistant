Don't think of it so much that they disabled intellisense in SQL Server 2005 so much as that SQL Server 2005 wasn't built with intellisense support in mind; there is code in the SQL Server 2008 database engine that supports the intellisense feature in Management Studio 2008. Yes, I know it seemed to work in the later CTP previews, but some googling (and DilbertDave's link) reveals that there were a number of ways in which the CTP behavior was broken.
