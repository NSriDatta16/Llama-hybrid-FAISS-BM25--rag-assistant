What is the easiest/most elegant way to iterate over matches in a vim script/function?

I am looking for an elegant solution to (within vim script) iterate over all matches of a regular expression in a buffer. That would be something like fu! DoSpecialThingsWithMatchedLines() for matched_line_no in (GetMatchedPositions("/foo\\>.*\\ Is there something like this? I am not necessarily looking for a full fledged solution, any pointer directing me into the right direction will do. Thanks / Rene
