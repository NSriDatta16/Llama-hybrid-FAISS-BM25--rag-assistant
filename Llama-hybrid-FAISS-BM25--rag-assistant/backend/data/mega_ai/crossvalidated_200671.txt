There is few/nothing written on feature extraction for 1D using DNN's. This is mostly because the idea of extracting visual features from a image and then using this as an input to a classifier was(is?) the standard way of doing ML for computer vision. And since the rise of CNN's people showed that the hidden convolutional layers do a similar job to the feature extractors previously used, and this is one the reasons it works. This parallel between 1D data feature extractors and hidden layers of NN's was never deeply investigated though people knew it generated some kind of feature. Yet, the interpretation of features from CNN's is easily adapted to 1D DNN's by investigating the outputs of each hidden layer as a "feature" or "feature of feature" the higher you go into the NN layer level.
