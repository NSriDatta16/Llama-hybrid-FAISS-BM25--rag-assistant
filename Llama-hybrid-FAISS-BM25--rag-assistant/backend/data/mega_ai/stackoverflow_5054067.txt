Hotmail supports POP3 access since late 2009 so you should normally be able to retrieve the messages in Hotmail with a pop3 connector. The easiest one I know of is Zend Framework and Zend_Mail_Storage_Pop3 . Since ZF is so widely used you are most likely to find tutorials and help on using these libraries. Connection details on how to connect to a Hotmail account through pop3 are at the official pop3 announcement blogpost on the windows live blog .
