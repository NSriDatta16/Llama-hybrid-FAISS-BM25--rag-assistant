How to implement a HTTPS login page in a web application?

I want to create a secure login/logout mechanism. I started reading the following articles to get an idea of things to take into account: Solving the Logout Problem Properly and Elegantly Revisiting the logout problem These articles make some good points, but I was thinking in using HTTPS in a similar way as the Yahoo mail login page. You know... you type http://mail.yahoo.com and you are redirected to a HTTPS page like **https://**login.yahoo.com/config/login where you insert your username and password and after your credentials are verified you are redirected back to a HTTP page with a generated session_id cookie and all communications from there on are on HTTP using the cookie. What do I need to implement this behavior? I want to do this for two Java web apps (one with Spring framework and one with Struts 1) but donâ€™t know exactly how to integrate that HTTPS part into the application (I have never worked with HTTPS before).
