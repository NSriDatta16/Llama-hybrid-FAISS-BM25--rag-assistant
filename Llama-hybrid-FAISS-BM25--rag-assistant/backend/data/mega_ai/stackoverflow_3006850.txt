Receiving a File via RFCOMM on Android

does someone know how to receive a file on android via RFCOMM? I'm a newby to bluetooth issues, so please have patience with me. I'm looking for an approach to receive data via RFCOMM as a stream and store it somewhere on my phone. Saving data is not the problem, it works quite fine. The main issue is the implementation of the connection and the reliable retrieval of the data... This whole procedure should be implemented as an android service (so that no activity has to be launched while receiving data). What would you suggest: Local or remote service? greetz, poeschlorn
