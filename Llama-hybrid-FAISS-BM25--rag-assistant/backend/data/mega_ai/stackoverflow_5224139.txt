The correct way of casting an int to an enum

Possible Duplicate: Cast int to Enum in C# I fetch a int value from the database and want to cast the value to an enum variable. In 99.9% of the cases, the int will match one of the values in the enum declaration public enum eOrderType { Submitted = 1, Ordered = 2, InReview = 3, Sold = 4, ... } eOrderType orderType = (eOrderType) FetchIntFromDb(); In the edge case, the value will not match (whether it's corruption of data or someone manually going in and messing with the data). I could use a switch statement and catch the default and fix the situation, but it feels wrong. There has to be a more elegant solution. Any ideas?
