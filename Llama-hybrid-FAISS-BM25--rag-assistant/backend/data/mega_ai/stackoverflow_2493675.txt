How do I keep the shape of an UIELement while doing a Drag and Drop in WPF

I have 2 StackPanel s - one containing an Ellipse and the other one containing nothing. I want to drag the Ellipse from one stack panel to the other. The actual drag & drop is already done and works fine, however I'd like to know how to keep that Ellipse shape at the tip of my mouse cursor. Even a Windows Forms example would be nice, I'll be able to adapt it.
