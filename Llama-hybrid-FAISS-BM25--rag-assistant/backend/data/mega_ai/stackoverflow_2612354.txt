Displaying fancy equations with Java Generate Images for formulas in Java Roughly I'd say your options are: Use one of the Java libraries mentioned for the first question, if they suit the your application and the form of the Latex (e.g., is it whole documents with macros, style files and BibTex or just single equations). Execute texvc as an external program (as Wikipedia/MediaWiki does), or link to the OCaml code via JNI. EDIT As Stephen C said, these are only for fragments of Latex. If you want to convert a full Latex document, you'll need a full Latex implementation - none of the above. And those need to be somewhat large and complex because they are full "development environments" for typesetting documents by writing Latex code. If this is what you need, you don't have much choice but to use one of the standard Latex distributions via exec (and I guess fail gracefully if the Latex interpreter reports errors in the Latex code). That said, there have been at least a couple of attempts to port Latex to Java (including two called "JavaTex"). Most likely these aren't in a state that would suit you - but see the summary of some recent attempts to judge for yourself: http://www.monperrus.net/martin/running+tex+on+a+java+virtual+machine
