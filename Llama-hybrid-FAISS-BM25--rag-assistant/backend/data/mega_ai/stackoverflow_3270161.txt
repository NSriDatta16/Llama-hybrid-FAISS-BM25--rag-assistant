Inject Groovy into existing Maven Java Project

I have been maintaining a maven java project for year. Recently, I learned Ruby and asked why haven't these nice features (of Ruby) existed in Java, and I am so happy to find Groovy the answer. It's already out there for more than 6 years and what a shame I didn't know about it sooner. Now come to the story: I have a lot of java code written already, organized in folder structures follow maven default convention ( src/main/java for logic & src/test/java for test) Now, I want to write some new stuff in Groovy, so I guess I should create src/main/groovy for groovy logic and src/test/groovy for test. However, both mvn eclipse:eclipse and the latest m2eclipse only understand and include src/main/groovy as source code folder of the generated eclipse project, and don't not recognize src/test/groovy at all. Is this the correct behavior? Or am I missed any thing? By the way, here is the gmaven plugin configured inside my POM: ... ... org.codehaus.gmaven gmaven-plugin 1.2 generateStubs compile generateTestStubs testCompile 1.7 org.codehaus.gmaven.runtime gmaven-runtime-1.7 1.2 compile groovy-all org.codehaus.groovy org.codehaus.groovy groovy-all 1.7.0 compile 1.7 ... ...
