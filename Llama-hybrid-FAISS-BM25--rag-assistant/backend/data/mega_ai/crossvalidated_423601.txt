My interpretation of the credible interval was that it encapsulated our own uncertainty about the true value of the estimated parameter but that the estimated parameter itself did have some kind of 'true' value. This is slightly different to saying that the estimated parameter is a 'random variable'. Am I wrong? Although you say that you interpret the credible interval as encapsulating our own uncertainty, the logic of your conclusion proceeds from the premise that a quantity with a true value is not a random variable. This is taking an aleatory view of probability (and subsequent "randomness") which conceives of randomness as a property that inheres in nature. Mathematically, a random variable is merely a quantity that corresponds to possible outcomes in a sample space, with a probability measure attached. Thus, your approach would only make sense if you take that probability measure as an inherent property of nature, giving the propensity for a metaphysically "random" event to occur. You then conclude that a parameter that has a true value must not be metaphysically "random" and therefore cannot be described by a (non-degenerate) probability measure. That approach is at odds with the epistemic interpretation of probability that is generally used in Bayesian theory. Under the latter approach (which is the standard interpretation), the probability measure is interpreted only as a measure of degree-of-belief (under certain coherence requirements) of the analyst (or some other subject). Under the epistemic interpretation, "random variable" is synonymous with "unknown quantity", and thus, there is no problem with saying that a parameter has a true value, but is still a random variable with a (non-degenerate) probability measure. The quote you are looking at is using this epistemic approach to probability, but your conclusion appears to be using a premise that is at odds with this interpretation.
