An Exercise on parallel programming and object oriented design

I am trying to self-study both object oriented design and parallel programming using the following books: "agile software development" by Robert C. Martin Bruce Eckel's "Thinking in Patterns with Java" "The Art of Multiprocessor Programming" Maurice Herlihy "Programming Massively Parallel Processors" by David B. Kirk But to practice I need to work on some project. Can you please help me finding a project where I can practice both these skills. I am looking for a project which involves both working with design patterns (and basic OOP principles) but also some heavy parallelizable algorithms.
