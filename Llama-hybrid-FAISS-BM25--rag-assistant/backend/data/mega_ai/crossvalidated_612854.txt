Validation can happen after training or they can be complementary. When it happens after the training is completed, the validation data passes through the neural network (which has fixed weights and biases) in one epoch. Complementary training and validation means the following. In one epoch training is done and right after it validation is done; next epoch, training is done again and again validation happens. Each time weights and biases are updated, there is an estimation of the neural network's performance. So we have the same number of epochs for training and validation. When you design your model, you can go for either single validation after complete training or complementary training and validation.
