That constructor of StreamReader is expecting a file path into the local file system, which is only available out of browser with elevated trust. Instead you should be using Application.GetResourceStream :- Stream stream = Application.GetResourceStream(new Uri("data.xml", UriKind.Relative)); StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream); However I expect you really just want this in an XDocument , you bypass this StreamReader stage:- XDocument doc = XDocument.Load(stream); BTW, I personally would leave the XML as Content in the Xap rather than embedding it in the assembly.
