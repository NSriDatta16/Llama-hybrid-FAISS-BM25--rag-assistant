This is venturing into more "intelligent agent" territory. Consider having a plan database for your AI. Your cast-fireball-spell plan may have a prerequisite with the ignite-fire spell, which itself may have a prerequisite of the successful casing of the create-gas-bubble spell. Picking a plan would require satisfying all the preconditions, so if your AI can create a gas bubble but not ignite the bubble, then the plan fizzles, and they have to do something else (perhaps retry).
