In Catboost(gradient boosting) I dont know, but in decision trees and random forest the answer is no. The final prediction is done based in the "mean" of the instances that fell in the leave. I say "mean" but its not necessary the mean. For random forest is the mean of that mean. Now your question, can I have a predicted value bigger than the maximum value in train? In decision trees - No, In random forest - No,For Gradient boosting - I don't know, For Linear Models - Yes
