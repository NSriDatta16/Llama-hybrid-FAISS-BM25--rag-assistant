Can I make a statement about how much larger of a delta a metric needs to be, such that a neutral conclusion become a significant one?

Apologies for the convoluted title. Couldn't figure out a more elegant 1 sentence description. Here are the details. I have an experiment measuring a metric e.g. conversion rate, that concluded with a confidence interval straddling 0, and a p-value larger than the classic 0.05 threshold. This points to insufficient evidence to reject the null, a scenario I'm describing as a "neutral" result. With the information I have from this experiment, is there anything wrong with me making the following claim? I can calculate the standard error from the confidence interval e.g. CI of [-0.5, 1.3] = SE of 0.9 Can I claim that had this experiment resulted in an observed delta of 0.9, assuming S.E remains the same, my new C.I would be [0.0, 1.8] leading to a conclusion of statistical significance? My instincts tell me there's a big flaw in this reasoning but I can't figure out where exactly.
