Another good package is the elasticnet package that Zou and Hastie put out. It has the function spca . Be careful to select a good value of $\lambda$, the sparsity parameter (or vector of them). I would be curious to know which package ends up working better for you since the other package mentioned by @Stephan Kolassa is a year newer and is by Hastie's coauthor, Tibshirani.
