isWeb="true" is just shorthand for threadinfotype="Castle.ActiveRecord.Framework.Scopes.WebThreadScopeInfo, Castle.ActiveRecord" WebThreadScopeInfo uses only HttpContext as sessionscope storage. If you have code that needs to use ActiveRecord outside of any HttpContext (e.g. Quartz.Net jobs), use the HybridWebThreadScopeInfo instead. When you define a specific threadscopeinfo class to use, there is no need to set isWeb .
