The average of averages is not the same as the grand average if group sizes are different (unless you have a very specific situation), which it very much seems is the case here. Suppose group 1 has two entries, 100 and 200. The average is 150. Next, suppose group 2 has a single entry, 250. Its average thus is also 250. The average of averages is 200. However, the overall average is 183. If you want to average averages in a way to obtain the overall average, you need to weight each "sub-average" by the number of entries in the group.
