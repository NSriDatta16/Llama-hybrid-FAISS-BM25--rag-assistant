Static code analysis in every case should only be done if you completely understand the analysis-process and the code. The problem simply is, that it's just rough and offering assumptions. Neither a solution, nor a completely accurate check for vulnerabilities. You have to able to determine the false positives with other testing methods. The value of a static code analyser is not a code-review. To eliminate dead code I'd use code-coverage to profile that. - In your case - you mentioned many abstractions... I pretty much guess static code analysis won't be enough.
