It is complicated, but this is how I understand it: Azure AppFabric SB connections are per "average connection month". The way it's calculated is that on a daily basis, they take the maximum number of connections at any given time, and then average the daily maximum over the month. If you buy a pack, you get the connections at a rate of around $2/connection/month, if you don't buy a pack, the connections are charged pro rated at around $4/connection/month. For example. If you have no packs, and you create 40 connections in one hour of one day (say month end reporting) - even though it's only an hour you are charged $4 x 40 for the day, but that's averaged over the month so you pay $4 x 40 / 30. Now to consider packs - even though you hit a peak of 40 connections your average is around 1.3 connections/month = ~$6, so even purchasing a 5 connection pack at $10 is unnecessary.
