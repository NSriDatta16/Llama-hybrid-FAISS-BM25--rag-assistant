WPF's animations and effects are computationally intensive. They require hardware acceleration to work smoothly. This means that is needs a decent graphics card to play nicely. You can check whether your app can use hardware acceleration as described here , and remove the glow effect if it doesn't. (Or just dumb it down, for example add a simple white rectangle instead of it, or something like that.) I once wrote a simple application which extensively used all sorts of effects and animation, and it was barely usable on an average machine. I dumbed down the effects, and everything became smooth.
