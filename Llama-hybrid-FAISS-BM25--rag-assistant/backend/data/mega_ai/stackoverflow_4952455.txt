It's hard to say without more information. I'd start by checking any errors in console when starting Tomcat. How does the problem manifest, what got you looking if the files did get copied? If I'm unable to find a specific problem, there's some random stuff / voodoo rituals to try (sometimes Eclipse just needs a bit of attention): Check Window / Preferences and then Java / Installed JREs and Server / Runtime environments. Click on Edit, see if Eclipse reports any errors. Check your project's build path - right click on Project / Build path / Configure build path. Go through all tabs; anything red needs fixing. Try opening Window / Show view and look at both Error log (which contains Eclipse errors) and Problems (any compiler warnings/problems). Sometimes Project / Clean helps. Try right clicking on your server in Servers view and choosing Clean. Try starting eclipse with -clean option.
