Such an equation describes a curved relationship between $y$ and $x$ - a parabola: (This particular set of parameters correspond to a minimum at $x= -\frac{_5}{^6}$, just off the left margin of this plot.) Consequently, you should keep all terms in the same x-variable together, since they describe the way $y$ is related to $x$. Do I interpret them as a summation of the two coefficients, so the effect of a one unit change of x on y is 0.5 + 0.3 = 0.8. No. The effect of the $x^2$ term on a one-unit change in $x$ is not constant. Consider increasing $x$ from 0 to 1 and then from 10 to 11: At $0$, the expected value of $y$ is $a$ (a=7 in my plot) At $1$, the expected value of $y$ is $a+0.5\times 1+0.3\times 1^2$ The average increase in $y$ when $x$ increases from 0 to 1 is $0.5\times 1+0.3\times 1^2 = 0.8$ At $10$, the expected value of $y$ is $a+0.5\times 10+0.3\times 10^2$ (a=7 in my plot) At $11$, the expected value of $y$ is $a+0.5\times 11+0.3\times 11^2$ The average increase in $y$ when $x$ increases from 10 to 11 is $0.5\times (11-10)+0.3\times (11^2-10^2) = 6.8$ So there's not one single number -- it depends on which $x$ you look at. It may be useful to describe the effect of a unit change at some low value, some high value and somewhere in between.
