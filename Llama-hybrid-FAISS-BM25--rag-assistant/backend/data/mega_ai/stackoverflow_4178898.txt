Justin, If you have dm-migrations required (which basically means that you're using an RDBMS adapter anyway), you can do the following to find out if a table (or column inside that table) exists. # Find out if the table named 'people' exists DataMapper.repository(:default).adapter.storage_exists?('people') # Find out if there's a 'name' column in the 'people' table DataMapper.repository(:default).adapter.field_exists?('people', 'name') Note that these API methods only get mixed into the adapter if dm-migrations are required and you're using a DataObjectsAdapter descendent.
