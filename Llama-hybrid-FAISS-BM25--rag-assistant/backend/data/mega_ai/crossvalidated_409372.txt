INAR is structurally different from ARIMA. ARIMA supposes normally distributed innovations, whereas INAR models count-data . Therefore, INAR models need to estimate their parameters using different likelihoods. You won't be able to make an ARIMA estimator perform well on low volume count data. (If your count data is high volume, a normal approximation may make more sense.) Unfortunately, there does not seem to be anything in Python, judging from a couple of searches using combinations of "integer autoregressive", "count data" and "time series". You could take published descriptions of INAR models (e.g., this or this , both of which I haven't read) and "roll your own" estimator in Python. Or, if you are open to alternatives to Python, the tscount package for R may be helpful. (While Python's statistical capabilities have been catching up to R, they still lag behind, and count data time series models are one aspect where R is ahead. There are also others.)
