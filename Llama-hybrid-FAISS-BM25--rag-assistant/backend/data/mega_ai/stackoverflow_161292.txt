One aspect of git has not been discussed when it has been brought to your attention in all these other answers: git provides a cvs server emulation, so that you might migrate to git (svn to git is easy and well supported) and later use a cvs server interface for accessing the repository in a centralized manner. Nobody has to know you use git in the background and you don't have to deal with distributed backup issues.
