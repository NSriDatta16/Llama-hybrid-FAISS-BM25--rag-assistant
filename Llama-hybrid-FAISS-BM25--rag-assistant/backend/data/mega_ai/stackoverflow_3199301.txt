jquery-ui tabs with fadeIn?

I have a small JQuery Tabs widget in a sidebar that fades in when the page loads, discreetly calling attention to itself and the interesting content behind the tabs. To build on this effect it might be nice if the individual tabs could fade in one after the other. Can this be done, and if so, how?
