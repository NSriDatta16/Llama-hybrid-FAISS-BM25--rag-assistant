How can I detect an iPhone *4* user through javascript

There are lots of scripts for detecting the User Agent string to detect iPhones and other mobile devices, but strangely enough, the iPhone 4's UA is the same as other versions. My webapp has many HTML5 features that need to be displayed differently for the 326ppi screen than other resolutions. Thanks in advance for any insight.
