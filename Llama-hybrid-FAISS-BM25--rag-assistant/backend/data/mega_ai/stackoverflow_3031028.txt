As I'm sure you're aware, screen scraping is a delicate business. This command sequence is no exception since it relies on the specific structure of the page which could change at any time without notice. grep -o 'Did you mean:\([^>]*>\)\{5\}' page.html | sed 's/.* \([^ In a pipe: curl --user-agent "fogent" --silent "http://www.google.com/search?q=insansiate" | grep -o 'Did you mean:\([^>]*>\)\{5\}' page.html | sed 's/.* \([^ This relies on finding five ">" characters between "Did you mean:" and the " " after the word you're looking for. Have you considered other methods of getting spelling suggestions or are you specifically interested in what Google provides? If you have ispell or aspell installed, you can do: echo insansiate | ispell -a and parse the result.
