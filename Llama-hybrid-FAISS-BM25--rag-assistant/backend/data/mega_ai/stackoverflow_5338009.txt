As others have said, your initializer sequence is valid for an array, and the struct contains a pointer. You can use maraguida's response, using a string literal, but IMHO, this isn't the most readable (and it won't work if, say, you decide to replace the explicit constants with manifest constants). The more general solution is to define a separate, named array, and use it: char const structBytes10to13[] = { 0x10, 0x11, 0x12, 0x13 }; SomeStruct example = { structBytes10to13, "10-13" }; This will work for arbitrary initialization expressions in the character array.
