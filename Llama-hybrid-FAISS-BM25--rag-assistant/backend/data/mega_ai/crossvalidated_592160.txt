Converting speed variance to time variance

I'm doing a design of experiments unit. I came up with prediction equations that predict the speed of a robot completing tracks of different types. The prediction equations give the settings for the best speed of the robot (m/s) for any particular track. The equations give a prediction for the average and the variance, in m/s, because that is the data that was fed into the regression to come up with the prediction equations. I am wondering how to convert my variance in m/s to seconds. E.g. say there is a particular track that my prediction equation suggests the best average speed I will get will be 0.5 m/s. And I know the track is 2 meters. So I will expect on average, my time to complete the track will be 2/0.5 = 4 s. Say I also have a predicted speed variance. I.e. my prediction equation gives a speed variance of 0.01 m/s (actually, it is standard deviation) for the track. How would you go about converting that variance to seconds?
