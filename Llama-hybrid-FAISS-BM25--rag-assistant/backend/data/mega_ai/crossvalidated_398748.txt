What is element-wise max pooling?

I came across this term in the VoxelNet paper in relation to point cloud based object detection using machine learning. It is mentioned in figures 2&3 and in 2.2.1 I am familiar with 2d max pooling, but this is alien to me and am struggling to find any useful information on it. After discussion with a colleague we think it may be as follows but would be grateful for a good reference/explanation: From a vector Y of vectors (y1..yk) the output z would be a vector of max values for each vector in Y: Y | y1 | y2 | y3 | y4 | yk | | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- | z | max(y1) | max(y2) | max(y3) | max(y4) | max(yk) |
