Determining PCA scores for a new data point

I have done a principal component analysis (PCA) on a dataset (using prcomp in R) and now I want to determine what the principle component scores would be for a new sample(s). How can I do this? I'm sure the information is encoded somewhere in the prcomp output, but I can't figure out which table, how to tie it back to a function, and I'm sure someone has already devised a command to do this (which I can't find).
