Would be nice to have a reusable stored procedure written that can do everything that I should do on a database programmatically using best DBA maintenance practices. Like updating statistics, check for page errors, defrag, reindex, shrink?, ..... Like a "Make my DB healthy" stored proc anyone who have a script like that available?
