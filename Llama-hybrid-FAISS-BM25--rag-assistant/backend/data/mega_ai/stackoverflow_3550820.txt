My advice would be to learn it by trying to implement the various types of learners yourself. See if you can find yourself a dataset related to some interest you have (sports, games, health, etc.) and then try and create a learner to do some kind of classification (predicting a winner in a sports game, learning how to classify backgammon positions, detecting cancer based on patient data, etc.) using different methods. Start with Decision Trees if that's part of your future course work since they're relatively simple, then move on to neural networks.
