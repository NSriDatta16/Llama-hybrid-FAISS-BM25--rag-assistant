Honestly, I'd use that. It not only covers console.log() , but also every other console method, and in a decently short number of lines. The fact that it was first used in the Yahoo media player seems to suggest that it works excellently cross-browser, as well.

As long as you comment above the snippet just what it is for (so as not to confuse future developers), you should be fine.
