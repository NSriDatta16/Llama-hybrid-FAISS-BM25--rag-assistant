This great tutorial covers the basics of convolutional neuraltworks, which are currently achieving state of the art performance in most vision tasks: http://deeplearning.net/tutorial/lenet.html There are a number of options for CNNs in python, including Theano and the libraries built on top of it (I found keras to be easy to use). If you prefer to avoid deep learning, you might look into OpenCV, which can learn many other types of features, line Haar cascades and SIFT features. http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_feature2d/py_table_of_contents_feature2d/py_table_of_contents_feature2d.html
