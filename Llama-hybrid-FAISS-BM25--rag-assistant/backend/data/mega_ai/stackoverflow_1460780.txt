Well, as it was obvious, yes, the appearance of the even rows was overwritten to the appearance of the rows I colored at the RowStyle event. The solution, so that the overwritten is avoided is the use of the DevExpress.XtraGrid.StyleFormatCondition object, while programmatically binding the grid, as in the following example: this.gridControl.DataSource = dataTable; DevExpress.XtraGrid.StyleFormatCondition styleFormatCondition1 = new DevExpress.XtraGrid.StyleFormatCondition(); styleFormatCondition1.Appearance.BackColor = System.Drawing.Color.LightCoral; styleFormatCondition1.Appearance.BackColor2 = System.Drawing.Color.SeaShell; styleFormatCondition1.Appearance.Options.UseBackColor = true; styleFormatCondition1.ApplyToRow = true; styleFormatCondition1.Condition = DevExpress.XtraGrid.FormatConditionEnum.Equal; styleFormatCondition1.Column = this.gridView.Columns["MY_COLUMN"]; styleFormatCondition1.Value1 = "0"; this.gridView.FormatConditions.AddRange( new DevExpress.XtraGrid.StyleFormatCondition[] {styleFormatCondition1}); This did solve my problem. Hope it helps somebody.
