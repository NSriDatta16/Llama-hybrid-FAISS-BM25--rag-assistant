How can I drag a copied object around a canvas?

I am able to drag a copy of an object and drop it on the canvas, using drag-drop manager functionality in Flex. The original object remains unchanged and a new copy of the object is created. However, If i further want to drag this copy and position it differently on the canvas, I find that the object is not draggable. Since this copy is created at runtime, I am not sure how I can achieve to drag it? My code is given below. Any suggestions will help.
