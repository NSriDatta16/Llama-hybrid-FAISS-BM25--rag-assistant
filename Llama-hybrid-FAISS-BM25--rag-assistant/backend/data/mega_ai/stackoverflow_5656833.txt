If changing anything in System Configuration borks your system, you can always clear out the bad values in the database directly, and clear your Magento cache. Do a select * from core_config_data where value LIKE '%paulsplace.com%' This will give you the two rows that were added when you clicked save. Remove the rows. Next, clear out all the files in var/cache/* to clear your cache. Then restore your Apache config to what it was before you started monkeying around. This should restore your site back to its previous state, and you can continue to experiment with things.
