Autocorrelation problem with "time series" data

I have some data in python that I plan to run a linear regression on but first I tested the assumptions of linear regression. When it came to autocorrelation my Durbin Watson statistic was 0.14 which indicates positive autocorrelation. The job id is not the same, the first 15 or so are 20000 but after that, it will go to 20001 and the percent complete will reset making a lot of 'mini time series.' Everything I've tried looking up thus far assumes one giant time series which I don't have so I have no idea how to deal with this autocorrelation. Any help would be appreciated.
