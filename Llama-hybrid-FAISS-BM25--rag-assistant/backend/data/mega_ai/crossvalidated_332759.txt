Predictive model(s) to predict disease at a future time $t_1$, given the predictor and output values at time points $t_0,t_1$?

Cross posted at https://datascience.stackexchange.com/questions/28926/predictive-models-to-predict-disease-at-a-future-time-t-1-given-the-predict , declaring it respecting the guidelines: We've $N$ number of subjects (patients) measured TWO times, $t=t_0$ and $t=t_1, t_1 \gt t_0$, with the predictor and output variables as follows: For the predictor variables, there're predictors $(x_1,x_2...x_p)$, measured both at $t=t_0,t_1$. Some of these predictors are directly related to biomarkers of a certain disease (e.g. flatness of nose), and some are not, e.g. marital status (single, married, divorced). Some of these $p$ predictors are categorial/discrete and the rest are continuous. The outputs are $y, z$, with values measured at $t=t_0,t_1$. $y \in \{0, 1\}$. Here, $y=0$ means the patient is healthy, i.e. no disease, and $y=1$ means (s)he's diagnosed with the disease. Here, $z$ is a continuous variable, which is observed to be more for patient diagnosed with the disease ($y=1$) and less for healthy subjects ($y=0$). The problem is to build a predictive machine learning model so that we can predict $y,z$ at $t=t_1$, when we know $y,z$ at $t=t_0$. To predict $y$, I'm thinking of the following, please criticize my idea or suggest something new: (1) Let $C_0$ be the set of all features in $\mathbb{R}^p$ so that $y=0, 0$ at $t=t_0, t_1$ respectively. And let $C_1$ be the set of all features in $\mathbb{R}^p$ so that $y=0, 1$ at $t=t_0, t_1$ respectively. Define a new categorical variable $Y$ to be $0,1$ for these two classes. (2) Then perform classification on $(C_0,Y_0)$ and $(C_1,Y_1)$. For a particular method, I'm thinking logistic regression, but is there intuitively a best choice without going to the cross-validation and testing? BUT , how do I predict $z$ at $t=t_1?$ I'm thinking of regression, but how exactly do I do this here? If my idea is wrong, What kind of predictive model(s) should I use and why?
