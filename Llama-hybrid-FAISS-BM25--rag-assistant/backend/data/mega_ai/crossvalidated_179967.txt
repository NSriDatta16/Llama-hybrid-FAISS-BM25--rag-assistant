You might want to read Quantifying effect of a categorical variable in time series analysis for some information about change point detection. Recent "Unusual Values" can also be a clue to a change in error variance or a regime change in model/parameters. Depending on the identified/suggested/most likely cause for the change point different remedies might be in order including model reformation in order to create new forecasts. You might want to peruse http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf which details how to program Pulse/Level-Step shifts and change points in error variance. I have personally extended this to Trend Change Detection ( see Auto-regression versus linear regression of x(t)-with-t for modelling time series ) and parameter change point detection ala Gregory Chow https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_test It is interesting to me that the history of detection is often ignored by others . Here is some material from the Tsay reference.
