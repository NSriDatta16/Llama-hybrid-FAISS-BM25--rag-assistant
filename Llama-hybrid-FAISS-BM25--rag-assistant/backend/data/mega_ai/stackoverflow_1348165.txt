To do it all in one query, you need to use subqueries. select band_name, (select count(*) from album where album_owner=band_id) as album_count, (select count(*) from song where song_owner=band_id) as song_count, (select avg(rating_value) from song join rating on rating_song=song_id where song_owner=band_id) as average_rating from band I'm assuming here that you mean you want the average rating for all songs for each band. If you meant you want the average rating for each song, then it doesn't really make sense to do it as a single query, because the count of number of albums applies to a band, not to a song, though I suppose you could return one row per song with the number of albums for the band repeated on each song.
