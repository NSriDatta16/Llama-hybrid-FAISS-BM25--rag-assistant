Interpreting standard deviation for PCA

I'm running PCA on my dataset using r and need some help interpreting the standard deviation results. Here are the results > summary(wine1.pca) Importance of components: PC1 PC2 PC3 PC4 PC5 PC6 PC7 PC8 PC9 PC10 PC11 PC12 Standard deviation 1.7440 1.6278 1.2812 1.03373 0.91682 0.81266 0.75088 0.7183 0.67710 0.54683 0.47704 0.18111 Proportion of Variance 0.2535 0.2208 0.1368 0.08905 0.07005 0.05503 0.04698 0.0430 0.03821 0.02492 0.01896 0.00273 Cumulative Proportion 0.2535 0.4743 0.6111 0.70011 0.77016 0.82520 0.87218 0.9152 0.95338 0.97830 0.99727 1.00000 From what I've read, it is good to pick the number of components which explain 85% or greater of the variation. Questions Should the class variable be part of the dataframe when performing PCA? How can I find out from these results how many components would give 85% or greater of the variance? Would it be PC5 because the standard deviation if .91 and then drops for PC6 at .81?
