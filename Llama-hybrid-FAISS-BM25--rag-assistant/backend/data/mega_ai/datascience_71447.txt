As someone who worked on a competitor to Tableau, Data Science skills have largely superseded the need for Bi Software for data munging, complex analysis and ad hoc reports. But BI Software can still be beneficial if you need to deploy your results to lots of people, often with varying rights to view something (e.g. you can only see your performance stats, but not the stats of alice). For this, the graphical capabillites of Tableau and the underlying security model are quite a lot to recreate in Python. This holds also true for a lot of use cases where you need to update reports regularly and the viewership needs nice reports. On the other hand, data munging, etl and most importantly complex analysis pipelines are not the strong suit of BI Software, they are much better done in Python. Also, if you are providing an API, which is intended for programmatic consumption, Bi Software is often stark nacked.
