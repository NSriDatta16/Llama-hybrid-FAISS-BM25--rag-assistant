Actually, while short of getting an actual Amazon employee to tell you there is no way to confirm this, I am fairly certain that the Amazon Remembers feature you refer to is actually the work of crowd sourcing- using lots of people combing through data to make it appear like a computer is doing it. I think they may actually be using there own Mechanical Turk system. Edit: Also, I found this SO question that might interest you. It is specifically for playing cards, but some of the answers (such as the machine learning example) can be modified to be more helpful for what you want to do with magic cards.
