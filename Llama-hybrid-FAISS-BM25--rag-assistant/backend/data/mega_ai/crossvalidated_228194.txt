Linear and Nonlinear Components of a Time Series

I am starting to develop a hybrid ARIMA-ANN model for forecasting. Most of the journals I read mention mostly a linear component for ARIMA and a nonlinear for ANN. How can you know which components in the data are linear and nonlinear? What are the definitions of the linear and nonlinear components of a time series?
