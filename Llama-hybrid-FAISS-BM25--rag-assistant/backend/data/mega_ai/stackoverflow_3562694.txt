Try http://graphsharp.codeplex.com/ . I started a project, today, using MSAGL, but I would rather use WPF for the UI. From the site: Can use all kinds of algorithms (layout, overlap removal, edge, highlight) Vertex dragging supported Templates for vertices and edges supported Mutable graph -> automatic relayout after the graph changes (burst mode: lot of modification but only 1 relayout) Async layout (background thread) supported Position changes are animated!
