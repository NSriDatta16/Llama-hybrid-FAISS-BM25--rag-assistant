I don't see anything related to over dispersion in your problem. Even though I don't work with SPSS, I assume that the logistic regression dialog requires 4 types of variables: dependent - the count of positive outcomes independent continuous - covariate "X" independent categorical - drug type count variable - number of observation in each category I don't see need or room for any correction.
