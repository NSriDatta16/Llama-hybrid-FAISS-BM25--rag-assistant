If your modules are pretty cleanly separated (logically and/or functionally), I've found it helpful to organize my svn repo like this: module1 (eclipse proj1) -- trunk -- branches -- tags module2 (eclipse proj2) -- trunk -- branches -- tags It might seem overkill at first (especially if the modules are small), but I find it helpful to try to maintain a one-to-one relationship between each "trunk, branches, and tags" dir structure in svn and each eclipse project. It lets me tag each module as a different version (when needed) and integrates nicely with build scripts. If your modules aren't logically separated, then you might want to combine them into one ;-)
