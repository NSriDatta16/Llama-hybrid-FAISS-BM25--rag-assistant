If you are worried that your modifications to the properties get overwritten by a visual setting by the developer you may hide them using [Browsable(false)] attribute. However, from OOP perspective inheritance is not encouraged unless really necessary. There is a golden rule : "Favor composition over inheritance". As this. __curious_geek said it's not a good idea to inherit controls to set properties this way but it's good practice to always have common base class for your business classes and screens. You may make a function in the base class of all screens to properly adjust the grids for you the way you want. If you make it virtual, you may override it in derived classes to customize the behavior per case as needed.
