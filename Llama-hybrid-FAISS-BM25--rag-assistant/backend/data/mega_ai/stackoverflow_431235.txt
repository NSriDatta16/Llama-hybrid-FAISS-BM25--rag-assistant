What is an "Abort trap" & how do I debug it?

I'm getting this message each time I compile my project: RunIPhoneUnitTest.sh: line 92: 31389 Abort trap "$TARGET_BUILD_DIR/$EXECUTABLE_PATH" -RegisterForSystemEvents I understand is a problem in my code, but then I don't figure how solve or found it. The strange thing, is that I get this with this call: -- This is the interface @interface DbObject : NSObject { NSInteger Id; NSDate* timeStamp; } @property (nonatomic) NSInteger Id; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSDate *timeStamp; ---- This fail with above error ---- NSString * filter = [NSString stringWithFormat:"id = %@", ds.Id, nil]; BUT the wird thing is that I delete that line, that method and still get it! Is making my crazy. Currently, I'm thinking in delete code until not get a error & start adding it, but wonder if exist a more pragmatic solution...
