I'd use http://www.modernizr.com/ Modernizr to detect the capabilities in the client, and then redirect to a different location in case support is insufficient for the current fidelity-level. If there is no CSS/JS support at all, you're pretty much screwed when it comes the client-side part. You'll have to resort to things like useragent sniffing... but then, nearly all phones have at least rudimentary CSS support, even the fairly old models.
