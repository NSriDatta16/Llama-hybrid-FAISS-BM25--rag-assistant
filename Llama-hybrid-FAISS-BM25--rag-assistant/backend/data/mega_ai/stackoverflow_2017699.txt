Here is an advice gleaned from the android developers forum: There are two fairly common and well defined situations: Situation: You need a temp file to do some processing that won't necessarily fit into memory. Solution: Create the file, use it, delete it when you're done* Caveat: The file may be exceptionally large: demand an SDCard. The file contains sensitive information: use app storage. Situation: You are operating a cache. Solution: maintain the files in the supplied cache directory (Context.getCacheDir()), the system knows these can be deleted** Caveat: Big ticket items (like songs and videos) go to the sdcard (the user can treat these types as useful files anyway)
