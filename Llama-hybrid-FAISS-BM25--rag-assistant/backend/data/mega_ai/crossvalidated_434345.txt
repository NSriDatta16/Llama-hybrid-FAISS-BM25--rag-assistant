How to decide maximum lags length in Newey West T stats

wI have a time series data. I run Newey-West statistics on it without mentioning lag length. It accepts null hypothesis. On the same time series when I mention max.length=50. It rejected null hypothesis. My data consists of 192 observations. Please tell me whether i should mention max. lag or go by default option.
