Intractable posterior - why not use kernel density for the data distribution?

In the Bayes rule, it is said that the posterior $$ P(\theta|D) = \frac{P(D|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(D)} $$ is intractable , because $$ P(D) = \int P(D,\theta) d\theta $$ and the latter is often a high-dimensional integral. See Why is the posterior distribution in Bayesian Inference often intractable? But this is just one way of computing $P(D)$. There are others? What about instead estimating $P(D)$ using a kernel density (place a Gaussian or some other lobe at each datapoint, and normalize so it all sums to one). Or simply using delta functions: $$ P(x) = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \delta_{x_i}(x) $$ This requires touching each bit of data, but that is not intractable.
