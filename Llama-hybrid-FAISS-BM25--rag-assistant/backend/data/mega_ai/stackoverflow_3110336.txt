It's valid and very useful in some cases. Consider the following code: switch(poll(fds, 1, 1000000)){ default: // here goes the normal case : some events occured break; case 0: // here goes the timeout case break; case -1: // some error occurred, you have to check errno } The point is that the above code is more readable and efficient than cascaded if . You could put default at the end, but it is pointless as it will focus your attention on error cases instead of normal cases (which here is the default case). Actually, it's not such a good example, in poll you know how many events may occur at most. My real point is that there are cases with a defined set of input values where there are 'exceptions' and normal cases. If it's better to put exceptions or normal cases at front is a matter of choice. In software field I think of another very usual case: recursions with some terminal values. If you can express it using a switch, default will be the usual value that contains recursive call and distinguished elements (individual cases) the terminal values. There is usually no need to focus on terminal values. Another reason is that the order of the cases may change the compiled code behavior, and that matters for performances. Most compilers will generate compiled assembly code in the same order as the code appears in the switch. That makes the first case very different from the others: all cases except the first one will involve a jump and that will empty processor pipelines. You may understand it like branch predictor defaulting to running the first appearing case in the switch. If a case if much more common that the others then you have very good reasons to put it as the first case. Reading comments it's the specific reason why the original poster asked that question after reading Intel compiler Branch Loop reorganisation about code optimisation. Then it will become some arbitration between code readability and code performance. Probably better to put a comment to explain to future reader why a case appears first.
