What about using a ptype attribute ? You could have photo.ptype = 'collection' or photo.ptype = 'single'. This way you would be able to identify each photo by that type. Moreover, you can make it even more elegant by using a scope on the photos and specify collection_photos scope or single_photos. Another possibility is polymorphic models. Have a photo model and a collectionPhoto and singlePhoto model that are using it.
