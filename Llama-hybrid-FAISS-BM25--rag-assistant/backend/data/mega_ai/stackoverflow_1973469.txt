If zero can be a meaningful value for this time series (e.g. temperature in Celsius degrees), it might not be a good idea to fill all gaps with zeros (i.e. you will not be able to distinguish between the real and stub values afterwards). You might want to interpolate your time series. Basic data structure for this can be array/double linked list.
