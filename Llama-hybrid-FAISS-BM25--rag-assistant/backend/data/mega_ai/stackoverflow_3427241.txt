Block-based UIView animation goes into turbo when view is not visible

I'm using the new block-oriented UIView animation methods to create a sliding-and-fading slideshow inspired by the one that shows up on the home screen of the Flickr application. It's all working very nicely, and I'm no longer intimidated by blocks. Where I'm using this is on a page of my app that's inside UINavigationController control. Everything's fine about it, and as far as I can tell it's working correctly. The thing is, I left one line of NSLog output in there, and when my view that houses my slideshow is not the top view controller on the stack, that sucker puts out just tons of lines of NSLog output. That thing is running once every 8.5 seconds (when a new slide is loaded) under normal circumstances, but when it's not visible it's like 16 or so per second. It goes normal again when its viewcontroller comes back to the surface, as if nothing had happened. If I wasn't talking to myself on the console, I'd never know this was happening. My animations are on a big loop. I don't really mind if they're churning away beneath me while I'm not paying attention. You think this is a problem? My concern is that it's eating unnecessary cycles, but it doesn't seem to have any real impact even on my testing 3G. Thoughts? Is there some universal way to pause custom UIView animations?
