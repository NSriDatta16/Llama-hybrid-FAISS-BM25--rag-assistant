Jquery problem with height() and resize()

I need to give an element a specific height based on document's height and keep it whether the document size changes: $(document).ready(function () { $('#descriptive_news_text').height(($(document).height() - 325)); $(window).resize(function () { $('#descriptive_news_text').height(($(document).height() - 325)); }); }); Now, when I manually resize the browser it works like a charm, but at page load the document size is calculated in a wrong way so that the div's height is also wrong. I've tried to force a $(windows).resize() as last statement (as a test, even with a delay of seconds), but this doesn't work as jQuery only recognized the right height after a manual resize. Also, resizing the window with a double click or via the "resize" button of the window (Chrome, Windows) it doesn't seem to trigger the "resize" event as dragging the window edges does. Any help?
