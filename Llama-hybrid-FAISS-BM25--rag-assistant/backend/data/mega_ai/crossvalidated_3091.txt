Regression analysis and parameter estimates with populations

I've seen a little bit here about the difference between statistical inference for random samples, and what happens when we actually have population data. Most arguments seem to suggest you "never actually have the population" and the population data you think you have represents some unobservable super population which is the data-generating process. But say, we have a state, covered by counties, and we have data on some environmental aspect of each county, for example, the total area of forest. We want to see if some binary county-level outcome is related to forest - let's say presence or absence of a disease (thinking Lyme disease here). As far as I can tell, this qualifies as "population" level data. Would running a regular logistic regression, and the normal tests on parameters, yield correct estimates? One thing that comes into this is whether the "samples" are independent. In this case, forest in county A is probably related to forest in the county B next door, meaning a reduction in the degrees of freedom and imprecision in standard error estimates (as I understand it). But even if we had totally independent data, would standard, sample-based statistical inference be appropriate here?
