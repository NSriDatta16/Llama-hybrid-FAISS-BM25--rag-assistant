I suspect this is Firefox trying to protect you from security issues when running Javascript. When I tried typing in your example into my address bar, Firefox prompted me to ask if I am sure I want to log in to api.del.icio.us . This other question concerning HTTP auth looks similar to your question, maybe it will help you. Update: I used Firebug's Net panel and its Javascript console, and I was able to see the request/response headers. Here is the request from the Javascript console, which FAILED: GET /v1/posts/add?url=http://www.spoons.com/&description=forks&tags=knives HTTP/1.1 Host: api.del.icio.us User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Referer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2708950/2740195 Authorization: Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Cache-Control: max-age=0 And, here is the request from the address bar, which WORKED: GET /v1/posts/add?url=http://www.spoons.com/&description=forks&tags=knives HTTP/1.1 Host: api.del.icio.us User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive Authorization: Basic XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX Cache-Control: max-age=0 The only difference seems to be the Referer header, which caused the access denied response. The setting network.http.sendRefererHeader in Firefox's about.config can be set to 0 which turns off the Referer header. When I tried this, then the Javascript console method started working. There is a Firefox extension called refspoof which is useful for sending your own custom Referer headers, maybe that can help here.
