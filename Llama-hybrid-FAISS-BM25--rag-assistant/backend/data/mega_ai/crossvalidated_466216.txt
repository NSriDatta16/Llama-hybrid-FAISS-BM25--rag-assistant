It depends on what you're optimizing for: what is your target distribution, over which you would like to minimize the expected loss? If it is the same as the training distribution, then the validation data should follow the same distribution. If it is a different distribution (e.g. you would like your algorithm to perform well on balanced data), you actually want to minimize the expected loss over that distribution, and your validation set should correspondingly be sampled according to that distribution. This situtation is called "covariate shift", and there is a whole branch of research on what's called "covariate shift adaption," i.e., dealing with this problem. There is a book by Sugiyama / Kawanabe on the subject from 2012, called "Machine Learning in Non-Stationary Environments".
