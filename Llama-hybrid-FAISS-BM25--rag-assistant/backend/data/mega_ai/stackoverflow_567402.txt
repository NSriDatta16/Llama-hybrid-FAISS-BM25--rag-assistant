421 means that the service is not currently available, and that the client should try again . This could be for any number of reasons, including trying to discourage you from too frequent mailing if Hotmail thinks you might be a spambot. Why not simply let your outbound smtpd queue the mails and try again? Why is "not all mail reaching your members"? Don't you try again if you get a 421 response? EDIT: Do what sqook says.
