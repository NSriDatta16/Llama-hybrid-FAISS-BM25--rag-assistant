Handling splitting and joining of objects in key-value storage?

After getting some help on how to measure fysical/actual size of memcached objects to prevent them from growing too large, I have thought about the next step - implementing a sharding/splitting function that transparently splits large objects into smaller pieces upon storage and glues them together as one big object when requesting them. Basically it should do everything behind the scenes automatically that needs to be done to keep memcached happy. What's an appropriate way to handle splitting of array, objects or whatever kind of objects? I am using PHP in my webapp, but for this case, I would be quite happy with a general approach with some psuedo-code to point me in the right direction. Thanks a lot!
