It turns out that the cause was that this project wasn't being considered by Eclipse to actually be a Java EE project at all; it was an old project from 3.1, and the Eclipse 3.5 we are using now requires several "natures" to be set in the project configuration file. org.eclipse.jdt.core.javanature InCode.inCodeNature org.eclipse.dltk.javascript.core.nature net.sf.eclipsecs.core.CheckstyleNature org.eclipse.wst.jsdt.core.jsNature org.eclipse.wst.common.project.facet.core.nature org.eclipse.wst.common.modulecore.ModuleCoreNature org.eclipse.jem.workbench.JavaEMFNature I was able to find the cause by creating a new "Dynamic Web Project" which properly read its JSP files, and diffing against the config of the older project. The only way I could find to add these was by editing the .project file, but after re-opening the project, everything magically worked. The settings referenced by pribeiro, above, weren't necessary since the project already conformed to the default settings. Both pribeiro and nitind's answers gave me ideas to jumpstart my search, thanks. Is there a way of editing these "natures" from within the UI?
