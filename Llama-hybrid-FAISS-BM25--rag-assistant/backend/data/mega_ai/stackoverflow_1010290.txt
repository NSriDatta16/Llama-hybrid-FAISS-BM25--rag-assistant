In HTML5, can you save an image to cache programmatically?

I love that in HTML5 you can save text data out to a local database, and can even use SQL to do it. ( http://webkit.org/blog/126/webkit-does-html5-client-side-database-storage/ ) I've got an app that I've written for the iPhone's MObile Safari that caches everything offline except for images. The images still have to be downloaded from the server, and I don't know how to ensure that they will stay cached. Ideally, I'd like to write them out to the localStorage database. I was thinking of writing an image to the canvas, and then serializing that as text... any ideas? Is there any easier way to do this? Ideally, I'd like to do this all with HTML and JavaScript, no native apps/objective-C.
