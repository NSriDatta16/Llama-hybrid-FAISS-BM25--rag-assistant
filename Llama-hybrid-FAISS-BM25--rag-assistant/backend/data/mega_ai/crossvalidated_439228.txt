Look at the data arrangement in the example you reference: To use Cochran's Q test, you need to have a dichotomous dependent variable, a grouping variable, and then a variable indicating the subjects for which there are repeated measures.... In any case, from how you've presented your data, you don't have data in this arrangement. From how you have presented your data and question, the best I can guess is that you want a chi-square test of independence. Or logistic regression, with a similar purpose. Data = read.table(header = T, text=" Group Blood Count Skull A 7 Back A 8 But A 2 Chest A 38 Nose A 22 Feet A 1 Elbow A 6 Lip A 2 Thigh A 1 Shoulder A 9 Calf A 20 Skull B 26 Back B 7 But B 3 Chest B 104 Nose B 26 Feet B 1 Elbow B 12 Lip B 8 Thigh B 9 Shoulder B 13 Calf B 34 ") Table = xtabs(Count ~ Group + Blood, data=Data) chisq.test(Table) ### Pearson's Chi-squared test ### ### X-squared = 15.597, df = 10, p-value = 0.1118 ### ### Warning message: ### In chisq.test(Table) : Chi-squared approximation may be incorrect model = glm(Blood ~ Group, weights=Count, data=Data, family=binomial()) library(car) Anova(model, test="Wald") ### Analysis of Deviance Table (Type II tests) ### ### Df Chisq Pr(>Chisq) ### Group 10 14.734 0.1421
