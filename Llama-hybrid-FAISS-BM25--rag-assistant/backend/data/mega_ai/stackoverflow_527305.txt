Rather than have a pile of one-off CSS files with 1 or 2 rules each in them, I have found it useful to give the body an ID or class attribute similar to your example. Ultimately, pragmatism should win. Simplicity means different things at different scales - if you have massive CSS changes per page, it suddenly becomes a lot simpler to maintain different CSS files and swap the include statements. But with just a handful of rules, maybe only a few edge case pages, it is easier to include all the rules in your main stylesheet.
