There's no such function in OpenCV and by reason. Face detection is very complex problem and there are only few approaches that do the work. For example, OpenCV implements Viola & Jones face detection algorithm which is known as one of the best such algorithms. Some other implementations use neural networks etc. So, face detection problem in some general complex scenes isn't as easy as it seems. I'm afraid that using face color information wouldn't be good enough to give stable results. There are some papers suggesting such techniques but conditions under which algorithm works are mostly limited (e.g. only one face per image or very simple background).
