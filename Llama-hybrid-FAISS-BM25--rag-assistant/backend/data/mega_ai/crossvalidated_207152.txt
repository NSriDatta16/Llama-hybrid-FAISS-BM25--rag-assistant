The constant is really just the difference in the intercepts from separate log wage regression for men and women. Here's a reproducible$^*$ example: use http://fmwww.bc.edu/repec/bocode/o/oaxaca.dta reg lnwage educ exper tenure if female==0 estimates store M reg lnwage educ exper tenure if female==1 estimates store F qui suest M F lincom _b[F_mean:_cons]-_b[M_mean:_cons] oaxaca lnwage educ exper tenure, by(female) swap pooled detail Here I used suest to combine separate male and female regressions and constructed a difference between the female and male intercepts from those regressions using lincom . Here's the output from the last two commands: . lincom _b[F_mean:_cons]-_b[M_mean:_cons] ( 1) - [M_mean]_cons + [F_mean]_cons = 0 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | Coef.

Without knowing more about your data, it's hard to interpret your results. Presumably, it means that there's a gap in the intercepts between men and women. If that intercept is a meaningful one (i.e., doesn't correspond to the log wages of someone without any education or experience), you can take this interpretation a bit further. Response to Questions: Cut and paste the output from Stata into here, select it, and then press the {} button to format it nicely. All the unexplained components sum up to the total unexplained, so your intercept component is made smaller by the negative education terms. This makes sense since your intercept is not really meaningful. To make it more interpretable, I would suggest standardizing your continuous Xs (subtract the mean and perhaps also divide by the standard deviation) to make the intercept more meaningful (careful with those squared terms though). This makes the intercept correspond to the log wage of the person who has the average attributes and is in the omitted category for all the sets of dummy variables. You can also subtract salient values rather than the mean, such as 12 for years of education. The unexplained part is usually attributed to discrimination, but it is important to recognize that it also captures the gender differences in unobserved (to you) variables, which will be picked up by the intercept. $^*$Making use of standard datasets rather than providing an edited screenshot of output from data that only you have access to will make it much easier to get a good answer. But if you can't do that, pasting output and formatting it with code tags is much better than a screenshot.
