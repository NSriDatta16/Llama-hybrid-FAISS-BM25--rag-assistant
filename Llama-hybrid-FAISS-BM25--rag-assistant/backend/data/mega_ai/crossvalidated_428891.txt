Encoding Ordinal categorical data using Python

I am trying to encode ordinal data. I found a post which suggests a way to do it. Where to find a guide to encoding categorical features? This seems to make sense. For nominal data, I would do the one-hot encoding. For ordinal data, is there any encoding that does what the post suggests? Also, if ordinal data is some string such as excellent, good, or average, how do you usually proceed? It seems many people just do the one-hot encoding.
