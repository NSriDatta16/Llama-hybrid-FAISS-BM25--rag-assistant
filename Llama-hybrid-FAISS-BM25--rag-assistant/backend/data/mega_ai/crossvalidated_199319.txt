Smarter Column Reference in R

I'm trying to organise my data the following way: comptime What's happening here is I want to get every 7th column of the data set starting from a certain point of the data.frame. Can anyone advise a smarter way to reference the columns, because I need to compile around 60 mini data.frames like this. If possible of course.
