Decide threshold for LM to filter out ill-formed sentence

I have a corpus of sentences. This corpus contains well-formed as well as ill-formed sentences. I want to filter out ill-formed sentences from the corpus. Ill-formed sentences are of two types : Sentences with grammatical errors, Ex : "What are the symptom of fever ?" Incoherent sentences, Ex : "How do you cure apple ?" The first thing which I tried was Language Model. I used the perplexity scores as well LM probability to decide which ones better. In perplexity case lower the better and in LM probability case, higher the better. But the problem I am facing with is how to decide the threshold of the value for perplexity and LM prob? Looking at the scores seems there's a significant overlap in distribution of good and bad sentences. I also don't have a labelled dataset, and hence I can't build a classifier where features would be LM Prob and Perplexity. Any ideas is highly appreciated.
