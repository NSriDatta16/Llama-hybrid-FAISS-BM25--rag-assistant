The B-Tree points to the row in the table, but the B-Tree itself still takes some space on disk. Some database, have special table which embed the main index and the data. In Oracle, it's called IOT -- index-organized table. Each row in a regular table can be identified by an internal ID (but it's database specific) which is used by the B-Tree to identify the row. In Oracle, it's called rowid and looks like AAAAECAABAAAAgiAAA :) If I have a table column with data and create an index on this column, will the index take same amount of disc space as the column itself? In a basic B-Tree, you have the same number of node as the number of item in the column. Consider 1,2,3,4 : 1 / 2 \ 3 \ 4 The exact space can still be a bit different (the index is probably a bit bigger as it need to store links between nodes, it may not be balanced perfectly, etc.), and I guess database can use optimization to compress part of the index. But the order of magnitude between the index and the column data should be the same.
