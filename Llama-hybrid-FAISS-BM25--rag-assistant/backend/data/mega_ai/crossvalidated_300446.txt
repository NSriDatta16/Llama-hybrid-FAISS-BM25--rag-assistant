Why is it ok to mix up the order of the time series in a moving block bootstrap?

For a time series consisting of a sequence of observations $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$, the moving block bootstrap (See here and wikipedia ) is implemented thus (emphasis mine): Pick a block length $k$. Create $n - k + 1$ overlapping blocks of length $k$, so that the first block $x_1^k$ consists of the subsequence $(x_1, \dots, x_k)$, the second $x_2^{k+1}$ is the subsequence $(x_2, \dots, x_{k+1})$, etc. Sample $m = \operatorname{round}(\frac{n}{k})$ blocks with replacement. The bootstrapped observations are then obtained by aligning these blocks back to back, in the order they were picked . Unlike the regular non-parametric bootstrap, in which the sample order does not make a difference, the moving block bootstrap changes the original chronological ordering of the time series. In the extreme case, where the block length $k = 1$, we can obtain the original sequence in reverse order when $(x_n, \dots, x_1)$ is the bootstrap sample. This seems counter-intuitive to me. Is there an intuitive explanation on why it is ok to mix up the ordering of the blocks?
