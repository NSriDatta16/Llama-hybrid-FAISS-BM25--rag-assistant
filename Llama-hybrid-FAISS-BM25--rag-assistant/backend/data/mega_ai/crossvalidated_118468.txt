PCA isn't the right tool here. If you want to show that the currencies have approximately the same pairwise distribution with respect to each other, just pick a few of the currency pairs and show that the graphs look similar by putting them next to each other. If you want to show that all the currencies have identical graphs, you might show that the distribution of all squared Pearson correlation coefficients between each pair of currencies is very narrow (low variance).
