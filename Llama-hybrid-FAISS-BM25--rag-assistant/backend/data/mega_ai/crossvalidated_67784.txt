This should probably go as a comment but I cannot add it there because of low reputation. However, I think it can also partly serve as an answer to the OP's question. As @NickCox alluded to, you should tackle this piecemeal. Read through the theory, work with a small number of variables and try to develop an intuitive sense of what is happening, although to develop this intuitive understanding will take some time, it will be worth it when you are trying to interpret the results of your principal component analysis. If you look at the link @NickCox suggested and scroll down to whuber's answer you will find a good geometric explanation for what eigenvectors and eigenvalues mean and will give you a visual feel of what you are looking at. I will add to that answer - if you collapse his ellipsoid into a two dimensional space i.e look at only the first two principal components, you will get an ellipse with one major and one minor axis. The major axis is the "direction" which explains most of the variance of your data. It is represented by the first eigenvector and its length is the first eigenvalue (when you arrange the eigenvalues in descending order). It is also the linear combination of all the variables in your dataset, more specifically it is that linear combination which most explains the variance in your data. Now, going back to your data you should look into textbooks on multivariate methods for methods of analyzing the covariance structure of your dataset. I am afraid I cannot point to anything specific but I think any intermediate level book would do. Additionally, I remember reading about applied principal component analysis from the book Statistical Methods in the Atmospheric Sciences by Daniel Wilks. If you get a hold of this book, you will find that it gives a good overview of the methodology in Chapter 11 (atmospheric scientists call PCA as Empirical Orthogonal Functions and it is the same thing). The author works with multi-variate data so it is structurally similar to what you have. Lastly, in addition to clustering and PCA you can also look into Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). It is also used in reducing the dimensionality of one's dataset but it looks at the relationship between pairs of data. I cannot say whether it would be applicable in your case.
