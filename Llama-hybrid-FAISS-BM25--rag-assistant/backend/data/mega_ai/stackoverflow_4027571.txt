Anybody tried taking advantage of the "Web Storage" in HTML 5 to store a shared key (passed during SSL-encrypted responses during authentication) that is used by javascript to alter the session cookie over time? That way, the stolen (unencrypted) session cookies would only be valid for a short amount of time. My guess is that Web Storage is segmented by port (in addition to host), so it wouldn't be possible. Just throwing that idea out there in case anybody wants to run with it.
