Taking into consideration your follow-up comments: If there are lots of zeros (i.e., a floor effect), the dependent variable will not be normally distributed. You may want to consider instead a logistic regression where you categorize responses as 0 or greater than 0. This depends on other theoretical considerations, but it seems to me like that's what you might be trying to do? You describe a between-subjects study (participants in condition A or B) where each participant is measured 240 times. You could fit a multilevel model that looks like: DV ~ Condition + (1|ID) Which means that the DV is predicted by Condition and a random intercept (i.e., intercepts are different for each participant). There are two levels in this dataset: Level 1 is the observation. Each participant's DV is measured 240 times at this level. Level 2 is the participant. Each participant has a value for the Condition (0 or 1). You say you want to get a different slope for each person, but that would mean you need some predictor at Level 1 , because the slope for condition can't change between people... because people aren't measured in both conditions.
