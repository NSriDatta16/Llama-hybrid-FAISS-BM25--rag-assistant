Is there a layered approach to Dependency Injection / Inversion of Control

DI/IOC: There are so many frameworks and the examples quickly get sticky with details particular to that framework. I find that I often learn a new technology best if I can learn its principles outside of a framework (the forest obscuring the trees). My question: What are the simple principles of DI/IOC? I am looking for a (framework agnostic) building approach that outlines what is gained, what the options are, what the costs are, for each simple principle. Please don't just paste links unless they actually address my question. I keep getting lost in those forests ;} Second question: Once I understand the core principles, would it be worth building my own simple framework? IE, would the insight gained be valuable relative to the effort expended? Thanks in advance! Robert
