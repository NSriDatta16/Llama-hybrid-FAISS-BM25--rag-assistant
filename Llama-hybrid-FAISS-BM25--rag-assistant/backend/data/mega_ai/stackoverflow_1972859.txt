This might not be the kind of answer you expected, but it might help you make your decision. Blizzard (WoW) uses XML to define UI. It's kinda like XAML in C#, just a lot less powerful and most addons just use XML to bootstrap the addon and then build UI in lua code. Also WoW actually stores addon "Saved Variables" in .lua files . In my opinion it doesn't mater that much. Choose something you like and which is easy to use for those who are going to extend your engine. The good thing about XML is that there are A LOT of tools and code already written to test, write and parse XML which means it could save you some time. For example XML Schema 's are very useful for validating user written files (security is just a side effect, the good thing is that if it passes your schema, the data is most likely 100% safe and ready to be plugged into your engine) and there quite a few validators already written for you to use. Then again some users are scared from XML files (even though they are very readable, maybe too readable) and would prefer something "simpler". If it's just for storage (not configuration) then no one is going to edit those file anyway in most cases. XML will also take more space then lua var dump (shouldn't matter, unless you have a lot data). I don't think you can go wrong here. Blizzard is using lua for storage and I quite like like how it works.
