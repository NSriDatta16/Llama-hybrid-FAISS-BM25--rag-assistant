How to use Word2Vec CBOW in statistical algorithm?

I have seen a few examples of using CBOW in neural network models (although I did not understand them). I know that Word2Vec is not similar to BOW or TFIDF, as there is no single value for CBOW and all examples I saw were used neural networks. I have 2 questions: 1: Can we convert the vector to a single value and put it in a dataframe so we can use it in logistic regression model? 2: Is there any simple code for CBOW usage with logistic regression?
