Well the three suggested databases are very different in their nature. SQLCE with Hibernate as RDBMS with a ORM, db4o as object database and RavenDB as document database. Each of them has its strengths. SQL CE & NHibernate-Combo The good: Extremely good support in tooling, the knowledge and a big community is there Easy to upgrage to MS SQL servers Extrem good reporting support The power of SQL The bad: Needs mapping The mapping between the OO and relational world is not easy and can lead to issues with complex models. RavenDB The good: Doesn't need any mapping Easy to use Powerful indexing JSON & HTTP access The bad: If your domain doesn't fit to a document-oriented approach, it will be quite painful It does not support the .NET Framework Client Profile (which is of particular importance as the OP's question is concerning embedded databases) db4o The good: Doesn't need any mapping Easy to use The storage model is close the object-model. This also works for very complex models. - The bad: Tooling support is weak. Afaik all three support LINQ and POCO-first approach. However since NHibernate & SQL CE still need tons of mapping its not as friction free as it could be. I think if your focus is on POCO first, LINQ-support, ebedded usage and easy to use, I would try RaveDB or db4o. If your focus is on 'safety', community-knowledge, tool-support and reporting I would go with NHibernate and SQL CE.
