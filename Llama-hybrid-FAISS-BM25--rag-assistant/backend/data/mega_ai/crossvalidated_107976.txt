If you have neither labels nor ranking examples, I don't know what you could do with your data other than clustering it based on similarity. The ranking function that you are supposed to learn can be a user's preferences (e.g. when I type "learning" in a search engine I prefer "machine learning" results rather than "e-learning"), a risk score for a bank (i.e. you would not be modeling the clients preferences, but the bank's), etc. That is, the set of possible rankings is $N!$, and there is not a universally good one. In ranking, you usually have some examples of ordered objects. The task is to learn a ranking function that can be: point-wise: you learn to score every item based on its attributes. The score is used for the final sort. pair-wise: you learn to sort in pairs. You have examples like $A \succ B$, and then your function learns to make pair-wise decisions. Since if you put all the pairs together, you will probably have inconsistencies (e.g. $A \succ B, B \succ C, C \succ A$ ) it is your task to create a final maximal consistent ranking from these pairs. list-wise: you try to learn a ranking function whose output will be a final list. Point-wise and pair-wise are the most common ones since it is easier to rank locally rather than all items at once (list-wise). The pointer to all this is "Learning to rank" (Information Retrieval) or "Preference Learning".
