To me, it would seem easier to collect data in a database. In a database, the information is organized, easily accessible, and can be manipulated easily. Also, if you need accessible to people remotely, allow other domains access to the database. Whereas in Git, you're stuck storing everything into flatfiles. It is your job to then parse all that information, and if you have a lot of information, this can take a long time. However, databases are usually pretty quick about returning the exact information you want.
