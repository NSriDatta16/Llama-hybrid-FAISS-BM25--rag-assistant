There's a couple issues here: 1) By combining the data across time you are losing power and also losing the temporality of the events: Did they purchase the books before or after they purchased the e-reader? It's not completely clear to me whether you have made this error. 2) If you do combine the events over time, and the event you are trying to model is "purchased an e-reader" then you want to use logistic regression, not linear regression. 3) I see no reason to dichotomize "purchased books" in last 12 months. Surely some people purchased 1 book and others purchased many. That ought to make a difference. 4) An even better tool for this analysis might be survival analysis, with "time to purchasing an e-reader" as the dependent variable and "books purchased" as the independent variable. Survival analysis allows for time-varying covariates (such as number of books purchased). 5) Finally, you probably should include other independent variables, if you have them. Things like sex, age, income.... These will matter and will help your analysis.
