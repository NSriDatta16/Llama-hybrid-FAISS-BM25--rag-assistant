Dragon Naturally Speaking fails on WPF sub menus

My WPF application menus fail to work with Dragon Natually Speaking, and hence I assume other screen readers and accessibility software. I want my software to work well for my blind and disabled customers. In order to figure out my mistake I also tried other WPF applications like Visual Studio 2010, and Expression Blend 4, but they have the SAME BUG. In all cases I can use voice to drop down a Main Menu HEADER like "File", "Edit", "Help" - BUT can NEVER activate the child menu items like "New", "Open", or "Close". I've read all I can on Accesibility and "UI Automation", I've tried running "UI Accessibility Checker" and 'Snoop', these applications also seem to enumerate my Menu HEADERS OK, but not the items on those menus. Why?
