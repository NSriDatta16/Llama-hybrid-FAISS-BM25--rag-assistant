Yes, bar() will be called before the destructor of foo. The standard says: 6.6: "On exit from a scope (however accomplished), destructors (12.4) are called for all constructed objects with automatic storage duration (3.7.2) (named objects or temporaries) that are declared in that scope, in the reverse order of their declaration." The scope isn't left until the return statement is completed.
