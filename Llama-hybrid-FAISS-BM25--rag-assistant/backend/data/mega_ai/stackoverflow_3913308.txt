Boost serialization is definitely a start, however there are other considerations such as Fragmentation - i.e. what happens if the "collection" of your objects cannot fit in to one packet, how do you know at the other end that you've received all the data that represents the "collection" Platforms - if you have a homogenous environment (say all linux), this is not an issue, but if you have a mixture, this could be a problem (I don't believe boost serialization works across different byte encodings - I could be wrong here, need to check docs) This applies to languages too (a point raised by Andy Johnson above) - with boost serialization, you're tied to C++. I would recommend that you look at one of the OS messaging products, and specifically if you want to send structures, something like Open DDS. All the serialization etc. is handled nicely for you, and you get lot's more features and functionality. Of course it's quite heavy weight, and slightly less performant than asio + serialization, but you have to do less work.
