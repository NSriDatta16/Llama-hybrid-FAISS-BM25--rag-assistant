Can I validly expand the odds ratio analogously to the relationship between relative risk & the incidence rate ratio?

I am involved in a nested Case-Control study that involves cohorts of cases and controls entering a program, with the outcome of failure by six months. Cases and controls are individually matched on month / year of entry. I have a lot (>10,000) of both. A primary risk factor of interest is receiving a medical diagnosis (psychiatric, musculoskeletal, respiratory) after entry and before 6 months. I have the person-time at risk for cases and controls to develop this risk factor, and can directly measure the incidence density of onset of risk factor in each cohort. Now, for background: The relative risk (RR) is defined as: $$ \frac{\left(\frac{N_\text{Cases exposed}}{N_\text{population exposed}}\right)}{\left(\frac{N_\text{cases unexposed}}{N_\text{population unexposed}}\right)}. $$ The incidence rate ratio (IRR) is defined as: $$ \frac{{\left(\frac{N_\text{Cases exposed}}{\text{Person-time exposed}}\right)}}{\left(\frac{N_\text{cases unexposed}}{\text{Person-time unexposed}}\right)}. $$ The odds ratio (OR) is defined as: $$ \frac{N_\text{cases exposed}*N_\text{controls unexposed}}{N_\text{controls exposed}*N_\text{cases unexposed}}. $$ Under the rare disease assumption the OR approximates the RR. My Questions: Can I validly expand on the odds ratio using person-time: $$ \frac{N_\text{cases exposed}*\text{Person-time unexposed}}{N_\text{controls exposed}*\text{Person-time exposed}} $$ to approximate the IRR? If not, why not, and what alternative would you suggest? If I can do this, would logistic regression would be appropriate? What other analytic approaches would you suggest?
