Team Foundation Server + Visual Studio 2008 Pro. A worthwhile combination?

Consider the use case of: Team Foundation Server (Workgroup edition?) Visual Studio 2008 10-15 developers ~10 SQL Server devs and admins (data warehousing/reporting) The needs are: replace Visual SourceSafe as the defacto version control system continue to use VS2008 Pro allow the SQL-focused users to leverage the TFS version control system without additional licensing continue using FogBugz Questions Would you consider Team Foundation Server a viable solution to the above scenario? Which tools (free/integrated) would you recommend to the various users? Are there licenses needed for each user in the version control system of TFS?
