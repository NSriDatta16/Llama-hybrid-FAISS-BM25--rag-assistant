How to compare fitted survival model with covariates vs. Kaplan-Meier?

How would one ideally compare fitted survival models with covariates vs. a Kaplan-Meier with a goal of getting an idea of whether the survival model describes the data well. E.g. in an example like this, you might get the impression that an intercept-only exponential model might be okay: set.seed(1234) sim % mutate(x = rweibull(n=100, shape=0.7, scale=exp(0.5+cov)), c = 2-seq(0, 1.98, 0.02), time = pmin(x,c), event= 1L*(x However, once there's covariates and esp. once they correlate with duration of follow-up (shift in population over time), it kind of feels like one ought to take that into account. Should I predict a survival curve for each patient and then average them, with each patient patient contributing until their censoring time?! I'm trying to figure this out and had not found the answer (perhaps looking in the wrong places?).
