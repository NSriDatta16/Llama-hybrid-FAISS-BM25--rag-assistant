If the issue is autocorrelated errors, $y = X\beta + u, u=\rho Wu + \epsilon$, then OLS is consistent but inefficient, as ACD says. It's like serial correlation in time series econometrics. But if there is spatial autodependence (also called autocorrelation, confusingly), $y = \rho W y+ X\beta + \epsilon$, then OLS is inconsistent. It's the same thing as a missing variable bias. If you have both issues, you need to use the Spatial Durbin Model, $y = \rho W y + X\beta + WX \lambda + \epsilon$. The spdep package for R contains numerous functions that compute spatial weights matrices, estimate spatial regressions, and do other things. I have a good deal of experience with the lagsarlm functions, but see in the package documentation that there is a sacsarlm function that seems to be more of what you are looking for. As far as the temporal aspect of your problem, the assumptions you make on dependence will go a long way to determining your model specification. Do your areas interact with each other directly? Examples of this are trade or housing markets; the exports from one country are highly dependent on the imports in another, and the sale price of recently bought houses is a very important contribution to the sale price of nearby houses. In this case, it makes sense to specify your weights matrix $W$ to accommodate this dependence. Allow a house purchased in time $t$ to be "neighbors" with houses in time $t-1$, but not with houses in time $t +1$. If your terms are correlated but not logically dependent on each other, such as agricultural yields, it would probably make more sense to have a single time-insensitive matrix $W$, but to include year dummies in the $X$ specification.
