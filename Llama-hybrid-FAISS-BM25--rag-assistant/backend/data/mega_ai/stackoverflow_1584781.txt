I was playing around your site page with Firebug. Can't really have a really elagant a quick solution for you except for this one: Setting the "div#Menu" to 100% and "div#Menu H1" to a height in percentage say 5%. You have "menu", "artists", "labels" and "formats" = 4 h1 items. That's 5 X 4 = 20%. Set "div#Menu ul" to 100-20 = 80%. Play around with the numbers and also adjust the vertical alignment, you should be good to go. The downside is, you will not have nice view in extremely small or large screens. My 2 cents.
