PC-Vector Autoregression (PC-VAR)

When using PC-VAR model for forecasting purposes, can we define it in the following manner? where a k-dimensional vector of intercepts is denoted by φ0 , Φ represents a k × k matrix of coefficients of the PCs and lagged terms of the response variable, and {αt} represents a sequence of serially uncorrelated random vectors with 0 mean and covariance matrix or vector of innovations. The dimension of the predictor variables is first reduced through PCA and then 3 PCs will be used to fit the model to forecast the response variable.
