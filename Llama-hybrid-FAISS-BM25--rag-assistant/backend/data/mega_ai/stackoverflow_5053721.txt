This is a requested feature for the public API. The developer comments hint at using the sendRawPdu from the internal SMSDispatcher API, which can be done via reflection . However, the use of private APIs for production code is highly discouraged It is not clear if it's possible to send using the public TelephonyManager API. /* * TODO(cleanup): It looks like there is now no useful reason why * apps should generate pdus themselves using these routines, * instead of handing the raw data to SMSDispatcher (and thereby * have the phone process do the encoding). Moreover, CDMA now * has shared state (in the form of the msgId system property) * which can only be modified by the phone process, and hence * makes the output of these routines incorrect. Since they now * serve no purpose, they should probably just return null * directly, and be deprecated. Going further in that direction, * the above parsers of serialized pdu data should probably also * be gotten rid of, hiding all but the necessarily visible * structured data from client apps. A possible concern with * doing this is that apps may be using these routines to generate * pdus that are then sent elsewhere, some network server, for * example, and that always returning null would thereby break * otherwise useful apps. */ /** * Get an SMS-SUBMIT PDU for a destination address and a message * * @param scAddress Service Centre address. Null means use default. * @return a SubmitPdu containing the encoded SC * address, if applicable, and the encoded message. * Returns null on encode error. * @hide */ public static SubmitPdu getSubmitPdu(String scAddress, String destinationAddress, String message, boolean statusReportRequested, byte[] header) { In conclusion: It's not clear if it's possible. I have the same question as you.
