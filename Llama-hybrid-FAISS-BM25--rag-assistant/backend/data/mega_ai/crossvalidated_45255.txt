The values for four variables a,b,c,d (which effect the rates of heart attacks/ strokes and amputation in hemodialysis patients ) is measured per month. So, I think that the time factor should be averaged to make the value observed in per month. For example , feature a for patient A will have 12 values for one year and 60 for 5 yrs, so, all the 60 values should be summed and divided by 60 which will give a resultant value x/month. The same procedure should be followed for other features as well. At last we will have 88 rows (patients) and 4 columns (features).
