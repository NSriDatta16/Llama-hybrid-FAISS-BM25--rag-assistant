Augmented Dickey Fuller and Nonlinear Time Series

Since the Augmented Dickey Fuller test assumes the time series to be an autoregressive-moving average model, I was wondering if it would be possible to explicitly construct a nonlinear time series that is stationary but that does not reject the null hypothesis of the ADF test. More precisely, is it possible to define a function $f:R^d \to R$ and a time series $(x_t)$ given by $x_{t+1} = f(x_{t-d+1},...,x_{t-d}) + \epsilon_t$ where $\epsilon_t$ is white noise such that $(x_t)$ is stationary and the ADF test does not reject $H_0$ ? Alternatively, is it possible to define a function $f$ and a time series $(x_t)$ as above, such that the time series is mean reverting and the ADF test does not reject $H_0$ ?
