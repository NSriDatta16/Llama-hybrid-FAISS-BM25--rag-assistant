The enabled binding has to get a BOOL value, and unfortunately won't just treat any old object as a boolean True. Fortunately, however, NSValueTransformer makes it easy to do so. There's a couple of constants named in the NSValueTransformer Class Reference which you can use in the bindings pane in IB. In your case, you can bind the Model Key Path to "selectedObjects" and enter "NSIsNotNil" in the Value Transformer field. The transformer gives the binding the BOOL value it needs.
