Using TF-IDF for feature extraction in Sentiment Analysis

I am working on sentiment analysis for twitter data, for which I have used Vader to get an approximation of sentiment for a tweet. Along with, I have used TF-IDF for feature extraction. These feature words I am using to train and test a Random Forest model. In my dataset, there are around 3K plus tweets from which I extracted around 570 unique feature words using TF-IDF. And all these features I have used for training the Random Forest Model. My query is in regards to the usage of this trained model in the real world. What if the new tweets which this model has never seen do not have feature words that I have used for training, will the model fail to make correct predictions for them (in my case there are only 3 possible predictions viz. positive, negative and neutral) correctly for them? If yes, then how should I handle this scenario? Please let me know in case I am missing something or doing something wrong here.
