How to use Apache HWPF to extract text and images out of a DOC file

I downloaded the Apache HWPF . I want to use it to read a doc file and write its text into a plain text file. I don't know the HWPF so well. My very simple program is here: I have 3 problems now: Some of packages have errors (they can't find apache hdf). How I can fix them? How I can use the methods of HWDF to find and extract the images out? Some piece of my program is incomplete and incorrect. So please help me to complete it. I have to complete this program in 2 days. once again I repeat Please Please help me to complete this. Thanks you Guys a lot for your help!!! This is my elementary code : public class test { public void m1 (){ String filesname = "Hello.doc"; POIFSFileSystem fs = null; fs = new POIFSFileSystem(new FileInputStream(filesname ); HWPFDocument doc = new HWPFDocument(fs); WordExtractor we = new WordExtractor(doc); String str = we.getText() ; String[] paragraphs = we.getParagraphText(); Picture pic = new Picture(. . .) ; pic.writeImageContent( . . . ) ; PicturesTable picTable = new PicturesTable( . . . ) ; if ( picTable.hasPicture( . . . ) ){ picTable.extractPicture(..., ...); picTable.getAllPictures() ; } }
