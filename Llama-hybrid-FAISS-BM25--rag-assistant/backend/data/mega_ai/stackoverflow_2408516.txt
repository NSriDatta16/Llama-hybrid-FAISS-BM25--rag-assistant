The DMS Software Reengineering Toolkit has a full PHP parser which does syntax checks. That's a big system if all you want is syntax checking. One way to get "just" the syntax checking part of DMS is the SD PHP Formatter . This tool formats PHP code nicely. To do so, it parses it first (there's the syntax check) and then prettyprints it according to the structures implied by the PHP language rules. Of course, you could just ignore the formatted result and simply look for parsing errors. If you like the test coverage idea, you should consider the SD PHP Test Coverage tool. This packages DMS to parse your source code, fill it with instrumentation to determine what gets executed when you run. It obviously has the syntax check still built in, as well as providing the test coverage ability.
