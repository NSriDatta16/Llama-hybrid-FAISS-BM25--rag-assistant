For me it only worked when the certificate and both keys were in the Login keychain. I had created a Development keychain before, but the Xcode Organizer wouldn't find the keys in there. So I moved them back to Login , quit the keychain tool - and voila, the error in Xcode Organizer went away! This was on Snow Leopard 10.6.2 with the 3.1.3 SDK.
