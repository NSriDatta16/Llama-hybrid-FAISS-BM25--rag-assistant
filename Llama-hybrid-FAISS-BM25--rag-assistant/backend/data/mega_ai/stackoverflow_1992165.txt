CMD: Check for quotes

Let's say, the user drag and drops an file into my batch file, which causes that the batch file copies the file to a certain directory. the problem is the following command: copy "%1" "C:\path\to\it" The problem here is the quotes around %1 . When you drag and drop something in a batch file, normally, it wouldn't put quotes, so everything's fine. But when i convert my batch file to EXE, it actually puts quotes there. So, what i want to do is, checking if the file does have quotes, if not, than do the command above, otherwise, do the command without quotes. Thanks.
