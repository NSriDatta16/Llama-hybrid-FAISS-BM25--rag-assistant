Is there a limit on an Excel worksheet's name length?

When I try to set a longish worksheet name using ruby and win32ole with the following code: require "win32ole" excel = WIN32OLE.new('Excel.Application') excel.Visible = 1 puts excel.version workbook = excel.Workbooks.Add worksheet1 = workbook.Worksheets.Add worksheet1.Name = "Pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism" #Length 30, fine worksheet2 = workbook.Worksheets.Add worksheet2.Name = "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" #Length 34, not fine I get the following: 12.0 -:9:in `method_missing': (in setting property `Name': ) (WIN32OLERuntimeError) OLE error code:800A03EC in Microsoft Office Excel You typed an invalid name for a sheet or chart. Make sure that: The name that you type does not exceed 31 characters. The name does not contain any of the following characters: : \ / ? * [ or ] You did not leave the name blank. HRESULT error code:0x80020009 Exception occurred. from -:9:in ` ' The version 12.0 indicates that I'm running Excel 2007, but it's complaining that the worksheet name is too long. I had a look at Excel 2007 specifications and limits as mentioned in this related answer , and I couldn't find it mentioning any such limit. (Trying to rename a worksheet manually suggests there may be such a limit, however) Is there a limit, and is it a hard limit or one that can be changed by changing the configuration of Excel?
