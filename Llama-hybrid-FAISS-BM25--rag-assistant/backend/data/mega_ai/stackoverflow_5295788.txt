The *WithCapacity methods that we see on NSString , NSArray , etc, have nothing to do with pre-populating the contents of the object. They are simply a means by which you can suggest to the object how much it's going to hold. If you suggest a large enough number, it may use a different storage mechanism than if it were a small number. So in other words, you could do [NSMutableString stringWithCapacity:1234567890] and it give you exactly the same thing as if you had simply done [NSMutableString string] , and the -length of the resulting object will always be 0. Frankly, the *WithCapacity methods are pretty useless. I've never found a reason to use them.
