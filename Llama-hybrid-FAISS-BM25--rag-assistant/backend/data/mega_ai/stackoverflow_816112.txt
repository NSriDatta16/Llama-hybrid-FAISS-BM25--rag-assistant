DB Design: Sort Order for Lookup Tables

I have an application where the database back-end has around 15 lookup tables. For instance there is a table for Counties like this: CountyID(PK) County 49001 Beaver 49005 Cache 49007 Carbon 49009 Daggett 49011 Davis 49015 Emery 49029 Morgan 49031 Piute 49033 Rich 49035 Salt Lake 49037 San Juan 49041 Sevier 49043 Summit 49045 Tooele 49049 Utah 49051 Wasatch 49057 Weber The UI for this app has a number of combo boxes in various places for these lookup tables, and my client has asked that the boxes list in this case: CountyID(PK) County 49035 Salt Lake 49049 Utah 49011 Davis 49057 Weber 49045 Tooele 'The Rest Alphabetically The best plan I have for accomplishing this is to add a column to each lookup table for SortOrder(numeric). I had a colleague tell me he thought that would cause the tables to violate 3rd-Normal-Form, but I think the sort order still depends on the key and only the key (even though the rest of the list is alphabetical). Is adding the SortOrder column the best way to do this, or is there a better way I am just not seeing?
