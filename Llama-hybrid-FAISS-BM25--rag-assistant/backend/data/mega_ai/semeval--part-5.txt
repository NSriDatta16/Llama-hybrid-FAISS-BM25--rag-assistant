first evaluation exercise on word sense disambiguation systems; the lexical-sample task was evaluated on English, French and Italian Senseval-2 – evaluated word sense disambiguation systems on three types of tasks (the all-words, lexical-sample and the translation task) Senseval-3 – included tasks for word sense disambiguation, as well as identification of semantic roles, multilingual annotations, logic forms, subcategorization acquisition. SemEval-2007 – included tasks which were more elaborate than Senseval as it crosses the different areas of studies in Natural Language Processing SemEval-2010 – added tasks that were from new areas of studies in computational semantics, viz., Coreference, Ellipsis, Keyphrase Extraction, Noun Compounds and Textual Entailment. SemEval-2012 – co-located with the first *SEM conference and the Semantic Similarity Task was being promoted as the *Sem Shared Task SemEval-2013 – SemEval moved from 2–3 years cycle to an annual workshop SemEval-2014 – the first time SemEval is located in a non-ACL event in COLING SemEval-2015 – the first SemEval with tasks categorized into various tracks SemEval-2016 – the second SemEval without a WSD task (the first was in SemEval-2012) *SEM – conference for SemEval-related papers other than task systems.
