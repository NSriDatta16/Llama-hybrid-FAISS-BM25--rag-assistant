It is probably an error by the question author, but the actual question is, "Why is it more costly to discover a defect later in the process" Within that question is the cost to discover the bug and we can hope it also means to fix it. Most of the answers do a good job at describing the cost to fix and why it is better to fix early versus fix later. And, I really don't disagree with any of them. But, that isn't the whole question. I have a regular series of esoteric arguments with some about the discovery cost. How much testing would have been required to find a specific bug (without hindsight). Would it have take 3 man-months more of automated or manual testing before you would have been likely to find that test case and scenario ? In practice, test as much as you can but finding that balance point isn't as easy as many would have you think. Most programs are too big to have 100% code coverage. And, 100% code coverage is usually just a fraction of all the possible scenarios the code must handle. Another factor that comes into the cost of a bug is the business cost associated with the bug. Are there 5 million boxes out there holding the bug ? Would you have to do a product recall ? Will it generate X calls to your warranty help desk ? Will it trigger some clause in a contract holding you liable for damages. In very simple terms, this is why software written in the medical field costs more per LOC than those for website development.
