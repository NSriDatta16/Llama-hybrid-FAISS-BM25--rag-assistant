Very simple real-valued time-series dataset for RNN prototyping

Is there a simple real-valued time-series dataset on which a vanilla RNN model can be trained. With "very simple" I mean only two to four real-valued inputs per time step and a single real-valued output per time-step. Background: I am doing research in the intersection of machine learning and formal methods. To test a new technique for formally verifying RNNs, we need to start with a quite simple setup. Thanks!
