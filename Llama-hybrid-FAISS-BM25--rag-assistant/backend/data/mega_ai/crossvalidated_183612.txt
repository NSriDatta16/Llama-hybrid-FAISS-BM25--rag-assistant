A statistical conundrum. Combining two distributions

I have a statistical problem in a domain that I can not talk about due to an NDA. However, I have worked out how to describe an exactly analogous problem as follows. You are in charge of record keeping at a factory that makes girders. Your job is to measure the strength of every girder that comes out of a factory. You have kept a record of tens of thousands of girders over many years and have noticed that the strengths (in whatever units) follow a normal distribution with a certain mean and standard deviation. You also notice that every girder has the name of the worker that made it stamped on one end. There have been several tens of workers names you've noticed over the years. So far you have never done any statistical tests to see whether the strength of the beams has any correlation with the worker that made it. Indeed it may be possible that any variation in strength is entirely due to variations in the raw materials and nothing to do with the worker at all... you never checked. Indeed you have no idea how the girder is made. Its a secret process the factory owners don't want to tell you. Now you recently noticed that a new name appeared on the end of a handful of girders, say it's "Fred". You measure their strengths and find they appear stronger than average, but the sample size is small. The question I have now is "What is the likely strength of Fred's next girder?" Presumably it must be some combination of the two distributions. The large overall distribution combined somehow with the small sized distribution... and presumably the weighting given to the smaller distribution should be determined by the degree of correlation between the choice of worker and the girder strength (which we don't know yet - but presumably we can do some test to find out). So I know the gist of what the answer might look like, but I don't know exactly how to do the math. Can anyone either tell me the answer, or point me to some resource that solves an analogous problem? EDIT: I thought of a kind of very inelegant, botched, solution that I shall describe below to suggest that an answer must be possible: Let us assume that the answer is a combination of the small "Fred" distribution (size f) and the much larger overall distribution (size N). Say that we invent a weighting factor K which expresses how much attention we pay to Fred's small distribution as opposed to the overall distribution... something like: Strength of Fred's next comes from a combined distribution of K x Fred's distribution + (1-K) x overall distribution. Then we can do an experiment where for each other worker w we select f girders at random, and derive a small distribution. Then we note the mean and standard deviation of that small distribution. Then we select one new randomly chosen girder from the rest of that worker's production (analogous to choosing Fred's next girder) and note its strength Sw. Then we ask the question "what value of K" would result in the combined distribution most likely to produce Sw for each worker... armed with this K, we can now solve our original question. I think this proves that there is a solution. Now I just want a more elegant one.
