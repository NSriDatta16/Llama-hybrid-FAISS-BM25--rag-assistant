What are the main methods for estimating the Average Treatment Effect in Observational Studies outside of matching?

I am wondering what the main methods for estimating the Average Treatment Effect in Observational Studies are outside of matching. In matching, there are weighting, stratification, propensity score methods, etc. However, are there techniques outside of this? Or are they all based on same way on matching?
