It is guaranteed by the C++ Standard 23.2.2/1: A list is a kind of sequence that supports bidirectional iterators and allows constant time insert and erase operations anywhere within the sequence , with storage management handled automatically. Unlike vectors (23.2.4) and deques (23.2.1), fast random access to list elements is not supported, but many algorithms only need sequential access anyway.
