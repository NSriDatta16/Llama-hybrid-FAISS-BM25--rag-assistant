A mixed-effects model for repeated measurements vs multiple time point-wise comparisons with a simpler test

I have a pretty standard situation of a study in which repeated measurements are taken from the same individuals. There are two factors: "Group" (with 25 individuals in each of two groups) and "Day" (time is treated here as a categorical variable). To keep things simple, let's consider only two time points, Day 1 and Day 2. When working in R, the data would look as follows (ID - subjects' IDs; Group - labels for the groups; Day - factor indicating the day of sampling, with 2 levels; BW - body weight, kg): dat ID Group Day BW 1 ID1 A Day 1 2333.231 2 ID2 A Day 1 2615.744 3 ID3 A Day 1 2282.484 4 ID4 A Day 1 2796.806 5 ID5 A Day 1 2262.759 6 ID6 A Day 1 2520.216 7 ID7 A Day 1 2606.598 8 ID8 A Day 1 2617.347 9 ID9 A Day 1 2439.651 10 ID10 A Day 1 2515.900 11 ID11 B Day 1 2692.253 12 ID12 B Day 1 2208.707 13 ID13 B Day 1 2343.652 14 ID14 B Day 1 2564.080 15 ID15 B Day 1 2411.044 16 ID16 B Day 1 2774.001 17 ID17 B Day 1 2634.651 18 ID18 B Day 1 2514.433 19 ID19 B Day 1 2198.449 20 ID20 B Day 1 2505.220 21 ID1 A Day 2 2314.214 22 ID2 A Day 2 2302.396 23 ID3 A Day 2 2319.029 24 ID4 A Day 2 2533.612 25 ID5 A Day 2 2290.300 26 ID6 A Day 2 2168.727 27 ID7 A Day 2 2466.597 28 ID8 A Day 2 2223.379 29 ID9 A Day 2 2441.762 30 ID10 A Day 2 2288.917 31 ID11 B Day 2 1984.846 32 ID12 B Day 2 2702.819 33 ID13 B Day 2 2793.834 34 ID14 B Day 2 2563.337 35 ID15 B Day 2 2666.664 36 ID16 B Day 2 2399.159 37 ID17 B Day 2 2586.255 38 ID18 B Day 2 2193.912 39 ID19 B Day 2 2797.592 40 ID20 B Day 2 3043.074 Here is a graphical representation of these data (data points coming from the same subject are connected with dashed lines to make it easier to understand the structure of this dataset): In order to test the effects of Group and Day, I could fit a mixed-effects model using e.g. the nlme package for R: # Fit the model: M Thus, according to the fitted mixed-effects model (which was adequate for these data - diagnostics were run but are not presented here), neither of the examined factors (Day and Group) are affecting the response variable; also, there is no interaction between the two factors. This is the type of analysis that I would do for such a dataset if I were asked to. However, in my organisation many people have no idea about the mixed-effects models. What they would typically do is applying a bunch of t-tests (or similar tests) to detect the effect of the "Group" on each of the sampling dates. For example, for the data shown above one would conduct a t-test for Day 1 and another t-test for Day 2, getting the following results: Day 1: P = 0.271 Day 2: P Thus, they would claim that there was a significant Group effect on Day 2. I tried to explain that this result would not be correct because of the presence of correlation in data, which originates from the repeated measurements made on the same subjects. However, a colleague of mine asked a question that I could not answer easily. He said: "Ok, the observations are correlated, I get that. But for now, forget about the fact that we have data from Day 1 and suppose that there are data only from Day 2. Observations in Group A and Group B are independent from each other, and so we are allowed to apply to a t-test or something similar. When we do apply a t-test [ as shown above ], we get a significant Group effect. How should we then treat this result?" And this is exactly the point were I got stuck. Indeed, if one has only the information from Day 2 and does a simple t-test, one gets a very different (and, in principle, justified) conclusion than the one obtained with the mixed effects model. Which method of analysis is to trust then? Is the Group effect real? I feel like I am missing some important piece for justification of the use of mixed model. Any hint would be highly appreciated.
