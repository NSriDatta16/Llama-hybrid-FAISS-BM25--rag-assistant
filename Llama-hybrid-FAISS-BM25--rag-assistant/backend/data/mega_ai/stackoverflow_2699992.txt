Okay, it's not elegant at all. So I don't encourage using this and will look for a better way down the line. But here's the solution I've got that works with the examples above and below. Unfortunately, the way I want it to be, the array HAS to contain a preceding 'ordering' number so, I suppose it's a fail on my part from the very beginning. But it works now. $TempDescArray = array(); $TempFieldArray = array(); $TempTableArray = array(); $Pointer = 0; foreach ($Fields as $Table => $FieldsArray) { foreach ($FieldsArray as $Field => $Description) { $TempDescArray[$Pointer] = $Description; $TempFieldArray[$Pointer] = $Field; $TempTableArray[$Pointer] = $Table; $Pointer++; } } asort($TempDescArray); $Fields = array(); $Pointer2 = 0; foreach ($TempDescArray as $Pointer => $Description) { $Fields[$Pointer2][$TempTableArray[$Pointer]][$TempFieldArray[$Pointer]] = $Description; $Pointer2++; }
