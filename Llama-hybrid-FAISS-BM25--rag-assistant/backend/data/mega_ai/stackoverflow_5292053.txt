jQuery UI dialog - grab text from table DIV and show - only happens on first click

I'm trying to get some text in a table cell into a jQuery UI dialog dynamically, firing from a link in the table (one for each row). It works for each link once, but thereafter it stops. Here's my Javascript: $(function() { $( ".abstractlink" ).click(function() { $( $(this).parent().find('.abstract') ).dialog({ modal: true, autoOpen: true, height: "auto", width: "600", draggable: "true", title: "Project abstract", resizable: "false" }); }); }); The problem is (I think) that I'm re-initialising the dialog each time a link is clicked. Trouble is, I need to change the DIV which is to be displayed each time a link is clicked (hence finding the element with the class 'abstract' in the parent (TR) element. Here's the relevant part of the table's code: View Project 3 abstract. Lorem ipsum. I have a strong feeling that this isn't a very elegant way of solving this problem, but as I'm still new to jQuery I am so I was glad I got this far. Any suggestions much appreciated!
