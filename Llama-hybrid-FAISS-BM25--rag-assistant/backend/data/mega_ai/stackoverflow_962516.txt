I was going to bitch and moan about Java, but obviously it isn't THAT bad and that would have amounted to trolling, and besides, I just remembered something far worse: Magic II. It just barely qualified as a language. Really, it could be more accurately described as a pre-SQL database system with a data driven programming model. It was based on the astute observation that almost everything you ever do with database tables involves doing something before you start iterating on the data, then iterating on the data, and then maybe doing something after you're done. "Programming" Magic involves filling in fields in tables that describe those three phases of a program's life. It also had a text mode screen designer that tied in with this whole mess. A trained Magic user could knock out reports and data entry screens at a reasonably fast pace, which made management happy. The problem for me was that the language had very minimal abstraction facilities. You could define routines that you could call from other routines. That's it. No data structures other than database tables, no in-memory arrays (you could define new tables, though!) No hash tables, no way to organize variables (which the language did support) in any meaningful way. No lists. Nothing. Of course, no classes or anything resembling an object model, but honestly - I could live without that. And I did. Worse yet, the "program" had bits and pieces that were hidden away in fields that you had to zoom into to be able to see - certain expressions, etc. So you could never just read a screen of code and know what it did. This thing took data driven programming to its ultimate, sad apex. It's an obsession, manifested in a programming tool. I was glad to put that miserable piece of junk behind me. Recently, I met a former co-worker who worked with me while I was using Magic. It's been almost 20 years since I've done that, but she was all too happy to tell me how she was tasked with maintaining one of my projects, and that she declared defeat when she found a recursive procedure in there somewhere. She had never seen anyone implement recursion in Magic. No one ever has. It was uncharted territory. I don't think anyone realized the tool was capable of recursion. The project had to be rewritten in a hurry, before it caused someone's brain to explode.
