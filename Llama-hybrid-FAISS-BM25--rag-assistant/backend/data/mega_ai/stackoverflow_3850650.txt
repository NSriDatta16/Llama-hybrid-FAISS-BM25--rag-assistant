Spring application ant build fails

I am very new to java and spring. I was trying out my first ever application in spring. I followed this tutorial http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/tutorials/os-ag-springframe2/section6.html I am unable to build using ant. I get this error when I try to build. deepak@deepak-laptop:~/geronimo-tomcat7-javaee6-3.0-M1/workspace/phonebook$ ant dist Buildfile: build.xml does not exist! Build failed There is no where in that tutorial the author has mentioned to create build.xml file. As a new bie I guess 'build.xml' is a file which ant generates. Help me get through this step. Thanks in advance.
