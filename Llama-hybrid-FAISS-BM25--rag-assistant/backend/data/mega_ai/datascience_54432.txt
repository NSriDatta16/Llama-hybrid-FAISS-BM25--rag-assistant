Inferring latent variable distribution from binary data

I want to create a model to infer the behavior of a latent variable. As an example, let's assume the latent variable represents the level of extro/introversion of a person. The level of extro/introversion can be represented with some continuous distribution and can assume values in [0,1]. I have a binary training set of facial images of people who are either: Extreme introverts (for which y=0) Extreme extroverts (for which y=1) Is there a way to model the original distribution (which is continuous, and not binary as the training set)? Obvious solutions worked poorly: I have tried training a CNN; a CNN with sigmoid activation for one output neuron + binary crossentropy, modeling this as a classification problem, and it worked very well distinguishing between the two classes, however, when evaluated on people who are somewhere in the middle of the intro/extroversion spectrum (y=~0.5), it performed poorly, assigning levels which are either close to 1 or 0. I have also tried creating a regression based network, with output neuron with linear activation and MSE as a loss function, getting the same performance.
