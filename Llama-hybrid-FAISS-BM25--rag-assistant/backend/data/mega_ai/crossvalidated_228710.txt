I'm very confused by your description, but here are some remarks that will hopefully be helpful. If you only apply exactly one predicate to each ball, as in the example in your first paragraph, then you have no information about how the predicates are related to each other. You can estimate the univariate distribution of each predicate's values across all the balls, but not the bivariate distribution, which is what you seem interested in. At at even simpler level, if we get A_(true) = 100, B_(true) = 100, chances are 100% that the underlying population is homogeneous (i.e. of a single type). I disagree. It seems quite possible, in your scenario, for any number of the 100 balls not tested with A to be false on A, and similarly for B. But how does one compute the confidence of this statement? Careful with your terminology. "Confidence" is a term from frequentist statistics, where we don't attach probabilities to hypotheses about populations.
