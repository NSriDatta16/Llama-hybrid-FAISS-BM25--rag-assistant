There are three (maybe more :-) ways of linking a library in Visual C++. You can explicitly include .lib file in the project by doing Add Existing Item and pointing to the lib file. That way you don't need to specify the path. You can add a file in Options/Linker/Input and specify path in Additional Library Directories. And finally, you can use #pragma comment( lib, "my.lib") and specify the path as before. I'm not sure, but I think the above pragma also allows to put the full path as well.
