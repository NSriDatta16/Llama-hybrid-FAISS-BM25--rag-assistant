How can I add a static Image Logo to a generated PDF using the SQL Server Reporting Tools Designer?

Using the Report designer in Visual Studio, I dragged and dropped a an Image control over onto the header but I'm lost as to what to do next. I need to choose the Source which gives me a choice between External , Embedded , Database and custom expression. I also have a Value property but it didn't prompt me to choose a file. Any ideas?
