Can you move an independent variable to the dependent side of the model?

Consider a biochemical reaction f(x1, x2, x3,…), where x1 is substrate and x2, x3, etc… are relevant process variables such as temperature, pH, etc…, and f(x1,x2,x3,…) is the product of the reaction. In any statistical model of f(x1, x2, x3,…) you will find that x1 (substrate) is the most important variable for determining product of the process, by far. This makes sense that the product of a biochemical reaction is primarily driven my the “food” available to the biological organisms. People in my industry are very interested in yield, defined as product/substrate, and they frequent generate models of the type f(x1, x2, x3,…)/x1 = g(x2,x3,…). Something feels fundamentally wrong with this. To me it is treating x1 (substrate) as a dependent variable that is itself a function of x2,x3, …. Is this approach legitimate? Please help me understand why or why not.
