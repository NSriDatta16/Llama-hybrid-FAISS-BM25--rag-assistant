You could try some Monkey script for wrapping selected text (but that was for Eclipse 3.2 or 3.3 with Eclipse Monkey , not sure about a current Helios Eclipse). You can check if this TeXlipse plugin would still be compatible with an Eclipse 3.5 or 3.6, but it is a Latex Mode Editor plugin only... But other than those attempts to bring wrapping to the Eclipse Editor world, no, so far no luck. The famous bug 35779 presents all the gory details of the wrapping affair and Eclipse. There was a project back in 2006 to introduce true wrapping . But its only conclusion was... that is wasn't so easy: see his comment#75 . senarvi comments below: TeXlipse seems to be relatively well maintained and available for the newest Eclipse (4.2). It allows reformatting a paragraph by pressing Esc + Q or selecting Latex > Correct Line Wrap . Bug 35779 is about the kind of word wrap mode that splits long lines in the editor window but leaves the physical lines intact, which is a different thing.
