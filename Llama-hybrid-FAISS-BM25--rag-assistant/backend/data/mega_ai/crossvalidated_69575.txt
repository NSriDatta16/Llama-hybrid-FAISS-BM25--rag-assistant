Relationship between the range and the standard deviation

In an article I found the formula for the standard deviation of a sample size $N$ $\sigma=\frac{\overline{R}}{2.534}$ where $\overline{R}$ is the average range of subsamples (size $6$) from the main sample. How the number $2.534$ is calculated? This is the correct number?
