Overlaying Html Content on top of Silverlight App

I have a silverlight application that I am embedding in an existing ASP.NET web application. The web application has several drop-down navigation menus that would normally cover part of the silverlight app. I am aware of embedding the app using "windowless" mode, and if I do so the HTML menus show up on top of the silverlight plugin and everything looks great. The problem is that I do not want to run in windowless mode due to its limitations. The application needs to handle MouseWheel events, which are not available natively in windowless mode. I am also not happy with the performance drawbacks of running in windowless mode. If I set windowless mode to false, the silverlight plugin is always rendered on top of the navigation menus which drop down behind it. Is there any kind of CSS/JavaScript/Z-Index hackery that can be done to force certain divs of HTML on my page to render on top of the silverlight app WITHOUT running in windowless mode? I don't have high hopes as I understand this scenario is one of the main reasons for running in windowless mode, but I figured I'd ask and see if there are any workaround ideas.
