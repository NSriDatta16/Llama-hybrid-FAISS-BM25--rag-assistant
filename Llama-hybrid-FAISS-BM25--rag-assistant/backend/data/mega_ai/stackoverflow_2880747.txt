We used Doctrine on two projects last year with MySql. I think it's about as good as a O/R mapper can get on PHP. DQL is actually quite well thought out, and you rarely (if ever) need to touch the DB. While the two projects were not "big," they did sustain high-traffic bursts for weeks at a time, including lots of DB access. Doctrine was never a problem. Compared to ZendDB, Doctrine -- being a standalone project -- gets much better attention, its own Blog and training courses, etc. With Zend, it always feels like a subproject.
