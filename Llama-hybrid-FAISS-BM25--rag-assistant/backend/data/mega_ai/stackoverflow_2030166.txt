There is no easy answer to this. SSIS' Flat File data source does not handle anything but the simplest formats. I've used the flat file task to read in ragged right or reccord typed flat files as one big column. I'd then run it through a script task to handle the parsing. Sorry there is no easier answer than that... you'd think there would be.
