The easiest way to do this is to 1) create the shortcut and 2) drag it. I don't do much managed code at all so I can't say if there is any built-in support for the IShellLink object. If not, somebody has probably already done the work and built a wrapper. So you could create the ShellLink object and fill it in with the path to your application, parameters, etc. and save it somewhere (perhaps the temp folder). Then you would initiate the drag operation with something like this: private void Form1_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if ((e.Button & MouseButtons.Left) == MouseButtons.Left) { // left mouse button clicked; begin drag // create data object with FileDrop format (list of files to be dropped) DataObject data = new DataObject(); System.Collections.Specialized.StringCollection paths = new System.Collections.Specialized.StringCollection(); paths.Add(@" \My New Shortcut.lnk"); data.SetFileDropList(paths); // begin the drag, indicating it is a copy operation DragDropEffects effect = DoDragDrop(data, DragDropEffects.Copy); } } Then when the user drops it (e.g. on their desktop) it will copy the shortcut file from the temp folder.
