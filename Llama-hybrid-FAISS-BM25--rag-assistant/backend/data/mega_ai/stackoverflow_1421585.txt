Here are some "advantages" to never releasing memory back to the system: Having already used a lot of memory makes it very likely you will do so again, and when you release memory the OS has to do quite a bit of paperwork when you need it again, your memory allocator has to re-initialise all its data structures in the region it just received Freed memory that isn't needed gets paged out to disk where it doesn't actually make that much difference Often, even if you free 90% of your memory, fragmentation means that very few pages can actually be released, so the effort required to look for empty pages isn't terribly well spent
