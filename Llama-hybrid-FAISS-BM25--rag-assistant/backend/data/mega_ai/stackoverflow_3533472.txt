Magento Ajax cart - the correct way

I have created an Ajax cart in magento although it is a little hacky. It's not in a module or that. All I'm doing is using a script in the root of app that initialise mage and works with it. What would be the correct way in implementing this? Ie how can I get my Ajax calls to interact wiu magento through a my module?
