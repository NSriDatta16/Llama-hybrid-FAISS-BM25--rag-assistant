To find the marginal distribution of X, think about finding the probability that X can take on different discrete values, conditioning on Y. pr(x = 0) = pr(x = 0 | y = 0) + pr(x = 0 | y = 1) + ... + pr(x = 0 | y = 3) = 0.13 pr(x = 1) = pr(x = 1 | y = 0) + pr(x = 1 | y = 1) + ... + pr(x = 1 | y = 3) = 0.45 etc... To find the expected value of X, simply think about summing up the discrete values that X can take on, weighting each value by the probability of it occurring (using the previously calculated marginal distribution). E[x] = X1*Pr(X = X1) + ... + Xn*Pr(X = Xn) To find the variance of X, think about the average deviation of each observation. Since we don't actually have actual observations, we can think about how often we would expect each kind of discrete X value to appear by weighting each outcome with its associated probability of happening. Now think about the deviation of these expectations from average. Given the expected value of Y and the variance of Y, we can calculate the co-variance of X and Y using the following formula: E[XY] - E[X]*E[Y]. We already know E[X] and E[Y]. To calculate E[XY] we can simply use an expectations formula. E[XY] = XiYi * pr(X = Xi & Pr Y = Yi) + .... = (0)(0)(0.01) + (0)(1)(0.07) + (0)(2)(0.05) + (0)(3)(0.00) + ... To find the expectation of P, E[P], we can take the expectation of both sides of the equation. P = 6X + 8Y - 5 E[P] = E[6X + 8Y - 5] The expectation of sums is equal to the sum of expectations using the property of Linearity. E[P] = E[6X] + E[8Y] - E[5] The expectation of a constant is the constant itself, since a constant is non-random. E[P] = 6*E[X] + 8*E[Y] - 5 To find the standard deviation of P, think about how we calculated the variance of X earlier. The standard deviation of a variable is identical to the square root of the variance of that same variable.
