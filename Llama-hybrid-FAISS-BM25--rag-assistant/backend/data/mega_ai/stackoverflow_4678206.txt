remote debugging a jnlp application with IntelliJ

I'm trying to debug a web start application using IntelliJ 10 (running on Win7). I read both SO: remote debugging a jnlp application with eclipse How can I debug applications under Java Web Start (JNLP) ? It seems like I'm missing something. I've tried to run it from command line, or adding the arguments into the jnlp file but no matter what I do I get an Unable to open debugger port : java.net.ConnectException "Connection refused: connect" Error. How can I debug a web start app?
