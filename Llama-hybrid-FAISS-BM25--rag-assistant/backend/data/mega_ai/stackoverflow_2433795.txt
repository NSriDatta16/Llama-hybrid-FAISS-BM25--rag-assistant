As other commenters have pointed out, you don't display exactly how you are linking people and colors. If you are using a linking table (person_id, color_id) then there is no way to solve this problem in standard SQL since it requires a pivot or cross-tabulation, which is not part of standard SQL. If you are willing to add the condition that the number of colors is limited and known and design time, you could come up with a solution using one join for each color and CASE or IF functions in the SQL. But that would not be elegant and, furthermore, I wouldn't trust that condition to stay true for very long. If you are able to come up with a different way of storing the color linking information you might have more options for producing the output you want, but a different storage technique implies some degree of denormalization of the database which could well cause other difficulties. Otherwise, you will have to do this in a stored procedure or application code.
