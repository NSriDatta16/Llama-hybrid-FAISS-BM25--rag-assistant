I think of "true"/"TRUE" and "false"/"FALSE" as syntactic sugar, a solution to a problem that never existed. I've always thought it easier to both use and read "1" and "0". When you think about flags in registers being on or off, do you think in 1s and 0s or trues and falses? What happens if you want to store several flags in a single variable? 1s and 0s are universal. I think the word "false" is too long for its own good. When I see a "0", it stands out in my mind like a red stop sign. Stop signs are red because the color red gets people's attention. Reading the word "false" is like seeing a green stop sign. So, to hell with bool and BOOL. I default to int. ...but, really, getting boolean flags right is the least worry in a language with as many ways to make a mistake as C++.
