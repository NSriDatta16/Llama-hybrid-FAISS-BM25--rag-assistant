If you click inside your flash movie and drag the mouse outside of it, MOUSE_MOVE event will continue to trigger until you release your mouse. MOUSE_LEAVE will trigger only when you release the mouse outside the player. This is how Flash Player works. Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think you can change this behaviour.
