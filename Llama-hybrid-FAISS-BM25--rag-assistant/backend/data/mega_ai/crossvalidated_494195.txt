Markov Chain Limit Proof

First, sorry for my bad english. I am having trouble proving this exercise (it came from some notes I had back in university, I am studying for my masters next year). Let $X$ be an aperiodic irreducible Markov chain on finite state space $S$ . Let $\pi$ be stationary measure. Assume $X$ started at $\pi$ . Let $a,b \in S$ . Show that: $\lim_{n \to \infty} \mathbb{P}(X_0=a, X_n=b) = \pi(a)\pi(b)$ I tried many things, including couplings, but cant figure it out. Any tips and help would be great. Thanks!
