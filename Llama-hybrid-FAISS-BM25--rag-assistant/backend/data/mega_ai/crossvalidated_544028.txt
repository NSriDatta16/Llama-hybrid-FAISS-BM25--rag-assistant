Two sample similarity analysis for non-independent daily time series data

What two sample or other relevant statistical tests can be performed in R between two samples which are independent of each other, but the observations within each sample may not be independent, thus violating IID assumption? The values within sample has pixel (say 100 pixels are present in the study area) values representing wildfire severity, thus the daily pixel values are correlated. The dataset from each of the two samples contain daily time series data, and each day has multiple observations. One sample/model is the predicted model and the other sample/model has the observed data. So, the idea is to see how good or how similar the predicted model is against the observed data.
