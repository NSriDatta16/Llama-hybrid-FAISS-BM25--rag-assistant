You could put all of that into one query like so SELECT dates.date, SUM(volume.STT) AS STT, SUM(NZ(timesheet.batching)+NZ(timesheet.categorisation)+NZ(timesheet.CDT)+NZ(timesheet.CSI)+NZ(timesheet.destruction)+NZ(timesheet.extraction)+NZ(timesheet.indexing)+NZ(timesheet.mail)+NZ(timesheet.newlodgement)+NZ(timesheet.recordedDeliveries)+NZ(timesheet.retrieval)+NZ(timesheet.scanning)) AS VA FROM tblAllDates dates LEFT JOIN tblvolumedata volume ON dates.date = volume.date LEFT JOIN tblTimesheetData timesheet ON dates.date timesheet.date GROUP BY dates.date; I've put the dates table first in the FROM clause and then LEFT JOIN ed the two other tables. The jet database can be funny with more than one join in a query, so you may need to wrap one of the joins in parentheses (I believe this is referred to as Bill's SQL!) - I would recommend LEFT JOIN ing the tables in the query builder and then taking the SQL code view and modifying that to add in the SUM s, GROUP BY , etc. EDIT: Ensure that the date field in each table is indexed as you're joining each table on this field. EDIT 2: How about this - SELECT date, Sum(STT), Sum(VA) FROM (SELECT dates.date, 0 AS STT, SUM(NZ(tblTimesheetData.batching)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.categorisation)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.CDT)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.CSI)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.destruction)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.extraction)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.indexing)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.mail)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.newlodgement)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.recordedDeliveries)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.retrieval)+NZ(tblTimesheetData.scanning)) AS VA FROM tblTimesheetData RIGHT JOIN dates ON tblTimesheetData.date=dates.date GROUP BY dates.date UNION SELECT dates.date, SUM(tblvolumedata.STT) AS STT, 0 AS VA FROM tblvolumedata RIGHT JOIN dates ON tblvolumedata.date=dates.date GROUP BY dates.date ) GROUP BY date; Interestingly, When I ran my first statement against some test data, the figures for STT and VA had all been multiplied by 4, compared to the second statement. Very strange behaviour and certainly not what I expected.
