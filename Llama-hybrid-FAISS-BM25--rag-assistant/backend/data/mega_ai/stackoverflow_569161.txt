I'm guessing... serialize less objects at a time? 2 main questions: what objects are they? POCO? DataTable? what type of serialization is it? xml? XmlSerializer? DataContractSerializer? binary? BinaryFormatter? SoapFormatter? other? json? bespoke? Serialization needs to have some consideration of what the data volume is; for example, some serialization frameworks support streaming of both the objects and the serialized data, rather than relying on a complete object graph or temporary storage. Another option is to serialize homogeneous sets of data rather than full graphs - i.e. serialize all the "customers" separately the "orders"; this would usually reduce volumes, at the expense of having more complexity. So: what is the scenario here?
