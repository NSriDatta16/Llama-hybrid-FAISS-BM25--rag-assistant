We were trying to fix a busted node on an Oracle cluster. The storage management module was having problems, so we clicked the un-install button with the intention of re-installing and copying the configuration over from another node. Hmm, it turns out the un-install button applied to the entire cluster, so it cheerfully removed the storage management module from all the nodes in the system. Causing every node in the production cluster to crash. And since none of the nodes had a storage manager, they wouldn't come up! Here's an interesting fact about backups... the oldest backups get rotated off-site, and you know what your oldest files on a database are? The configuration files that got set up when the system was installed. So we had to have the offsite people send a courier with that tape, and a couple of hours later we had everything reinstalled and running. Now we keep local copies of the installation and configuration files!
