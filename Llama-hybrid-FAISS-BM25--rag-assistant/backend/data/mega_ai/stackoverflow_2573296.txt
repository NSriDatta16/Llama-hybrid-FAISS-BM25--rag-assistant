If you have a REST API, you have no need for an iframe, in fact, iframes are considered very poor practice in modern web applications. An iframe would be useful if you have content on an external site that is not easily manipulated with javascript on the client side, or with your application on the server side. This content is usually in the format of an HTML document. You've already stated that you have a REST API, so you can likely manipulate the data returned by a resource in any way you see fit. For instance, if the resource responds to JSON or XML requests, you could format and organize that data via Javascript from the client (web browser) or you could use your web framework to gather the data from the REST API and manipulate/organize it, making the result available to your application. In order to secure the data as it is transferred back and forth between the client and the server, you could provide an API Token (lots of sites do this, e.g. Github, Lighthouse, etc.) for each user from the service provider and require users in your application to provide their API Token. The token could be passed in the HTTP headers to the REST service provider separating the token from the request and response data. HTTPS (SSL) is a must for this type of traffic to prevent eavesdropping. Let me know if this is too general, I could give you a few specific examples.
