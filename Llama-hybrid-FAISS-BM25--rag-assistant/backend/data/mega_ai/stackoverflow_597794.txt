side-by-side diff program that supports dragging blocks of text into windows?

I'm looking for a side-by-side diff program a la xxdiff or DiffMerge that, instead of diffing files, allows blocks of text to be dragged into either the left side or right side window. I'm refactoring some SQL embedded in source files, and it would be nice to drag the sql statements from each source file into the diff program instead of having to cut and paste to files and then diff the files. Any clues appreciated, bonus for mac and linux compatibility... Thanks! update: both winmerge and beyond do this perfectly... thanks again guys!
