How to estimate the weights for a weighted average if not every weight is used in every example?

Say that you have a data set that contains $N$ examples. For each example, there are three main sections of important information. The first most important piece of information is the name of the example, called $i$ . The second most important piece of information is the weighted average, or score. The score is a real number $x$ in the interval $[0, 100]$ . The third most important section of information is the set of all the weights and their associated scores. For each weight, there is a unique name associated with it, called $j$ . The goal I have is to estimate the weights that are used in computing the scores in the examples. But there is a catch. Not every name and its associated weight is used in every single example. Each example $i$ is associated with a subset $S_i$ of $[1...j]$ . I suspect the weighted average (or score) for $i$ is $y_i =$ $(\sum_{j \in S_i} W_j*X_{i,j})/(\sum_{j \in S_i} W_j)$ For instance: suppose you have one example called "Blue," and it has a score of 90, that has the following names and their associated ratings, Roxanne 50 Alice 70 But in another example called "Red," there is a score of 75 with the following info: Roxanne 80 Bob 10 So given this, how do I find how Alice is weighted as well as Bob? More generally, how do I find the value for each weight for every name across all $N$ examples? Across all of the examples, the number of rows will not be constant. Some examples will have five ratings, but others will have just three. Assume that $N$ is not small, such that $N > 100$ .
