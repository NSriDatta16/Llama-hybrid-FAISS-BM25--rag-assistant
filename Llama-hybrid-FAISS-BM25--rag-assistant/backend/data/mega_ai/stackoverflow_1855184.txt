Dealing with URLs in Django

So, basically what I'm trying to do is a hockey pool application, and there are a ton of ways I should be able to filter to view the data. For example, filter by free agent, goals, assists, position, etc. I'm planning on doing this with a bunch of query strings, but I'm not sure what the best approach would be to pass along the these query strings. Lets say I wanted to be on page 2 (as I'm using pagination for splitting the pages), sort by goals, and only show forwards, I would have the following query set: ?page=2&sort=g&position=f But if I was on that page, and it was showing me all this corresponding info, if I was to click say, points instead of goals, I would still want all my other filters in tact, so like this: ?page=2&sort=p&position=f Since HTTP is stateless, I'm having trouble on what the best approach to this would be.. If anyone has some good ideas they would be much appreciated, thanks ;) Shawn J
