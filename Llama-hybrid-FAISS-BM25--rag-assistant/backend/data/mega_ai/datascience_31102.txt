How can I obtain datasets about human poses?

Lots of machine learning tutorials always mention about the identification of hand written numbers or cats or dogs, and there is always a prebuilt dataset for training. But no one said that how to build that dataset . Now we want to build our own model about human poses identification. We know how to train, how to inference, and how to integrate it to our project sources. But the most difficult task we seem is how to obtain LOTS human pose images and mark them with correct tags to train. Would someone kindly show us a way to achieve that? Thanks in advance.
