How to Increase the Max Length of the Product Description in Magento (when importing)?

Edit: This was a bogus question. The problem was that I had quotes in my description field. The entire field should be wrapped in one set of quotes with none inside. Changed quotes to apostrophes to fix. Magento is working correctly. I am using a Profile in the Import/Export section of my Magento admin to import a CSV document. My description fields are very long (around 10k file size). Two issues are occurring: On the published product, only the first 50% or so of the description is present. The Magento system does not import the next column on the import document (brief description). Does anybody know how to fix this?
