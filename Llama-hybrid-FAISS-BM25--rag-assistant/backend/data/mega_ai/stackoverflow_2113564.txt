First, lines of code written don't correlate well with actual productivity. At least in my opinion, if you want to measure and/or estimate productivity, function points are a more effective measurement. Second, when a metric varies over a wide range, the average generally means very little. In a case like this, a geometric mean generally means more than an arithmetic mean, but without (at least) something about the variance/standard deviation, it still doesn't mean much. I'd also note that there are some fairly sophisticated models that have undergone substantial research and even measured against real projects to get at least some idea that their results correlate with reality. For example, the COCOMO II model will generally produce much better results than just using lines of code per unit of time. There's at least one free online implementation (Edit: looking at it, this now allows either LoC or function point based modeling). There are also a tools such as SoftStar and Function Point Modeler ) that combine a COCOMO-like model with function points to get what appear (at least to me) to be fairly solid results.
