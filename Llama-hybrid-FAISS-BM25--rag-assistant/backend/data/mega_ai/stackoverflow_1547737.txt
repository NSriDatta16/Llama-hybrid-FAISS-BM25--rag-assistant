You should generally use SwingUtilities.invokeLater or the SwingWorker to isolate the changes to GUI components from any potential locking scenarios (file I/O or remote server calls) or processor intensive operations. If your calculations do any disk reading or writing, or if you make calls to a server, I would suggest that you reorganize your code to do all of you painting calls in the AWT thread. Likewise if you realize your calcs are taking too long to complete and your GUI seems sluggish, breaking them out would be prudent.
