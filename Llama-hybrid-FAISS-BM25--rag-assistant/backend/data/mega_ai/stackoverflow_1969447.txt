First of all, I'd strip out all the #pragma omp parallel directives until you have code that works. Right now it just reduces readability. Second, if you want to generate "unsolved" sudoku's (i.e. those where most numbers are not filled in) what you usually do is you fill in a few numbers at random and you test the sudoku by letting the computer solve it. If the comupter succeeds it means you started with a proper sudoku. Here you find a nice explanation of an algorithm that solves sudokus. Third, be aware that the numbers you want to put in a sudoku puzzle are constrained quite a bit. If a 3x3 block (or a 9x1 line or column) contains a 1, you can't add additional 1's to the block (line, column), if a 9x9 block contains nine 1's you can't add additional 1's to it, etc. So probably it is better to fill an array of arrays with all the numbers you can add (nine arrays of 1-9 for all 3x3 blocks) and randomly take elements out of these arrays and put them into the puzzle in the corresponding 3x3 block. This way you at least avoid the situation where you add duplicate numbers to the same 3x3 block.
