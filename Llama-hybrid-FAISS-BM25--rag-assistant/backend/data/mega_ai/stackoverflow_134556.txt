If you're storing an object as binary data in the database, then you really should use a BLOB datatype. The database is able to store it more efficiently, and you don't have to worry about encodings and the like. JDBC provides methods for creating and retrieving blobs in terms of streams. Use Java 6 if you can, it made some additions to the JDBC API that make dealing with blobs a whole lot easier. If you absolutely need to store the data as a String, I would recommend XStream for XML-based storage (much easier than XMLEncoder ), but alternative object representations might be just as useful (e.g. JSON). Your approach depends on why you actually need to store the object in this way.
