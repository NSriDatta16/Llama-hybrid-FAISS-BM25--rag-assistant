Rational Application Developer freezes when opening XML files

When I try to edit an XML file in the XML Editor of Rational Application Developer for WebSphere Software version 7.5.4, the program becomes unresponsive. title bar has "(Not Responding)" appended to it menu bar disappears cursor switches to hourglass window can be dragged and it gets repainted normally window can be minimized and restored The application must be terminated and restarted before it can be used. Also, the XML files can be edited normally through the Text Editor. How can I fix this?
