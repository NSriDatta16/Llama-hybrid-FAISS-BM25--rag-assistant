Regression with Time series model

I wanted to see if the different kinds of supports to small enterprises have contributed to the development/growth of small enterprises using 15 years period data (6 years before implementing these programs & 9 years after it). I used comparative research design & applied linear time series regression. At 10% significance level, the result gave me the following result: -R squared= 0.35, Adjusted R squared= -0.03 -some coefficients are positive & some are negative -p-values for all the four independent variables' coefficients are > significance level -t-stat= 0.5, 0.2, -0.2, & 1.4 Therefore, 1) How can I interpret these results? 2) Can I use You may answer all or any of these 5 questions. -Here is the data: - No. of credit Training marketing Business Organizing services (in $) (in No of services development service (in No. of firms) Trainees) (in No.of firms) (in No.of firms) employees 45,351 44,062,000 2,990 1,322 1,920 19,134 107,283 109,560,000 40,435 30,662 5,353 74,941 20,131 36,050,000 8,375 7,500 4,848 8,225 64,945 83,600,000 16,538 18,779 7426 6406 223,242 157,100,000 10,894 25,876 2479 9909 134,611 229,912,620 33,547 58,687 6,642 27,971 39092 90,529 271,924,783 70,157 18,543 2,300 63,759 368,691,717 12,148 12,443 3,954 67,238 110,619 491,586,029 76,461 25,414 4,168 70,600
