You can read the popular paper Understanding Neural Networks Through Deep Visualization which discusses visualization of convolutional nets. Its implementation not only displays each layer but also depicts the activations, weights, deconvolutions and many other things that are deeply discussed in the paper. It's code is in caffe' . The interesting part is that you can replace the pre-trained model with your own.
