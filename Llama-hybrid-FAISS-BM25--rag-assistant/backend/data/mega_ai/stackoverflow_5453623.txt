does not turn off javascript, it gives code that is rendered only if javascript IS turned off. I'm not entirely clear what you mean here. I think you mean that you want to apply very different styling to some new pieces in some of your pages. If they are in contiguous blocks you could put them in a div, and use that in your new styles. E.g. say you have: css: p {color: green; font-family: serif;} a {color: blue;} /* lots and lots of other declarations */ html: Here is a paragraph, there are a lot of these Here is a paragraph I need in the new style, there are a lot of these too! Then you could do: css: p {color: green; font-family: serif;} a {color: blue;} /* lots and lots of other declarations */ .newStyle p {color: black; font-family: sans-serif;} .newStyle a {color: red;} /* lots and lots of other declarations */ html: Here is a paragraph, there are a lot of these Here is a paragraph I need in the new style, there are a lot of these too!
