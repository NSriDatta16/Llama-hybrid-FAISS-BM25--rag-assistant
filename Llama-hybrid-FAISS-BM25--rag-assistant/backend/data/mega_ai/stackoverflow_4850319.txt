Moving from Web.Mail to Net.Mail, replacing MailMessage.Fields?

I'm trying to update some older software which uses the now-declared-obsolete System.Web.Mail classes. Unfortunately, I don't really know a heck of a lot about email, so I'm looking for advice. Here is the fragment of code I'm looking at revising: Dim myMessage As New Web.Mail.MailMessage Dim cdoSendUsingPort As Integer = 2 Dim cdoNTLM As Integer = 2 myMessage.Fields.Add("http://schemas.microsoft.com/cdo/configuration/smtpserver", Options.SMTPServer) myMessage.Fields.Add("http://schemas.microsoft.com/cdo/configuration/smtpserverport", 25) myMessage.Fields.Add("http://schemas.microsoft.com/cdo/configuration/sendusing", cdoSendUsingPort) myMessage.Fields.Add("http://schemas.microsoft.com/cdo/configuration/smtpauthenticate", cdoNTLM) From what I can tell, this should be configuring some kind of sending option. I can kind of work out what's going on, but I don't know how I should go about re-implementing it... It's looking like the place to be putting this stuff is now in the System.Net.Mail.SmtpClient.Credentials class, but the information in there doesn't seem to bear any resemblance to what I have here. I'm almost certain I'm making some obvious error, here, but I can't see it. Can someone tell me what I should be doing?
