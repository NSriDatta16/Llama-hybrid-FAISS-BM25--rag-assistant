There is no value on using the hashed password to send it to the service, given you'd still need a separate mechanism to secure the communication i.e. SSL If the system accepts the hashed password, for all intends and purposes the hashed password is the password. If an attackers gets the hashed password, (s)he has access to the account without needing to figure out the original password. One important issue with all the above, is that if the db is compromised & an attacker gets the hashed passwords, that means instant access to all the accounts through the said WebService, since as far as the WebService cares those are already the passwords. I really suggest you take it to them & talk about it. It might be one of those things that some dev did & haven't gained the attention/priority to straight it out.
