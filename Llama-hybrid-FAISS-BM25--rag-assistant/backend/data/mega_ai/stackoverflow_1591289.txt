It's supposed to work. Here's the implementation of the Auth getIdentity function. /** * Returns the identity from storage or null if no identity is available * * @return mixed|null */ public function getIdentity() { $storage = $this->getStorage(); if ($storage->isEmpty()) { return null; } return $storage->read(); } Here's the implementation of the PHP Session Storage write and read functions: /** * Defined by Zend_Auth_Storage_Interface * * @return mixed */ public function read() { return $this->_session->{$this->_member}; } /** * Defined by Zend_Auth_Storage_Interface * * @param mixed $contents * @return void */ public function write($contents) { $this->_session->{$this->_member} = $contents; } Are you sure you are loading the same instance of the Zend_Auth class? Are you using $auth = Zend_Auth::getInstance(); Maybe you are calling the write method after the getIdentity method? Anyway, as I said before, what you are doing should work.
