Your end goal is to spread out to a larger user base who gets to buy stuff. What if you did something like releasing your bags of w00t over a period of an hour or two, and over a range of IP addresses, instead of releasing them all at the same time and to any IP address. Let's say you have 255 bags of w00t. 1.0.0.0 can buy in the first minute, 2.0.0.0 can buy in the second minute (potentially 2 bags of w00t available), etc, etc. Then, after 255 minutes, you have made bags of w00t available to everybody, although it is highly likely that not all 255 bags of w00t are left. This limits a true attack to users who have >255 computers, although a bot user might be able to "own" the bag of w00t assigned to their IP range. There is no requirement that you match up bags to IP's fairly (and you definitely should use some type of MD5 / random seed thing)... if you distribute 10 bags of w00t incrementally, you just have to make sure that it gets distributed ~evenly~ across your population. If IP's are bad then you can use cookies and exclude the use case where a non-cookied user gets offered a bag of w00t. If you notice that a particular IP, cookie, or address range has an extreme amount of traffic, make the bag of w00t available to them proportionally later / last, so that occasional / steady / slow visitors are given opportunities before heavy / rapid / probable bot users. --Robert
