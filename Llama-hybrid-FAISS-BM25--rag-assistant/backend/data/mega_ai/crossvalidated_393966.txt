"Normal" regression requires continuous data so you shouldn't treat it as such. "Normal" Logistic regression requires binary variable, however there is also multinomial regression. In the case of multinomial regression you are trying to explain a nominal variable with some regressors. You can look at the following: "Estimation of multinomial logit models in R: The mlogit Packages" by Yves Croissant or "mlogit" in R. Good luck.
