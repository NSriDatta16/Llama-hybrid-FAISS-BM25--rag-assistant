I usually handle this with a list node, but pretty much any of the usual node types will do (div, span, etc). The idea is to create a container element for each column and float each left. Add an overflow:hidden to the container element (in this case, the ul) so that browsers will properly calculate the height of the floated elements nested inside. The display:inline on the floated li's fixes an ie6 double margin bug. http://jsfiddle.net/brianflanagan/QU2HB/
