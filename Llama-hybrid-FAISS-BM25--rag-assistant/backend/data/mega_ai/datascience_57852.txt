What is the current state-of-the-art video classification technique?

For a project I am aiming to automise the detection of goals in foosball (a.k.a. 'table football') matches. To do so I now track the ball in every frame using the openCV library in Python. To determine if a ball has been shot into the goal and should count as a point I want to train a neural network on videos that include goals and non-goals. When the ball is not found for a number of frames, I want the algorithm to put the video through a neural network to determine if it disappeared because a team scored. I've been doing some research on video classification techniques but cannot really determine which one works best on classifying videos right now. Currently I am considering first training a CNN on single frames out of the videos, and then gathering the convolutional features for the videos by feeding them through the network (with classification layer and fully-connected layers popped off), after which the convolutional features are put through an LSTM classification network sequentially for each video. Is this the best way to go about such a problem, or are there better techniques available?
