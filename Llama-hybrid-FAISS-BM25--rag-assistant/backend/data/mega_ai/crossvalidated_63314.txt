You can't average the data. Since the variables will be same across the imputed data, you have to append each imputed data. For example, if you have 6 variables with 1000 observations and your imputation frequency is 5 , then you will have the final data of 6 variables with 5000 observations. You use the rbind function to append the data in R. For example, if you have five imputed data (assuming that you have already these data in hand), your final data will be obtained as finaldata For details, see here. After imputation: The regression coefficient from each imputed data will be usually different; so the coefficient is obtained as average of coefficients of all imputed data. But, there is additional rule for standard error. See here for details.
