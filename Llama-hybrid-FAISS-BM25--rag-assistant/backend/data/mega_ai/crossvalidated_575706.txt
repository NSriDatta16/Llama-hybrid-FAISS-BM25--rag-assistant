Mean centering and average marginal effects

I was reading Wooldridge's "Introductory Econometrics," in which he said: "The centering of explanatory variables about their sample averages before creating quadratics or interactions forces the coefficient on the levels to be average partial effects.â€‹" (p.180). I am struggling to see why this is the case.
