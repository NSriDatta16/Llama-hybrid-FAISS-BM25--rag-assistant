Logistic Regression -- Question about inverse of a features probability

I'm working on a customer churn model. Currently i have a variable for increased returns (1/0). After i run the model and convert the coefficient to and odds ratio, then convert that to probability; I wind up with 70%. (Churn =1, Not Churn = 0) My question is can i use the inverse of this probability to say that a customer with decreased or flat returns has a 30% probability to "not churn". If i actually flip this relationship in the data and feed it to the model, it starts to generate a lot more false positives, and accuracy falls drastically. Any help would be extremely appreciated. Thanks!
