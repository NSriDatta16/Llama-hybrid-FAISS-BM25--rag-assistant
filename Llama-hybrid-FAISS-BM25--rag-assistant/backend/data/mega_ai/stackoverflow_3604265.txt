Alright, so you're problem here is Opera (bless it) doesn't support the onKeyDown command very well - so you have to look at onKeyUp or onKeyPress instead. There's a really handy HTML table on quirksmode explaining this. Given you're only trying to trap a control key onKeyUp is probably your best bet. I've been forced to combine onKeyDown and onKeyPress in order to catch text input AND control keys (but since you want text input to work as normal you don't need to go this far). It should be simply a matter of switching "onkeydown" to "onkeyup" in your example fragment. There is, perhaps, a question of why you'd be doing the above. I don't know what Login() does, but building a form with 3 parts (input-text, input-password, and input-submit button) will -by default- submit the form when enter is pressed in either of the input boxes, you could just add an onSubmit event to the form calling Login();
