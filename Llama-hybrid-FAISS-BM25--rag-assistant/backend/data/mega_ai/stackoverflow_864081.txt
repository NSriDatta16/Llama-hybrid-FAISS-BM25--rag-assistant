Why don't my two columns align properly in IE7?

I'm teaching myself CSS through books and websites. I've made a simple site with a centered box followed by two-columns, and it displays fine in Firefox 3 and Safari 3, but not in IE7. My right column stays on the right, but is pushed down so that it starts where the left column ends. I've seen a lot of blogs about IE hacks, but I don't know which to apply, or where it should be added in my code. Any tips would be greatly appreciated! Here is my CSS: #wrapper { position:relative; width:900px; margin-right:auto; margin-left:auto; } #centerbox { background-color:#FFFFFF; width:870px; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; padding:10px 15px 10px 15px; margin-bottom:30px; text-align:left; border:8px solid #E0BB24; } #leftcolumn { float:left; margin-left:10px; width:410px; padding:0px 10px 10px 10px; color:#FFFFFF; } #rightcolumn { width:395px; margin-left:480px; margin-right:10px; padding:0px 15px 10px 10px; background-color:#FFFFFF; border:1px solid #26A9E0; } And this is my HTML: The physician's creed: &quot;First, do no harm&quot; Politicians, policymakers, and public officials should take the same oauth Text Putting Patients First Read more about our idea of a better way to reform health care by putting patients first &raquo; Principles for reform Tell politicians in Washington you will follow these principles in judging any health reform proposal: No new government-run health insurance plan No one-size government-dictated package of health benefits No new jobs-killing mandates on employers No requirement on individuals to buy this expensive coverage No federal institution that controls private health insurance No government intrusion into our medical privacy No federal government control over the practice of medicine through a federal health board, comparative effectiveness review, and other government intrusions into doctor-patient medical decision-making Read more &raquo; Sign the petition Dear Policymaker: I stand with millions of Americans who implore you to follow the Do No Harm principles &mdash; and do NOT destroy America's health care system!
