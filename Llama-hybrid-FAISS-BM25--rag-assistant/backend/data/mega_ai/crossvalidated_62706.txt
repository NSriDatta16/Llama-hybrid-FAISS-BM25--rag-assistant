How to present rows which can have several categories?

I have a spreadsheet where the content is organized like that: content | category1 | category2 | category3 | ... _________|___________|___________|___________| ... content 1| x | | x | ... content 2| | x | | ... ... How can I present this information more effectively? For example, is there a Javascript library I could use or something like that, where we could choose to show only the rows which are associated to some categories, or set a category to a row, etc? Thanks in advance
