Team Build - Automatically Reenable Agent After Becoming Unreachable

We have a central Team Foundation Server (2008) deployment where all projects get stored. Each project sets up their own build server running Team Build to do their own automated builds. Here's the problem. When a connection error is detected between TFS and the Team Build server, it moves the build agent's status to 'unreachable' which means it's not available for any subsequent builds. Our servers have scheduled reboot windows and when TFS can't communicate with those agents (or vice-versa) during that window, it moves the agent to 'unreachable'. Every morning we come in and find that we have to manually go in and reenable the agent. Is it possible to have the team build agents come back online as soon they're available again? Or perhaps write a script that brings them back online automatically?
