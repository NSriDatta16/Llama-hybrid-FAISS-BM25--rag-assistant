I figured one way to do it (if you don't want to mess with the registry), but ultimately I went with the other answer. I had to drag the solution file to the taskbar itself. The OS knows to add VSLauncher to the taskbar and pin it to it. The problem I was having was I was trying to drag it onto the visual studio 2008 application icon I had pinned to the desktop.
