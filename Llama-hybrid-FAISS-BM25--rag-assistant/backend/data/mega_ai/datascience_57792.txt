How to use machine learning to create combine of opposite images side by side

Inspired by: Two Worlds Pictures I just want to create a Machine Learning Model that can automatically combine the opposite images into 1 image. I am thinking about 2 possible solutions: Pose Estimation : Detect humans and their poses from image data and search an archive by pose, but totally out of context. Land Lines : explore similar lines. It's just my ideas, do you have any recommendations? Thanks
