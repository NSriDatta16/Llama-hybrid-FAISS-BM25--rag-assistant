Overview Smarty templating engine for PHP lets easily separate application logic and presentation, the first being in PHP code and the other generally, but not always, in HTML. That way a separation of PHP and HTML code is encouraged. Currently two versions of Smarty are maintained smarty2 for legacy purposes that is compatible with PHP 7.2, and smarty3 that is compatible with PHP 7.3 and PHP 7.4. As of April 13th 2020, current Smarty releases are 3.1.35 and 2.6.31 Example PHP script ( example.php ) : require_once('../smarty/Smarty.class.php'); $se = new Smarty(); $se->assign('pi', 3.14159); $se->assign(array( 'title' => 'Hello World !', 'today' => date('d/m/Y'), )); $se->display('example.tpl'); Template ( example.tpl ) : Smarty example {$title} Pi value : {$pi} Today is : {$today} Links: Main Smarty site Online documentation Smarty FAQs Smarty 3 Overview Downloads Smarty 2->3 upgrade notes
