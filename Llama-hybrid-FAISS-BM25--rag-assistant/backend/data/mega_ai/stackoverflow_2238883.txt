What is the correct way to specify dimensions in DIP from Java code?

I found that it is possible to set dimensions of my interface elements in XML layouts using DIPs as in following fragment: android:layout_width="10dip" But all Java interface takes integer as arguments and there is no way to specify dimensions in DIPs. What is the correct way to calculate this? I figured that I have to use property density of DisplayMetrics class but is this a correct way? May I rely on this formula being always correct? pixels * DisplayMetrics.density = dip Is there a utility function for the conversion somewhere in Android?
