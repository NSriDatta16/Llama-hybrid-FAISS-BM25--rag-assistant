In machine learning for generative adversarial networks (GANs), it is common to use Wasserstein metric / Earthmover's distance to compare output images from the well-known paper 2017 on Wasserstein GAN . Traditional measures like K-L divergence may be too stringent: see What is the advantages of Wasserstein metric compared to Kullback-Leibler divergence? Also if your goal is to compare specifically images for being nearly visual duplicates, you can look into image perceptual hashing/fingerprinting : pHash , Neal Krawetz's classic introductory blogpost on perceptual hashing (can be as simple as squashing image down to 8x8 and binarizing, then comparing by Hamming distance)
