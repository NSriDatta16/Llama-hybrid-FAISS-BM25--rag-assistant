MooTools Sortables with horizontal list having problems

I am having problems sorting list items using the Sortables class when the list items are displayed horizontally. Removing this style fixed everything: display: inline Created an example on jsfiddle. This works. Check the stylesheet for .countries li - it does not display the list inline - http://jsfiddle.net/Wgpqw/ This does not work properly. I can drag the list items around the list, but the sort randomly happens when moving around - http://jsfiddle.net/Wgpqw/1/ I suspect it has something to do with the list element positioning in inline mode. Any help is greatly appreciated.
