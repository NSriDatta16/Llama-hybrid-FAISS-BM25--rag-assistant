Method(s) to predict binary outcome from onset of variation in time series data

Context: I have data on 100 patients showing their time of attendance at a service. They attend on a roughly daily basis between 9-5 (except weekends and occasional missed appointments). They access a community pharmacy, so can attend at any time during opening hours (0830-1800). Some patients are recorded as being discharged from the service (various reasons). Hypothesis: Discharge from service (binary outcome) can be predicted following an increase in the variation of their attendance time. Question: What statistical method(s) should I investigate to develop a model to test this hypothesis? Note: I am familiar with basic inferential tests (e.g. linear + logistic regression, basic time-series) and am stretching myself by reading up on GARCH and Functional Data. I understand these can help me describe variance in each patient's time of attendance - but not clear how to apply this to determine the risk of a binary outcome. There's an e.g. of (idealised) data on 2 patients here . Patient 1 (green) has roughly constant variance and is not discharged. Patient 2 (red) demonstrates increased variance in attendance time before being discharged (red cross). Thanks in advance for any pointers to direct my reading and implementation in R.
