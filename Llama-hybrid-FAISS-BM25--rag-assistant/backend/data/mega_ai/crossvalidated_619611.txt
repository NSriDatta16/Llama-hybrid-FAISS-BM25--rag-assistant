Even when using "machine learning methods" for causal inference, which usually implies semiparametric estimation of causal effects, cross-fitting is commonly used to reduce bias from regularization/overfitting and produce desirable statistical properties of the estimator such as valid confidence intervals. For cross-fitting, you split your data into two, use one subset to pick you model (e.g., select controlling variables) and use the other to estimate the parameters of your model. You then repeat this for all subsets and average your results from different splits to recover the loss of statistical efficiency from splitting your dataset. So it's the same idea as "train-test split". You can read more here for example: Ratkovic, Marc. "Rehabilitating the Regression: Honest and Valid Causal Inference through Machine Learning." (2019). Random forests are very commonly used in modern causal inference techniques using machine learning.
