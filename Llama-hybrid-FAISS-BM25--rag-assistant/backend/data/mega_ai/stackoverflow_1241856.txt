Illegal mix of collations error in MySql

Just got this answer from a previous question and it works a treat! SELECT username, (SUM(rating)/COUNT(*)) as TheAverage, Count(*) as TheCount FROM ratings WHERE month='Aug' GROUP BY username HAVING TheCount > 4 ORDER BY TheAverage DESC, TheCount DESC But when I stick this extra bit in it gives this error: Documentation #1267 - Illegal mix of collations (latin1_swedish_ci,IMPLICIT) and (latin1_general_ci,IMPLICIT) for operation '=' SELECT username, (SUM(rating)/COUNT(*)) as TheAverage, Count(*) as TheCount FROM ratings WHERE month='Aug' **AND username IN (SELECT username FROM users WHERE gender =1)** GROUP BY username HAVING TheCount > 4 ORDER BY TheAverage DESC, TheCount DESC The table is: id, username, rating, month
