Excellent model fit but high VIF

I want to use a predictive model for a time series variable M that is related to an other variable X. I can generate independent scenarios for X and I need to generate corresponding values for M. Alternative 1: Linear regression Sample size is over 500. $R^2$ is 94% and SE are small, giving highly significant results. First row below are the coefficient estimates, second are the SE. 0.741393543 2.282116981 0.009401482 0.02483862 Alternative 2: autoregressive model Fit an autoregressive model with X as an exogenous variable: $$M_{(n+1)} = a M_n +b X_{(n+1)} + c$$ In-sample fit is excellent ( $R^2$ over 98%) and SE are good. First row below gives the coefficients, second the SE. 0.759621998 0.185402072 0.529660298 0.018255516 0.014094594 0.043751245 However $M_n$ and $X_{(n+1)}$ are highly collinear (see Alternative 1!). They have a VIF near 20. Visually, the in-sample fit for Alternative 2 is striking and it's tempting to use this, however the size of the VIF is giving me pause, even though the SE are actually quite good (the very high $R^2$ is helping here). Using Alternative 1 gives coefficient estimates that are much tighter and that should be more robust as they get reestimated over time. Nevertheless, Alternative 2 seems like a solid model despite the high VIF. What are the risks of using Alternative 2? Below are the in-sample fits. Top is Alternative 2.
