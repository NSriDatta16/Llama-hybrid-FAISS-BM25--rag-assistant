You've mentioned that you're trying to use objects as keys in a hash, to store additional data. The standard-in-PHP-5.3 SPL Object Storage class was designed for this use case, though it's kind of funky to use. It can behave as an array, thankfully. Now, it can only be used to store actual objects, not primitives. This may pose a problem for your use case, but it's probably the best thing you've got for storage of objects as keys.
