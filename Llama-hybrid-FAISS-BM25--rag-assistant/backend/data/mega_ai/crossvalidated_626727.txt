dynamic time warping step pattern

I am measuring the distance between two time series that are of different length. Time series were built by creating a score of windows of years: t1 = (0,0.5,0.6,..,0.3) of length 72 representing years 1901-1931,1902-1932.. t2 = (0,0.3,0.8,..,0.2) of length 82 representing years 1901-1941,1902-1942.. Series are expected to be very close, but the purpose of using DTW is to prove that using different window length (30,40 years) won't affect the score system. Should I use an asymetric step pattern when measuring the distance?
