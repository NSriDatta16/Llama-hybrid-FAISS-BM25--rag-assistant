I have used (and owned subscriptions to) all three. These days I tend to use DevExpress for Winforms apps and Telerik for ASP.NET, and that is a result of which company had the controls I needed back when I started the projects. Once you have a large app in production you tend to stick with the suite you used. My experience with Infragistics was back in the VB6 days. My advice would be to get the free trials and then base your decision on these things: a) does the suite offer the controls you need? b) how amenable to your style do you find the public interfaces of their controls? c) how well is the suite documented? d) how easy is it to find answers/info on the company's website / online knowledge base / community forum e) how active are the community forums, and what is the predominant type of activity there? you want to find people discussing solutions, not workarounds Overall, I have liked the Telerik customer experience best.
