I know this is old, but a combination of these ideas leads to a very elegant solution: Keep all the default property settings for the DropDownList (AppendDataBoundItems=false, Items empty). Then handle the DataBound event like this: protected void dropdown_DataBound(object sender, EventArgs e) { DropDownList list = sender as DropDownList; if (list != null) list.Items.Insert(0, "--Select One--"); } The icing on the cake is that this one handler can be shared by any number of DropDownList objects, or even put into a general-purpose utility library for all your projects.
