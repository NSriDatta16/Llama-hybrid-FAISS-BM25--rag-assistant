Whether or not you need to create a new application for mobile depends on the site you have. The website at my workplace could not possibly fit on a mobile phone screen (too many frames), but other sites that have a more adjustment-friendly layout might just need a little tweak. I would test your site on a mobile browser emulator, there are a bunch of them listed on this site . Also, you might consider switching your firefox's user agent ( here ) so you can browse popular site's mobile versions, along with the source they used to lay it out.
