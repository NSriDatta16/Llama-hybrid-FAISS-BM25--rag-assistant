With a few exceptions, Python is used pretty much wherever a programmer who knows Python wants to focus on solving a problem instead of struggling with implementation details. You'll find it in games , web applications , network servers , scientific computing , media tools , application scripting , etc. (There's a somewhat old list of some organizations that use it here .) People who know it well tend to love it because it strikes a very rare balance of conciseness and clarity, and (perhaps to a lesser extent) because it has a rich set of useful libraries. Some places where Python isn't used as much: Web browser scripts (because browsers implement JavaScript, not Python, though there are ways around that ) Large GUI applications (perhaps because good GUI bindings are relatively new) Graphics engines (for performance reasons, but note that Python is sometimes used for the controlling logic that makes use of a graphics engine) Small embedded devices (although some folks have had success with compact , stripped-down and special-purpose implementations of Python, and we're starting to see python tools for building applications on smart phones and tablets .)
