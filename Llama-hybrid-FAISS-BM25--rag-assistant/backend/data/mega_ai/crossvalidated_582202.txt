Neural Network vs Linear regression

We know that the neural network will perform like a linear regression if there is only one hidden unit. So, the NN method should perform at least as well as a linear regression method. I have built a tidymodel model using the following line of code: Data_nnet_mod % set_engine("nnet") %>% set_mode("regression") and have tuned it using Data_nnet_fit % tune_grid(val_set, grid = 25, control = control_grid(save_pred = TRUE), metrics = metric_set(rmse)) It turns out that the linear regression output has a smaller RMSE than the NN method. I wonder why the best RMSE that the NN method produces is larger than that of the regression method. Theoretically speaking, should the NN method not be at least as well as the regression method?
