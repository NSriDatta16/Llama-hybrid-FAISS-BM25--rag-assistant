Keep in mind that due to the state-less nature of the web, your ActionResult isn't "called from" your ActionLink as much it is simply a url that the user-agent requested. Because of this, the only real "built-in" way you can know where that user was coming from is by inspecting the http Request headers to see what the referring page was: string referrer = Request.Headers["referer"]; You'd then be responsible for parsing out the Action method from this url, if you were going to call it directly. Be aware that this referrer may not be a link within your own site.
