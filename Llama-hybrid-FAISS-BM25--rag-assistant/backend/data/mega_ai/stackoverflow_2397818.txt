Using UITouch inside a UIScrollView

Just toying with the SDK and I was wondering if possible a UITouch event can work inside a UIScrollView. I have setup a UIScrollView which handles a large UIView, inside the UIView is a UIImageView, I've managed to get the UITouch to drag the UIImageView outside of the UIScrollView but inside it's not registering the event. I suppose what I was trying to accomplish was dragging the UIImageView around the large UIView whilst the UIScrollView moves along the image if the user drags it beyond the POS of when the UIView when the UIImageView began it's dragging, if that makes sense? Many thanks
