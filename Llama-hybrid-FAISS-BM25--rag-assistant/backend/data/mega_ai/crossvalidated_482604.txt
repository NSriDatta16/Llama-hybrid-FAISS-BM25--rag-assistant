Do financial return series have a probability mass function (pmf)?

Stock returns, computed from stock prices as $r_t = \ln (p_{t}) - \ln (p_{t-1})$ , are real-valued and unbounded giving the impression that they are continuous random variables . But aren't they actually discrete random variables given that: financial time series are finite in the number of historical observations they possess, and they do fluctuate within a feasible range of real values (percentage up and down ticks) known (inferred) beforehand from the source price data? (i.e. a real value of 5.1 would not appear as an observation in a daily-frequency time series because that would mean the stock jumped 610% in one day) If so, does that mean they have probability mass functions (pmf) and not probability density functions (pdf)?
