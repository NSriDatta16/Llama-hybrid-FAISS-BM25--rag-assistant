The RunScript method within WatiN has little room for reply. If the script you want to run contains an error of any kind, WatiN will throw the AV exception (this should definitely be improved). It is possible to do what you want-- I did the same thing with Infragistics grid controls. Sorry I couldn't be of more help.
