jQuery - event that a user edited the content of a textarea

I use jQuery and make an iteration over a list of projects. Every project is put on the screen and it is draggable. Also very project has a textarea. Source code: $.each(data, function(id, project) { $('#projects').append(' '+project.text+' '); }); $(".note").draggable({ containment: "#projects", scroll: false }); What I want, is to know if a user change the text of the project, so I need to know if the cursor leaves the textarea. And I need to know the new text and the data-projectid, so I can save the new text (into a database which is located in the backend system). Thank you in advance for your help, Tim-.
