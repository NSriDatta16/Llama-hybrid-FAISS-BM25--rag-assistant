Got it working - I downloaded the jquery-json plugin, encoded my array as a json obect to send to django, and then used simplesjon.loads() in the django view to convert that json object to a python list. However, the fact that it took so many steps and jQuery on its own doesn't even come with json encode functionality still makes me think there must be a more elegant way - if anyone has any insight, I'd love to hear it. Thanks Daniel for pointing me in the right direction.
