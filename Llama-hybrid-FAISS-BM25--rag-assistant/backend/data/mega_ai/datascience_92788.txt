No, you don't average across all feature maps. When the input has multiple channels, you need your convolution filter to have the same number of channels . Therefore, the filter "covers" the full depth of the input. Then, you simply perform the element-wise multiplication of the filter with the overlapping region in the input and add all the resulting elements together. Therefore, if the input to a convolutional layer is a grayscale image, a filter is of dimensions [3,3,1] , while if the input is a color image (with 3 channels), your filter is [3, 3, 3] , like this ( source ): The same happens with feature maps with N channels: we need a filter with N channels.
