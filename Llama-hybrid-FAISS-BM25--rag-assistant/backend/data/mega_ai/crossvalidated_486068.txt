Nature of Dependence in Bayesian Contingency Tables

Question from a novice in both R and Bayesian approaches. I used the Bayes Factor package to calculate the BF for a contingency table of two nominal variables with 3 categories each and the results supported non-independence. Is there a way within the Bayesian framework to examine the magnitude of dependence? I was hoping for something analogous to Pearson residuals from the Chi-square test explained here: http://www.sthda.com/english/wiki/chi-square-test-of-independence-in-r Thank you in advance for your input!
