Get the GET query in a Python CGI script (Apache, mod_cgi)

I am trying to get the query string in a CGI python script because for some reason the .FieldStorage and .getvalue functions are returning "None". The query is being generated correctly. I checked it in Wireshark and it is correctly produced. Any ideas on how I can just get the string itself correctly? I was trying to use os.environ('QUERY_STRING') but that didn't work either. Josh
