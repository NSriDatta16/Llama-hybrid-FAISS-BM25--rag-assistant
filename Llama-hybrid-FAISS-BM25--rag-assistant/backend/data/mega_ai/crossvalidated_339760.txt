Without going Bayesian and bringing priors into the equation, a null result suggests that population parameters you infer about may be equal. Depending on the distribution, they may even be directionally reversed (ie, even if your sample statistic A > B, in the population B may be > A). If we were allowed to make decisions based only on the raw directionality of the sample statistics, thereâ€™d be no reason for a statistical test.
