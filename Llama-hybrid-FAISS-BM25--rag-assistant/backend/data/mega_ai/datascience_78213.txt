Maybe you can aggregate the data using fields such as Client ID, merchant ID so that you may also analyze the client and merchant data separately. For example, you can aggregate the data on client id to get the sum or mean of the amount spent by the client. You can further analyze the data by plotting boxplots, distribution plots to find various insights. I would highly recommend you to aggregate such transaction data. You may also want to perform time series analysis using the transaction date to find the hidden trend seasonality. For this you may want to take a look at fbprophet ( https://facebook.github.io/prophet/docs/quick_start.html ).
