If stack overflow kept static html files of every page, well that would be impossible. Server side languages like ASP.NET or PHP are used to generate the page, using the same template each time. To do that, they get the information from a database, e.g. MySQL, SQLite, XML files, etc. CMSs like Wordpress, Drupal or Joomla are widely used, which keep all the data organized and do all the work of generating the page for you. Seperating data (e.g. the plain text of your question), the appearance/display (CSS) and the Controller , the in-between part (server-side code - PHP, ASP.NET, etc.), is called MVC, for M odel (data) V iew (display) C ontroller (in-between), and using the MVC architecture is good practice.
