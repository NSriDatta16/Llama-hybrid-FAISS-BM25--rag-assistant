It looks like the latest edition of Productivity Power Tools includes features to change how the tabs are displayed / can be used. It does not currently support disabling of floating tabs or disabling dragging tabs off the dock; but in the comments section of the page, there is mention of adding it in future versions. Bonus feature: middle click scrolling.
