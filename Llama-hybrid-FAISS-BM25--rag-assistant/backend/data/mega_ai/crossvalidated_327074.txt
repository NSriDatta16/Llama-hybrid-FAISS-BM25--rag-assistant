K-Nearest Neighbor imputation explanation

I have a dataframe with some missing data in it. I need to deal with those missing data before trying anything. I've seen that knnImputation in R is a good choice but I would like to understand what it really does before. (I'm just a student who's trying to deal with data science) I think I've understand the knn classifier but I don't find any good doc about knn imputation. Do you know some ? Or maybe if someone could explain a little ? Also, the choice of k in knn imputation is the same with the knn classifier ? Thanks!
