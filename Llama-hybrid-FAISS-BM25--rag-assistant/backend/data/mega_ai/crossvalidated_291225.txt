Do neural nets require data to be sequential?

I want to know if sequential data changes the output of a standard (not recurrent) neural network. For instance, let's say I have a straight line with coordinates in the format: x: 0, 1, 2, 3 y: 0, 1, 2, 3 Now I have another straight line, exactly the same as the first one, but with the points in a different order: x: 0, 3, 1, 2 y: 0, 3, 1, 2 Will the neural network treat these the same when mapping to an output (i.e. ignore the fact that the coordinates are not in the same sequence)?
