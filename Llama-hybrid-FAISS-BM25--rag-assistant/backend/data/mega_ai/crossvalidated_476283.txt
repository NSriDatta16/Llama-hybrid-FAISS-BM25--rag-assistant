If you’re interested in Bayesian Inference then there’s a wonderful book (goes into GLMs quite a lot) called Statistical Rethinking by Richard McElreath. The second edition is just out and there’s lecture series on YouTube. The most recent series (called Winter 2019 IIRC) follows the second edition.
