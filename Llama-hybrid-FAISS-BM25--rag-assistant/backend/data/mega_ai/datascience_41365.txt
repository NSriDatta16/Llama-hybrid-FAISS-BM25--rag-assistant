Boostrap parameter in random forest regressor?

There's one parameter in RandomForestRegressor which is bootstrap . By default bootstrap=True bootstrap : boolean, optional (default=True) Whether bootstrap samples are used when building trees. So from the docs if I set bootstrap=False then I guess bootstrap samples are not used but I'm really confused on what is bootstrap samples mean here? There were explanations but it's really confusing. Can someone please explain it in a simpler term ? And also does bootstrap=True help in improving the model accuracy? Thank you.
