Various scenarios are possible and not all would use the same statistical analysis. Here is one example: Out of 100 green applies 6 have worm damage; out of 5 red apples, 2 have worm damage. You could try a formal test to see if proportions $\hat p_g = .06$ and $\hat p_r = .40$ are significantly different. (Asking this makes sense only if red and green applies were grown and stored together so worms had equal munching opportunity for each apple.) You can look in a basic statistics text or online for 'test of two proportions'. (For example, NIST .) Various statistical computer programs implement such a test. Minitab is one of them, giving results below: Test and CI for Two Proportions Sample X N Sample p 1 6 100 0.060000 2 2 5 0.400000 Difference = p (1) - p (2) Estimate for difference: -0.34 95% upper bound for difference: 0.0224804 Test for difference = 0 (vs The first test uses a normal approximation. The note complains that you have too little data (especially for red apples) for the P-value 0.003 to be trusted exactly. But this P-value is sufficiently smaller that 0.05, that it seems reasonable to say the two sample proportions are significantly different at the 5% level. Fisher's exact test is sometimes more accurate for small samples. It uses the hypergeometric distribution. The reasoning is as follows. I have 105 apples in a bag (100 green, 5 red), worms randomly attack 8, what is the probability six or fewer are green: $P(X \le 6).$ The probability for exactly $6$ is $P(X=6) = 0.0428:$ $$\frac{{100 \choose 6}{5 \choose 2}}{105 \choose 8} = 0.0428,$$ which can be evaluated by computing the three binomial coefficients or by using a hypergeometric PDF dhyper in R. choose(100, 6)*choose(5,2)/choose(105,8) [1] 0.04275365 dhyper(6, 100, 5, 8) [1] 0.04275365 The remaining five probabilities are smaller. The sum for $P(X \le 6) = 0.0455$ can be found in R with the hypergeometric CDF phyper . The result agrees with the Minitab output. phyper(6, 100, 5, 8) [1] 0.04552478 A simpler scenario is to ask whether the worm infestation is sufficiently bad that half of the apples are wormy. With the data above, it seems not. If 105 apples are equally likely to be wormy or not, then 'on average' we would expect to see about 52 or 53 wormy apples. The probability of seeing 8 or fewer wormy ones is very small. Specifically, the null distribution of the number $Y$ of wormy apples is $Y \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n = 105, p = .5)$ and $P(Y \le 8) \approx 0.$ pbinom(8, 105, .5) [1] 7.476687e-21
