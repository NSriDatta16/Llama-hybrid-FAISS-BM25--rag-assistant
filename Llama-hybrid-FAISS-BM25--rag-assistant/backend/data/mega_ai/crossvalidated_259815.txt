Why logarithmic scale for hyper-parameter optimization?

I'm using random search for hyper-parameter optimization of a machine learning pipeline. For example, for the C and gamma parameter it is recommended to use logarithmically spaced values. Why should I use such values? For example, if I use logarithmic spaced values from $2^{-5}$ to $2^{15}$, then there will be many more values near to $2^{-5}$ (i.e. near zero) than near to $2^{15}$.
