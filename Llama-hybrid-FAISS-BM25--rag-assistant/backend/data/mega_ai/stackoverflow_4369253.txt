beta and production versions of a winforms release co-existing?

I am wondering if it is possible to have one solution with different deployment paths for the same application. What I would like to be able to do is have a 'production' version and a 'debug/beta' version of a winforms application. Ideally I would like to be able to have this done with the minimum amount of 'manual effort' required. what I mean is that I would like to be able to configure my winform solution so that if I build a beta version of the application it will appear as a sibling to the 'release' version in the start menu... something like this: Start Menu-->CompanyName-->ProductName-->AppName Start Menu-->CompanyName-->ProductName-->AppName(beta) What is a good practice to configure such a thing? Currently it seems like this is the approach we need to take: change the Assembly name for the Application, in the "Application" tab, to "AppNameBeta", we cannot use the same Assembly name, otherwise it will overwrite AppName or AppName will overwrite AppNameBeta. change the product name in the Publish\Options, to "AppNameBeta", so that the shortcut names are different. change any assembly name references in the Resources.xml file(s), from AppName to AppNameBeta (whatever assembly name is changed in Step #1). Am I misunderstanding this or is there a simpler/more elegant way to deploy a beta version? Thanks for your support.
