What's the standard way to give a set of different clickable options all submitting the same form?

I have a PHP-generated page which is displaying some data about a set of films. The page is updated using POST. The form only shows films starting with a particular letter. I want to present a set of clickable options at the top of the screen, each of which is a letter. So if you click on "B" it submits the form and re-draws the page showing only films that start with B. (I know, Ajax would be a better way to do this, but I'm trying to get something done quickly). Anyway, I know I can do this by having each link be a Javascript call which sets the value of a hidden field and then submits the form, or I could do it by having each letter be a button which has a particular value and submits the form directly, but neither of those strikes me as particularly elegant. Is there a standard way to do this? Am I missing something really obvious?
