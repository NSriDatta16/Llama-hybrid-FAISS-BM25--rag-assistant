JQuery Sortable Grid Functionality without Identical Dimensions

I am looking to create a sortable (via drag and drop) grid, similar to what JQuery's Sortable grid does ( http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable/#display-grid ). However, Sortable requires that you use only divs with identical dimensions. For my purposes, each block is allowed to be different widths and heights. The functionality I am looking for is the snap-to-grid capabilities while "shoving" the other elements out of the way. Draggable does everything except for preventing them from overlapping and shoving the other elements out of the way. Oh, it doesn't have to be Jquery either. I'm open to using other methods if it is easier.
