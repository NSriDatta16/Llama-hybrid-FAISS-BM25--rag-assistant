Setting initial values in ARIMA

I tried to fit 2 ARMA models to a set of financial time series data with 2 sets of initial parameter values (all 0's and all 0.5's). The final estimates of the parameters are quite different. I'm not sure why this happens as I thought the parameter estimates should converge? mod1=arima(logreturn,order=c(2,0,3),init=c(0,0,0,0,0,0) mod2=arima(logreturn,order=c(2,0,3),init=c(0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5,0.5)) P.S. The data set is a bit long hence I omitted it. But it appears to be normally distributed with mean 0.
