Is there some "Feature Graphic" generator for Google Play?

I'm looking for some "Feature Graphic" online generator. Feature Graphic is the big image displayed in the web-based Android Market. It could be something simple and it could look like one for this app: https://market.android.com/details?id=menion.android.locus I would input screenshots, title and some slogan and it would generate nice feature graphic. I think many Android developers would appreciate such service.
