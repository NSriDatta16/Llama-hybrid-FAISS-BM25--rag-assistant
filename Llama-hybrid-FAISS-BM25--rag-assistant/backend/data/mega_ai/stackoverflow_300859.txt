There is no way to add DRM protection (i.e. encryption) to static FLV files - anyone who knows the URL can simply download them, or (in some cases) get them out of their browser's cache, and then play them in any supporting player. (However, you can probably prevent people from embedding your content in other sites - google " Hotlinking protection ".) Streaming your FLVs can be done for free with OSS like Red 5 . This doesn't offer "DRM" protection per se, but it does send the video in a file stream, so there is no single file for the user to download and save. It's still possible for the user to capture the file with certain programs, but it's much more inconvenient. As for "real" DRM, the only solution I'm aware of is Adobe Flash Media Rights Management Server . I've never used it, but apparently it will stream DRM-encrypted FLV or MP3 content, and enable you to apply the usual sorts of DRM restrictions.
