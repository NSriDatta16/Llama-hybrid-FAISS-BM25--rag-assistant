It sounds like your question is specific to HP's QTP/BPT. Here are the differences. QTP is really the 'engine' that is used by both BPT and QTP. QTP provides two main views for working with scripts. QTP: The first is the 'Keyword' view which presents a tree of actions and functions. This mode is suited for beginners and allows them to select objects from either the application or from the object repository as well as selecting the methods to be performed on the objects. The script is then generated automatically. The second is the 'Expert' view which allows the display and editing of the scripts source code. The expert veiw provides an IDE for developing the scripts. This view is suited for advanced users. BPT is based on the concept of creating test cases from re-usable business components which in turn are created from keywords. This keyword-driven approach simplifies the process of test case creation by providing a gui that allows the user to 'drag and drop' components to build the test. the script is generated automatically.
