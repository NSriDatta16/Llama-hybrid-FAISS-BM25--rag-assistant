Are clusters discouraged in LabVIEW?

I found this comment in the LabVIEW instrument driver guidelines (section 6.2): If you need more terminals than the recommended patterns, reconsider the grouping of the controls and indicators on the VI. Except for error in and error out, avoid using clusters to minimize the number of terminals. Clusters often require the user to unbundle and rebundle data from the cluster. If National Instruments is discouraging clusters, what does "reconsider the grouping of the controls and indicators on the VI" mean? I really like using clusters, and I think they've improved my VIs. Am I missing something?
