What does non-linearity mean when using only binary predictors?

I'm working on a project that uses genetic data. The dataset has thousands of predictors that are all binary (does the person have a certain letter in a certain position in their genetic code: yes/no). I'm trying to do regression using those predictors, trying to predict the height of the person. Because each predictor can only have two values, I don't see how there can be any non-linear effects other than through variable interactions. Is there any non-linearity here that I'm missing? I'm also thinking about something like a tree-based model (say, random forest). I understand how a tree-based model could outperform a linear regression by assigning different effects (different betas) to certain predictors depending on the value of other predictors. But I would call this "capturing variable interactions". Is there any argument to say that a tree-based model is "capturing non-linear effects" when all the predictors are binary? And another, related question: What would be the effect of using, for example, different SVM kernels?
