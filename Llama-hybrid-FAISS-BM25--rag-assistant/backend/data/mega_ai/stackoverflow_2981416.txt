C++ coverage tool that WORKS?

Been searching for a good coverage tool for a while now. I'm with VC++ 2008. Tried already: NCover, PureCoverage, PartCover and a few others I can't remember their names. None works! Not even with a very basic console application that does almost nothing. Tried to get an evaluation copy from BullsEye and few more others - not only that they require you to ask for it (no automatic process), they don't even answer after you request AND after you ask what's going on, through the support mail. So the question is: Is there any tool, which I can immediately download an evaluation for it, that actually works on VC 2008 projects? Something that will get me going within 10 minutes ? It's funny but it seems to be a very non-trivial request in the area of this kind of software.
