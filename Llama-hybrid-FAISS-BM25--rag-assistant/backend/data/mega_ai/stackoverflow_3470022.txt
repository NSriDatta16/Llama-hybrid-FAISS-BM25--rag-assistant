deserialization of just serialized data fails, why?

I am trying to serialize and deserialize objects in silverlight, but cannot seem to get it to work. Serializing works just fine but it complains about my rootObject not being expected. I don't get it because it it is Silverlight who generated the XML. Btw; i'm still new to C# I have a class which looks like: [XmlRoot("DataStorage")] // has no effect public class DataStorage { public string type { get; set; } public string imgUrl { get; set; } public List children { get; set; } public DataStorage() { type = "default"; children = new List (); } } When serialized by Silverlight it produces: default However, when I attempt to deserialize it produces: System.InvalidOperationException was unhandled by user code Message=There is an error in XML document (2, 2). InnerException: System.InvalidOperationException Message= > was not expected. My deserialization code is as follows: // create the xmlSerializer for DataObject XmlSerializer xmlSerializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(DataObject)); // Open the file again for reading. StreamReader fileStream = new StreamReader(isoStore.OpenFile("IsoStoreFile.xml", FileMode.Open)); XmlReader xmlReader = XmlReader.Create(fileStream); DataObject deserializedObject = (DataObject)xmlSerializer.Deserialize(xmlReader); fileStream.Close(); Debug.WriteLine(deserializedObject); Any idea?
