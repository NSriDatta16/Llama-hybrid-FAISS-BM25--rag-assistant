Yes, is matter when you indexing multiple columns. Prefixes can be up to 1000 bytes long (767 bytes for InnoDB tables). Note that prefix limits are measured in bytes, whereas the prefix length in CREATE TABLE statements is interpreted as number of characters. Be sure to take this into account when specifying a prefix length for a column that uses a multi-byte character set. source : http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/column-indexes.html In a latin1 collation, you can only specify up 3 columns of varchar(255) . While can specify up to 50 columns for varchar(20) In-directly, without proper index, it will slow-down query speed In terms of storage, it does not make difference, as varchar stand for variable-length strings
