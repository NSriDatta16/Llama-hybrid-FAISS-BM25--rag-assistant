Dealing with large amount of data in php/mysql

So i have something like a auction and for each deal or that auction i have to generate random identifier code and assign to user. So i came up with something like this for db storage {1:XKF3325A|ADSTD2351;7:ZARASR23;12:3290OASJX} - so what i have there is user id : random code and some user can have several random codes seperated by |. My question is what type of storing i should use for my db? The codes i generate for users might be over 2k-3k.
