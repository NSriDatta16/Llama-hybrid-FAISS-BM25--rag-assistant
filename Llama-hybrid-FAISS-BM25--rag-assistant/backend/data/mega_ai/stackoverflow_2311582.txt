I always set the permissions of certificates and other files containing sensitive data such that only my development team and the apache service can access the file. This is important if you are using a server shared by a large organization, like a university, where lots of people might have permissions to the file by default. Often I've seen read permissions given to everyone so that the web server can access the file(since it is neither the owner nor in the group permission for the file, the only thing left is to give read to "other"). Instead, I ensure there is a group containing only my development team, and set the read/write permissions for the file to that group. I then use ACL to add a read permission for the APACHE service. You have to use an ACL since the owner and group are normally set to a developer and development team group, leaving you no options for setting access for apache other than using ACL.
