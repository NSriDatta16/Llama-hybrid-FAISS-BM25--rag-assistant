Let's consider an example to understand degrees of freedom: Pretend we have 5 observations, $(1, 2, 1, 3, 5)$. If I tell you the mean of this data set ($2.4$) but not the values of the observations themselves, you can make up four values without changing the mean. If you pick $(3, 4, 3, 5)$ as your first four observations, then the last number to choose must be $-3$ if the mean is fixed at $2.4$. If we only care about the mean, then we have one equation and one unknown. If you have $n$ observations with a fixed mean, you have the freedom to pick any $n - 1$ numbers you want without changing the mean -- but the $n^{th}$ observation is determined. Notice however, I chose the value of $2.4$ in the paragraph above arbitrarily, so I could have chosen something else. Therefore, I have $n - 1$ degrees of freedom from the data and $1$ degree of freedom because I picked the mean, so I have $n$ degrees of freedom if I estimate 1 parameter. Now, let's say I tell you the mean and the standard deviation: for the same sample of $(1, 2, 1, 3, 5)$, the mean is $2.4$ and the standard deviation is $1.673$. Now I can pick three of the five numbers, and the last two will be determined (two equations, two unknowns). The parameters are a little different however, because the sample standard deviation is a function of the sample mean -- they are not independent of each other. This means that I have $n - 2$ degrees of freedom from the data, but still only $1$ degree of freedom from the parameters, for a total of $n - 1$ degrees of freedom. See this Stack Exchange question for more information.
