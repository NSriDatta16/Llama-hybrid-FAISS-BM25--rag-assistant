VAR with stationary and non-stationary in R

I'm working on using Granger causality of some variables and I have 4 stationary time series (X1, X2, X3, X4) and one that is not (X5). I've seen here that If (A) then first-difference each of the three variables (x1, x2, x3), and use them together with the stationary variable x4 to build a VAR model. But if I differenciate the (X5) series, by using VAR in R: Error in VAR(qq2) : NAs in y. where qq2 = cbind(X1,X2,X3,X4,X5) . Because I lose one observation in differencing. Do I need to remove one observation from the other series as well? EDIT: Example provided. Let's assume three series, X1 and X2 stationary. X3 non stationary. X1
