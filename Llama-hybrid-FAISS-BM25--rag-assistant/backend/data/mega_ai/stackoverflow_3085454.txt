This isn't possible with MySQL alone. While MySQL does have a Federated Storage Engine (ie: remote access to other MySQL servers) it doesn't support transactions. That means you can't coordinate a multi-server transaction directly through MySQL. MySQL does support XA for InnoDB tables , so you can use an external transaction manager with MySQL, but PHP doesn't have any support for XA. Generally this is considered an Enterprise-level feature, and you'd implement using Java or C#/.NET .
