About Dijkstra's paper

I am reading Coders at Work . I came across this paragraph in Donald Knuth's interview. Seibel: It seems a lot of the people I’ve talked to had direct access to a machine when they were starting out. Yet Dijkstra has a paper I’m sure you’re familiar with, where he basically says we shouldn’t let computer-science students touch a machine for the first few years of their training; they should spend all their time manipulating symbols. I want link to that paper. Which one paper is that? (He wrote too many :-)
