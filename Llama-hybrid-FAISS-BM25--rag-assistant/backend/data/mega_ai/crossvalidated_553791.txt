Can I calibrate to 100% of my sample in ML regression?

I have a standard ML regression model trained on 80% of my data with 20% saved for testing. I want my model to match my full sample as best possible. Can I multiply my outputs by mean( observations from 100% of my data) / mean( predictions on 100% of my data) ? (This way my average prediction will match my average observation) Why not? And what are the mathematical implications?
