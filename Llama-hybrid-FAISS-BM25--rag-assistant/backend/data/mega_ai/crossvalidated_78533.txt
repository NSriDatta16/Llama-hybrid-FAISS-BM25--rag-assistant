Your problem statement is as close to the definition of binary classification as one can get. It's worth observing that many popular classification algorithms aren't binary internally. Decision trees, neural nets, SVM, ... all have decision values which you could use to calculate a probability. Additionally, if your classifier always predicts miss , something is likely wrong. Try assigning higher weights to positive training instances in whichever way the algorithm of your choosing allows this.
