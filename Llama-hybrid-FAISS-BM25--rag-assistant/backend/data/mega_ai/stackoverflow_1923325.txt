Why is my .Net app contacting Verisign?

I wrote a .Net application that has nothing to do with network communication. There is not a single line of code in the whole application that uses the NIC, but my firewall has caught it trying to contact Verisign for some reason when the app starts. This does not happen regularly; as a matter of fact, it has only happened twice. The last time it happened, I was able to launch Wireshark before telling my firewall to allow access to the network. There was no real data transfer that I can tell. It only captured 9 TCP packets: some SYN packets, some SYN/ACK, and some RST packets (The RST packets were broken). I would suspect one of my third-party dlls, but I don't see why a math library or an image manipulation library would try to establish a connection with Verisign and then do nothing with that connection. My clients are in organizations with tight security; the last thing I want is a phone call asking why my application is connecting to the Internet. Does anyone know why this is happening? Is there a way to prevent it from happening? The .pcap file that Wireshark generated is here .
