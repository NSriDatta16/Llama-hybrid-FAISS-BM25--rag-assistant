What does this notation mean: $F$ at the matrix norm and $Q$ under the $\arg\min$

I am trying to figuring out what is meant by Q and F in the 4th equation mentioned in this paper: Diachronic Word Embeddings Reveal Statistical Laws of Semantic Change They haven't define in the paper what is meant by Q and F . So, I am assuming that they are some fixed mathematical notations.
