How to embed Ruby in C++?

What's the best way to embed Ruby as a scripting language in C++? Using ruby.h? SWIG? Something else? What I need is to expose some C++ objects to Ruby and have the Ruby interpreter evaluate scripts that access these objects. I don't care about extending Ruby or accessing it in C++. I've found this article on embedding Ruby in C++ , and while it's very useful, it's kinda old and I was wondering if there are any other resources on the subject (or open source implementations of similar engines).
