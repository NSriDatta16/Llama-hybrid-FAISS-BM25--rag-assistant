Also check out the re pragma , which will show how regexes are compiled as well as how they execute: $ perl -Mre=debugcolor -e '"huzza" =~ /^(hu)?z{1,2}za$/' Output is: Compiling REx "^(hu)?z{1,2}za$" Final program: 1: BOL (2) 2: CURLYM[1] {0,1} (12) 6: EXACT (10) 10: SUCCEED (0) 11: NOTHING (12) 12: CURLY {1,2} (16) 14: EXACT (0) 16: EXACT (18) 18: EOL (19) 19: END (0) floating "zza"$ at 0..3 (checking floating) anchored(BOL) minlen 3 Guessing start of match in sv for REx "^(hu)?z{1,2}za$" against "huzza" Found floating substr "zza"$ at offset 2...
