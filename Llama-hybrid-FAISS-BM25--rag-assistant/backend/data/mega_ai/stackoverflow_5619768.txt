I need help on this homework/lab

I finished all the classes except for the student class. I don't understand how to approach it. Here is the prompt. Extend the Person class developed in lab1 to derive classes for students, hourly employees, and full-time salaried employees. Determine an appropriate class inheritance hierarchy. These classes should have the following fields, necessary constructors, and appropriate access and modifier methods. for all employees: *department full-time employees: *salary hourly employees: *hourly rate *number of hours worked each week(4weeks) the hourly employee class should contain the necessary methods that will print the total hours (four- week total), average hours per week worked by each employee, and the total wages during a four-week period. student: *classes taken and grades for each class (use an ArrayList) The student class should contain the necessary methods to print the transcript for each student (write a tester class to test your classes) How should I use an arraylist for the student class? I'm only going to post the relevant classes public class Person { private String first; private String last; private static int idNumber = 1001; int Id ; private String full; Person(){ } Person(String fn,String ln){ first = fn; last = ln; Id = idNumber++; full = first +" "+ last; } static int getidNumber(){ return idNumber; } void setfirst(String fn) { first = fn; } String getfirst(){ return first; } void setlast(String ln){ last = ln; } String getlast(){ return last; } @Override public String toString(){ String blah = "First name: " +first+ " Last Name:" +last+ "\tThe full name is: "+full+" Id#"+Id; return blah; } } import java.util.*; public class Student extends Person{ Student (String fn, String ln){ super(fn,ln); } } Thank you in advance for all advices and suggestions.
