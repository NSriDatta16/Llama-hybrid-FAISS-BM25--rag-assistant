Afaik... First you need to get the data of GPS by using Location baser services provided in Android SDK(See Location MAnager, Location Listener etc etc...) Confusion:- The confusion is that How can I make a server. Ans: Cant help you with this because i m not expert at configuring servers How to transfer data from Android to server and what application required at server end which receive the data from Android. Is any desktop or console application needed which bind it-self at particular port of server, or web page is enough for me to achieve this target. Ans: You can transfer the data that consists of the Latitude and Longitude using a webservice that recieves the data using get or post methods and then dumps it into your database every time the OnLocationChanged method is called on Location Listener. Preferably u can configure a mysql database in your server and then use it for your data storage. The web page you need to design in such a way that it frequently gets the location related data from the database and then display markers accordingly. What protocol which I have to use UDP or TCP/IP, or use directly the HTTP or HTTPS steam? Ans: If you are aware of php then u can use REST services or if you are .Net kind of guy you can use a SOAP webservice that uses simple http post methods to update data to the server. Hope this helps.
