Do the programs check whether the new output is the same as the old before writing? If not, then it doesn't seem like the symlinks will offer any advantage, since the datastore will always uniquified in the course of running the analysis. Are you able to change the way that the programs write their output? The following sequence will avoid following the symlink: write the new output to out.tmp if the old output out and out.tmp are identical, delete out.tmp otherwise, move out.tmp on top of out How big is the data? Is it big enough that it's worth the effort to optimize the storage requirement? You can always save the full output, and run some analysis (in the simplest case, diff ) after the fact to see if the data is the same. If it is many GBs of data, you may want to look in to a filesystem that will optimize the duplicate data for you (the feature is known as "de-duplication"). Or, you can use LVM's snapshot support , which allows cheap copy-on-write snapshots of a filesystem. As a poor-man's de-duplicating file system, you can do something like this in bash: for file in $output_files; do md5=`md5sum $file | awk '{print $1}'` if [ ! -f "db/$md5" ]; then mv $file db/$md5 fi ln -sf db/$md5 $file done
