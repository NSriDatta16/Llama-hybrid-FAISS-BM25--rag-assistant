If you're loading "other parts" of your site only via AJAX calls, you can store a value in global javascript namespace which just indicates that you already executed that action. Otherwise, you're doing a complete page refresh (redirect to another site) there is no clean javascript solution. In that case you need to store a cookie , make usage of the local storage or bring your server script into play.
