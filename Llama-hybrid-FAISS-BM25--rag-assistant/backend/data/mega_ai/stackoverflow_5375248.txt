Creating a generic VMware control library

In our organization, we're running several VM solutions from VMware: VMware ESX VMware ESXi (now called Hypervisor/vSphere) VMware Workstation I'd like to be able to control all of these in a transparent way (send power commands, revert to a given snapshot to begin with) as part of an automated process of our product. My problem is that there are far too many APIs and i've failed to find any good samples on how to achieve this. Anyone has any experience with creating this sort of library? which VMware APIs need to be used?
