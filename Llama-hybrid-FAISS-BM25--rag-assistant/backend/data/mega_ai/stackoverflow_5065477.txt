Personally I do see an issue that can be inconveniencing for the user: When most people register with a web site, they expect that they will have to answer quite a few questions, spend some time reading the FAQ and the terms of service and then spend some more time setting up some preliminary aspects of their profile. The traditional flow allows the user to choose the time to go through that process. Afterwards, the user only receives a verification link, which normally is a 3-second process to use and can be done at practically any time. Your proposed flow forces the potential user of your site to spend time reading your documentation, then wait until they receive the message and then find some more time, potentially after a few days, to fill in the forms. I, for one, would find that at least slightly annoying - if not outright discouraging - especially if the mail takes its sweet time to arrive, as it's often bound to do. I also don't like the inherent implication of such a scheme: Traditional flow : "Oh nice, you filled in our forms, just give us an address to send you a proper verification". The user here is merely waiting to complete what is essentially a done deal. Mail-first flow : "Oh it's you . Well, wait for a while and we will send you an invitation if we want you". Here, on the other hand, the user is left in a limbo of subconscious uncertainty until they receive your message. I believe that the first approach is far more open and friendly to the user. It's also the current standard flow for these cases, which should be enough of an incentive to use on its own - you should avoid forcing your users into processes they are not used to, unless there is no other way.
