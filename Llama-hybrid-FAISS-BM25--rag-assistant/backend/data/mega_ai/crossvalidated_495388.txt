If you want the centriod, it's just $(\bar{X}, \bar{Y})$ . If you want weighted means, you can multiply each value by its weight before summing and then divide by the sum of the weights to compute the weighted mean. If it's more convenient for you, copy each datum weight times and then average. Here's a simple example, coded in R: d = data.frame(x=c(3,2,7), y=c(5,6,2)) d = d[rep(1:3, times=c(2,4,8)),] print(d, row.names=FALSE) # x y # 3 5 # 3 5 # 2 6 # 2 6 # 2 6 # 2 6 # 7 2 # 7 2 # 7 2 # 7 2 # 7 2 # 7 2 # 7 2 # 7 2 colMeans(d) # x y # 5.000000 3.571429 plot(d) points(5, 3.57, pch=16, col="red")
