Interpretability is kinda tough with Random Forests. While RF is an extremely robust classifier it makes its predictions democratically. By this I mean you build hundreds or thousands of trees by taking a random subset of your variables and a random subset of your data and build a tree. Then make a prediction for all the non-selected data and save the prediction. Its robust because it deals well with the vagaries of your data set, (ie it smooths over randomly high/low values, fortuitous plots/samples, measuring the same thing 4 different ways, etc). However if you have some highly correlated variables, both may seem important as they are not both always included in each model. One potential approach with random forests may be to help whittle down your predictors then switch to regular CART or try the PARTY package for inference based tree models. However then you must be wary about data mining issues, and making inferences about parameters.
