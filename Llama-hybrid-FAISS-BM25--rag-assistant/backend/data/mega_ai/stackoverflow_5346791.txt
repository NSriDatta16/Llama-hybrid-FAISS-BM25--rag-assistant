MySQL - SUM(GROUP BY)?

I'm having an issue where I need to get the sum of a group of values in a select statement,. Basically, I need to: SELECT col1, col2, SUM(col2) AS col3 FROM myTable GROUP BY col1 where col1 will wind up into about 3 groups and col2 contains around 40 values... so I don't need col3 to be the same value [the sum of col2] but the sum for col2 for each group of col1 * EDIT * ok - here is the actual query: select a.id,a.alloyname,a.label,a.symbol, g.grade, if(a.id = 1,( ((( select avg(cost/2204.6) as averageCost from nas_cost where cost != '0' and `date` >= '#variables.firstOfMonth#' and `date` = 0,((ep.estPrice - t.value)* (astm.astm/100)), 0)), 0))))) as thisValue from nas_alloys a left join nas_triggers t on t.alloyid = a.id left join nas_astm astm on astm.alloyid = a.id left join nas_estimatedprice ep on ep.alloyid = a.id left join nas_grades g on g.id = astm.gradeid order by g.grade; I need the total of 'thisValue' grouped by grade... trying to get my head around it..
