I've gone the root of rolling my own library for that (In c# but should be easy to understand for a Java developer). Rxrdg started as a solution to a problem of creating test data for a real life project. The basic idea is to leverage the existing (regular expression) validation patterns to create random data that conforms to such patterns. This way valid random data is created. It is not that difficult to write a parser for simple regex patterns. Using an abstract syntax tree to generate strings should be even easier.
