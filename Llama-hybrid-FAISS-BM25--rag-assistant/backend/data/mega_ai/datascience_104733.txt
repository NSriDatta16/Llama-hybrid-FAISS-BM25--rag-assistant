quereies related to autoencoder

i want to design an deep auto encoder after following keras tutorial. Input is a simple 2-dimensional image consists of 512 rows and 50 columns matrix My trial code is encoded = Dense(128, activation='relu')(input_img) encoded = Dense(64, activation='relu')(encoded) encoded = Dense(32, activation='relu')(encoded) decoded = Dense(32, activation='relu')(encoded) decoded = Dense(64, activation='relu')(decoded) decoded = Dense(128, activation='sigmoid')(decoded) autoencoder = Model(input_img, decoded) encoder = Model(input_img, encoded) i have some queries I need to clarify. In the above code what is the size of the latent space.Is it 32 dimension.But my image is 2dimensional then how the information is compressed, can anybody clarify it. b) does the latent space size is always = number of neurons of last encoder layer(i.e. 32)
