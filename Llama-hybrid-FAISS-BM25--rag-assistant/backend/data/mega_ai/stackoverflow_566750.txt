The question is unclear, but by using Invoke, you are defeating the purpose of having the image request on a separate thread. (You might notice that your interface becomes unresponsive while the request is happening) Instead, it is better to create a new thread object, start it, and then use the Invoke to set the image (after it has been retrieved), something along the lines of private void menuItem1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e) { etiquetaCargando.Visible = true; Thread reqThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(RequestImage)); reqThread.Start(); } private void RequestImage() { /* Get the image ... */ Invoke(SetTheImage, new object[] { theImage }); } this assumes that you have a method SetTheImage which will actually do the job of displaying the image on your form.
