Well, I would suggest to start with identifying the use cases for your IDE: 1. Maintain files (open, save, delete, rename) 2. Parse Code Syntax and display results. 3. Pass File to compiler and display results. ( And then write out the simple steps of what these use cases do. This will help alot as well as giving you a 'context' for all those niggly little requirements that will pop up. Otherwise it's simply a list of functionality and very hard to organize, implement consistently and completely and know you caught everything.) So, you could say you have 3 domain objects now: File and Code and Compiler. Anyway it's a start Yes, A HUGE project for simple curiosity. You might alos look at how eclipse is built as well as how an OO compiler is built. These may give you ideas as to your domain objects
