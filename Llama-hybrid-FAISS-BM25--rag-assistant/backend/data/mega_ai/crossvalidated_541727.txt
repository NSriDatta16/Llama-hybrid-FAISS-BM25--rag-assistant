Are overestimated correlations detrimental for component scores of PCA?

In some cases, we may want to use principal component analysis on several time-series variables, or some regionalized random variables (i.e., spatial varying variables). The variability of these variables usually contain large-scale trend, which might result in the variables being correlated. Therefore, the correlation obtained from conventional multivariate statistics might be overestimated. I want to know what is the effect of the overestimated correlation for PCA scores? Whether should I detrend the variables before performing PCA?
