When should I release my code?

I've been holding off on releasing a library I wrote because it is the first library which I'll be releasing publicly. Here are my concerns: The library isn't complete it is in a very usable state, I'd say it is version 0.3, however it still lacks a number of features which I would like to at some point implement, and control how they're implemented (meaning not merging someones implementation). I'm fearful of criticism, I know there are a few things which should be reorganized/refactored, but I wrote the initial class quickly to be functional for another project I am working on. So when is the best time to release? Should I just throw it up on github and work on the issues post-release? Or should I wait until I refactor and feel completely comfortable with what I have written? Most classes/libraries I see are always very elegantly written, however I have not seen any in very early release stages, are a lot of classes fairly sloppy upon initial release?
