Taking into account the few valuable rectifying comments ,here is a my attempt to answer the question using the approach suggested in the original (incorrect ) solution.It would have been too long for a comment .However the answer is not some elegant expression. \begin{align} S &= a_1+\cdots+a_n , \\ A &= a_1-a_2+a_3+\cdots . \end{align} I want to compute the probability that $S. A . Here is my attempt: Let $E_1$ be the event that $S>0$ and $E_2$ be the event that $A>0.$ To simplify things assume $n$ is even, to begin with. We observe that $S>0$ if more than half of $a_i$ 's are +1. . We have: \begin{equation} P(E_1 \cap E_2)=P(E_1 | E_2)P(E_2)=P(E_2 | E_1)P(E_1) \end{equation} Now, \begin{align} P(E_1) &= P(S>0) \\ & =\sum_{k=\frac{n}{2}+1}^n \binom{n}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{2^n}. \end{align} . Now to compute $P(E_2 | E_1)$ we make the following simple observations: Every +1 at an even place will contribute negatively and every -1 will contribute to positively in the alternating sum $A$ So given $S>0,$ we would wish to enumerate the ways in which the alternating sum $A$ can be negative .Let the number of +1's and the number of -1's that go to even places be respectively $l$ and $m.$ Since the total number of even places is $ \frac n2 ,$ we have the following constraints : $$ 0 \leq l \leq \min\{ n/2,k\}$$ and $$ 0 \leq m \leq \min\{ n/2-l,n-k\}$$ With this arrangement and assuming $E_1$ ,the value the alternating sum will become: $$ (k-l)-l-(n-k-m)+m=2k-2l+2m-n$$ and this we need to be less than zero. so the number of ways of arranging $k>n/2$ +1's and $n-k$ -1's so that $A can be expressed as $$ \displaystyle \sum_{k=n/2+1}^{n-1} \binom{k}{l} \binom{n-k}{m} \binom{n-l-m}{k-l} $$ subject to the constraints : \begin{align} & 0 \leq l \leq \min\{ n/2,k\} \\ & 0 \leq m \leq \min\{ n/2-l,n-k\}\\ &2k-2l+2m-n This gives us $P(E_2|E_1),$ after taking probability of this arrangement into account .That value is to be multiplied by \begin{align} P(E_1) &= P(S>0) \\ & =\sum_{k=\frac{n}{2}+1}^n \binom{n}{k} \cdot \frac{1}{2^n} \end{align} .to get the requisite probability.Again ,it is my humble request to that mistakes ,if any be pointed out and kindly tell me whether solution through this approach is possible
