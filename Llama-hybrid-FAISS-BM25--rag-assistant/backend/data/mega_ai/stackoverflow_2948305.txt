Does some Integer data types differnate with other Programming languages?

Do Integer data types allow spaces when it should be just numeric? Do other programming languages allow spaces in an Integer data type? For example, MySQL database storage does not allow spaces to be stored in an int data type. Do other languages allow it when storing in their own int type?
