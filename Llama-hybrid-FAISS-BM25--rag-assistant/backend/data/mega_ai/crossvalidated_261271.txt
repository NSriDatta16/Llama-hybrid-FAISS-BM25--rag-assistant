Imputation methods for time series data

I have some network data which measures the noise levels in a cellular network. On a typical mast there are generally 3 sectors or antennas which point in different directions. Within one of these antennas there can be multiple frequencies which all serve roughly the same geographic area. I have two weeks of 15 min data which is 1343 observations and I have this data for 12 cells/sectors in the network. Within this dataset I have a very small number of missing values for each variable. As you can see from the summary I have a very small number of missing objects in each variable: > str(wideRawDF) 'data.frame': 1343 obs. of 13 variables: $ Period.Start.Time: POSIXlt, format: "2017-01-20 16:30:00" "2017-01-20 16:45:00" "2017-01-20 17:00:00" "2017-01-20 17:15:00" ... $ DO0182U09A3 : num -102 -101 -101 -101 -101 ... $ DO0182U09B3 : num -103.4 -102.8 -103.3 -95.9 -103 ... $ DO0182U09C3 : num -103.9 -104.2 -103.9 -99.2 -104.1 ... $ DO0182U21A1 : num -105 -105 -105 -104 -102 ... $ DO0182U21A2 : num -105 -104 -105 -105 -105 ... $ DO0182U21A3 : num -105 -105 -105 -105 -105 ... $ DO0182U21B1 : num -102 -103 -104 -104 -104 ... $ DO0182U21B2 : num -99.4 -102 -104 -101.4 -104.1 ... $ DO0182U21B3 : num -104 -104 -104 -104 -104 ... $ DO0182U21C1 : num -105 -105 -105 -104 -105 ... $ DO0182U21C2 : num -104 -105 -105 -103 -105 ... $ DO0182U21C3 : num -105 -105 -105 -105 -105 ... > summary(wideRawDF) Period.Start.Time DO0182U09A3 DO0182U09B3 DO0182U09C3 DO0182U21A1 DO0182U21A2 Min. :2017-01-20 16:30:00 Min. :-104.23 Min. :-105.90 Min. :-106.43 Min. :-106.16 Min. :-105.94 1st Qu.:2017-01-24 04:22:30 1st Qu.:-102.20 1st Qu.:-104.53 1st Qu.:-105.18 1st Qu.:-105.41 1st Qu.:-105.37 Median :2017-01-27 16:15:00 Median :-101.32 Median :-103.14 Median :-103.74 Median :-105.20 Median :-105.15 Mean :2017-01-27 16:15:00 Mean : -99.75 Mean :-102.21 Mean :-103.12 Mean :-105.00 Mean :-104.85 3rd Qu.:2017-01-31 04:07:30 3rd Qu.: -99.42 3rd Qu.:-101.21 3rd Qu.:-102.73 3rd Qu.:-104.89 3rd Qu.:-104.78 Max. :2017-02-03 16:00:00 Max. : -85.96 Max. : -69.96 Max. : -83.16 Max. : -88.01 Max. : -91.49 NA's :7 NA's :10 NA's :10 NA's :10 NA's :10 DO0182U21A3 DO0182U21B1 DO0182U21B2 DO0182U21B3 DO0182U21C1 DO0182U21C2 DO0182U21C3 Min. :-106.42 Min. :-105.40 Min. :-105.40 Min. :-105.45 Min. :-106.08 Min. :-106.45 Min. :-106.47 1st Qu.:-105.48 1st Qu.:-104.48 1st Qu.:-104.41 1st Qu.:-104.46 1st Qu.:-105.42 1st Qu.:-105.45 1st Qu.:-105.48 Median :-105.32 Median :-103.92 Median :-103.90 Median :-103.77 Median :-105.14 Median :-105.18 Median :-105.27 Mean :-105.06 Mean :-103.19 Mean :-103.09 Mean :-102.87 Mean :-104.96 Mean :-104.97 Mean :-105.08 3rd Qu.:-105.08 3rd Qu.:-102.73 3rd Qu.:-102.50 3rd Qu.:-101.53 3rd Qu.:-104.80 3rd Qu.:-104.87 3rd Qu.:-104.92 Max. : -89.24 Max. : -86.43 Max. : -81.07 Max. : -85.27 Max. : -93.65 Max. : -87.37 Max. : -86.89 NA's :10 NA's :3 NA's :3 NA's :3 As part of my analysis on this dataset I am getting bogged down in the intricacies of data imputation. I have read a number of Stack Overflow and Cross Validated articles as well as a number of papers but I am going off on tangents every time I look at a new paper. My data is not normally distributed, in fact it is right skewed so I can't use the mtsdi EM algorithm since it requires normality. imputeTS is for uni-variate time data so this is not of use to me either. I am currently trying to figure out an issue with the TestMCARNormality function in the MissMech package which I hope will confirm that my missingness is MCAR I can impute using a non-parametric method because of the non-normality. What reasons would prevent me from using either linear, spline or stine interpolation to fill in these missing values?
