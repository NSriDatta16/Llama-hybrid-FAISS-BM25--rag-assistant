How to analyse this simulation

So, here's the situation: I have some simulation results, from a simulation driven by two parameters. One of these parameters has two settings, the other has four each was replicated ten times for a total of 80 sets of results. Each simulation produces results for each of four groups. The progress of each group was measured by seven variables. Thus there are 28 results from each simulation. I am certain (due to the implementation of the simulation) that these results are to some extent influencing each other. Three of the outcome variables describe how well the group did in intergroup competitions (which influenced the quantity of rescources available to the group) and four describe the behaviours that the agents learned to use (which is influenced by the quantity of resources available to the group) What I'd like to test is: Did the two parameters influence the four behaviour outcomes and if so in what direction? Did the groups that performed well or poorly in the intergroup competitions (as measured by three variables) behave differently (as measured by these four variables) and if so how? For some reason I'm struggling to get my head around the right approach to take here, but I've got the nagging sensation that it should be obvious.
