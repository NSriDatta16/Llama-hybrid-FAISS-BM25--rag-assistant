Understanding Covariance Matrix- Formula

I watched Andrew NG's lecture on PCA and happened to come across this formula for computing Covariance Matrix which I don't comprehend . I feel there's no need for a summation(sigma) over ranging from i=1 to n , when that purpose is served by the 'Transpose term of x(i) ' . I've seen formulae like this : where Covariance of a matrix Z is computed by just Z.Z' without the need for summation . So , if both the formulae are computing the covariance matrix , I don't understand why their formula differ . Why do we need a summation ? Can someone breakdown the formulae ( perhaps with an example) to help me understand if there are any differences between the two ? Both are formulae of covariance matrix.
