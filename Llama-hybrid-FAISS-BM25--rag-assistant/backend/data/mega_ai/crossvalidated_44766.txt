You said: "The goal is to predict the price for a number of routes not included in the sample." Therefore, fixed effects will almost certainly not work for you. The port fixed effect will soak up all of the variation in variables that vary only by port, leaving you with no coefficients on any port-specific characteristics. You want to determine what each port characteristic does on average to your prices (on average, holding all other characteristics constant), so that you can make predictions for future ports if you know their characteristics. If you include fixed effects, you lose the ability to do so, because you don't know what each port characteristic does to your prices.
