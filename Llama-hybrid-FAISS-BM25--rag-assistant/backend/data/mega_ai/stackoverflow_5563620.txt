These options are more intended for URL arguments parsing, which you are trying to do. 1. Range search : for a word, a character most efficient but can be fastidious to write... (and read!) See rangeOfString: and its friends on NSString documentation 2. Split quick and elegant to write, but not so efficient Since it is a URL argument style string, it is easily parsable by splitting on & and = witch can be done easily using componentsSeparatedByString: or componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet: 3. Regular expressions clean code, powerful Regular expressions are imho the best choice to manipulate text, but they can be harder to use/learn than previous solutions. To use regular expressions I suggest two options: iPhone OS >= 3.2 has regular expressions : NSString rangeOfString:options:NSRegularExpressionSearch But this is close to option 1. RegexKitLit , with provides an excellent regular expression engine on OSX/iOS would provide, imho, the best and most powerful solution to your problem (and many others!!!)... 4. Other Kits/API/SDK the missing api/toolkit/sdk? don't write code thousands people already wrote... I wished that NSURL would support URL arguments, for parsing and build urls... but it does not. I don't know a good URL parsing/toolbox library that offers such URL Arguments manipulation tools (Google Toolbox does not provide such URL arguments tools except for escaping which is already really useful) but I'm sure that exists! And a good library, with tested and reliable code would be for sure your best solution... 5. Others... there are many I forgot to mention NSScanner which I never really looked into (bad me) More generally, Apple documentation on this topic is interesting.
