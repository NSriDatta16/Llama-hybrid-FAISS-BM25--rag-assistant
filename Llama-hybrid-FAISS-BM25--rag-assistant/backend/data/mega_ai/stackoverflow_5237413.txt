Both your queries return same data, may be different orders. But they touch same data on disk/table space/ may be same indexes too (Can you please put explain for query 2). First query actually warms caches for you, it will get data in memory and so second query is fast. Can we make it faster?, probably its very fast already, its looking only 3 records, so index is perfect. First query may be was done on cold caches/bufferspools. Next time while doing benchmarking warm the caches first by running few random queries and check. As suggested by @The-Scrum-Meister you can remove index RemoveMeDate , it will speed up your inserts and if its getting used now will reduce some pressure on memory. Check if you need to tune the server/storage engine itself to fully utilize hardware available and make server fast.
