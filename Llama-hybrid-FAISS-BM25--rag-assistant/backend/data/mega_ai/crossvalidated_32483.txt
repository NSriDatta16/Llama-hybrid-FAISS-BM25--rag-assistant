I don't see anything obviously wrong with the paragraph in quotations, but I haven't seen the data and cannot check is numbers. However, the two paragraphs that follow it are very unclear. Suppose he had said, "Overall, nonsmokers who were morbidly obese had a relative risk of coronary heart disease of 1.25 (95 percent confidence interval, 1.17 to 1.32) as compared with nonsmokers who had normal body weight." Would anyone have reason to doubt him?
