How to identify if a variable is quasiperiodic?

At the core of this question is an ignorance of what a quasiperiodic variable (or collection of variables in a multivariable system) actually is. I don't have a particular data set in mind, but rather I am seeking to expand my repertoire of patterns to look for in future exploratory data analysis of time series. Wikipedia gives this description: Quasiperiodicity is the property of a system that displays irregular periodicity. Periodic behavior is defined as recurring at regular intervals, such as "every 24 hours". Quasiperiodic behavior is a pattern of recurrence with a component of unpredictability that does not lend itself to precise measurement. It is different from the mathematical concept of an almost periodic function, which has increasing regularity over multiple periods. The mathematical definition of quasiperiodic function is a completely different concept; the two should not be confused. Their description tells me a few things about what a quasiperiodic variable isn't, but I still feel quite in the dark about what it is. What is it?
