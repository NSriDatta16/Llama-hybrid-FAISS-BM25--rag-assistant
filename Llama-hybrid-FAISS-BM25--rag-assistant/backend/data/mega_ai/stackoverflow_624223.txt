You never pass an object as an argument - you only ever pass a reference or a value type value. Unless you use the ref keyword, arguments are passed by value - i.e. the initial value of the parameter is the evaluated value of the argument, and changes to the value of the parameter aren't seen by the caller. However, it's very important to understand that the value of the parameter (for a reference type) is just the reference . If you change the contents of the object that the reference refers to, then that change will be seen by the caller. It's a topic which deserves more than a few paragraphs - I suggest you read my article about parameter passing in .NET for more information.
