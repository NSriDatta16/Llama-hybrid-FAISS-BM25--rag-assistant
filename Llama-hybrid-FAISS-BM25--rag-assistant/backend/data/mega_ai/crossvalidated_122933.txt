For a more detailed description of these models see Chapter 5 from the book: Bayesian Data Analysis One of the problems with fixing the parameter $b=1$ is that the shape of the distribution of $\sigma^2$ is restricted which, in some cases, might be unrealistic or induce bias on the inference on the remaining parameters. These kind of models can be easily implemented using BUGS or JAGS in a Bayesian framework and you do not need to restrict any of the parameter values. Also, the shape of the prior is updated with the information of the data, resulting in a posterior distribution of the variables. The book I mentioned presents some codes for doing so.
