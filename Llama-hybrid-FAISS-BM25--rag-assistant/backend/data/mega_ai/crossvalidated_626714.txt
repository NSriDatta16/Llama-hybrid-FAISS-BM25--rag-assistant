Is logistic regression with random effects appropriate for my problem?

My problem is the following: I have 1/0 "conversion" outcomes. I have samples from three groups: people who speak russian, people who speak japanese, people who speak portuguese. i expect the conversion rate will be different from each group. each language group is placed within a treatment or control cohort randomly. there is a 50/50 split within each language group. so i have one coefficient, $T$ , which is a fixed effect, for the treatment effect. then i have one other coefficient, $L$ , which I think should be the random effect for each group. $Y_i = \alpha + T_i + L_{\gamma} + e$ where $L_{\gamma} = N(0, \sigma_\gamma^2 I)$ i believe this is correct because I expect the conversion (and therefore the variance) to vary by group. the people sampled for each language group are also a random sample. therefore, to stabilize the variance, it seems to be that we must have an error term, and a random effect, for each language group. a fixed categorical effect it would seem to me is not quite right because the assumption would be equal variance for each sample. does this seem right?
