How can I implement a 1D CNN in front of my LSTM network

At the moment I reshape my X_train like this: X_train = input.reshape(1,1,12) model = Sequential() model.add(LSTM(100,input_shape=(1, 12))) model.add(Dense(100, activation='relu')) model.add(Dropout(0.5)) model.add(Dense(9, activation='sigmoid')) But now I am thinking of implementing a 1D CNN in front of this LSTM layer. Does anybody know how this should be done?
