PCA and demeaning

Suppose I give a test to many students. I record their performance in each question ( a score) and create a set of variables: the responses of students to each question, so that the scores for each question is a variable. I then wish to do principal component analysis on these variables to find the common components. Two natural common components are the ability/knowledge of the student versus the complexity level of each question (let's assume both exist in the data). Since the complexity of each question is not a very interesting factor, I wish to eliminate that factor from the start. My intuition is that by demeaning each variable before doing PCA (or stacking the variables, running a regression on question fixed effects, and saving the residuals), the complexity factor is eliminated by definition because the complexity factor varies across questions but not across individuals within each question. Therefore, removing the mean differences across questions removes the underlying factor. Is this correct?
