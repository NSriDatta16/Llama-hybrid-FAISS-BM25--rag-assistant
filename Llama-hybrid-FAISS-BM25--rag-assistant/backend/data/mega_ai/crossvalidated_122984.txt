It's largely a question of emphasis, since both data consist of cross sectional and time series components. Panel data is more likely to have large N and smaller T. There is more attention to the individual components (e.g. stores over time, consumers over time) and more likelihood of segmenting those individual components (e.g. high income consumers, consumers who have moved from middle to high income). The individual components have survival/replacement issues (the components leave the study for some reason, and must be replaced). With econometric data you are more likely to be dealing at a more aggregated level and it's often somebody else's problem (e.g. those fine folks at the BLS) to deal with those issues. Autocorrelation issues do arise, but often are modeled as past history rather than as an autocorrelation per se, e.g. your past history of buying Chocolate Frosted Sugar Bombs http://www.gocomics.com/calvinandhobbes/1986/03/22 informs the prediction of future buying behavior.
