You might be interested in Spring Slices . It basically allows you to have fragments of a web application deployed as individual bundles. Depending upon the complexity of your overall offering this may be desirable. I've not looked at it seriously for a while, so I'm not too sure of it's current status, though I expect it's improved greatly since I last looked. Anyone with more up to date info please feel free to add links. http://blog.springsource.com/2009/08/07/slices-menu-bar-screencast/
