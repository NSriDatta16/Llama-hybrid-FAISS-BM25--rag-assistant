Dates inverted when stored through SSIS to Oracle Database

I am storing dates though SSIS to an oracle table . I am using a Execute SQL Task , when i view the dates in SSIS it looks like, example '01-APR-2008' but when it is stored in oracle database, it stores it as '08-APR-01', as you can see the dates are inverted and i have no way controlling the behavior here. Anyone has an idea, i can post the whole configuration if required, The Execute SQL task has a query like the one below: "INSERT INTO Test.TimeTable (TIME_DIM_ID) select '"+(DT_STR, 50,1252) @[User::ReadingDate] +"' from dual" where @User:: ReadingDate is a variable of Data Type DateTime , and its value is (01-APR-08 9:38:27 PM) this is just the default value, the variable is populated by another task, and the dates in the variable are then picked up by the EXECUTE SQL Task , but they are inverted at the point of storage.
