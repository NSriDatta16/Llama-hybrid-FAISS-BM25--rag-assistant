The solution x* will be two real values. This sort of decision boundary is typical in mixture models, for instance $\sigma_1^2 = 1$ is a "typical" scenario, and $\sigma_2^2 = 100$ is an "outlier" scenario. The low variance, highly peeked distribution is selected around its mean; elsewhere above and below this region attributed to the low variance distribution, the diffuse high variance distribution is selected. West & Harrison discuss models involving "typical" and "outlier" observation variance $V$ , in their notation $V_\text{typical}=1$ and $V_\text{outlier} = 100$ . West, Mike, and Jeff Harrison.
