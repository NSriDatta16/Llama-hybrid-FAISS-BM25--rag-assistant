You can store binary data such as an image into a BLOB field in a database. It's as simple as putting the file contents into an INSERT statement. However, I highly suggest you take a look at some of these threads. Storing an image in a database is usually not the best way to go: User Images: Database or filesystem storage? Storing images in database: Yea or nay? Should I store my images in the database or folders? Would you store binary data in database or folders? Store pictures as files or or the database for a web app? Storing a small number of images: blob or fs? store image in filesystem or database?
