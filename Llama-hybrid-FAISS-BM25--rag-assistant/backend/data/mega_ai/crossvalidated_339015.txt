Let me briefly answer, and I'm happy to elaborate as need be. It sounds as though the model you want to run is random = ~1 + Time | Person This will account for a different "average" for each person, and it will allow for a random slope for time. Though, in this case, if you have only two times points (with all individuals having the same values), this such a model doesn't have enough "randomness" to draw from to separate estimated value and variation. That is, you are essentially just modeling the exact difference for each person from time 1 to time 2. However, for the other values, which have multiple measurements at different times, these values may not be consistent from person to person, so there may be a meaningful amount of variation in the model. Lastly, you can add anything to the random equation that was measured at each time point. And you cannot add anything to the random equation that was measured only once for the individual (that can only be a fixed effect). Hope this helps.
