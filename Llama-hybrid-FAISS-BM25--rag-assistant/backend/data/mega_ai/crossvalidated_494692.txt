You can use ARMA.autocov in the ts.extend package The ts.extend package contains a number of functions that compute theoretical aspects of stationary ARMA models, including the auto-correlation and auto-covariance functions, the auto-covariance matrix, and the standard probability functions for the stationary Gaussian ARMA model (i.e., density, distribution, and random-generation function). The ARMA.autocov function takes an auto-regression vector ar and a moving-average vector ma (so long as the AR polynomial is for a stationary model) and gives the auto-correlation or auto-covariance function up to any specified length n . (This function extends a similar function in the stats package, which lets you get the auto-correlation, but not the auto-covariance. $^\dagger$ ) This can be implemented using the following syntax. #Set the parameters AR Note here that the parameter $\sigma$ is not part of the ARMA.autocov function, but it affects the auto-covariance by using multiplication by $\sigma^2$ . $^\dagger$ The function stats::ARMAacf computes the auto- correlation function, but there does not appear to be any function in the stats package to compute the auto- covariance function , which is quite annoying. If you can separately compute the variance of the time-series values (i.e., the first element of the auto-covariance function) then you can multiply the auto-correlation function to get the auto-covariance function, but the stats package does not appear to give you a way to do this.
