Chi-square on a categorical variables (derived from continuous distribution)

We know that Chi-Square can be used with categorical data (such as Male/Female, Republican/Democrat, etc). However, I convert my original continuous data to categorical variables and then use Chi-square analysis on it. Is the approach correct? It has been pointed out to me at continuous vs categorical logistic regression for marks and admission that using such an approach with logistic regression may be flawed. Not sure if Chi-square is also affected the same way. The actual scenario is given below (can also be seen on the mentioned weblink) : I have a list of marks scored by students in Science (X, between 0 to 100%) and whether they went to college to or not (Y). High marks in science showed a higher concentration of college admits and low marks had the second best hit rate (students went for Arts degree, etc). Scores in the intermediate range had a lower hit rate. Most students have lower scores in Science. I divided my sample into 5 bins: 0-10, 10-20, 20-80, 80-90, 90-100. Found Chi-Sq to be significant. My main question is - Is categorizing such marks into bins correct?
