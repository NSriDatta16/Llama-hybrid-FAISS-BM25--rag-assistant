Is my model overfitted?

I am using a naive bayes classifier to classify 20 newsgroup dataset. My accuracy on the training set is 97 and on the testing set is 89. Is my model overfitted? If it is what steps can I take to prevent overfitting. My code has an nlp preprocessing method, a pipeline that performs count vectorization , tdidf transformation and mulinomiall naive bayes. Uses bigrams,max df=0.8, min df = 2. Alpha set to 1.
