Number of days looks quantitative to me. "Nominal" means that the data labels are just names, with not even any order to them, but that is not the case here. But why can't days be e.g. 2, 4, 6, or more? Is this something to do with observing, i.e. people only looked at the insects on certain days? I don't think we have enough background here. Are you monitoring individual insects, so that you can track say insect #42 Healthy -- Healthy -- Sick -- Dead? Or you are just counting totals of the categories? If you have individual trajectories you can look at transition probabilities using Markov chain ideas; otherwise this is essentially a table of counts with time flavour and bar charts and a chi-square test might be a starting point. Presumably "Dead" is irreversible but otherwise what are the rules? Is any transition between Healthy, Sick and Diapause allowed? (If you say bug on this forum, people are more likely to think of software, not entomology, so you need to explain.) Facetious aside: the observation that the longer you wait, the likelier it is that insects have died seems unsurprising to this amateur; you need a statistical test to back that up???
