Can I interpret coefficients for "Year" as differences between years that are not explained by my predictors?

I am doing statistical analysis of a natural experiment that consists of multiple years of measurements. I have two independent variables that are physically related to Y . I am interested in whether there are differences between years that are not explained by the model. I want to test whether a third predictor can reduce the differences between years. I added Year as a categorial predictor in my linear regression (I am using natural cubic splines). My model looks like this: Linear Regression Model ols(formula = depend ~ rcs(X1, 3) + rcs(X2, 4) + Yearf, data = data, x = T, y = T) Model Likelihood Discrimination Ratio Test Indexes Obs 869 LR chi2 805.76 R2 0.604 sigma0.6327 d.f. 10 R2 adj 0.600 d.f. 858 Pr(> chi2) 0.0000 g 0.848 Residuals Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.75550 -0.40733 0.01893 0.42597 1.70108 Coef S.E. t Pr(>|t|) Intercept 1.5327 0.2067 7.41 Effect plots for the predictors look like this: After adding X3, the effect plot looks like this: Regarding my questions formulated at the beginning of this post, I would interpret the results as follows, but I am not sure if the whole approach is valid: If X1,X2 (and X3 in the second plot) are set to their average values, the mean response of Y for each year would be the value within the plot for Yearf . Visually it appears that the differences between the years reduces when X3 is added to the model while the standard error of the mean response increases. Is it valid to do this visually? As far as I know, an anova only tells me if the difference between year x and my base year (here 2015) is significant, but I donâ€™t want to compare it for a specific year. I want to get an idea of the whole picture. Does this make sense to you?
