I often scrape websites for information, and when I'm being really lazy, I will submit everything as a GET instead of using POST ... many times, CGIs that require a POST will accept a GET . I set my script up to use a random USER-AGENT from a list: either safari on ipad, firefox on XP, or Internet Exploder on Vista. Who knows, it may be me scraping your site, and getting the points for the answer ;-).
