Delphi7: PageControl MouseMove while drag and dropping on it

I have the following problem. There's a pagecontrol on my form and I want to activate a certain tabsheet and then drag and drop (from explorer) to a scrollbox on the tabsheet. (each tabsheet has a scrollbox) I have code to activate a tab when you mousemove over the pagecontrol. (see code below) The problem is that when I drag a file from explorer the mousemove never fires when I hover/mousemove over the pagecontrol while still dragging. Also tried to set DragAcceptFiles(pagecontrol.Handle,true); but that also doesn't help. procedure TForm2.PageControlMouseMove(Sender: TObject; Shift: TShiftState; X, Y: Integer); var tabindex : Integer; begin tabindex := PageControl.IndexOfTabAt( X, Y ); PageControl.ActivePageIndex := tabindex; end; Any ideas/solutions guys and girls? Thanks. SoulBlade
