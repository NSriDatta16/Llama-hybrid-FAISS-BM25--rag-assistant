Need help with a LOOP statement in a php curl function embedded with XML

I have a php curl script that my sms gateway provided to enable me send sms via xml.The original script is what i have below. ////////////////////////////// original php curl xml code from gate way $user $pass $sender $message $mobileno "; // previously formatted XML data becomes value of “XML” POST variable $fields = "XML=" . urlencode($xmlString); // in this example, POST request was made using PHP’s CURL $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $postUrl); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields); // response of the POST request $response = curl_exec($ch); // redirect the page upon successful sending header("Location:customized/successfullysentbulksms.php"); curl_close($ch); ?> /// code end I how ever tried to tweak the codes in order to enable me send customized multiple sms by connecting to a mysql table with the following fields (id,name,mobileno) in such as way that i can select 10 recipients and send a customized message so that each recipient get the same message with his name showing in the message such as " Dear(.$name),thank you for visiting our store today" From the little php that i know, i believe that i am suppose to connect to the database to select my recipient and then write a "do or while loop" that will enable the script to repeat or loop this function till it has successfully sent sms to all the recipients. I'm presently stuck with embedding my loop function, please i will be glad if someone can take a look at what i've done so far and help me out. My tweaked version of the code /////////////////////////////////////////// $user $pass $sender $message2 $no "; // previously formatted XML data becomes value of “XML” POST variable $fields = "XML=" . urlencode($xmlString); // in this example, POST request was made using PHP’s CURL $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, $postUrl); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POST, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS, $fields); // response of the POST request $response = curl_exec($ch); // redirect the page upon successful sending header("Location:customized/successfullysentbulksms.php"); curl_close($ch); ?>
