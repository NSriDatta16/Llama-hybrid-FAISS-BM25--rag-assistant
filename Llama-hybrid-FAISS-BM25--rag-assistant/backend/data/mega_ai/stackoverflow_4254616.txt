HTTP caching questions

I am using response header to make sure that the page is not cached on the browser end, i have used the following code to do that. Can some one please let me know following, How to to test if its working ? or not working? Does it also stops the caching for CSS and JS fils. Can some one please elaborate how this caching works ? in windows we have templerary internet files does it has something to do with this. Response.CacheControl = "no-cache, no-store"; Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); Response.Expires = -1;
