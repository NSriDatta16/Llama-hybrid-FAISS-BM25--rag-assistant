Looking at it from a corporate view only... some thoughts... Developing against server installs (virtual, real, whatever) means that you're developing against something resembling production or UAT. I think it also encourages best practice and some discipline. The Express edition has limits that means you can't replicate the data or conditions you have in production. Not one of the databases I work on would run in the Express limits. If I remove data so I can run locally, then I have no indication of how my 1000 row queries will perform against when I have 200 million in production. And forget abut partitioning, indexed views and other good stuff too. I've seen many 3rd party apps that require SQL Server to be on the web server, or a shared SQL/app box, or need sysadmin rights to run. To me this always looks no thought was given to the target audience and developed locally. The advantage of server installs is capacity and performance. How are you going to tune query on your 200 million row/50 GB database, deal with the effects or parallelism etc Saying that: developer edition can also be installed locally on your laptop. Finally, in many shops, local SQL Server installs are disallowed. Back in my 100% DBA days, I used to hunt them down...
