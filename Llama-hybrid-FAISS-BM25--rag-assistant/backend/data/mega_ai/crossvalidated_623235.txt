Why are FGLS standard errors so low when estimating linear regression on panel data?

I am currently writing my master thesis an the effect of academic publication on anomaly returns. The idea is that in finance literature anomaly - factors/portfolios are proposed. After the factor is published in a journal the time series of the returns of the factor, which was positive before, decreases significantly. I estimate a fixed effect regression model using panel data of factor returns to study this effect. The data is structured as follows: My data set consists of about 207 factors. For each "factor/portfolio" I have a time series of monthly returns e.g.from 01.01.1990 until 31.12.2021. The length of the time series is not equal across the factors. Each factor has a dummy variable for each point in time that is one if the observation is after the sample considered in the publication otherwise it is zero. Similarly, each factor has a dummy variable for each point in time that is one if the observation is after the publication in the journal otherwise it is zero The model is defined as: $$ \label{regression_model} R_{i,t} = \alpha_{i} + \beta_{1} S_{i,t} + \beta_{2} P_{i,t} + \epsilon_{i,t} $$ where $R_{i,t}$ is the return of factor $i$ at time $t$ , $\alpha_{i}$ estimates the predictors fixed effect. $S_{i,t}$ is the post-sample dummy variable and $P_{i,t}$ is the post-publication dummy. In the literature it is proposed to either use: (i) heteroscedasticity-consistent standard errors (ii) standard errors estimated by clustering on time (iii) standard errors estimated using a FGLS method under the assumption of contemporaneous cross-sectional correlation between panel portfolio residuals I estimated an FGLS Model since it was considered to be the most conservative by the literature. To do so I used the plm R package and the following model: model_fgls Oneway (individual) effect Within FGLS model Call: pggls(formula = ret ~ out_samp + post_pub, data = pred_ret, effect = "individual", model = "within", index = c("signalname")) Unbalanced Panel: n = 207, T = 197-1146, N = 126463 Residuals: Min. 1st Qu. Median 3rd Qu. Max. -16.97522740 -1.61125401 -0.04535875 1.54106692 16.57735040 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z-value Pr(>|z|) out_samp -0.20112934 0.00092318 -217.87 However, the results are confusing since the standard erros are much lower compared to the literature and other methods I tested. Here is the same model but estimated using estimatr: robust standard errors clustering on month (ym). model_robust Call: lm_robust(formula = ret ~ out_samp + post_pub, data = pred_ret, clusters = ym, fixed_effects = ~signalname) Standard error type: CR2 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) CI Lower CI Upper DF out_samp -0.1936 0.06211 -3.117 1.99e-03 -0.3158 -0.07142 320.4 post_pub -0.3294 0.05237 -6.289 6.87e-10 -0.4323 -0.22648 509.7 Multiple R-squared: 0.0143 , Adjusted R-squared: 0.01268 Multiple R-squared (proj. model): 0.001559 , Adjusted R-squared (proj. model): -8.547e-05 F-statistic (proj. model): 20.11 on 2 and 1145 DF, p-value: 2.611e-09 Similarly using plm and correcting standard errors using vcovBK by Beck and Katz. model_95_vcovHC t test of coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) out_samp -0.193602 0.042276 -4.5795 4.666e-06 *** post_pub -0.329367 0.031385 -10.4944 The estimated coefficients are similar across all methods. FGLS, however, yields standard deviations of 0.00092318 and 0.00038256 compared to 0.042276 and 0.031385 which is the same order of magnitude reported in the literature. My questions therefore are: Why are the standard error of the FGLS model so low? Did I specify the model wrong or is this common? Which method should I use?
