Regressions using panel data, is there a way to account for countries that have opposite reactions towards a change in the same explanatory variable?

For example, if the United States savings ratio is increased with a decline in interest rate, but Canada's savings ratio decreases with a decline in interest rate (savings rates and interest rates are time series data), is there some econometric model that can tell me this even when using panel data? Or am I better off doing two normal OLS-regressions, one for each country?
