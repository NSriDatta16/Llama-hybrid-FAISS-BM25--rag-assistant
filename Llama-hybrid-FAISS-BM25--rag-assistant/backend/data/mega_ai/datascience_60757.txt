boltzmann-exploration(softmax exploration) in reinforcement learning

I have started learning reinforcement learning and as a part of it I am exploring the action selection strategies available. I am comparing epsilon-greedy vs boltzmann exploration(softmax exploration). I have understood and implemented epsilon greedy the follwing way. def get_action(state, episode): # get action from model using epsilon-greedy policy # Decay in Îµ after we generate each sample from the environment epsilon = epsilon_min + (epsilon_max - epsilon_min) * np.exp(-epsilon_decay*episode / 4) if np.random.rand() I am not completely fluent with boltzmann and facing difficulty with implementation. can some one help me with this implementation. Tried a lot but couldn't. Really stuck at this. Thanks.
