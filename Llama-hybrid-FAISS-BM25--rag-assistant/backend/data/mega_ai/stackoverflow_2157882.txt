I'm working at an enterprise level ColdFusion shop with multiple CF applications running on the same server that are all pointed at the same client variable store. The only concern within the organization is how the client variable store affects regular backups, and that falls under the data team's purview. We don't have any problems with the different apps actually using the same client variable storage.
