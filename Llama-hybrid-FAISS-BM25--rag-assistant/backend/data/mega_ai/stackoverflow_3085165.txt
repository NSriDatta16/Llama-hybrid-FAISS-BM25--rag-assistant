Why pay for storage/bandwidth/backups/etc. when you can have somebody in the cloud handle it for you? S3 (and other Cloud-based storage options) handle all the headaches for you. You get all the storage you need, a good distribution network (almost definitely better than you'd have on your own unless you're paying for a premium CDN), and backups. Allowing users to upload directly to S3 takes even more of the bandwidth load off of you. I can see the tracking concerns, but S3 makes it pretty easy to handle that situation. If you look at the direct upload methods, you'll see that you can force a redirect on a successful upload. Amazon will then pass the following to the redirect handler: bucket , key , etag That should give you what you need to track the uploaded asset after success. Direct uploads give you the best of both worlds. You get your tracking information and it unloads your bandwidth. Check this link for details: Amazon S3: Browser-Based Uploads using POST
