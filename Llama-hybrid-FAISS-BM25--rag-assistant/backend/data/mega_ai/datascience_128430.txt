Univariate time series forecasting with bimodal distribution

This is my first ML project ever. Well the objective is to build a forecasting model of a univariate time series containing solid waste weights loaded from the city of Austin,Texas. The distribution of the data is shown below. First, I want to fit an ARIMA model to the dataset. But it cannot capture well the values since they are following a multimodal distribution. So I tried to segment it on two datasets: one dataset for the weekends and an other one for business days so that I would have to fit two forecasting models for each. However, the segmentation criterion does not work and business days dataset is also bimodal. I also tried to proceed with kmeans clustering by creating two clusters. Howerver, one of the two clusters is still multimodal. Can anyone give me suggestions?
