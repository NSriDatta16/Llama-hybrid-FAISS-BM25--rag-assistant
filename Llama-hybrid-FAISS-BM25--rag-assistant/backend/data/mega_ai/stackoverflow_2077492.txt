any suggestion on clustered client server comm. approach?

Let's say i'm building a client server software. the main server connects to agents on different servers. the agents is a search client and each will return quite huge array of 64bit integers and finally the main server (parent) will sort it to produce finaly result. Which is better/faster approach, using a socket to get all the data from client, or use socket to send client state and request id, the result then stored on temp flat file with that id (main server will then need to access that temp file located on client svr)?
