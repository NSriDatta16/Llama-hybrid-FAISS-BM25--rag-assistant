Similar to steffen's suggestion of RapidMiner, you might want to consider Weka . It may be geared more specifically to machine learning than you are hoping for though. It has lots of algorithms for tasks like clustering, classification, and regression. Weka has a GUI, but it can also be used as a software library as well. I've seen histograms in the GUI but I'm not sure if it's easy to reuse them through the library or not.
