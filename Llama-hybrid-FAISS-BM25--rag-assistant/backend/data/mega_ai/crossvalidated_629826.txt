Examples of unsupervised neural networks that are not self-supervised

I'm trying to understand if such things exist. For the NN to learn it seems that we need a measure of error and thus we need labels. In the case of auto-encodoers, which are considered unsupervised, the labels are just the input so the NN is self-supervised. In the case of GAN's we know everything the generator creates is fake and all of our initial sample is true and thus it seems to be self-supervised as well. Is there another case? Is there an unsupersived, not self-supervised NN example?
