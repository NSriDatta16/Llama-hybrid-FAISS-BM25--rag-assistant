redirect 301 question

We just switched to our new website redesign. We have a copy of the previous one in a folder "v1" and the new one is in "v2". I play with 2 .htaccess files. The file are organised as such: root L .htaccess (1) L v1 L v2 L .htaccess (2) .htaccess 1 does 2 things: remove the www out of the URI redirects all requests to v2/ The rules are: RewriteCond %{HTTP_HOST} ^www\.example\.com$ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ http://example.com/$1 [R=301,L] RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/v2/ [NC] RewriteRule ^(.*)$ /v2/$1 [NC,L] Now, I have specific URLs that are well indexed. For example: example.com/pixflow/ I would like to 301 redirect it to example.com/projects/pixflow1/ (which physically means example.com/v2/projects/pixflow1/) To achieve this, I've put in .htaccess 1: RewriteRule ^pixflow/$ http://%{HTTP_HOST}/projects/pixflow1/ [L,R=301] But that does not work, it returns 404. What am I doing wrong?
