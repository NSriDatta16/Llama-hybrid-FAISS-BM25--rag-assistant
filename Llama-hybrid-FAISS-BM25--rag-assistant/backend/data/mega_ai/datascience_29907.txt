Censored output data, which activation function for the output layer and which loss function to use?

I am building a neural network to solve a regression problem. The output is a single numerical value. Unfortunately, the output is censored: the values below 0 were recorded as 0, and postive values remained unchanged. What activation function should I use for the output layer (maybe ReLU)? How to define the loss function, should I just use RMSE? (because the output is censored, we want the neural network to be able to generate 0 output, and positive values). Edit 1: The problem is to predict the electricity demand time series based on multiple input variables. Only the values above a certain threshold are being recorded, hence the output is censored. We have a lot of numerical/categorical input variables: time of the day, air temperature, days in a week, holiday/workday, etc. We want to build a neural network model to predict electricity demand (0 or positive) based on the input variables.
