The same familiar spectrum instruction yields cross-spectra. coherency and phase when used on a bivariate time series. Look at this sample code. dIPC and Crudo are respectively (differenced) consumer price index and oil price. We first build a bivariate time series (out of ordinary ts time series) with ts.union, then invoke spectrum. datos We only need now to plot coherency and phase. I find it useful to align them one below the other with par(mfrow=c(2,1)) and then do the plots: plot(sp,plot.type="coh") plot(sp,plot.type="phase")
