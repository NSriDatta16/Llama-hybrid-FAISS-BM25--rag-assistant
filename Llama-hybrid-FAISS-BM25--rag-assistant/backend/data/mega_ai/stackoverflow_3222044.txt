The construct myfoo.h #ifndef MYFOO_H #define MYFOO_H /* header information for myfoo.h */ #endif belongs in every header-file. The trick is: you can include a header file (accidentally) more than once without thinking abaout double declarations. so this is for the preprocessor. The #pragma is for the compiler, and a preprocessor should ignore pragmas it does not understand.
