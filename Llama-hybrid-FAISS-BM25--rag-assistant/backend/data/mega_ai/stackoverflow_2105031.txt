You can write to local storage on the worker role by using the standard file IO APIs - but this will be erased upon instance shutdown. You could also use SQL Azure, or post your data off to another storage service by HTTP (e.g. Amazon S3, or your own server). However, this is likely to have performance implications. Depending on how much data you'll be storing, how frequently, and how big it is, you might be better off with Azure Storage! Why don't you want to use Azure Storage?
