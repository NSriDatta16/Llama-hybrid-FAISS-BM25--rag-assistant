It might help to understand what named routes are doing. Defining a Named route creates a wrapper around url_for providing the options required for the created route. Routing resources creates many named routes. With that in mind, the overhead of calling a named route as opposed to url_for with the options needed is negligible. So if you're linking to a specific resource, named routes are the way to go. They're easier to read, type and maintain. However, don't discount url_for. It has many creative uses thanks to the way it handles missing options. It is very useful when it comes to keeping views DRY that are used from multiple nested sources. Ie: when you have a blog_posts controller and posts_controller sharing the same views. I strongly encourage you to read the url_for documentation . To help figure out where those places it makes sense to use url_for are.
