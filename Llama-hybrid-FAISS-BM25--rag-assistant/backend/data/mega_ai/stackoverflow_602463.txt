Take a look at quince, the infragistics ui patterns site: http://quince.infragistics.com . Personally, I'd look at using a filterable grid, like the xtragrid from DevExpress: http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/Controls/WinForms/Grid/datafiltering.xml coupled with a search bar above it to initially populate the grid.
