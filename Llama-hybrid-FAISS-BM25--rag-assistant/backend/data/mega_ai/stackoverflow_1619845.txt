You need to look into introducing a WIN32 systemwide hook . This MSDN article covers the basics of this (attention it specifies both application or thread level hooks and system-wide hooks). Once you understand that, you'll need to catch several keyboard related messages, WM_KEYUP for sure, a few other WM_KEYxxxx messages as well, depending on your needs). You'll then need to introduce the logic which decides whether keystrokes are valid or gibberish, and either pass-on the messages (so they can eventually trickle down to the application which has focus) or ignore them.
