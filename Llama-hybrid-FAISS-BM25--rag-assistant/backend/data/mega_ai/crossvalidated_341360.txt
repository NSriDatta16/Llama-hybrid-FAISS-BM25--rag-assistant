Support vector machines (SVMs) are the zero temperature limit of logistic regression?

I was had a quick discussion recently with a knowledgeable friend who mentioned that SVMs are the zero temperature limit of logistic regression. The rationale involved marginal polytopes and fenchel duality. I wasn't able to follow. Is this statement about SVMs being the zero temperature limit of logistic regression true? And if so, can someone describe the argument?
