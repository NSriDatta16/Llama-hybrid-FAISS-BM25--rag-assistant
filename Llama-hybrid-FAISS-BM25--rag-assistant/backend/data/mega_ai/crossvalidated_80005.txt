It's also important to understand how parameter values inside the confidence interval differ from those outside, which is not something that follows from the definition of a confidence interval but from the particular method of its construction. For example, if you construct a confidence interval based on likelihood cut-offs the parameter values inside have higher likelihood than those outside. See Are all values within a 95% confidence interval equally likely? . To my mind such considerations are what put the "confidence" into "confidence interval"; taking only coverage into account allows the construction of valid confidence intervals that defy common sense. See Confidence interval for $\mathrm{Uniform}(\theta, \theta+a)$ & Confidence Interval for variance given one observation .
