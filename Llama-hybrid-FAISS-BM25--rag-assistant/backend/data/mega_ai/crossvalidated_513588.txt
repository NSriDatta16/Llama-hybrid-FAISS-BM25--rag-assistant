Time Series Stationary or Not

Here is my time series plot of some data. There appears to be a constant variance, but I don't believe that the mean is constant (e.g., big dip around time $t=17$ and big increase around time $t = 57$ ). Is it correct for me to say that this time series does not have a constant mean, but it does have a constant variance? I am a beginner to time series analysis.
