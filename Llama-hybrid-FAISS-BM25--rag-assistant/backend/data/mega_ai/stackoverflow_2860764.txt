ObjectContext ConnectionString Sqlite

I need to connect to a database in Sqlite so i downloaded and installed System.Data.SQLite and with the designer dragged all my tables. The designer created a .cs file with public class Entities : ObjectContext and 3 constructors : 1st public Entities() : base("name=Entities", "Entities") this one load the connection string from App.config and works fine. App.config 2nd public Entities(string connectionString) : base(connectionString, "Entities") 3rd public Entities(EntityConnection connection) : base(connection, "Entities") Here is the problem , i already tried n configuration, already used EntityConnectionStringBuilder to make the connection string with no luck. Can you please point me in the right direction!? EDIT(1) I can do my queries if i use de parameterless constructor but i need to change the connection string, i can't use the one in my app.config. How can i construct a valid connection string?!
