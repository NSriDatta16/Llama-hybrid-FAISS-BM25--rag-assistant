Socket & TCPClient are both pretty easy to manage and efficient. They'll definitely do what you need. There are a variety of good reasons to use the async modes of either. Be warned that there are some threading issues. For instance, some of the async methods will terminate when the calling thread exits. There are a lot of very inefficient/bad .NET multi-threaded server examples out there too, so be careful. One last thing to watch out for is the exception handling. Often you just get a "SocketException" back and have to inspect it to figure out what really happened. It would be great if there were a few more derived SocketException classes that could be handled independently. But don't let me discourage you, once you get your code implemented and working it'll continue to "just work" from then on.
