Explanation and prediction are not the same (see Galit Shmueli's webpage on her research on the topic, her paper published in Statistical Science (pdf) , and Practical thoughts on explanatory vs. predictive modeling here on CV). You "don't want to predict if a new article and unlabeled one will be popular or not", which means you aren't really after prediction. Instead, you "want to explain which features and which values are associated with the unpopular articles". That sounds like you want to be able to advise someone (say a potential author) how to write their article better so that it won't be unpopular. You are interested in causality. To determine that, you need to run experiments. You need to find some preliminary theoretical framework on the topic (there is presumably existing research, or you could use your intuitions). Then gather some authors and randomly instruct them to write articles with or without certain features (or in varying amounts). Then have readers rate their interest (as a proxy for popularity). With those data, you can fit simple logistic regression models and test if the features are significant. There are also various methods for trying to infer causality from observational data, but it's a little dicier and the statistical techniques are more complicated. You can read some of our threads on the topic under the causality tag.
