If the complexity of your model or classifier trained on those n features scales badly (e.g. the number of parameters grows as O(n^3)), then even 500 features can be a problem. Not only because the optimization takes longer, but also because you might not have enough data to constrain your parameters, which would lead to overfitting. By reducing model complexity, dimensionality reduction can therefore also act as a means of regularization .
