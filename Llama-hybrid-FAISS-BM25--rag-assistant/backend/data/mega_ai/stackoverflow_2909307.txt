You should plan on raising ETW trace events throughout your app - not only to alert listeners to issues, but also to provide visibility into the behavior and even performance of your apps' and components' performance. ETW is an (insanely) high performance and (astonishingly) low-impact way of raising events that can be gathered and analyzed - even in production environments. It's the logging & tracing infrastructure used throughout Windows, SQL, etc. Three useful links for you: Diagnostics: Using ETW tracing in .NET 3.5 (EventProviderTraceListener) Controlling .NET Framework Logging link text Two Minute Drill: Introduction to XPerf Read all 3 in order and then re-read - later information will be highly useful, but will be harder to understand unless you grasp the basics first ;) Ignore the instructions to use logman to start and stop your trace collections; use XPerf instead. If you've not yet seen the Perf toolkit and XPerf viewer , then you're in for a treat! :D I strongly encourage you to consider raising start & stop events at the start and end of all of your apps' most important features so that you can overlay these events with other telemetry so that you can see, for example, the impact of your apps features on Disk, network, memory, CPU, etc. Hope this helps.
