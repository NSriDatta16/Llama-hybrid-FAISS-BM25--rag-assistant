It looks like you are computing the Shannon entropy , or at least the nats version of it, which is not a probability. For one thing, Shannon's entropy is not bounded from above to unity. A function of a probability is a probability if it satisfies Kolmogorov's probability axioms . I don't know about a real-world example offhand, but you can find some discussion online about "metaprobability". Closest thing that comes to mind is when a Bayesian defines a prior over the possible values of an unknown probability.
