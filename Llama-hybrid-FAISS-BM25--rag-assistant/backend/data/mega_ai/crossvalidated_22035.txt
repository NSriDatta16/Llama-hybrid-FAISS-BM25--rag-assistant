Partitioning trees in R: party vs. rpart

It's been a while since I looked at partitioning trees. Last time I did this sort of thing, I like party in R (created by Hothorn). The idea of conditional inference via sampling makes sense to me. But rpart also had appeal. In the current application (I can't give details, but it involves trying to determine who will go to jail among a large sample of arrestees) I cannot use advanced methods like random forests, bagging, boosting etc. - I need an easily explicable rule. I would also like to have some manual control over which nodes split, as recommended in Zhang & Singer (2010) Recursive Partitioning and Applications . The freeware that comes with that book allows this, but is otherwise rather primitive in its user input. Any recommendations or suggestions?
