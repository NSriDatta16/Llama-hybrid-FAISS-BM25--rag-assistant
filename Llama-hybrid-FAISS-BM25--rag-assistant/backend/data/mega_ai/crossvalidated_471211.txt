To add to the existing thread, you could think of doing this using what are called piecewise or blockwise updates. If you're considering the gaussian case and block updates you would have candidate values that are generated using a mean vector and a co-variance matrix and everything is accepted or rejected at once. If you're however considering piecewise updates, you would then sample each parameter of interest independently and apply the acceptance criteria individually.
