WinForms TreeView

I am looking for a WinForms treeview control with following requirements: Should be not so hard to write code for it (most tree/list combinations are way too complicated) Should have some sort of easy drag and drop capabilities (including a vista-explorer style drop marker) Should be free or at least affordable Should provide some freedom of text/color/style/etc. of the treenodes (classic "outlook bold with blue numbers style) Any ideas? thx
