I will not provide a full or mathematically rigorous answer, but I'll try to point out as many analogies and motivations from physics as I can see. If you consider a mechanical system, a term like $\frac{1}{2}k {(x-\mu)^2}$ can occur as measure of elastic energy : For instance when you have a linear spring with spring constant $k$, which can only move in x-direction and is in equilibrium when $X=\mu$. We choose $\sigma$ such that $k=\frac{1}{\sigma^2}$. Larger values of $k$ represent stiffer springs. Remember that the gibbs measure comes from statistical mechanics, describing an ensemble of particles and where $\beta$ is the inverse temperature: The smaller the value of $\beta$, the faster is the average speed of the particles, i.e. the more likely are states which are "far away" from the equilibrium (in the sense of states with a high energy function $E(x)$). In this way, also $\beta$ represents the "stiffness" of the ensemble of particles. The terms $\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \pi \sigma^2}}$ and $\frac{1}{Z(\beta)}$ play a very similar role: They are normalization constants which ensure that the resulting functions are probability densities. These constants naturally depend on $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$. In conclusion, we can reasonably define $E(X=x)=\frac{1}{2} {(x-\mu)^2}$ as an energy function and set $\beta = \frac{1}{\sigma^2}$ as inverse temperature or measure of stiffness, where smaller values of $\beta$ make high-energy states more likely. Unfortunately, I cannot provide a meaningful physical interpretation of this particular gibbs ensemble consisting of unidirectional springs.
