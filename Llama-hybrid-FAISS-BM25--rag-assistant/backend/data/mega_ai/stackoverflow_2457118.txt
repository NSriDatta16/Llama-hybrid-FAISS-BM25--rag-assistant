I'd say split your controller into multiple. Not only it becomes easier to find whatever you need to work on in the file, probably there is a relation between the methods that "belong" to the same section. The end result is a more organized project, Alternatively, why not have one single method that serves a static page, and work out which page to serve based on url ($id)? You'd have to play with CI routes a bit, in order to still have "site.com/pages/static_page_x" instead of "site.com/pages/view/static_page_x", but if you have a consistent way of accessing your static pages, it would save some typing, give you a way of adding new pages without touching the controller code, and might also come in handy if you want to apply to all the static pages something that you didn't think you'd need before.
