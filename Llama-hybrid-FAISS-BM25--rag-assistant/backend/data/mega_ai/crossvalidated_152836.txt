Take a look at the drag force equation in physics: $$F_D=av^2$$ Here, $v$ is the speed of an object, and $a=1/2\rho C_DA$ and $b=2$. Air density is $\rho$, the $C_D$ is a drag coefficient and $A$ is the surface of an object. You say that the drag is proportional to the square of the speed and the surface area of the object. As you see there's no standard way to express this relationship, other than saying that it's proportional to this or that. Another example is Cobb-Douglas production function from microeconomics: $$Y=AL^\beta K^\alpha$$ Here, $A$ - total factor productivity, and $\alpha,\beta$ - output elstaicities of labor and capital. As you see the $b$ coefficient was given a specific name which is interpretable in its domain, not some generic "nonlinearity" term.
