I worked in a smoke test writer for an asp.net application. We used QuickTest Pro , the automation of test runs was done with Quality Center (it was called Test Director.). This involved writing hundreds of test scripts that automate a web browser interacting with the web application. These tests where used validate a build before rolling it out on our production servers. Quality Center allows you to define a "pool" of test machines to allow you to run a large list of test scripts in a multi-threaded manner. A more simplistic smoke test would be to log all errors/exceptions that the application produces and run a spider against the system. This will not obtain very "deep" code coverage, but smoke tests aren't meant for deep code coverage. This error logging should be apart of the production application to deal with errors as they come up. Bugs will always slip though the cracks and sadly enough the best testers will be your users.
