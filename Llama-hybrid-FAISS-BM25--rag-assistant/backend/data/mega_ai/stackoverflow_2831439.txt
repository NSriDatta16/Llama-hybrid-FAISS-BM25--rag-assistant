Shorthand for nested null checking C#

As far as I know there is not a significantly more elegant way to write the following.... string src; if((ParentContent!= null) &&(ParentContent.Image("thumbnail") != null) &&(ParentContent.Image("thumbnail").Property("src") != null)) src = ParentContent.Image("thumbnail").Property("src").Value Do you think there should be a C# language feature to make this shorter? And if so, what should it look like? for example, something like extending the ?? operator string src = ParentContent??.Image("thumbnail")??.Property("src")??.Value; Apologies for the rather contrived example, and my over-simplified solution. Edit ... Many years later This is now a planned language feature called the " Null propagating operator " ?. https://roslyn.codeplex.com/discussions/540883 ( Thanks @Brian )
