Web based JMX console for Tomcat?

Are there any web based JMX consoles available for Tomcat that basically provide the same functionality as Tomcat's JMX Proxy Servlet but in a more user friendly manner? I understand that I could simply use jconsole over RMI but this solution is not always applicable because of firewall issues. It also requires extra server-side configuration and in some organizations changing server-side configurations might not be that straight-forward. So what I would like to have is a simple war-file that I can just drop into my container without any configuration (lets forget security manager for now). Also, it would be nice if the user interface would be something that creates an impression of quality and reliability.
