Depending on how advanced you already are with jQuery, this book may be a good one. It is broader in scope than just the jQuery library itself, so the jQuery coverage may not be as thorough as you would like. It does target .net though, and also discusses other relevant libraries such as the Telerik asp.net ajax control library.
