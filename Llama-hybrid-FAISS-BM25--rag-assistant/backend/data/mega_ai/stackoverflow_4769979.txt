I hoped there would be a better way of doing it, but the mock will record all calls to Reset so using a standard Verify call will always return 2. The following maintains a separate counter, which isn't very elegant. If there's a built-in way of doing this with Moq, I'd love to know. int clearResetCount = 0; Mock dep = new Mock (); MyClass myclass = new MyClass(dep.Object); dep.Setup(s => s.Reset()).Callback(() => clearResetCount++); Assert.AreEqual(0, clearResetCount, "Expected clear reset count - before."); myclass.Clear(); Assert.AreEqual(1, clearResetCount, "Expected clear reset count - after.");
