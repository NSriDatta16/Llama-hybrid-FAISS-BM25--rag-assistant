What problems should I expect when moving legacy Perl code to UTF-8?

Until now, the project I work in used ASCII only in the source code. Due to several upcoming changes in I18N area and also because we need some Unicode strings in our tests, we are thinking about biting the bullet and move the source code to UTF-8, while using the utf8 pragma ( use utf8; ) Since the code is in ASCII now, I don't expect to have any troubles with the code itself. However, I'm not quite aware of any side effects we might be getting, while I think it's quite probable that I will get some, considering our environment (perl5.8.8, Apache2, mod_perl, MSSQL Server with FreeTDS driver). If you have done such migrations in the past: what problems can I expect? How can I manage them?
