Paul Graham was the guy to really introduce the idea of using Bayesian spam filtering to the web at large with his original article A Plan for Spam , back in August 2002. Then, his follow-up a year or so later introduced many of the problems that swiftly arose. These are still pretty great works on the topic. In the second article, Graham mentions using CRM114 , which works on a much wider set of patterns than just space-delimited words. CRM114 is cool, but comes without much implementation help for a spam filtering system. There's the open-source powertools for Bayesian spam filtering like Death2Spam and SpamProbe . I find nothing works quite like filtering mail through a Gmail account. Happy hunting.
