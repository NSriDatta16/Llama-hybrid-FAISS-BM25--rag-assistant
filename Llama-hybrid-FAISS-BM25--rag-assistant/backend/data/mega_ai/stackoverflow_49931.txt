Dundas has a set of tools that let you drag and drop dimensions/hierarchies/measures to create visualizations like charts and/or grids. The product name is Dundas Chart for ASP.NET Enterprise Edition, and it has a free demo. ProClarity also had a suite of tools. Not sure how you get those tools any longer, but I think they are part of MSDN now.
