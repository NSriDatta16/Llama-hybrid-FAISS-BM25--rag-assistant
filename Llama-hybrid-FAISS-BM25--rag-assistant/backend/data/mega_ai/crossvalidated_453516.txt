Count Modelling and Rates and Zero Inflation

I am looking for some help modelling overdispersed (zero-inflated negative binomial) count data as a rate. I want to model the survivability of villages in different municipalities given guerilla attack counts over a time period of 14 months in a cross-sectional data set. My dependent variable is a count variable, civilian casualties, and it contains a large number of zeros. I am interested in modelling civilian casualties as a rate, the rate of casualties per attack, given village characteristics. I am unsure how to setup my model or do some feature engineering to model the rate given zeros (for villages with no casualties) which seem to complicate or make impossible the use of an offset.
