XML Node to String in Java

I came across this piece of Java function to convert an XML node to a Java String representation: private String nodeToString(Node node) { StringWriter sw = new StringWriter(); try { Transformer t = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(); t.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.OMIT_XML_DECLARATION, "yes"); t.setOutputProperty(OutputKeys.INDENT, "yes"); t.transform(new DOMSource(node), new StreamResult(sw)); } catch (TransformerException te) { System.out.println("nodeToString Transformer Exception"); } return sw.toString(); } It looks straightforward in that it wants the output string doesn't have any XML declaration and it must contain indentation. But I wonder how the actual output should be, suppose I have an XML node: Bee buzz Most other kinds of bees live alone instead of in a colony. These bees make tunnels in wood or in the ground. The queen makes her own nest. Could I assume the resulting String after applying the above transformation is: "media type="audio" id="au008093" rights="wbowned" title Bee buzz title /media" I want to test it myself, but I have no idea on how to represent this XML node in the way this function actually wants. I am bit confused, and thanks in advance for the generous help.
