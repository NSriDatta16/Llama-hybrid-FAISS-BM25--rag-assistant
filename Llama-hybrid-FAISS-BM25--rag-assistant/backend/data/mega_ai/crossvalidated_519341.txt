To answer your question from a totally uncorrelated perspective, it's instructive to note that in financial engineering and economics, there needs to be some kind of uncertainty around cost or budget estimates, since a single prediction based on the best features won't be sufficient. Even if you employ ML and determine which features are the most informative through model-building strategies using univariate/multivariate regression models, importance scores from random forests, or any other feature selection method, you still won't have anything to work with that explains how uncertain your cost estimate is. What is needed is Monte Carlo cost estimation. What could be more helpful would be to identify the best features which predict cost, develop an objective function, e.g. cost = hourly labor rate * #employees * hours of work. Then generate histograms for these 3 example inputs, determine which probability distributions fit the best, then simulate quantiles from each, each time calculating the cost. You will then have a histogram of cost, which you give to the customer, along with providing the 10th and 90th percentile values of cost (or 5th, 95th). If you were designing an oil rig and presenting cost estimates for a loan from a bank on an enterprise scale, this is what you would be doing. Below is a simple example of a run for a rollout of a new product after manufacturing. The cost uncertainty distribution is on the lower right of the panel.
