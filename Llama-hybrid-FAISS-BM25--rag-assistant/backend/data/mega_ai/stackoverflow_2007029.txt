This particular question has come up on multiple occasions and I will summarize that there are several possible solutions, only 1 of which I would recommend. Use a WorkManager from the commonj API. It allows for managed threads in a Java EE container and is specifically designed to fit your use case. If you are using WebSphere or WebLogic, these API's are already available in your server. For others your will have to put a third party solution in yourself. WorkManager info Related questions Why Spawning threads is discouraged
