Frankly, I don't understand why that is happening, since it's just doing linear regression, right? Random forests are not linear regression. A linear regression estimates coefficients of a linear model, while random forest simply does not. A useful resource for learning about random forests is Leo Breiman's 2001 paper " Random Forests ." Also the fact that the output sums to 1 is disconcerting. The "targets" of the regression forest you describe are numbers between 0 and 1 that always sum to 1. The prediction of each tree is an average of the terminal leaf targets. The prediction of the ensemble is the average of the predictions of the trees. So we predictions that are a convex combination of probability distribution, so the result is also a probability distribution. All discrete probability distributions sum to 1.
