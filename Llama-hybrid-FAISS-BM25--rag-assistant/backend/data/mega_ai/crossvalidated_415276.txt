How to interpret B when x is squared?

My OLS regression looks like this: $$y=\beta_0+\beta_1x_1+\beta_2x_2+\beta_3(x_3)^2+\epsilon.$$ I do not include $x_3$ linear because it vifs with squared value and without squared value I have wrong specification according to RESET. How do I interpret the $\beta_3$ in my equation (in general)? I know it should be something like: $$\Delta y=(2\beta_3x_3)\Delta x$$ But what should I use as an $x_3$ ? Should it be an average $x_3$ value?
