We try not to include the unused or even the rarely used stuff for example in VC++ there is #define WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN //exclude rarely used stuff and what we hate in MFC is that if u want to make a simple application u will produce large executable file with the whole library (if statically linked), so it's not a good idea what if u only want to use the cout while the other no?? another thing i don't like to pass arguments via command line coz i may leave the project for a while, and forget what are the arguments... e.g. i prefer using #pragma (comment, "xxx.lib") than using it in command line, it reminds me at least with what file i want That's is my own opinion make your code stable and easy to compile in order to to rot as code rotting is a very nasty thing !!!!!
