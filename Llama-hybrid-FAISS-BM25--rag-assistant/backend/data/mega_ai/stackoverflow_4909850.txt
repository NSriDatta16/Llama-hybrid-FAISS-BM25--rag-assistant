Which HTML5 microdata do I use for a job (vacancy)?

I'm trying to markup a vacancy/job item with microdata but I wonder whether I'm doing it the right way, because my item properties like 'title' and 'date' don't make sense in combination with my itemtype 'organization'. How could one rewrite the following block better leveraging microdata? Web developer Company Name , City Lorem ipsum dolores amet ...
