Any Machine Learning algorithm to know a yes/no answer?

Any Machine Learning algorithm to know the meaning of sentences? Specifically, I have sentences like, "we do not allow managers to trade derivatives", "We do not have policy on hedging", "our policy do not permit trading on stock", "trading is not allowed"... The actual sentence is longer. Any algorithm I can know whether trading on stock is allowed or not by programming? Thank you for your help!!!
