If you're referring to influencing the location of #includes, Project properties|Configuration Properties|C/C++/Additional Include Directories is the ticket. There is also project properties|Common Properties|Additional reference search paths. If your question is how do I parameterize stuff in a VCProj file like I would in Ant, the answer is that in VS2010 VC projects are[/can?] be MSBuild-based whereas VS2008 vcproj files are a proprietary XML based format [but as the other answers say, they have an analogous properties capability]. In the absence of more info, I'm pretty sure the standard approach for what you're doing is to add your search paths a la the first or second paragraph.
