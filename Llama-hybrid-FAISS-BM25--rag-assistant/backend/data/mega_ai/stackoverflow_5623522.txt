I don't think it's actually faster to right click -> add base class then to add a class file and type : Base behind it. If you want to implement an abstract class you can right click on the base class and select "Implement Abstract Members" You can also use the Class Diagram tool (right click a project and select View Class Diagram) then add a class and drag an inheritance arrow from the toolbox onto it.
