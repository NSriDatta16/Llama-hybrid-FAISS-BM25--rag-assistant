Under the assumption that the array is almost sorted, you could use one of the following : Smoothsort Wiki even has a java implementation on it. Since you can't do it faster than O(n) (since it takes that much time in order to even find out if an array is sorted or not) smoothsort is a good choice. More details here . The advantage of smoothsort is that it comes closer to O(n) time if the input is already sorted to some degree Coctail sort The complexity of cocktail sort in big O notation is O(n2) for both the worst case and the average case, but it becomes closer to O(n) if the list is mostly ordered before applying the sorting algorithm, Timsort Java's arrays are actually now using timsort in java 7 in order to sort objects ( sort() ). Description of timsort here .
