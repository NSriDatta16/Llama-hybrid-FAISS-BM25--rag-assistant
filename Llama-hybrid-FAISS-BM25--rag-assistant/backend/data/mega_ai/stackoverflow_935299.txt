Ambiguous `id` Field

I have the following two tables: system - id - systemName - idOrganization organization - id - officeSymbol I am running the following query and receiving an id is ambiguous error: SELECT system.systemName, organization.officeSymbol FROM system LEFT JOIN (organization) ON (system.idOrganization = organization.id) As you can see, I'm not selecting the id column. If I place system.id within the list of fields to select, I no longer receive this error. Unfortunately, the manner in which this data is handled I can't return the id - we don't want it displayed to the user. Also, if I add GROUP BY system.systemName I no longer get the error - but this just doesn't seem like the optimal solution. Note: The LEFT JOIN is intentional as not all systems will be assigned to an Organization. SELECT VERSION() --> 5.0.77-community-log CREATE TABLE system ( `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `systemName` VARCHAR(45) DEFAULT NULL, `idOrganization` INT(11) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), KEY `fk_system_organization` (`idOrganization`), CONSTRAINT `fk_system_organization` FOREIGN KEY (`idOrganization`) REFERENCES `organization` (`id`) ON DELETE NO ACTION ON UPDATE NO ACTION ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1; CREATE TABLE organization ( `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT, `officeSymbol` VARCHAR(45) DEFAULT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;
