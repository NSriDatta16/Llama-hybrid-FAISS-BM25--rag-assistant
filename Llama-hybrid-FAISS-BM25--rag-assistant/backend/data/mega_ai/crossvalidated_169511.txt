Merging observations in Gaussian Process

I am using Gaussian process (GP) for regression. In my problem it is quite common for two or more data points $\vec{x}^{(1)},\vec{x}^{(2)},\ldots$ to be close to each other, relatively to the length scales of the problem. Also, observations can be extremely noisy. To speed up computations and improve measurement precision , it seems natural to merge/integrate clusters of points that are close to each other, as long as I care about predictions on a larger length scale. I wonder what is a fast but semi-principled way of doing this. If two data points were perfectly overlapping, $\vec{x}^{(1)} = \vec{x}^{(2)}$, and the observation noise (i.e., the likelihood) is Gaussian, possibly heteroskedastic but known , the natural way of proceeding seems to merge them in a single data point with: $\vec{\bar{x}} \equiv \vec{x}^{(k)}$, for $k=1,2$. Observed value $\bar{y}$ which is an average of observed values $y^{(1)}, y^{(2)}$ weighted by their relative precision: $\bar{y} = \frac{\sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(2)})}{\sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(1)}) + \sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(2)})} y^{(1)} + \frac{\sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(1)})}{\sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(1)}) + \sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(2)})} y^{(2)}$. Noise associated with the observation equal to: $\sigma_y^2(\bar{x}) = \frac{\sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(1)}) \sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(2)})}{\sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(1)}) + \sigma_y^2(\vec{x}^{(2)})}$. However, how should I merge two points that are close but not overlapping? I think that $\vec{\bar{x}}$ should still be a weighted average of the two positions, again using the relative reliability. The rationale is a center-of-mass argument (i.e., think of a very precise observation as a stack of less precise observations). For $\bar{y}$ same formula as above. For the noise associated to the observation, I wonder if in addition to the formula above I should add a correction term to the noise because I am moving the data point around. Essentially, I would get an increase in uncertainty that is related to $\sigma_f^2$ and $\ell^2$ (respectively, signal variance and length scale of the covariance function). I am not sure of the form of this term, but I have some tentative ideas for how to compute it given the covariance function. Before proceeding, I wondered if there was already something out there; and if this seems to be a sensible way of proceeding, or there are better quick methods. The closest thing I could find in the literature is this paper: E. Snelson and Z. Ghahramani, Sparse Gaussian Processes using Pseudo-inputs , NIPS '05; but their method is (relatively) involved, requiring an optimization to find the pseudo-inputs.
