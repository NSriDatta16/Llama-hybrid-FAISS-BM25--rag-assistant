how is the logistic regression scatter plot created

I have a newbie question about logistic regression fit plots. I'm fitting a very simple binary output based on a simple continuous input X Y 0.1 0 0.1 0 0.1 0 0.1 1 0.5 0 0.5 0 0.5 1 0.5 1 0.9 0 0.9 1 0.9 1 0.9 1 when using JMP, the fitting model is logistic. I understand the fitted line, but what are the points plotted on the chart? I only have 0,1 in the output, but why does the logistic plot show values of Y that are not 0,1? Thanks for any help with this.
