How does LASSO select among collinear predictors?

I'm looking for an intuitive answer why a GLM LASSO model selects a specific predictor out of a group of highly correlated ones, and why it does so differently then the best subset feature selection. From the geometry of the LASSO shown in Fig 2 in Tibshirani 1996 I'm led to believe that LASSO selects the predictor with the greater variance. Now suppose that I use best subset selection with 10 fold CV, to obtain 2 predictors for a logistic regression model and I have reasonable prior knowledge that these 2 predictors are optimal (in 0-1 loss sense). The LASSO solution favors a less parsimonious (5 predictors) solution with greater prediction error. Intuitively, what causes the difference to arise? Is it because of the way LASSO selects among correlated predictors?
