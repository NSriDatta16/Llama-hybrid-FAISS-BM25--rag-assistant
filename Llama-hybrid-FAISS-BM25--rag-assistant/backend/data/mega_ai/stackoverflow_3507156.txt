How about this as a different take on the same problem: I'm creating a lot of PDFs server-side, I've got 10's of 1000's of clients who generally want to run reports at the same time of the month. Average PDF size might be 7-10Mb. With a finite heap available, 'swapping' the data out to a temporary file is a valid way to create the PDFs since I need to be able to set the content-length on the response prior to streaming the PDF data to the client. Perhaps instead of just questioning the design some useful options might be handy. Personally I'm looking at using either one temp file per process or concurrent access of a single 'swap' file. What would you suggest?
