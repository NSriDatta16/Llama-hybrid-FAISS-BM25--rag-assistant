You should seriously take a look at dbdeploy (dbdeploy.com). It is ported to many languages, the major ones being Java and PHP. It is integrated in build-tools like Ant and Phing, and allows easy sharing of so called delta files. A delta file always consists of a deploy section, but can also contain an undo section. When you commit your delta file and another developer checks it out, he can just run dbdeploy and all new changes are automatically applied to his database. I'm using dbdeploy for my open source blog, so you can take a look on how delta files are organized: http://site.svn.dasprids.de/trunk/sql/deltas/
