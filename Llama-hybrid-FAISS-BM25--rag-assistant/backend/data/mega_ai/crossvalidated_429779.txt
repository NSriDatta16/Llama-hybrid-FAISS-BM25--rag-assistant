Since outlier detection is commonly considered to be an unsupervised learning , most do not require labeled data. Parameters thus must be mostly guessed by experience, studying algorithms, domain understanding, and experimentation (try some parameters, study the result). Examples include: k nearest neighbors local outlier factor loop There are some exceptions. For example, one-class SVMs require training data free of anomalies and then are used to detect anomalous instances in future data. So these are partially supervised.
