This is another clean solution: sub, sup {vertical-align: baseline; position: relative; font-size: 70%;} /* 70% size of its parent element font-size which is good. */ sub {bottom: -0.6em;} /* use em becasue they adapt to parent font-size */ sup {top: -0.6em;} /* use em becasue they adapt to parent font-size */ In this way you can still use sup/sub tags but you fixed their idious behavior to always screw up paragraph line height . So now you can do: This is a line of text. This is a line of text, with sub text. This is a line of text, with sup text. This is a line of text. And your paragraph line height should not get screwed up. Tested on IE7, IE8, FF3.6, SAFARI4, CHROME5, OPERA9 I tested using a p {line-height: 1.3;} (that is a good line height unless you want your lines to stick too close) and it still works, cause "-0.6em" is such a small amount that also with that line height the sub/sub text will fit and don't go over each other. Forgot a detail that might be relevant I always use DOCTYPE in the 1st line of my page (specifically I use the HTML 4.01 ). So I don't know if this solution works well when browser is in quirkmode (or not standard mode) due to lack of DOCTYPE or to a DOCTYPE that does not triggers Standard/Almost Standard mode.
