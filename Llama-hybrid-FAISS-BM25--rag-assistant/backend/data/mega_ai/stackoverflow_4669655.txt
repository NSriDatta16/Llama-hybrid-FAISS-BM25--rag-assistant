Magento: find orders containing a product

Is there a way in Magento to find all orders that contain a given product? It would be even better if it could be done from the administration panel. Reports -> Products -> Products Ordered gives me the day the product was sold and how many orders contain it, but I need to know which specific orders include the product. Thank you!
