How to start a process from within a windows service

I want to pop a browser with a given url from within a windows service . Like so: System.Diagnostics.Process.Start("http://www.venganza.org/"); Works fine when running in a console but not from within the service. No error messages, no exceptions, the Process.Start() command just seem to do nothing. It smells of some security issue, maybe something with the service properties and/or logon options? Annoying stuff this... Anybody? (Oh, and on windows 7/.NET framework 3.5.)
