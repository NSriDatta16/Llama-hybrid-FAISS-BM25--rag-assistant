Data leakage: Does it make sense to split time series this way?

I’m trying to make sense of how to create the training data for time series. Let’s say we have sales data: Day, sales 1, 60 2, 65 3, 80 4, 90 5, 100 Then we create such training samples: x1=[60, 65] y1=[ 80] x2=[65, 80] y2=[ 90] x3=[80, 90] y3=[100] My worry is: If we train a model using such training samples, wouldn’t the model already “see” the y1 as x2 when we are feeding x2 into the training process? Isn’t that some kind of data leakage?
