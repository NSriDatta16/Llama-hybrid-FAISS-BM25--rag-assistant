How can I perform weibull analysis on monthly recorded data of wind speeds?

I've read several articles about how to perform Weibull distribution but they all did it with wind speed data in a time series manner (example: recorded data every 10mins and then averaged to every hour). My prob is that I've got only mean monthly wind speed for a year (from January to December). So how should I deal with this situation to perform Weibull distribution on these data? I have data for 5 years namely 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010 and like i said, its monthly wind speed from January to December. I'd appreciate if you could help out. Thank you in advacnce...
