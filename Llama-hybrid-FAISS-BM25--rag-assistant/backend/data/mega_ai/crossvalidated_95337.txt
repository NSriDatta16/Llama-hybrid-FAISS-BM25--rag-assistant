Linear Regression: Finding t and p-value

all. I'm taking an introductory to applied statistics class and can't figure out how to do a question on my homework. I won't put all of the data up, because I really want to know how to do the problem, not just the answer. In the problem, I am given a list of schools and the tuition from each school in the years 2000 and 2005. I put the tuition values from 2000 in list one and the values from 2005 in list two. From there, I was able to state the correct least-squares regression line by running LinReg(a+bx) on my ti-83 calculator. However, it also wants to know the p-value and t, and I have no idea how to come up with these values. We are encouraged to use our calculators, so if someone could point me in the right direction, I'd be much obliged. :)
