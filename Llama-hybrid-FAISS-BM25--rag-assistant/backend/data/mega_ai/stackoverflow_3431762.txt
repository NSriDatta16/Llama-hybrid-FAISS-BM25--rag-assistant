JQuery Draggable and an with an SVG?

I have an SVG file within an object tag displaying in a table cell,and I want to make the SVG draggable within the table cell using JQuery's Draggable. The code--minus the confusing bits in the tag, looks like this: button blah, blah button If I set the tag itself as draggable, draggable doesn't work. If I wrap the tag in a , and make the draggable, I can drag using the margin of the div, not the SVG itself. I tried setting the handle of the to the SVG object like this: $('#objdiv1').draggable({ handle: '#svgobject1' }); but that failed as well. Is there any way to make the SVG object draggable by clicking and dragging the SVG itself? I set up an example here in case that helps see what I'm talking about.
