Your taglib root declaration is broken. The lns must be xmlns and there must be a / between j2ee and web-jsptaglibrary_2_0.xsd . The correct declaration is as follows: As a side-note, ensure that the web-app root declaration of your web.xml is at least as per Servlet 2.4. Else it will still not work. Unrelated to the problem, using scriptlets in JSP is discouraged since a decade.
