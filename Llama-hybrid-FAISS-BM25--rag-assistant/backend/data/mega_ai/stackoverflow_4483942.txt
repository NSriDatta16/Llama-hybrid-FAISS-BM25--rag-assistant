Touches began is a view method, not a view controller method. You are using locationInView:self.view this should be locationInView:self Check this code is in a view subclass and not a view controller subclass. Also, you might need to use [self convertRect:[menuButton bounds] fromView:menuButton]; to convert the CGRect to the proper coordinate space.
