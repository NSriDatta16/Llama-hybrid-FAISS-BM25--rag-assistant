Why do we detrend or remove seasonality from a data when doing time series analysis?

I am very new to time series. I am wonder why would we want to detrend or removing some seasonality of some time series remove important information about the time series itself? For example this is from my notes By removing noise, doesn't that create a white noise process. A white noise process itself is random so no prediction can be made? Thank you!!
