Here's an example of zooming programatically (there is no way in IB to do this): MKCoordinateRegion region; MKCoordinateSpan span; span.latitudeDelta=0.02 / 10; // zoom level span.longitudeDelta=0.02 / 10; CLLocationCoordinate2D location; location.latitude = latitude; // set these var's first! location.longitude = longitude; region.span=span; region.center=location; [mapView setRegion:region animated:TRUE]; [mapView regionThatFits:region]; I'm not sure if this is what you're after but have you tried mapView.userLocation for the CLLocation stored? Also remember that in the iPhone Simulator the pin will always drop on Apple HQ unless (from Xcode4) you change the simulated user's location - this is a Location Services arrow-icon just above the console in Xcode. When using a device the co-ordinate should move to your GPS location, depending on coverage.
