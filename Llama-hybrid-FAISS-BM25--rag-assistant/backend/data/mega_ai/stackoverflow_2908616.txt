It seems to me that the error which you have in jqgrid.min.js corresponds an error in uncompressed version of jqGrid direct at the beginning of .jqGrid('setGridParam', { url: url }) (see line 82 of grid.base.js ). It is the part of the so named "New API" introduced in 3.6 version of jqGrid. The code fragment started with following lines: $.fn.jqGrid = function( pin ) { if (typeof pin == 'string') { var fn = $.fn.jqGrid[pin]; if (!fn) { throw ("jqGrid - No such method: " + pin); } var args = $.makeArray(arguments).slice(1); return fn.apply(this,args); } //... I am not sure why you have a "syntax error", bu I recommend you to verify, that the id of the grid is really "Search". If you will don't find an error add more information in your question. For example: which version of jQuery you use? Including of a code fragment and the order of JavaScripts which you load would be also helpful.
