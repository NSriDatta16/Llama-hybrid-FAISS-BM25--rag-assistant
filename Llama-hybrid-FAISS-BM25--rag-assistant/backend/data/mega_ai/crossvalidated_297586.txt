Background: I did something that I don't feel bad about, but I don't feel exactly right about. I would like to get enough pointing in the right direction to teach myself and feel solidly good about it. I discovered that both day of week and hour of day were driving variables in my training set when they shouldn't. I made what is statistically and technically an excellent fit with neural networks. I ran the NN on the full data to get a first prediction, then I adjusted the input data to have a single day of week, and single hour of day, to simulate as if it was all run at the same moment, and reran the NN. The difference between the NN outputs I called "time error". I took the mean value of that error for each hour in each day of week, and made a table of mean error. I then traversed both the training and test data and for the apropriate time and day of week I subtracted the mean error. I then handled the modified training and modified test data using a separate process. My goal was to estimate the size of day of week and hour of day, and get a sense of how well the data behaved without them. My next step is to properly remove the impact of day and hour from the data, an not do it as a "hack". Questions: Can you tell me what the "textbook" method is that I should have used instead of my previous approach? What should I have done? For my "next step" can you tell me the method that I should use? What is it called? I'm enough out of my element that I don't know what tag to use. Is this anova? manova? nonlinear manova? mixed effects? data scrubbing?
