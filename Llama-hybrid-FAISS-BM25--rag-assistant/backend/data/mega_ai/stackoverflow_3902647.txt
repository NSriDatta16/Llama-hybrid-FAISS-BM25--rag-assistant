Create a 256 length char array. Stream through the file a byte at a time incrementing the array position of each byte. Hard code the number of 1s in each of the 256 bytes in another array. Multiply the 2 arrays and sum. Not sure about elegance and definitely requires more memory, but might be faster than linuxuser27's algorithm.
