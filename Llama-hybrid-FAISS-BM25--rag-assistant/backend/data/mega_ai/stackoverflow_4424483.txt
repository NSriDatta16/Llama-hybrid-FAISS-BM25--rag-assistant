I've been using Mercurial and enjoy it very much. You can get a free Bitbucket account and start storing your repos in the cloud. There's a really good free video on tekpub for Mercurial and Codeplex . It takes you through all the basics and will be close to how Bitbucket works. Check out the http://hginit.com link as another good resource. I was using SVN on my local box to store my personal work but no more. With Bitbucket & Mercurial I won't have to worry about my local box dying and making sure I had everything backed up.... You could also look into Git. The basic gist I have found/heard is Mercurial is a little easier to work with but not as powerful as Git. However, both are excellent choices. Bottom line is you can't go wrong with either Hg (Mercurial) or Git but I would go with Hg unless you needed some of the advanced features which sounds like you don't. Learning SVN isn't necessarily bad as there are a lot of Organizations using it but I would really concentrate on Distributed Version Control Systems instead. They really are the future. :-)
