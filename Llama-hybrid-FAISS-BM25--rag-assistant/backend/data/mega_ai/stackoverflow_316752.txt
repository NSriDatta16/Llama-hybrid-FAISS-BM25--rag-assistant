If performance is your only consideration a file_exists() will be much less expensive then a database lookup. After all this is just a directory lookup using system calls. After the first execution of the script most of the relevent directory will be cached in storage so there is very little actual I/O involved, and, "file_exists()" is such a common operation that it and the underlying system calls will be highly optimised on any common php/os combination. As John II noted. If extra functionality and user inteface features are a priority then a database would be the way to go.
