How does Max Pooling (of size 2x2) change the size of receptive field in CNN?

I am often told that Max Pooling of $2x2$ doubles the size of the receptive field from the previous layer. If that is true, I would like to understand how that happens. I have already checked this article and this one . However, I am not able to understand the effect of Max Pooling on the receptive field. Appreciate any help on this. Thanks!
