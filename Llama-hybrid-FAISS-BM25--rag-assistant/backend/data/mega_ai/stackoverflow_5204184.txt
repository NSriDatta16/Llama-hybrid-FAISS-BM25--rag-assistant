How to mimic Wordpress "Widget" drag & drop behavior?

I need to mimic Wordpress "Widget" drag & drop behavior. jQuery UI Sortable can do it but not the same way as WP. I can drag & drop now but the dropped element is removed from the source. That's not what I expected. Let's say I have two A and B. I drag an item of A and drop it to B and I expect the item stay within A, not to be removed from it. Any idea? I really appreciate your helps!
