.Net RIA Services: Multiple loads to one callback

I have found that it's quite often the case I have multiple queries/entities that I want to load in RIA Services that are all related, and a single callback that processes the data once the loads have all been completed. However, I don't see a clean, easy way to do this with RIA Services without adding my own boilerplate code to either count callbacks (as in if I have three loads, then in the callback have a class variable that increments and returns if still I'm starting to think my best option is to make a separate, reusable little class called "LoadGroup" that takes in multiple load queries and a callback function, and only invokes the callback once all the loads have completed. My question is: am I re-inventing the wheel here? Is there functionality of RIA Services that already basically does this (or a design pattern better than the one I'm suggesting)? Or should I go ahead with my plan of writing my own little class? Thanks, -Robert
