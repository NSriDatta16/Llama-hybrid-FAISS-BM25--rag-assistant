It is a classic answer of 'it depends' - one size does not fit all and what you are looking at is the eternal balance between a pure accademic approach vs a pragmatic one. Too far in either direction can produce a bad result, so sometimes you will sacrifice accademic correctness to get something to work well. It is not possible to determine whether this case is a premature optimisation or a valid one without knowing workloads, number of queries, how often that join would / would not be used as a result of the optimisation etc.
