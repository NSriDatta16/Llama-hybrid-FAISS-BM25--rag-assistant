From the code you posted, I guess that the menbers suits and denominations should be static data member, that is they will always have the same data for every Card instance. So I suggest you make them static and initialize them at file scope in your cpp file (outside of your class declaration): Declaration: class Card { public: Card(int n); Card(string d, string s); int getNumber(); string getDenomination(); string getSuit(); void setNumber(int n); void setDenomination(string d); void setSuit(string s); void printMe(); void compareMe(Card c); private: int number; string denomiation; string suit; static const string suits [4]; // static const static const string denominations [13]; // static const }; Definition: const string Card::suits[4] = {"Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"}; const string Card::denominations[13] = {"Ace","2","3","4","5","6","7","8","9","10","Jack","Queen","King"}; EDIT: As Robert S. Barnes stated, making them static const is even better. Hope that helps.
