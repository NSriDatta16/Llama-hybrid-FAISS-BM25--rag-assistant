I have seen logging procedure that was transaction independent ( PRAGMA AUTONOMOUS_TRANSACTION; ) and was called from main procedure. It saved in funtime_log table: current time (wall clock), sequential number, thread (session) id, and text (eg. name of procedure) This way you can select all events from one session ordered by sequential number and see where the time differs most. In production environment you can simply make this function do nothing to disable logging.
