find child image width and apply it to containing parent div jquery

I have an and some 's inside a . I want to get the width of the child img and apply it to the width of the parent div so that the paragraphs of text will wrap to the same width as the img. I want to be able to do this to multiple iterations on the same page. Background: I am developing a wordPress theme that uses the masonry jquery plugin ( http://desandro.com/resources/jquery-masonry ). My theme has something in common with Gridalicious theme ( http://suprb.com/apps/gridalicious ) but the post widths and sizes will be dictated by the image width and will not be uniform. My html/css is spotless but my jquery / javascript is pretty shaky - but if I can get some pointers I should be able to work with it. Any help truly appreciated.
