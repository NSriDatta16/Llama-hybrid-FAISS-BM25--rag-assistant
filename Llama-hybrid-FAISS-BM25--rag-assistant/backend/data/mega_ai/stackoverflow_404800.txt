In C, at a much simpler level, consider the following; Use #pragma pack(1) to byte align your structures Use unions where a structure can contain different types of data Use bit fields rather than ints to store flags and small integers Avoid using fixed length character arrays to store strings, implement a string pool and use pointers. Where storing references to an enumerated string list, e.g. font name, store an index into the list rather than the string When using dynamic memory allocation, compute the number of elements required in advance to avoid reallocs.
