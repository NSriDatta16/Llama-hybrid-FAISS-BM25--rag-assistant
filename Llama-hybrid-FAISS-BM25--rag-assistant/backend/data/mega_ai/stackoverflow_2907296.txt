It is difficult to tell from the fragment of code you have posted whether you expose any of the data outside the class. If not, then this would work. However, if not, there are several issues: If you are exposing the List, you should only ever return a copy of it as an IEnumerable using the yield keyword. Make sure your PostVoteType is immutable, otherwise the references can be changed and the fields used might be altered
