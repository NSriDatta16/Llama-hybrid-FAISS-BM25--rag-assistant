Git is designed for code. Pachyderm is designed for machine learning assets: data, pipelines, and notebooks. You can put machine learning assets into git. However, git will treat machine learning assets just as code primitives. One example is notebooks which are JSON. JSON in git quickly becomes difficult to manage. Pachyderm will manage them in notebook specific ways.
