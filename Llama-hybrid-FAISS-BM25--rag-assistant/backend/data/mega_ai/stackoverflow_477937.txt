I guess you have to construct it by yourself by manually parsing the kind of URL you get. If it is an image url, well then you just have to rescale it and in case the user clicks on it, then handle that by opening the original one somehow. If it is a link to some youtube video, then you have to take a look at how the embedding of Youtube videos works. You can just copy the code that is provided by Youtube itself, and then exchange the parts with the URL to the video with the URL you got from your user. I did never implement something like that, but I assume it should work somehow like this.
