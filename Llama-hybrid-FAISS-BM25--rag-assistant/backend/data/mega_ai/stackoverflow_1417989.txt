Django uses a relational DB for its underlying storage, and that intrinsically DOES have "set semantics": no way to circumvent THAT. So if you want a "multi-set" of anything, you have to represent it with a numeric field that counts how many times each item "occurs". ManyToManyField doesn't do that -- so, instead, you'll need a separate Model subclass which explicitly indicates the A and the B it's relating, AND has an integer property to "count how many times".
