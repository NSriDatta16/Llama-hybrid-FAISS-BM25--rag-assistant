Reducing the Build time - Hudson

I would like to know,If there is a Hudson plugin to reduce the build time by distributing the tests across slaves. I found a project called Test Load Balancer (TLB) But this is used for only Ant projects. Mine is a Maven project. I'm looking for a solution on Hudson. I'm trying to improve the build pipeline , so that we can move towards continuous delivery. Right now, one of my Job takes 30 minutes on average. Any help will be appreciated.
