Evenly divide a dollar amount (decimal) by an integer

I need to write an accounting routine for a program I am building that will give me an even division of a decimal by an integer. So that for example: $143.13 / 5 = 28.62 28.62 28.63 28.63 28.63 I have seen the article here: Evenly divide in c# , but it seems like it only works for integer divisions. Any idea of an elegant solution to this problem?
