Write a simple tool that processes only #include "" directives. Note, it should not process "#include <>" directives, and don't touch any other preprocessor directive you encounter. You'll want to support -I arguments in a gcc like way (or do something equivalent for your compiler if running in a different environment). Should be a afternoon job, and would make a nice open source project (leave a pointer if you do it). This will result in dragging in the whole tree of "non-standard" headers used by each source file you work on, but that should be harmless.
