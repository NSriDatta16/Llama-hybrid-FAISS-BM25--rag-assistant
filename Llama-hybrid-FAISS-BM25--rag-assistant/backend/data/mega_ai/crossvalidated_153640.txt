PCA/factor analysis of mixed (quantitative + qualitative) data: inconsistent results

I have a dataset composed of 4 variables, 2 being numerical and 2 categorical (ordinal in fact). They all represent 4 types of indicators/measures of the same phenomenon . I want to analyse them in a multivariate way. I tried to apply first a PCA on the 4 variables (forcing the ordinal into numerical which is sometimes suggested), i get this graph: then i tried to do a FAMD (factor analysis of mixed data) which was recommended with the factominer package.Unfortunately there is not a lot of documentation about it. This is the output: And the other output (observations + levels): my problem: the FAMD variable graph gives completely different results. It seems from the data (and the PCA) that quanti2 and quali2 should be closely related, but that's not what shows the famd's variable plot. Why so? Moreover, on the second FAMD graph (observations), i get this "V" shape. How can i interpret it and draw conclusions about the relationship between this 4 indicators? And of course, if you have a more clever way to analyse this dataset, please explain it! I dput my data here: data % as.data.frame %>% PCA FAMD(data)
