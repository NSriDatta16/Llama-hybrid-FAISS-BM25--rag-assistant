Detecting a "Drag" from WPF ListView and delegate it to its ViewModel

Is there a way to do this in a simple way? Detecting that something is dragged from a ListView and then tell the ViewModel that something is dragged and tell it which item. Note: I don't mind a simple solution that doesn't strictly follow MVVM if the "correct" way is too complicated.
