Why is this MySQL INSERT INTO running twice?

I'm attempting to use the mysql insert statement below to add information to a database table. When I execute the script, however, the insert statement is run twice. Here's the URL mysite.com/save.php?Body=p220,c180 Thanks in advance. '; print_r($message); echo 'message count = '.count($message); echo ' '; $i = 0; $j = count($message); while($i exec("INSERT INTO tippingtotals(sid,time,material,weight) VALUES('$i+$j','$now','$m','$amount')"); echo $count; echo ' '; $i++; } //close the database connection $dbh = null; } catch(PDOException $e) { echo $e->getMessage(); } ?> Like most of you, I thought it was because I was starting $i=0 so I added the $i+$j in the insert statement so I could see how items were being inserted into the table. Here's what running the script returns: I'm certain there's an error in my logic. I just can't seem to figure out what it is. I ran LiveHTTPHeaders as suggested below and this is what turned up... http://localhost/mysite/save.php?Body=p180,c220 GET /mysite/save.php?Body=p180,c220 HTTP/1.1 Host: localhost User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; U; Intel Mac OS X 10.6; en-US; rv:1.9.2.3) Gecko/20100401 Firefox/3.6.3 Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language: en-us,en;q=0.5 Accept-Encoding: gzip,deflate Accept-Charset: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive: 115 Connection: keep-alive HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Mon, 19 Apr 2010 22:17:31 GMT Server: Apache/2.0.63 (Unix) PHP/5.2.11 DAV/2 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.2.11 Content-Length: 93 Keep-Alive: timeout=15, max=100 Connection: Keep-Alive Content-Type: text/html ---------------------------------------------------------- Turns out that the error is only happening when I load save.php in Chrome.
