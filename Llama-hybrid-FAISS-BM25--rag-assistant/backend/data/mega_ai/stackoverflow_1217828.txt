For PHP processing, look into cURL . It will allow you to call pages on your back end and retrieve data from it. Basically you would do something like this: $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_URL,$fetch_url); curl_setopt ($ch, CURLOPT_HTTPHEADER, $headers); curl_setopt ($ch,CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $user_agent; curl_setopt ($ch,CURLOPT_CONNECTTIMEOUT,60); $response = curl_exec ( $ch ); curl_close($ch); You can also look into the PHP HTTP Extension .
