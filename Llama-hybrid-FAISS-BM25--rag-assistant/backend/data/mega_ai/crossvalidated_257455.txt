Find correlation between two time series. Theory and practice (R) discusses my road-map which is quite consistent with the very clear presentation that you cited http://svds.com/avoiding-common-mistakes-with-time-series/ . The simple though profound idea is that to identify the intra-relationship one needs to adjust for any inter-relationship in the candidate X. I strongly suggest reading the seminal article on this subject https://www.jstor.org/stable/2341482?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents . If you have problems obtaining it please feel free to contact me and I will try and help you. Finally care must be taken to deal with possible anomalies as their untreated presence induces obfuscation yielding a downwards bias in statistical tests of significance much like a pebble affecting your glasses which will affect your vision. I wonder about Google's econometricians/statisticians scholarship http://people.ischool.berkeley.edu/~hal/Papers/2015/primer.pdf as they continue to apply ordinary correlation tests (GOOGLE CORRELATE ; GOOGLE TRENDS) to time series data where angels fear to thread suggesting search processes based upon the naive assumption of no intra-correlation which is functionally equivalent to the assumption when analyzing cross-sectional data when trying to identify/short list significant predictors.
