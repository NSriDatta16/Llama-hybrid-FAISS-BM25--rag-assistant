After spending an exhausting amount of time trying to figure out the correct query, I believe I have found the answer. It looks like i needed to change the BaseColumns._ID to ContactsContract.Data.CONTACT_ID and for each update I made, I also had to supply the mime-type also I did not see this anywhere in the android documentation. Much help was found on this write-up: Working With Android Contacts String orgWhere = ContactsContract.Data.CONTACT_ID + " = ? AND " + ContactsContract.Data.MIMETYPE + " = ?"; String[] orgWhereParams = new String[]{String.valueOf(id), ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Organization.CONTENT_ITEM_TYPE}; operationList .add(ContentProviderOperation .newUpdate(ContactsContract.Data.CONTENT_URI) .withSelection(orgWhere, orgWhereParams) .withValue( ContactsContract.CommonDataKinds.Organization.DATA, guCon.getCompany()).build());
