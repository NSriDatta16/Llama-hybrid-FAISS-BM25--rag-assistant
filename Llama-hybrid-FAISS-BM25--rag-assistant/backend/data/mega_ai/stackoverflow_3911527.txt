Homework? Did you submit the result of the expression, or the expression itself? ",".join([name1, name2, name3]) Or whatever you used? Edit: You mention that you submitted ("name1", "name2", "name3") - which would not return the concatenated names - but rather those stings. If you wanted to do it like this (a little less elegant then the version I put above) you could try: name1 + "," + name2 + "," + name3 The difference being the quotations (") around the names - are stopping you from using the variables provided. Edit2: This is how I understand the question you were asked. They want you to submit to them, an expression that will return the values assigned to the name1, name2 and name3 variables (whatever they may be) - There are two examples of such expressions above - which concatenate the three name variables, and add a comma between them - have you tried submitting either of the examples above?
