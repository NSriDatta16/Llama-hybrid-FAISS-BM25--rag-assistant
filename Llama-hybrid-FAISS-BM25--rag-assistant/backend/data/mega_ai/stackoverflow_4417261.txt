You willl certainly see that Matlab is fast on some points, but when you need specialized things like manual memory management for working with a vector that exceeds what Matlab wants to give you, you'll need to jump through some hoops. I'm sure you can do everything quick and easy in Matlab, but I've come to see it as quite cumbersome in terms of elegance and post-optimization readability. Vector math is certainly fun and quick, but I find it hard to spot the dimensions sometimes. I'd say stick with what you know, and switch when you're convinced Matlab can't do it. Learning another language is hard, especially when you want quick code, and numerical calculations. On a sidenote, I prefer C++, together with some awesome libraries (GSL, Eigen, etc.). The funny thing is that I still make my plots in Matlab, because I came to know that part of Matlab very well :)
