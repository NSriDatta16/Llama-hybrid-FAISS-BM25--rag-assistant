I'm very new to Xcode debugging, but while doing my research I stumbled upon this question which may be helpful to your issue. Basically there are two people in there who had many issues with xcode debugging and the OP solved his issue through a clean install. Quoting LucasTizma 's 4th edit: FINALLY got device debugging to work. I have a feeling that something low-level on my device was causing issues...nothing I did worked on my system. However, I installed Xcode on another system and device debugging on the same device (with the same cable) worked flawlessly. Directly after that, device debugging began working on my original machine, leading me to believe that some strange hardware flag was screwed up and somehow "reset" on the second machine. In any case, it works now.
