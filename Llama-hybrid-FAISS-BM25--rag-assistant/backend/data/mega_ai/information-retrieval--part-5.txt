rg report "Science, Government and Information" gave a full articulation of the idea of a "crisis of scientific information". The report was named after Dr. Alvin Weinberg. * Joseph Becker and Robert M. Hayes published text on information retrieval. Becker, Joseph; Hayes, Robert Mayo. Information storage and retrieval: tools, elements, theories. New York, Wiley (1963). 1964: * Karen Spärck Jones finished her thesis at Cambridge, Synonymy and Semantic Classification, and continued work on computational linguistics as it applies to IR. * The National Bureau of Standards sponsored a symposium titled "Statistical Association Methods for Mechanized Documentation". Several highly significant papers, including G. Salton's first published reference (we believe) to the SMART system. mid-1960s: * National Library of Medicine (NLM) developed MEDLARS Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System, the first major machine-readable database and batch-retrieval system. * Project Intrex at MIT. 1965: J. C. R. Licklider published Libraries of the Future. 1966: Don Swanson was involved in studies at University of Chicago on Requirements for Future Catalogs. late 1960s: F. Wilfrid Lancaster completed evaluation studies of the MEDLARS system and published the first edition of his text on information retrieval. 1968: * Gerard Salton published Automatic Information Organization and Retrieval. * John W. Sammon, Jr.'s RADC Tech report "Some Mathematics of Information Storage and Retrieval..." outlined the vector model. 1969: Sammon's "A nonlinear mapping for data structure analysis Archived 2017-08-08 at the Wayback Machine" (IEEE Transactions on Computers) was the first proposal for visualization interface to an IR system. 1970s early 1970s: * First online systems—NLM's AIM-TWX, MEDLINE; Lockheed's Dialog; SDC's ORBIT. * Theodor Nelson promoting concept of hypertext, published Computer Lib/Dream Machines. 1971: Nicholas Jardine and Cornelis J. van Rijsbergen published "The use of hierarchic clustering in information retrieval", which articulated the "cluster hypothesis". 1975: Three highly influential publications by Salton fully articulated his vector processing framework and term discrimination model: * A Theory of Indexing (Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics) * A Theory of Term Importance in Automatic Text Analysis (JASIS v. 26) * A Vector Space Model for Automatic Indexing (CACM 18:11) 1978: The First ACM SIGIR conference. 1979: C. J. van Rijsbergen published Information Retrieval (Butterworths). Heavy emphasis on probabilistic models. 1979: Tamas Doszkocs implemented the CITE natural language user interface for MEDLINE at the National Library of Medicine. The CITE system supported free form query input, ranked output and relevance feedback. 1980s 1980: First international ACM SIGIR conference, joint with British Computer Society IR group in Cambridge. 1982: Nicholas J. Belkin, Robert N. Oddy, and Helen M. Brooks proposed the ASK (Anomalous State of Knowledge) viewpoint for information retrieval. This was an important concept, though their automated analysis tool proved ultimately disappointing. 1983: Salton (and Michael J. McGill) published Introduction to Modern Information Retrieval (McGraw-Hill), with heavy emphasis on vector models. 1985: David Blair and Bill Maron publish: An Evaluation of Retrieval Effectiveness for a Full-Text Document-Retrieval System 1986: Donald A.B. Lindberg M.D., NLM Director, implemented a direct health professional interface to MEDLINE and other MEDLARS databases. Grateful Med, a pun on the Grateful Dead, was adapted from Microsearch, an ELHILL user interface that assembled query language prior to connecting to the NLM mainframe. After retrieving the query results, Grateful Med disconnected from the mainframe to keep search costs low. mid-1980s: Efforts to develop end-user versions of commercial IR systems. 1985–1993: Key papers on and experimental systems for visualization interfaces.
