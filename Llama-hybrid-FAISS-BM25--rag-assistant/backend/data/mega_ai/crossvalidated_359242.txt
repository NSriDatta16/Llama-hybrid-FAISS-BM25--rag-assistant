Confidence interval for a macro/micro average

I'm working on a supervised multi class classifier that labels texts according to three possible classes. I calculated the one-vs-all precision, recall and F1 score for each class and the macro averaged version of those metrics. How can I calculate the 95% confidence interval for the macro averages? Below is the confusion matrix. refClass1 refClass2 refClass3 predClass1 1070 33 2 predClass2 54 937 18 predClass3 13 14 802 macro_avg precision 0.95479955 recall 0.956325957 F1 0.955562144 Thank you very much for the input!
