Can a Fully Connected layer transform a 4D tensor to a 3D tensor by itself?

Recently, I was researching some topics in biometrics and I stumbled upon this paper . They have a table there (Table 1) in which they state that they used a modified CNN from this paper (Table 9). In the latter, the first FC layer outputs a 2D tensor as expected (batch x 512), in the former however they claim that it outputs a 3D tensor (batch x 32 x 2). Is this possible? Isn't it a mistake? I always thought that one has to flatten the tensor before FC layer so I'm confused how is it possible to suddenly go from 4D to 3D tensor using just FC.
