scale_C=True means that the C parameter of the SVM problem is scaled with the number of samples. This is the default in libSVM and liblinear, however if you train models with a widely-varying number of samples it means that a single value of C will not be adequate for all the models. For this reason, we advocate using scale_C=False . It is documented in the list of parameters of the SVM objects . I must confess that I do not know what the shrinking heuristic is, and it is not properly documented in the libSVM documentation.
