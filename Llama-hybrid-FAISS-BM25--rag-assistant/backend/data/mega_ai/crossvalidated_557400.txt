Bayesian networks are always directed. They're represented through Directed Acyclic Graphs, so no, you shouldn't see someone referring to an undirected graph as a bayesian network. They're probably referring to a Markov Random Field (MRF), which is undirected and therefore can represent some relationships that a Bayesian Network, being directed and acyclic, can't. On the other hand, there are relationships that can be represented through a Bayesian Network that can not through a Markov Random Field. Both structure learning of a Bayesian network and inference tasks using a bayesian network are performed with bayesian statistics. People could have named it something else, but in the end they decided to call it bayesian networks and it stuck :-)
