The height of the pdf is just a relative frequency: is that correct?

I understand that the pdf function is not a probability, and the area under the curve must sum to one. I understand that the height of the pdf function is meaningless, and it is not a probability but a density of the probability. Can I say that the height of the pdf tells us which value of the random variable can occur more likely than the other values? For example, the following answer came from ChatGpt. Let's consider a numerical example related to children's weight. Suppose we have a dataset of children's weights that follows a normal distribution with a mean of 50 kg and a standard deviation of 5 kg. For Child A, let's say their weight is 55 kg. We can calculate the probability density at this weight using the dnorm() function: dnorm(x = 55, mean = 50, sd = 5) The resulting probability density would be a numeric value representing the likelihood of observing a weight of 55 kg within the given normal distribution. For Child B, let's say their weight is 45 kg. Similarly, we can calculate the probability density at this weight: dnorm(x = 45, mean = 50, sd = 5) This will give us the probability density for a weight of 45 kg within the normal distribution. Comparing the probability densities for Child A and Child B will provide insight into the relative concentration of weights around these values within the distribution. A higher probability density suggests that weights closer to that particular value are more likely to occur.
