Strange result in Poisson regression - R

I have performed a Poisson Regression in R, but I got strange results that I cannot find an answer for. My data is like this: Aspect_16 Nr_Pereti 1 E 49 2 ENE 73 3 ESE 29 4 N 84 5 NE 77 6 NNE 99 7 NNW 77 8 NW 92 9 S 19 10 SE 20 11 SSE 9 12 SSW 17 13 SW 23 14 W 39 15 WNW 56 16 WSW 25 The Nr_Pereti variable are counts for each level in the 'Aspect_16' column. The model formula and results are: summary(model_nr_exp) Call: glm(formula = tab_gen_exp$Nr_Pereti ~ tab_gen_exp$Aspect_16, family = poisson) Deviance Residuals: [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 3.8918 0.1429 27.243 I don't have any Deviance Residuals for the model, and when I try to plot the model, it gives me this error: Error in qqnorm.default(rs, main = main, ylab = ylab23, ylim = ylim, ...) : y is empty or has only NAs In addition: Warning messages: 1: not plotting observations with leverage one: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 2: In min(x) : no non-missing arguments to min; returning Inf 3: In max(x) : no non-missing arguments to max; returning -Inf What did I do wrong here? Thanks.
