Bayesian model comparison: What is it about MCMC that makes RSS or BIC hard to use?

I'm trying to figure out why certain methods are used for comparing models in Bayesian statistics. DIC is often used in Bayesian model comparison. However, I'm under the impression that one could calculate likelihood and/or BIC, too. Specifically, I've been told that the calculation of likelihood could depend on 'how one marginalizes over parameters'. What does this mean? Are there other reasons why some people don't prefer BIC?
