Reformulation of logistic regression

I am given the question above and can't seem to get the form that it's asked for. I have tried working it backwards from the goal which gives me: log(1 + e^(y_i * t_i)) - log(e^(y_i * t_i)) This is different from the form that's taught in textbooks: I may be missing something very obvious. Any help or hints are kindly appreciated
