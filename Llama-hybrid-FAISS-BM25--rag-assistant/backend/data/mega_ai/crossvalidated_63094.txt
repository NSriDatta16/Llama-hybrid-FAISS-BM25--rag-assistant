How to identify spikes in a noisy time series?

I have time-series data of brain cell spiking. It's basically got a baseline of random noise with large spikes interspersed. I want to be able to algorithmically cluster the spike portions of the scatter from the baseline noise. How can I do this (preferably a solution in R)? K-means definitely does not work.
