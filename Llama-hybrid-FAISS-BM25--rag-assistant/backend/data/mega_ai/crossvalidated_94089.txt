How to Obtain “Right” Parameters of Multinomial Logit Model (or Other Conditional Models) in R?

I started to use the function multinom of R package nnet in order to fit several conditional probability distributions with the multinomial logistic model. I need the parameters of the fittings in order to pass them to a Java program, which will compute the probabilities and use them. My problem is that the probabilities computed with the parameters returned by multinom , following the usual definition of multinomial logistic model, are not the same as those directly computed in R , which are the correct ones. On Stack Overflow I have already asked a question about this issue, but I do not still know how the R function multinom computes these probabilities; my guess is that it relies on neural networks, since this function belongs to R package nnet , but I do not have any idea about the details, and an inspection of the code led to nowhere. Do you know an R package which fits conditional probabilities and returns the corresponding parameters of the model, so that we may easily compute the probabilities in another program? E.g., using the MARS model ( R package earth ) or Projection Pursuit Regression ( R package ppr ) is not feasible, since computing the probabilities from the parameters of these models would be a mess. Besides, the function mlogit from the R package with the same name is not applicable as well, since the dataset should be in a certain format (we would also need the predictors corresponding to the alternative, "non-chosen" response variable).
