It is not only correct but also your only alternative in a situation where you do not have an external source that provides you with the forecasts associated with your variable df.x . However, you should consider that the error associated with performing forecasts of the external variable will also propagate to the forecast of the time series of interest, df.y . It may be useful to divide the problem into two stages: one that fits a suitable model for the x-series and forecasts its values to the necessary horizon, and then use those forecasts to specify the dynamic regression model you propose.
