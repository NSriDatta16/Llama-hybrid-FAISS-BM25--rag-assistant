I think fmsf example is a bad idea. A car is not a tire or an engine. You should be using composition for that. MI (of implementation or interface) can be used to add functionality. These are often called mixin classes.. Imagine you have a GUI. There is view class that handles drawing and a Drag&Drop class that handles dragging. If you have an object that does both you would have a class like class DropTarget{ public void Drop(DropItem & itemBeingDropped); ... } class View{ public void Draw(); ... } /* View you can drop items on */ class DropView:View,DropTarget{ }
