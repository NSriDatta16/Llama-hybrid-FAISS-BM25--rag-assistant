Concept of p-vector and matrix

I have worked with vectors and matrices but the following paragraph from The Elements of Statistical Learning by Trevor Hastie et al is little confusing (online edition, page 10) Matrices are represented by bold uppercase letters; for example, a set of N input p-vectors $x_i$, i = 1, . . . , N would be represented by the $N$ x $p$ matrix X. This means that the matrix X has $N$ rows and $p$ columns. Then the next lines confuse me, where I need your help. In general, vectors will not be bold, except when they have N components; this convention distinguishes a $p$-vector of inputs $x_i$ for the $i^{th}$ observation from the $N$-vector $x_j$ consisting of all the observations on variable $X_j$. Since all vectors are assumed to be column vectors, the $i^{th}$ row of $X$ is $x^{T}_i$, the vector transpose of $x_i$. What does this mean? Why is $i^{th}$ row of $X$ is $x^T_i$? I thought $i^{th}$ row of $X$ would have dimensions of $1$x$p$. I would appreciate if someone can please clear my doubts.
