Two other popular generative models which I think he is referring to are: Variational autoencoders, which have an encoder network, $q_\theta(z|x)$ which approximates the posterior distribution on latent codes (the "inference network"). Restricted Boltzmann Machines, which require block gibbs sampling between visible and hidden units to sample an image (or even just to train the model).
