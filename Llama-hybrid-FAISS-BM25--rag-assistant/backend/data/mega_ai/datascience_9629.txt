This is how you can approach this problem: Customer Segmentation: Segment each customer as a separate data point, and if possible have another project for clustering the customers depending on various factors (Example: Depending on geographical regions, age, etc). This would help in simplifying the problem statement and narrowing it too. Now choose the best combination: Now after segmentation, choose the best(average) combination of interaction mechanisms needed to be implemented for customer conversion. The mean would answer you the question: What is the average number of interactions by different media taken by a customer before he/she is converted Bonus : In addition to calculating the mean, calculating the median also helps, as it helps in fixing skew due to overly compulsive customer reps who interact a bit more frequently than some, and difficult customers.
