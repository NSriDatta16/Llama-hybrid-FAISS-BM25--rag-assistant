I remember reading about the Bytecode Engineering Library (BCEL) a long time ago, back when Java 1.4 was all the rage. See http://jakarta.apache.org/bcel/index.html . I never used it, so I only mention it because it seems close to what you are asking about (and it works, or at least worked, with older VMs) and I didn't see anybody mention it yet.
