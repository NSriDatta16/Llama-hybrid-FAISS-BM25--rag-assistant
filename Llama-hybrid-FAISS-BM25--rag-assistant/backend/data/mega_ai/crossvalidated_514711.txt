How can Bayesians express true ignorance about a parameter and still perform inference? The binomial case

How do I capture a claim of ignorance about a parameter in a Bayesian analysis? For instance, suppose I observed a binomial random variable $X\sim Bin(n, p)$ . Say $X = 5$ and $n = 10$ . I want to make inference about $p$ . But now further suppose I don't know anything about $p$ beyond the fact that it is between zero and one. A uniform prior is not a claim of ignorance about $p$ , as discussed here What is the Wine/Water Paradox in Bayesian statistics, and what is its resolution? . So how can I express my ignorance about $p$ and proceed with inference given the observed data?
