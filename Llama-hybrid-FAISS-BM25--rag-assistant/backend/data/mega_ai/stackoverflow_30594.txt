Is it possible to find code coverage in ColdFusion?

I am trying to be a "good" programmer and have unit tests for my ColdFusion application but haven't been able to find a code coverage tool that can tie into the test that I'm using. For those of you who do unit tests on your ColdFusion code, how have you approached this problem?
