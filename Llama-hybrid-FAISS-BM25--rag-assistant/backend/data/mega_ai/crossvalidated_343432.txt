Let us assume we have some unobserved variable $\theta$ that represents a state, e.g., $\theta \in \{0,1\}$. We have two sensors, label them $s_1$ and $s_2$, and each produces a random measurement $x_i, i\in \{1,2\}$ that is dependent upon the state, with possibly different probability distributions $p_i(x_i;\theta)$. We'll further assume the random parts of the measurements are independent of each other. Now, if $\theta = 0$, the probability distribution for the measurements $(x_1, x_2)$ is just the product of the sensor-specific probability distributions conditional upon $\theta=0$ (thanks to that independence assumption made in the previous sentence): $$p(x_1,x_2; \theta = 0) = p_1(x_1;\theta=0)p_2(x_2;\theta=0)$$ and similarly for $\theta=1$. If we have a prior distribution on $\theta$, say $P(\theta)$, we can form our posterior distribution in the usual Bayesian way: $$p(\theta;x_1,x_2) \propto p(x_1,x_2;\theta)P(\theta) = p_1(x_1;\theta)p_2(x_2;\theta)P(\theta)$$ ETA: For concreteness, let us assume we are monitoring a piece of equipment that produces power, e.g., a solar panel that tracks the sun. Something happens that may have damaged it, in which case it would a) produce less power, and b) consume more power trying to track the sun. So we have two different sensors reporting measurements, the sensor $s_1$ that tracks power production and the sensor $s_2$ that tracks power consumption. If the tracker is good, power production ($x_1$) is distributed $\text{Normal}(100,10)$. If it is bad, power production is distributed $\text{Normal}(90,10)$. If the tracker is good, power consumption ($x_2$) is distributed $\text{Gamma}(\mu=5,\sigma=2)$. If it is bad, power consumption is distributed $\text{Gamma}(\mu=10,\sigma=3)$. I am parameterizing the Gamma using the mean and standard deviation respectively for ease of interpreting the numbers. If we define a parameter $\theta$ which equals 1 if the tracker is good and 0 if it is bad, we can write the probability distributions for $x_1$ and $x_2$ as follows: $$p_1(x_1;\theta) = \text{Normal}(90 + 10\theta, 10)$$ $$p_2(x_2;\theta) = \text{Gamma}(10-5\theta,3-\theta)$$ Our prior probability is on whether or not the tracker is good, i.e., on $\theta$. We doubt it was damaged; let's set $P(\theta = 1) = 0.75$. Now we look at our sensor readings. $x_1 = 97$ and $x_2 = 6.7$. On to the Bayesian calculation engine! The likelihood function for $\theta$ is just the product of the individual probability distributions $p_1$ and $p_2$: $$L(\theta; x_1,x_2) = p_1(x_1;\theta)p_2(x_2;\theta)$$ and some calculation gives us the following results: $$L(\theta=0; x_1=97, x_2=6.7) = 0.00281$$ $$L(\theta=1; x_1=97, x_2=6.7) = 0.00364$$ and our posterior probability that the tracker is good is: $$P(\theta = 1) = {0.00364*0.75 \over 0.00364*0.75 + 0.00281*0.25} = 0.795$$ Note that it is not, strictly speaking, necessary that we construct a numeric parameter $\theta$ for this example. We could have just done everything using "Good" and "Bad" as conditions for selecting, in the case of sensor 1, which of two Normal distributions to use in the calculation, and similarly for sensor 2, and we would have gotten the same result.
