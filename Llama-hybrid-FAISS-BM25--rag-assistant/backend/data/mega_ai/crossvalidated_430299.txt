Word for data set that holds up through outliers?

I'm trying to think of the word that describes a set of data that is large/diverse enough that outliers don't make much of a difference in interpreting the data. For example, the average of $\{4,4,6,3,5,4,3,4,5,15\}$ (which is $5.3$ ) is much more similar to the same data set without the $15$ (which is $4.2$ ) than the average of $\{8,5,6,18\}$ (which is $9.3$ ) is to itself without the $18$ (which is $6.3$ ). This term would be used as: "set 1 is more ___ than set 2 because it has a larger sample size." Thanks!
