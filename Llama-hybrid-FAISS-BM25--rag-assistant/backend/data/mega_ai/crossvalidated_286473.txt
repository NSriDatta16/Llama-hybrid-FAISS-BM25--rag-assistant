It is said Logistic regression doesn't deal with categorical features well. Why is it so?

multiple articles on the internet proclaim that logistic regression as a method is not able to deal with categorical independent features well. Unfortunately i was not able to find any explanation for it. Can anybody help me out on why this is so? quoting from the article "Too many categorical variables are also a problem for logistic regression." the article in question is present here. http://www.edvancer.in/logistic-regression-vs-decision-trees-vs-svm-part2/
