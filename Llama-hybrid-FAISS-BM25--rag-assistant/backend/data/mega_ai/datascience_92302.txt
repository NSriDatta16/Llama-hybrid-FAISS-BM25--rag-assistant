How do you perform basic statistical analysis on a Binary Dataset?

I have never worked with a Binary dataset (1 and 0) (True or False) so I'm unsure what kind of statistical tests I should run to draw up simple conclusions. I'm doing a data science project and the company wants to know/understand what features/characteristics are important to decide whether or not a customer will renew their lease (last column in Graph). They want me to just perform basic/simple probability and statistical analysis on the dataset. I'm working in a Juypter notebook (pandas, seaborm, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn). I would appreciate it if someone could help lead me in a direction to what kind of simple analysis I can run on binary data. Heres a sample of the table: ID Age 20-29 Age 30-39 Age 40-49 Age 50 > Lease Length Lease Length 1-2 Years Lease Length > 3 Years Late Payment No Fine Violations Credit Score Below 600 Renews 312 1 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 313 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 0 314 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 315 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 0 1 1
