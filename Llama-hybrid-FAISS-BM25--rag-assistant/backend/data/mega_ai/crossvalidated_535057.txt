Note that a classifier does not yield probabilities but instead involves a forced binary choice. You must be talking about a probability estimation method. Logistic regression will handle the entire range of probabilities, even for rare events. But with only 134 events you have a very small effective sample size for estimating the contributions of multiple predictors. Don't consider sampling with replacement to develop the probability model. You will need to have only a handful of candidate predictive features with 134 events or will need to make heavy use of data reduction that is blinded to the outcome variable (unsupervised learning) as a first step.
