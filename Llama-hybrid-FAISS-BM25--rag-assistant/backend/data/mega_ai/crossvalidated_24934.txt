Command-line tool to calculate basic statistics for stream of values

Is there any command-line tool that accepts the flow of numbers (in ascii format) from standard input and gives the basic descriptive statistics for this flow, such as min, max, average, median, RMS, quantiles etc? The output is welcome to be parseable by the next command in command-line chain. Working environment is Linux, but other options are welcome.
