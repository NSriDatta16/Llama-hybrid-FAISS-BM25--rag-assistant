If the things being counted are independent of each other and the rate is constant (or follows a model like in poisson regression) then the Poisson distribution will generally hold quite well. Examples like cars arriving at a garage tend to work fairly well (over periods of time that the rate is fairly constant, including both rush hour and the middle of the night for a garage frequented by 9 to 5 workers would not work well). What time you arrive at the garage will have little or influence on what time I arrive. There are exceptions however in that if 2 people arrange to meet at a given time then they are likely to arrive closer together, if one follows the other then they will be even closer. Also things like a nearby traffic light could cause clumps in the arrivals that would not match a Poisson. If you want to compare a specific dataset to see if the Poisson is a good match then you can use a hanging rootogram .
