Since you posted your question under the c++ tag as well as c, then I am assuming you are using c++. In c++, you can also use the #pragma once compiler directive: 1.h: #pragma once #include "2.h" /// rest of 1.h 2.h: #pragma once #include "1.h" /// rest of 2.h The result is the same. But there are some notes: pragma once will usually compile a little faster since it is a higher level mechanism and doesn't happen at preprocessing like include guards Some compilers have known bugs "dealing" with #pragma once. Though most if not all modern compilers will handle it correctly. For a detailed list see Wikipedia Edit: I think the directive is also supported in c compilers but have never tried it, and besides, in most c programs I've seen, include guards are the standard (maybe due to compiler limitations handling the pragma once directive?)
