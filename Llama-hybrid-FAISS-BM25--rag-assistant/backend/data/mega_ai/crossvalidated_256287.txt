Statistics point estimation question

I have the following question, I am not sure how to interpret it. Suppose we are interested in estimating the difference in true average mean length between the two species of fish. Calculate an appropriate point estimate of Species 1 mu - Species 2 mu. Based on your point estimate, which species of fish appears to be longer on average? It also gives a table full of values for each species. This sounds to me like i am supposed to get the mean of species 1, and then the mean of species 2 and see which one is longer? Is that the right way to proceed?
