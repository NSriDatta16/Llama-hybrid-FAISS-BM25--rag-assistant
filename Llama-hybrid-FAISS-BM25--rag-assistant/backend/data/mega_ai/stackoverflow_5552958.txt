No, there is no way to drag and drop an attachment file from an outlook e-mail. @Richard: AIR doesn't allow dropping message files to an AIR-Application. Instead you receive a String, containing some mail info like subject, size, recipient. No content, no attachments. That's a pity... Please feel free to correct me, but I have searched for a solution for a while and no solution found.... Greetings steelheart
