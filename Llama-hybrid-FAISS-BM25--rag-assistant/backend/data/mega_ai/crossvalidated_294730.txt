Filtering noise with Machine Learning

I was wondering if it could be possible to filter noise in an image using machine learning techniques. In my concrete case, I have important information as points (of the same size) that form a diagonal and a lot of noise in form of ""random"" points like a genome comparison (see figure 1). For sure, there are Â¿simpler? techniques to do that. I have implemented myself a simple heuristic to clean the image, for example, but It could be done using ML? maybe like a dataset with diagonals and other with random points? I usually use tensorflow so, if you know about something similar already implemented, it could be great to see it.
