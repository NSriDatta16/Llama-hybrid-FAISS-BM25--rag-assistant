Use external image in UIImage imageNamed

I am downloading two images from the web Apple.png and Apple@2x.png. I want to use [UIImage imageNamed:@"Apple.png"] so it can use the build in features to detect whether it should display either Apple.png or Apple@2x.png. Now where do I store these images? I read the following in the documentation: The name of the file. If this is the first time the image is being loaded, the method looks for an image with the specified name in the applicationâ€™s main bundle. Ah so the Application's Main Bundle is the way to go. This is what my code looks like: NSString *directory = [[NSBundle mainBundle] bundlePath]; NSString *path = [directory stringByAppendingPathComponent:imageName]; NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager]; [fileManager createFileAtPath:path contents:dataFetcher.receivedData attributes:nil]; I checked if the file was created in the folder of the path and that was correct. I also dragged an Example.png in my project file just to see if it got stored in the same folder and that also was correct. However, [UIImage imageNamed:@"Apple.png"] , still fails to fetch the images.
