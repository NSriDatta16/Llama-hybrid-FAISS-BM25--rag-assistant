How to choose between data-driven pattern or intuition?

I am performing a multivariate logistic regression (This could very well be any other kind of regression method) to study the effect of some predictor variables on the probability of event. I have some prior knowledge that informs me that the effect of a continuous predictor variable $X_1$ should be monotonic. However, when I use a natural cubic spline to expand $X_1$ and include it together with the other variables, I got a $V$-shaped effect for $X_1$. For example, if the event is death from poisoning, $X_1$ is the exposure of subject to certain hazardous material. I could find no reasonable explanation of the downward sloping part of the effect. What would you suggest I do? Here are some potential solutions I have considered, neither is very satisfactory: ignore the downward sloping part, and just fit a simple spline for the upward sloping part trust the result from the natural cubic spline and then apply the model directly My feeling is that the best approach is probably to uncover the root of the strange phenomenon, likely a confounding variable. But I am not sure how to even start on this? Any suggestion would be appreciated!
