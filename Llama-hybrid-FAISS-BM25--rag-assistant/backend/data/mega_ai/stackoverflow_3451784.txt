I would probably not recommend using LINQ to SQL at this point. If you're doing new development, I would recommend the ADO.NET Entity Framework instead. This is a much more current, actively developed alternative to LINQ to SQL, as it's getting a lot of attention from Microsoft moving forward. As for LINQ to Nhibernate... If you're already planning to use Nhibernate, this gives you the benefits of LINQ. I, personally, very much like using LINQ in my projects, as I find it makes my code faster to write and more maintainable, so I'd highly recommend this. I'd probably still favor EF over Nhibernate for .NET development (it's built into the framework, supported by MS, etc), however.
