een 1993 and 1997, several companies proposed solutions, such as Microsoft's at Work or Novell's NEST. The field gained momentum when Bill Joy envisioned device-to-device communication as part of his "Six Webs" framework, which was presented at the World Economic Forum in Davos in 1999. The concept of the "Internet of things" and the term itself first appeared in a speech by Peter T. Lewis to the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation 15th Annual Legislative Weekend in Washington, D.C., published in September 1985. According to Lewis, "The Internet of Things, or IoT, is the integration of people, processes, and technology with connectable devices and sensors to enable remote monitoring, status, manipulation, and evaluation of trends of such devices." The term "Internet of things" was coined independently by Kevin Ashton of Procter & Gamble, later of Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Auto-ID Center, in 1999, despite preferring the phrase "Internet for things." At that point, he considered radio-frequency identification (RFID) an essential component of the Internet of things, as it would effectively enable computers to manage all individual things. The primary defining characteristic of the Internet of things has been considered its ability to embed short-range mobile transceivers in various gadgets and daily necessities, enabling new forms of communication between people and things, as well as between things themselves. In 2004, Cornelius "Pete" Peterson, CEO of NetSilicon, predicted that "The next era of information technology will be dominated by [IoT] devices, and networked devices will ultimately gain in popularity and significance to the extent that they will far exceed the number of networked computers and workstations." Peterson believed that medical devices and industrial controls would become dominant applications of the technology. Defining the Internet of things as "simply the point in time when more 'things or objects' were connected to the Internet than people", Cisco Systems estimated that the IoT was "born" between 2008 and 2009, with the things/people ratio growing from 0.08 in 2003 to 1.84 in 2010. Applications The extensive set of applications for IoT devices is often divided into consumer, commercial, industrial, and infrastructure spaces. Consumers A growing portion of IoT devices is created for consumer use, including connected vehicles, home automation, wearable technology, connected health, and appliances with remote monitoring capabilities. Home automation IoT devices are part of the broader concept of home automation, which generally includes lighting, heating and air conditioning, media and security systems, and camera systems. Moreover, long-term benefits could include energy savings by automatically ensuring lights and electronics are turned off or by making the residents in the home aware of usage. A smart home, also known as an automated home, could be based on a platform or hubs that control smart devices and appliances. For instance, using Apple's HomeKit, manufacturers can have their home products and accessories controlled by an application in iOS devices such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch. This could be a dedicated app or iOS native applications such as Siri. This can be demonstrated in the case of Lenovo's Smart Home Essentials, which is a line of smart home devices that are controlled through Apple's Home app or Siri without the need for a Wi-Fi bridge. There are also dedicated smart home hubs that are offered as standalone platforms to connect different smart home products. These include the Amazon Echo, Google Home, Apple's HomePod, and Samsung's SmartThings Hub. In addition to the commercial systems, there are many non-proprietary, open source ecosystems, including Home Assistant, OpenHAB, and Domoticz. Elder care One key application of a smart home is to assist the elderly and individuals with disabilities. These home systems use assistive technology to accommodate an owner's sp
