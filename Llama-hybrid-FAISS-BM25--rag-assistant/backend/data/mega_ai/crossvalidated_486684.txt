Finding the interaction terms in Logistic Regression with 4 ind. variables (11 different ways of choosing int. terms)

When doing logistic regression with 4 independent variables, it is believed there will be significant interaction effects, and the strongest interaction will probably be when 3 or 4 of the variables are non-zero. There will also be interactions with pairs of the variables being non-zero. The 4 independent variables can have values from 0 to 6 (integers). This represents the count of a condition. (A different condition is counted for each variable. There are 11 different ways to choose one or more interactions terms here. R throws an error with this command, as there are too many interactions: (that's how I interpreted it when I wrote this - I don't recall the exact message now) model_1 How should I proceed in finding the significant interactions? UPDATE This problem has disappeared. I reloaded the project and dataset in a new R-Studio session (the old one was closed), and re-ran the exact same command, and I am no longer getting an error. model_1 The model includes all 11 possible interaction terms. I guess the error was caused by some library conflict. If I had time, I'd go back through the history (long), reloading libraries to try and recreate the error message. I don't recall what the error message was now.
