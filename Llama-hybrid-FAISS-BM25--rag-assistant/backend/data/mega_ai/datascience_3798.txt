Try exploring the rich field of "Anomaly Detection in Time Series". Control charts and CUSUMs (or cumulative sum control charts) might help you. Simple Bullet Graphs might be all you need. Based on historical data and domain knowledge, define normal variance. Then make it clear to stakeholders when the current value is outside of predefined ranges. Stephen Few is an expert in business dashboards. Any of his books will help you. If you are open to R, try Shiny to create simple interactive web applications (It is very straightforward). There is also an open source package for anomaly detection , both local and global. Create quick prototypes and get feedback!
