Explanation of equation from DeepLearning Book

I have been reading Deep Learning from Goodfellow et al In chapter 6, Deep Feedforward networks, in choosing the mapping for ϕ, they've used the equation $y=f(x;θ,w)=ϕ(x;θ)^Tw$ . I was wondering why are there two parameters. Does it mean $θ$ is used to learn the function $ϕ$ and not the function $f$ . Also is the parameter $θ$ necessary? Can't the function be learned only using $w$ .
