Cluster centroids vs PCA as a preprocessing stage

K-means centroids: using cluster centroids as samples. PCA: Principal Component Analysis What advantages or disadvantages are when using any of them as a preprocessing stage in machine learning? In what situation their use will be recommended? Both will destroy the features. Because the original samples will be transformed. Unless medoids are used. Thank you
