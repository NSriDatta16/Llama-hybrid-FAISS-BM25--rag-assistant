When using MCMC to sample the predictions you would first take a sample from the posterior for the parameters $\beta$ , and then plug in the parameters and the data $\tilde{\mathbf{x}}$ . Let's use the Stan code example to illustrate it. // [...] model { y ~ poisson_log(alpha + beta * x); { alpha, beta } ~ normal(0, 1); } generated quantities { array[N_tilde] int y_tilde = poisson_log_rng(alpha + beta * x_tilde); } What the code does, is it first samples the alpha and beta parameters, then it predicts the mean of the Poisson distribution in alpha + beta * x_tilde , and for each x_tilde it samples one value from the Poisson distribution with the predicted mean. So it does use the samples from the posterior distribution but the samples alone do not produce the posterior predictive samples. I'm not sure how you would like to use them for this purpose other than by plugging them into the model to sample the predictions.
