How can I terminate a running Maven build in NetBeans?

If I run a Maven build in NetBeans which starts a long-running Java process (for example a HTTP listener or a JMX agent), terminating the process seems to have no effect. So I have to restart NetBeans and terminate the processes manually. I am using NetBeans 6.5 and 6.7 RC 1 on Windows XP and Vista.
