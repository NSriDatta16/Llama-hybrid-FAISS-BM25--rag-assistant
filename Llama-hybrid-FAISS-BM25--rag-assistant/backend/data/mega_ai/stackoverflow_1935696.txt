A WPF resource (build action = Resource ) leverages embedded resources as supported by the core .NET framework, but adds support for accessing the embedded resource via a pack URI . From MSDN : WPF resource files are not the same as the embedded or linked type of resources that can be configured using the core .NET Framework support for assembly resources. While WPF resource files do leverage the core .NET Framework embedded resource support, the ability to access WPF resource files using pack URIs is easier than using namespaces.
