Are there any advantages to using an XSLT stylesheet compared to manually parsing an XML file using a DOM parser

For one of our applications, I've written a utility that uses java's DOM parser. It basically takes an XML file, parses it and then processes the data using one of the following methods to actually retrieve the data. getElementByTagName() getElementAtIndex() getFirstChild() getNextSibling() getTextContent() Now i have to do the same thing but i am wondering whether it would be better to use an XSLT stylesheet. The organisation that sends us the XML file keeps changing their schema meaning that we have to change our code to cater for these shema changes. Im not very familiar with XSLT process so im trying to find out whether im better of using XSLT stylesheets rather than "manual parsing". The reason XSLT stylesheets looks attractive is that i think that if the schema for the XML file changes i will only need to change the stylesheet? Is this correct? The other thing i would like to know is which of the two (XSLT transformer or DOM parser) is better performance wise. For the manual option, i just use the DOM parser to parse the xml file. How does the XSLT transformer actually parse the file? Does it include additional overhead compared to manually parsing the xml file? The reason i ask is that performance is important because of the nature of the data i will be processing. Any advice? Thanks Edit Basically what I am currently doing is parsing an xml file and process the values in some of the xml elements. I don't transform the xml file into any other format. I just extract some value, extract a row from an Oracle database and save a new row into a different table. The xml file I parse just contains reference values I use to retrieve some data from the database. Is xslt not suitable in this scenario? Is there a better approach that I can use to avoid code changes if the schema changes? Edit 2 Apologies for not being clear enough about what i am doing with the XML data. Basically there is an XML file which contains some information. I extract this information from the XML file and use it to retrieve more information from a local database. The data in the xml file is more like reference keys for the data i need in the database. I then take the content i extracted from the XML file plus the content i retrieved from the database using a specific key from the XML file and save that data into another database table. The problem i have is that i know how to write a DOM parser to extract the information i need from the XML file but i was wondering whether using an XSLT stylesheet was a better option as i wouldnt have to change the code if the schema changes. Reading the responses below it sounds like XSLT is only used for transorming and XML file to another XML file or some other format. Given that i dont intend to transform the XML file, there is probably no need to add the additional overhead of parsing the XSLT stylesheet as well as the XML file.
