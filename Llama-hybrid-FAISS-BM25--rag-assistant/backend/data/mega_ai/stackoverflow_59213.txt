Easiest way to add a Header and Footer to a Printing.PrintDocument (.Net 2.0)?

What's the easiest way to add a header and footer to a .Net PrintDocument object, either pragmatically or at design-time? Specifically I'm trying to print a 3rd party grid control (Infragistics GridEx v4.3), which takes a PrintDocument object and draws itself into it. The resulting page just contains the grid and it's contents - however I would like to add a header or title to identify the printed report, and possibly a footer to show who printed it, when, and ideally a page number and total pages. I'm using VB.Net 2.0. Thanks for your help!
