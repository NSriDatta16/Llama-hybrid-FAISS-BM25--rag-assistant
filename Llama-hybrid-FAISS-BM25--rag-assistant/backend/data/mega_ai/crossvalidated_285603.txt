@RobertF you missed the fact that many comparable subjects close to treated subjects were excluded with this algorithm. Regarding the "big deal" it is true that it's worse to lose subjects from the group with the lower sample size. But I claim it is not really scientific to exclude informative data that were already collected. This has nothing to do with bias. It also has to do with non-reproducibility of analyses by others.
