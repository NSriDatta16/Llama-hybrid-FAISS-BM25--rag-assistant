I must admit that I even do not understand the first assertion: if there are four items, the probability that a random choice of the best item is correct is 25%, not 50%, and the probability that both best and worst are correct is even lower. Maybe there is more information in the reference (Hollis, 2017), which is behind a paywall. Apparently, the authors do not seek a confidence interval for the BWS, but for the "compliance rate", which is a proportion. binom.confint(260/2, 260) returnes a confidence interval $50\%\pm 6.23\%$ , which is close to the alleged value. To obtain a confidence interval for BWS itself, the most straightforward method is a non-parametric approach via the "bias corrected accelerated (BCa) bootstrap". The idea is to randomly draw answers with replacement and compute percentiles of the resulting BWS's (BCa adds some vodoo to reduce bias and impreve asymptotic convergence to the nominal coverage probability). Moreover, it is also possible to estimate the variance of the BWS with the "Jackknife Method". For details on applying the bootstrap for computing confidence intervals for arbitrary estimators with R sample code, section 6 of this technical report might be helpful.
