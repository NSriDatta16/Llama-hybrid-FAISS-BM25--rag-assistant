You're getting there. In the (free, online, excellent) textbook, this falls into section 17.3, "Processing two lists simultaneously: Case 3". I suggest you take a look. http://www.htdp.org/2003-09-26/Book/curriculum-Z-H-1.html#node_toc_node_sec_17.3 One caveat: it looks like the data definition you're working with is "s-expression", which you can state like this: ;; an s-expression is either ;; - the empty list, or ;; - (cons symbol s-expression), or ;; - (cons s-expression s-expression) Since this data definition has three cases, there are nine possibilities when considering two of them. John Clements (Yes, you could reduce the number of cases by embedding the data in the more general one that includes improper lists. Doesn't sound like a good idea to me.)
