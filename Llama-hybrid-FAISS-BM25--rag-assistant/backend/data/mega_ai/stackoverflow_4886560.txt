BIRT: Computing the average of a time interval

I have the following database table consisting of a series of tasks: id BIGINT NOT NULL time_in timestamp(0) with time zone, time_out timestamp(0) with time zone, user_name text NOT NULL I compute the duration of a task as (time_out - time_in). I need to first compute the average task duration for a given user, and afterwards for all users. I do the first within the SQL query used to obtain the data set. The result of this is an INTERVAL, but in BIRT it is seen as a String (maybe because the INTERVAL data type is absent). So now I have a set of Strings, each representing an INTERVAL. How do I compute their average? P.S. I first thought I should do this by using the BIRT 'Time' data type. However, 'Time' represents a time of day, not an interval. There seems to be not equivalent for INTERVAL in BIRT.
