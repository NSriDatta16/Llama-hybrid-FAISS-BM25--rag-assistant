The number in a MySQL INT(n) datatype doesn't specify how much storage space is reserved, it's a display-width for formatting purposes only. As such an INT(10) is the same as a plain INTEGER , that is to say a 32-bit signed number. So this is certainly an appropriate datatype for a 32-bit Unix timestamp. But if you want 64-bit timestamps it's not going to be enough; you would have to use a BIGINT .
