how to add xml file when u have drawable-hdpi,mdpi,ldpi instead of drawable in eclipse?

Possible Duplicate: How to add XML drawable in Eclipse Ok guys I'm little stacked here. According to official documentation Google says that "Once you've defined your Drawable in XML, save the file in the res/drawable/ directory of your project." is the way to add a XML drawable to the project. But when I created the project ADT created 3 different drawable folders for mdpi, hdpi, and ldpi. So when I wanted to create my XML drawable, I right click on my drawable-hdpi folder and select "Add new Android XML file", and there I have to select what kind of XML file I want to create, but there isn't "drawable" to select. If I create new text file and save it as button_drawable.xml Eclipse says that there is an Error in the file and that It can't build my project. So, please tell me how do you add xml drawables in Eclipse
