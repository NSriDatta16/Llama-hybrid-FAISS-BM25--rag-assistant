In order to identify outliers, one needs to have an equation that adequately describes the signal. When faced with analyzing time series data fitting splines initially seems interesting but ultimately fails. The problem is that one has to determine the number of splines ( pure deterministic structure) and the length of each spline.This approach essentially is a fitting approach rather than a modelling (data-based) approach. The nature of the signal and the nature of the errors needs to be identified. Possible models might possibly include both a deterministic structure for the signal and/or autoregressive structure for the signal. Deterministic structure can include level shifts, local time trends (splines), seasonal(periodic) pulses and one-time pulses and sometimes in "physical/biological time series" sines,cosines and such but never in powers of time like quadratics/cubics etc.. Autoregressive structure can include the explicit incorporation of previous values. Errors from this "model" can often be characterized with an ARIMA structure thus further enhancing the signal. The final model should render a set of residuals that have a constant mean and variance. Your characterization implies that there might be identifiable "patches of residuals" , possibly having a "trend". I would suggest that you post your, perhaps scaled to hide the real data, and have some of the readers of your post to actually render a workable solution. You can then systematize their solution and incorporate it into your application. You might want to review a similar thread as it deals with analysing time series data. How do I calculate projected figures for the next year based on past performance?
