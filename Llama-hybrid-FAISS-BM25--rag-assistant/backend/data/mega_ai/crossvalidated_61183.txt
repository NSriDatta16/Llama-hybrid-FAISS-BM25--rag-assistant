Bioinformatical problem - specific word enrichment in a given sequence

My bioinformatical problem looks like this: two sets of gene sequences (size of set A > 1000, size of set B > 1000; sequence length varies from 1000 to 100000). Set_A_Sequence_1: ACGTACGTACGT... Set_A_Sequence_2: ACGGAAGT AAA T... .... Set_B_Sequence_1: AAA G AAA TG AAA ... Set_B_Sequence_2: AAA TC AAA C AAA ... ... I want to see if Set_B sequences are enriched for specific word (for example: AAA ). How can I do this? I came up with three solutions: Count how many Set_A sequences have/don't have word; Count how many Set_B sequences have/don't have word. Apply Fisher's test. Count how many word occurrences there are per sequence in Set_A; Count how many word occurrences there are per sequence in Set_B. (For a given set example that would be: Set_A:0,1; Set_B:3,3). What statistical test I can use for such enrichment analysis? Calculate percentage of sequence in Set_A covered with word; Calculate percentage of sequence in Set_B covered with word. (For example, data would look like this: Set_A:0%,25%; Set_B:75%,75%). What statistical test I can use for such enrichment analysis? Questions: Is it right to use Fisher test in solution 1 (Contain/Don't contain word)? What statistical tests I could use for solution 2 (Number of words)? What statistical tests I could use for solution 3 (Coverage with word)? Edit Simplified data looks like this: Sequence name Length Contain word(0/1) Number of words Coverage with word(%) Set_A_seq_1 1000 0 0 0 Set_A_seq_2 2000 1 1 15 Set_A_seq_3 3450 0 0 0 Set_A_seq_4 10000 0 0 0 Set_A_seq_5 25000 1 2 5 ... Set_B_seq_1 20000 1 3 25 Set_B_seq_2 100000 1 3 30 Set_B_seq_2 9000 1 5 70 Set_B_seq_2 10000 1 10 85 Set_B_seq_2 12000 1 7 60 ... EDIT I wasn't able to find a lot of published methodology for genomic site enrichment, but this figure suggests perfect way of solving problem that I have. Figure A. - Enrichment in three different genomic sites compared using permutation and odd enrichment to permutated data.
