How do I strongly type criteria when using NHibernate's CreateCriteria method?

I'm currently using NHibernate, for the first time, with Fluent NHibernate. I've gotten everything setup nicely, however now I've come to actual doing some data retrieval, it seems to have fallen short. I was expecting NHibernate, to allow me to do something like: session.CreateCriteria () .Add(Restrictions.Eq(x=> x.DocketNumber, "10101")); However, this doesn't appear to be the case and I seem to have to write: session.CreateCriteria () .Add(Restrictions.Eq("DocketNumber", "10101")); That'll be less-than-wonderful when I rename any properties! I've always though hard coded strings in code is bad, especially when the strings relate to property names. Is there any way I can strongly type these restrictions? I had a look at this blog post, but it seems quite messy, is there a nicer solution?
