If you didnt find it yet, https://www.phpro.org/tutorials/Introduction-to-SPL.html has a few examples that might help you. IteratorIterator > "This iterator wrapper allows the conversion of anything that is Traversable into an Iterator." Traversable > "Interface to detect if a class is traversable using foreach." "Internal (built-in) classes that implement this interface can be used in a foreach construct and do not need to implement IteratorAggregate or Iterator." "This is an internal engine interface which cannot be implemented in PHP scripts. Either IteratorAggregate or Iterator must be used instead." The site has some RecursiveIteratorIterator examples that might be handy but, if i get it right , IteratorIterator is from the scripting point of view pretty useless (when used to foreach at least). It creates Iterateable Objects out of Objects implementing the Traversable interface, but intern classes implementing the Traversable interface are foreachable anyway and scripts cannot implement Traversable... (Not mentioned in the docs, the SimpleXMLElement is implementing Traversable)
