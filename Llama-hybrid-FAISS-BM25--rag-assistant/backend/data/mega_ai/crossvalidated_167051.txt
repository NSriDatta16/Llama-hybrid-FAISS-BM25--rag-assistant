Who Are The Bayesians?

As one becomes interested in statistics, the dichotomy "Frequentist" vs. "Bayesian" soon becomes commonplace (and who hasn't read Nate Silver's The Signal and the Noise , anyway?). In talks and introductory courses, the point of view is overwhelmingly frequentist ( MLE , $p$ values), but there tends to be a tiny fraction of time dedicated to admire Bayes formula and touch upon the idea of a prior distribution , usually tangentially. The tone employed to discuss Bayesian statistics oscillates between respect for its conceptual underpinnings, and a hint of skepticism regarding the chasm between lofty objectives, and arbitrariness in the selection of the prior distribution, or eventual use of frequentist maths after all. Sentences such as "if you are a hard-core Bayesian..." abound. The question is, Who are the Bayesians today? Are they some select academic institutions where you know that if you go there you will become a Bayesian? If so, are they specially sought after? Are we referring to just a few respected statisticians and mathematicians, and if so who are they? Do they even exist as such, these pure "Bayesians"? Would they happily accept the label? Is it always a flattering distinction? Are they mathematicians with peculiar slides in meetings, deprived of any $p$ values and confidence intervals, easily spotted on the brochure? How much of a niche is being a "Bayesian"? Are we referring to a minority of statisticians? Or is current Bayesian-ism equated with machine learning applications? ... Or even more likely, is Bayesian statistics not so much a branch of statistics, but rather an epistemological movement that transcends the ambit of probability calculations into a philosophy of science? In this regard, all scientists would be Bayesian at heart... but there would be no such thing as a pure Bayesian statistician impermeable to frequentist techniques (or contradictions).
