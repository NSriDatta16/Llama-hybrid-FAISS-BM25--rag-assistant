I can completely understand your situation. Even though I am PhD student, I find it hard sometimes to related theory and application. If you are willing to immerse yourself in understanding theory, it is definitely rewarding when you think about real world problems. But the process may be frustrating. One of the many references that I like is Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis Using Hierarchical/Multilevel Models . They avoid the theory where they can express the underlying concept using simulations. It will definitely benefit you as you have experience in MCMC etc. As you say, you are working in bioinformatics, probably Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies is a great reference too. I will make this a community wiki and let others add to it.
