Fisher's exact test assumes fixed (conditioned) row and column totals. It looks like the total number of 1's for your dataset is not fixed and could have been anything from 0 to 40. In other words, you do not know in advance the margins of your contingency table to which you will apply the test: \begin{array}{l | ll | l} & X_{2} = 0 & X_2 = 1 & \text{Total} \\ \hline X_1 = 0 & \text{...} & \text{...} & \text{?} \\ X_1 = 1 & \text{...} & \text{...} & \text{?} \\ \hline \text{Total} & \text{?} & \text{?} & 40 \end{array} This means that both the row and column totals are unconditioned in your case. Therefore Fisher's exact test is not exact in your case and it is true that applying it means you have less power on average. Barnard's exact test and it's variant Boscholoo's test, do not condition on any margin, so you have more power using them on average. To help you decide between Bernard's and Boscholoo's test see this . Regarding multiple testing, you could simply apply Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons. This means with 3 pairwise comparisons, at P Regarding your first question. I don't see any matched pairs of subjects in this data. What I understand by paired data: For example using some additional treatment information we can have contingency table: \begin{array}{l | ll } & X_{\text{after}} = 0 & X_{\text{after}} = 1 \\ \hline X_{\text{before}} = 0 & \text{...} & \text{...} \\ X_{\text{before}} = 1 & \text{...} & \text{...} \\ \end{array} Or by using some additional similarity information, something like this: \begin{array}{l | ll } & X_{\text{sibling}} = 0 & X_{\text{sibling}} = 1 \\ \hline X = 0 & \text{...} & \text{...} \\ X = 1 & \text{...} & \text{...} \\ \end{array} For this kind of paired data we can use the McNemar's test . In logistic regression example you probably meant: glm(X1 ~ X2 + X3, data = data1, family = binomial) glm(X4 ~ X2, data = data1, family = binomial)
