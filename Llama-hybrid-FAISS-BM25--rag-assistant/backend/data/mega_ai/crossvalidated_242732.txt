Meaning of "Pre-Post estimation model"

The model given just looks like a time series panel data with added controls but then I noticed that there was only one constant (so not a Fixed Effects Model ) and but the error term changes between restaurant indicitating that it maybe a Random Effects Model . $$y_{it}= \beta_0 +\text{Grading_Post}_{it}'\beta _1 +X_1'\beta_2 |+\text{Pre_Post}_it+\gamma_i +\delta_i+\epsilon_{it} $$ Where the dependent variable is fines/inspection score http://www.appam.org/assets/1/7/Impact_paper_9-30-15.pdf Page 14 has the models Page 31 onwards has the regressions I've consulted my book "Principle of Econometrics" but it does not seem to discussed and this book just about discusses everything. Can anyone link me to something can explain this concept better? edit: I think i get it now this is a panel data however the way the model is written allows for the model to test two different regressions. One is the initial inspection score and the other is final inspection score. Grading_Post uses a dummy variable mechanic where it equal 1 if it's the initial score (if testing for initial score) and 0 otherwise. Does anyone know what they also mean by "Seasonal Fixed Effects" and "Restaurant Fixed Effects" that has to be panel data right? I think it's an extra intercept that is unique for each restaurant or season.
