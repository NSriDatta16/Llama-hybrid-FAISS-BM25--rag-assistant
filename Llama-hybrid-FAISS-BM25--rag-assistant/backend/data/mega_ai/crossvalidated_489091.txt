Partially left truncated data in bivariate time series, one series is missing data what to do?

I have two time series of futures Settlement Prices where I am to model the systematic volatility of the settlement prices for these two time series. My plan is to: Calculate the logged returns. Fit a VAR model to the data. Denote the residuals by, $u_t$ . Fit an MGARCH model to the residuals $u_t$ . Infer on the parameters. Forecast. I hope this plan is alright. However, my issue is that one of my time series are left truncated (I suppose both are in a certain sense) and I can't seem to find out what to do about it. The time series do share the same endpoint and the data are equidistant, but one is missing data in the beginning. After some googling it seems like its possible to setup some sort of truncated distribution, but I've only found that for a single variable (and mostly survival analysis), and I obviously do not know the distribution of my data. How do I approach this problem? Any sources or hints would be great, thank you.
