There is a good reason why the regression coefficients in logistic regression are estimated by maximizing the likelihood or penalized likelihood. This leads to certain optimality properties. The concordance probability ($c$-index; AUROC) is a useful supplemental measure for describing the final model's predictive discrimination, but it is not sensitive enough for the use you envisioned nor would it lead to an optimal model. This is quite aside from the overfitting issue, which affects both the $c$-index and the (unpenalized) likelihood. The $c$-index can reach its maximum with a misleadingly small number of predictors, even though it does not penalize for model complexity, because the concordance probability does not reward extreme predictions that are "correct". $c$ uses only the rank order of predictions and not the absolute predicted values. $c$ is not sensitive enough to be used to compare two models. Seeking a model that does not use the entire list of predictors is often not well motivated. Model selection brings instability and extreme difficulty with co-linearities. If you want optimum prediction, using all candidate features and incorporating penalization will work best in most situations you are likely to encounter. The data seldom have sufficient information to allow one to make correct choices about which variables are "important" and which are worthless.
