If scalability, throughput and memory usage are not a concern, then using 50 threads is an adequate solution. It has the advantage of being simple, and simplicity is a good thing. If you want to be able to scale, or you are concerned about memory usage (N threads implies N thread stacks) then you need to consider an architecture using NIO selectors. However, the best architecture probably depends on things like: the amount of work that needs to be performed for each client station, whether the work is evenly spread (on average), whether the work involves other I/O, access to shared data structures, etc and how close the aggregate work is to saturating a single processor.
