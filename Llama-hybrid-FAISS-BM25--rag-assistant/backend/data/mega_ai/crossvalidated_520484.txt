Selection of a “best” regression model using differet approaches

I need help with the following question. I am really lost, so any help/hint would be much appreciated! I am aware that for best fit model, we are looking for higher $R^2_{Adj}$ , smaller $MS_{res}$ , PRESS (Prediction error sum of squares), AIC (Akaike Information Criterion) and BIC (Bayesian Information Criterion).
