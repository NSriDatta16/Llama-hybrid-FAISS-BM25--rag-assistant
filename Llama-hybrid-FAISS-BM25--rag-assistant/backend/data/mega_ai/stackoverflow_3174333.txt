GitHub and Source Code Protection and Control

I am working in a small startup organization with approximately 12 - 15 developers. We recently had an issue with one of our servers where by the entire server was "Re provisioned" i.e. completely wiped of all the code, databases, and information on it. Our hosting company informed us that only someone with access to the server account could have done something like this - and we believe that it may have been a disgruntled employee (we have recently had to downsize). We had local backups of some of the data but are still trying to recover from the data loss. My question is this - we have recently began using GitHub to manage source control on some of our other projects - and have more then a few private repositories - is there any way to ensure that there is some sort of protection of our source code? What i mean by this is that I am aware that you can delete an entire Project on GitHub, or even a series of code updates. I would like to avoid this from happening. What i would like to do is create (perhaps in a separate repository) a complete replica of the project on Git - and ensure that only a single individual has access to this replicated project. That way if the original project is corrupted or destroyed for any reason we can restore where we were (with history intact) from the backup repository. Is this possible? What is the best way to do this? Github has recently introduced "Company" accounts... is that the way to go? Any help on this situation would be greatly appreciated. Cheers!
