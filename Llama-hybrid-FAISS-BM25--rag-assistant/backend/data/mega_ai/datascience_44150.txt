How to measure uncertainty and prediction errors for a naive Bayesian Classifier?

I have a small dataset of 30 rows and 5 columns (4 features and 1 class). The classifier is used to give the likelihood of occurrence of an incident. thus, the class variable gives the probability of occurrence. How can I measure the uncertainty and prediction errors of my classifier? I have read a post here about measuring the uncertainty of prediction. However, it is tacking the issue of multiclass classification!
