Second UITouch Event trigger First UITouch Event why?

I have a great problem since last 2 days. I'm working with a multiple Touch enabled view. My UIViewController has 8-10 imageview. I want to detect touch on each view separately, but multiple view at a time. Touch is detected on all image view, but problem is here- Suppose I have Tap on a image view and hold down this image view and now tap another image view, second image view is detected touch successfully but it also trigger to first image view which is previously touched and hold down. But I don't want it. So please any one help me. Code level help is appreciated. NB. My UIViewController also implemented TouchesMoved Methods for swiping purpose. - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { for(UITouch *touch in event.allTouches) { if(CGRectContainsPoint([imView1 frame], [touch locationInView:self.view])){ NSLog(@"imView 1 touched"); } if(CGRectContainsPoint([imView2 frame], [touch locationInView:self.view])){ NSLog(@"imView 2 touched"); } } } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { for(UITouch *touch in event.allTouches) { if(CGRectContainsPoint([imView1 frame], [touch locationInView:self.view])){ NSLog(@"imView 1 touch moved"); } if(CGRectContainsPoint([imView2 frame], [touch locationInView:self.view])){ NSLog(@"imView 2 touch moved"); } } }
