You need to decide which algorithm you use based on your Target Variable(Output, Dependent Variable) . If your Target Variable is Categorical you need to go for Classifier (Binary/Multi), if your Target Variable is Continuous you need to go for Prediction Algorithms (ie: Regression, Decision Tree, etc...), if the data is Time dependent you need to use Forecasting Techniques (Time Series, Croston, etc...) For example if you are looking at Linear Regression : Its basic idea is to fit the data in the form of a line. As we remember in our schooling they taught us about Linear Algebra, where you need to find a solution for a line by substituting points in that, if it satisfies, then it is solvable and many other cases. Same way, here if your target variable is Continuous then you use your features as variables. It attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data. Equation of Linear Regression is: $$Y = a + bX$$ where $X$ is the Explanatory(Features) variable and $Y$ is the Dependent(Target) variable Do not get confused with Logistic Regression(LR) and other Regression Techniques, LR is not a Regression technique it is a Classifier, people generally get confused with that. Regarding Classifiers , if the data is Linearly Separable (Yes/No, 1/0) then we can use LR, if they are not Linearly Separable you need to use techniques like SVM.
