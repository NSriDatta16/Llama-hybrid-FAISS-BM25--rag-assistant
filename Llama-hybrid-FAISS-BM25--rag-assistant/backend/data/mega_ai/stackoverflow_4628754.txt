Serializing OpenXML Parts Elements Storing in VARBINARY SQL 2005

I am building a solution that allows users to pick and chose sections from a Word template, populate those sections with content from a database, and assemble the 1k new data into a new .docx document So far, I have successful methodologies for locating content and transplanting that content into a new document. I am using the OpenXML SDK 2.0 to locate content by Styles and Content Controls. I am able to create IEnumerable objects containing elements such as Paragraphs, SdtBlocks, Run, etc. I need to find an elegant way to serialize these element blocks so I can store them as whole blocks of type VARBINARY in a SQL 2005 database. Can someone please point me to a viable example for serializing these OpenXML parts/elements?
