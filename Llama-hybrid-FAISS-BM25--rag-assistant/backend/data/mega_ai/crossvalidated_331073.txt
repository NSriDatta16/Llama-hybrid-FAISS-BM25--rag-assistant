How Can I teach someone "sampling from a given distribution" is hard?

For many people I know, they do not think sampling from a given distribution is a hard problem in general. For example, many software provide functions do to sample from normal distribution or uniform distribution. How can I teach to other person that, in general, sampling is hard (in terms of time complexity), which is why we have many algorithms to do sample, such as McMC? Is there any good intuitive example of to show sampling is a non-trivial problem?
