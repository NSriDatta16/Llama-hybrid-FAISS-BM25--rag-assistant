No, there isn't a decent solution for body type, unless you're willing to cater only to those with bleeding-edge browsers. Microsoft has WEFT , their own proprietary font-embedding technology, but I haven't heard it talked about in years, and I know no one who uses it. I get by with sIFR for display type (headlines, titles of blog posts, etc.) and using one of the less-worn-out web-safe fonts for body type (like Trebuchet MS). If you're bored with all the web-safe fonts, you're probably defining the term too narrowly â€” look at this matrix of stock fonts that ship with major OSes and chances are you'll be able to find a font cascade that will catch nearly all web users. For instance: font-family: "Lucida Grande", "Verdana", sans-serif is a common font cascade; OS X comes with Lucida Grande, but those with Windows will get Verdana, a web-safe font with letters of similar size and shape to Lucida Grande. Linux users will also get Verdana if they've installed the web-safe fonts package that exists in most distros' package managers, or else they'll fall back to an ordinary sans-serif.
