Multiclass classification of timeseries data using NN

I have the following dataset that I was thinking of using RNN/LSTM for classifying the protocol. Data contains features from packet capture that has only two provided fields: OUI of the MAC address of the device and the inter-arrival time (IAT) of the packets for a specific protocol. For example, the labeled data for http and ntp from the point-of-view of a specific device type is provided below: # MAC, ConnectivityIAT -> protocol ff:f1:f2, 10, -> http ff:f1:f2, 20, -> http ff:f1:f2, 30, -> http ff:f1:f2, 0, -> http ff:f1:f2, 3, -> ntp ff:f1:f2, 6, -> ntp ff:f1:f2, 9, -> ntp The task is to predict the correct class when something like: ff:ff1:f2, 10 -> ? is seen. Questions: How do I convert the categorical value of OUI to numerical entities How to approch the solution using a NN ?
