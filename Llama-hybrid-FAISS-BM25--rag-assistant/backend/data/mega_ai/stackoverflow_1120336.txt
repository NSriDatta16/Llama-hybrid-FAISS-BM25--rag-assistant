What is the easiest way to foreach through a List removing unwanted objects?

In my application, _collection is a List from which I need to remove all User objects which do not match the criteria . However, the following code gets an invalid operation error in its second iteration since the _collection itself has been changed: foreach (User user in _collection) { if (!user.IsApproved()) { _collection.Remove(user); } } I could create another List collection and copy them back and forth but then I have the issue of non-cloned reference types, etc. Is there a way to do the above more elegantly than copying _collection to another another List variable?
