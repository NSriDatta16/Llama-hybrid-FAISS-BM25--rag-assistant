Java WebStart JNLP: Run Different Code in First Run

We are using WebStart JNLP file to create a shortcut on our users` desktop. The problem is that we would like the code in our jar file to be launched only when the user press the desktop shortcut. However, Java WebStart executes the jar also on the first launch (when we set the desktop icon). Is there any way we can set the icon without running the jar, but to launch the jar when the user press the desktop icon?
