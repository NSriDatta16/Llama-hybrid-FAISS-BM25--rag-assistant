We experimented with 1.9 a couple months ago and we were so impressed by the speed improvements that we almost immediately began the process of migrating over to it. The only libraries that did not run smoothly were Facebooker, which one of our developers was able to patch in a couple of days (The plugin is now fully 1.9 compatible), and VPim (iCalendar library) which we were able to switch out easily with the much newer RiCal plugin. Rails 2.3 is absolutely ready to run on 1.9 and in our experience resulted in a greater than 60% improvement in request times. Our integration tests also received the same benefit. We had 1200 tests that tool 300 seconds to run now taking only 110 seconds with no other changes except switching from Ruby 1.8.7 to Ruby 1.9.1. This also means we were able to double the amount of load each of our servers could handle. It's certainly possible that you use a gem that is not 1.9 compatible, but the vast majority of them are or can be made compatible with minor changes. You will definitely not experience any issues with 75,000 unique visitors, and a single server should be able to host a rails application with at least ten times that level of traffic unless your application is written very poorly.
