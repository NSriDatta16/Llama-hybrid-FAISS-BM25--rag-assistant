Is this a valid statement according to the de Finetti theorem?

Some background on my problem - Let us consider a discrete memoryless channel (DMC) $W_{Y|X}$ from Alice to Bob. A DMC is a conditional probability distribution over the random variable $Y$ given input random variable $X$ . We wish to send a uniformly randomly chosen message from a set of size $\mathcal{M}$ over this channel with average transmission error at most $\varepsilon$ . To achieve this, one has an encoder on Alice's side that takes the message as input and outputs a random variable $X$ . $X$ is the input to the channel which outputs random variable $Y$ . A decoder on Bob's side takes random variable $Y$ as input and outputs a message. A transmission error has occurred in the communication protocol if the input and output messages are different and otherwise, Alice and Bob have successfully sent a message using $W$ . Now consider $n$ i.i.d. copies of the given DMC and denote it by $W_{Y|X}^{\otimes n}$ for $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . We ask what the maximum communication rate can be using the DMC $W_{Y|X}^{\otimes n}$ . As before, we have an encoder that takes a uniformly random message from a set $\mathcal{M(n)}$ and outputs and $n$ -bit string $X^n$ . Let $p_{X^n}$ be the distribution over the $n$ -bit strings $X^n$ when we encode a uniformly random message. $p_{X^n}$ must be invariant under any permutation of the $n$ positions since we have $n$ i.i.d. copies of the same channel. As we increase $n$ , we add more i.i.d. copies of $W_{Y|X}$ . Hence, the permutation invariance of our capacity-achieving $p_{X^n}$ holds for any choice of $n\in\mathbb{N}$ . For $k\in\mathbb{N}$ , let us consider i.i.d. distributions $q_{X^k}^i = \prod\limits_{j=1}^kq^i_{X_j}$ for any choice of distribution $q^i$ . Does there always exist a convex combination of such i.i.d. distributions such that $$p_{X^k} = \sum_{i}\mu(i)q_{X^k}^i$$ where $\mu(i)$ is some measure that assigns a weight to each element of our convex combination. I am not sure if this claim is a special case of the de Finetti theorem (see Theorem 2 of these notes ). The point that I am confused about is whether my $p_{X^k}$ can be thought of as extendible for $n>k$ to allow me to invoke the de Finetti theorem.
