Heteroskedasticity- is everything over for my model?

So, I've got this exponential model: Which, when tested via Pagan- Breusch, got heteroskedasticity detected. Breusch-Pagan / Cook-Weisberg test for heteroskedasticity Ho: Constant variance Variables: var2 chi2(1) = 760.75 Prob > chi2 = 0.0000 And visualy: My question, then, is: is there anything I can do to "save" my model?
