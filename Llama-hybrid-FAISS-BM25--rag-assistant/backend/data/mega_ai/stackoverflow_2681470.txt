javascript toolkit for offline webapps

we're building an survey webapp which will let the user to add new records to the survey when offline and will upload when the browser reconnects with the server. We've identified that this will need offline storage and hence google gears seems to be an obvious choice (we understand that adobe Flash has Offline Storage but not sure if that is the best way). I am aware of Dojo offline javascript toolkit which uses google gears for the underlying functionality. However, dojo offline is not part of the dojo toolkit after version 1.3. (currently dojo is 1.4.2). Google gears toolkit is currently frozen except for critical vulnerability fixes (it has not been updated almost for the last 1 yr) because they think that HTML 5 is the way to go ahead. Hence, we're looking for a higher abstraction on top of Google Gears engine TODAY, AND which will (in the future) switch the underlying engine to HTML5 if the browser supports HTML5 standards. We'd love to use Dojo but they have discontinued Dojo offline -- we'd prefer something that will be maintained for some time. Which are possible good strategies, JS toolkits/libraries to use for building this webapp ? Pls. advise.
