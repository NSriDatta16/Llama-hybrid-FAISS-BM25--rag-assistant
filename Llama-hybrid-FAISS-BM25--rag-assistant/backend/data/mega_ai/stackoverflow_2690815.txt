@font-face and letter-spacing in webkit

I just discovered that letter-spacing doesn't always work in webkit (and perhaps other browsers?) when embedding fonts. I've tried it on two different fonts and received different results. "League Gothic Regular" will work http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/fonts/7-league-gothic "Quicksand Light" will not http://www.fontsquirrel.com/fonts/Quicksand What's the skinny? Is there a way to force the hand of non-compliant fonts? Quick note: Firefox does seem to apply to both fonts.
