If you want to learn about SSH in depth then may I advise you this book SSH: The Secure Shell The Definitive Guide See here for more info: http://www.snailbook.com/ I've read the book and learned really a lot. It teaches you all about setting up servers, clients, key agents and various (practical) applications.
