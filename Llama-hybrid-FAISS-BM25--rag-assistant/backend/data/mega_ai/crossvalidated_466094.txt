Dimensionality reduction with features in different scales

I want to make dimensionality reduction to data that contains features in different scales (for example height in meters and weight in Kg). Usually I use PCoA with euclidean or bray-curtis distance, but I'm afraid that it will give higher weight to features with higher scale. Any good distance metric to these kind of data? Maybe should I use Z-score for each feature? Or should I do PCA (which is based on correlation and not on distance) or any other algorithm instead? Thanks!
