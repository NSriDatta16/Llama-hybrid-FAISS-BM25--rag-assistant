Causality: Models, Reasoning and Inference, by Judea Pearl: Causal Bayesian Networks and the Truncated Factorization

Background: $\newcommand{\doop}{\operatorname{do}}\newcommand{\op}[1]{\operatorname{#1}}$ Definition 1.2.2 (Markov Compatibility) If a probability function $P$ admits the factorization of $$P(x_1,\dots,x_n)=\prod_i P(x_i|\operatorname{pa}_i)$$ relative to the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) $G,$ we say that $G$ represents $P,$ that $G$ and $P$ are compatible, or that $P$ is Markov relative to $G.$ Here the $\operatorname{pa}_i$ are the parents of $x_i.$ Definition 1.3.1 (Causal Bayesian Network) Let $P(v)$ be a probability distribution on a set $V$ of variables, and let $P(v|\doop(x))$ denote the distribution resulting from the intervention $\doop(X=x)$ that sets a subset $X$ of variables to constants $x.$ Denote by $P_*$ the set of all interventional distributions $P(v|\doop(x)), X\subseteq V,$ including $P(v),$ which represents no intervention (i.e., $X=\varnothing$ ). A DAG $G$ is said to be a causal Bayesian network compatible with $P_*$ if and only if the following three conditions hold for every interventional $P\in P_*:$ $P(v|\doop(x))$ is Markov relative to $G;$ $P(v_i|\doop(x))=1$ for all $V_i\in X$ whenever $v_i$ is consistent with $X=x;$ $P(v_i|\operatorname{pa}_i,\doop(x))=P(v_i|\operatorname{pa}_i)$ for all $V_i\not\in X$ whenever $\operatorname{pa}_i$ is consistent with $X=x,$ i.e., each $P(v_i|\operatorname{pa}_i)$ remains invariant to interventions not involving $V_i.$ Truncated Factorization: $$P(v|\doop(x))=\prod_{i|V_i\not\in X}P(v_i|\operatorname{pa}_i)\qquad\text{for all } v \text{ consistent with }x.$$ Problem Statement: Prove that the three conditions of Definition 1.3.1 (Causal Bayesian Network) are necessary and sufficient for the truncated factorization. My Answer So Far: $(\to)$ Assume the three conditions of Definition 1.3.1 hold. We know by (i) that we can write $$P(v|\doop(x))=\prod_iP(v_i|\op{pa}_i,\doop(x)).$$ Then we factor into two products, depending on where the $v_i$ are: \begin{align*} P(v|\doop(x)) &=\prod_iP(v_i|\op{pa}_i,\doop(x))\\ &=\left[\prod_{i, v_i\in X}P(v_i|\op{pa}_i,\doop(x))\right]\left[\prod_{i, v_i\not\in X}P(v_i|\op{pa}_i,\doop(x))\right]. \end{align*} According to (ii), the first product is $1,$ yielding $$P(v|\doop(x))=\prod_{i, v_i\not\in X}P(v_i|\op{pa}_i,\doop(x)).$$ Finally, we argue that \begin{align*} P(v|\doop(x)) &=\prod_{i, v_i\not\in X}P(v_i|\op{pa}_i,\doop(x))\\ &=\prod_{i, v_i\not\in X}P(v_i|\op{pa}_i) \end{align*} by invoking (iii), since we assumed that $P(v_i|\op{pa}_i)$ are invariant to interventions involving $X.$ Am I correct so far? $(\leftarrow)$ Other than the obvious first step of assuming we can write the truncated factorization, I don't have any ideas on this one. How can I proceed? Would the steps in the $(\to)$ direction all be reversible? Many thanks for your time!
