Not sure what you mean by "organize" and "based on". If you mean produce a list of any capitalized words, each with a list of the lines containing that word (similar to toolic 's solution, you could do this: my %CAPS = (); map { my ($word) = /(\b[A-Z]+\b)/; push( @{ $CAPS{$word} }, $_) } @comments; This will build a mapping of WORDS to things , and the things in this case are going to be lists of lines. And you can refer to these lists as $CAPS{'GOOD'} or $CAPS{'BAD'}, or $CAPS{ whatever }.
