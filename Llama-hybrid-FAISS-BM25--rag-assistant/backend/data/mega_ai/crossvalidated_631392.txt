Another issue you might want to think about is that a team might be good at offence, and poor at defence. The defensive strength of a team can be estimated by the number of goals it concedes, and the offensive strength by the number of goals it scores. There is another complication. A human predictor would be capable of reasoning: Manchester City have scored many goals this season, but so far they have played only weak opponents. Manchester United have scored fewer goals, but they have played strong opponents. I suggest that the quality of each team should be represented by two number, and the number of goals predicted in a match should be estimated as a Poisson distribution of offensive strength divided by defensive strength. Then use a Bayesian software package to find maximum likelihood estimates of strength, given the data.
