What, in my opinion, you need to do is first study difference equations, then basic statistics and after that you can approach the elementary time series models, e.g. ARMA, GARCH and so on. Math and Stats are a prerequisites I am afraid. A good math book for econ students is "Fundamental Methods of Mathematical Economics" by Chiang, Wainright. I am sure there are others but that one I use and know very well. You will get the knowledge you need about difference equations there.
