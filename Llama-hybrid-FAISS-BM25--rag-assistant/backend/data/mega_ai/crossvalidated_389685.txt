Can someone confirm if I am running this generalized linear model in R correctly?

I'm a grad student and stats beginner just trying to make sure I'm using the right model and using it correctly. I'm using R version 3.5.0. My data look like this: Nest_ID Treatment BCI 1 001 NTC 2.18 2 001 NTC 2.54 3 001 NTC 2.23 4 001 NTC 2.33 5 001 NTC 2.37 6 002 NTC 2.10 7 002 NTC 2.61 8 002 NTC 2.51 9 002 NTC 2.18 10 002 NTC 2.40 11 003 A1 2.15 12 003 A1 2.29 13 003 A1 2.45 14 003 A1 1.80 15 003 A1 2.15 77 004 C1 2.31 78 004 C1 2.21 79 004 C1 2.54 80 004 C1 2.29 81 004 C1 2.38 I have multiple BCI data points for each nest and 5 treatment groups. I want to know if there are differences in BCI between the treatment groups, but each BCI corresponds to individuals from the same nest, and each nest received the same treatment. So at first I took the average BCI from each nest to get a single BCI from each nest and ran an ANOVA on it. This seemed to work fine, but a colleague told me I could use glm and it would account for the fact that I have multiple individuals from a nest that received the same treatment. I tried glm in R, and I don't see how it's accounting for the nest being the lowest statistical unit. GLM When I use this formula, my results come back significant when I don't think they should be. They came back not significant when I just took the average BCI from each group. Thanks in advance for any guidance!
