Seems you're using jQuery. Include jquery.cookie.js . You can now set cookies like $.cookie('position_x', 123) and get them like $.cookie('position_x') . The drag-and-drop library should have some callback that is run when you stop dragging. In that callback, save the x and y position away in separate cookies (to keep things simple). When the page loads, check for those cookies and use the values to position the element.
