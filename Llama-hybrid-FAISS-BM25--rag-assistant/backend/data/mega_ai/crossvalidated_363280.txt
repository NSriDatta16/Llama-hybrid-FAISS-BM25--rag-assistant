The initial question is: What is the probability that users will click on this article? The proposed question is: Will this article be clicked on by a user? In the first scenario, your data was about the article. In the second scenario, you could have article- and user-level data. If you have user-level data (e.g., gender, source, location), then I would attempt to develop a user-level model, as you have proposed. Once you have predictions for new articles based on potential users, you could roll up the results to calculate a predicted click-through rate. A logistic regression would be a good first step. Evaluate the model, and if it is good, then use it. If not, investigate other models that are useful when the outcome is rare or infrequent, like models used in spam detection.
