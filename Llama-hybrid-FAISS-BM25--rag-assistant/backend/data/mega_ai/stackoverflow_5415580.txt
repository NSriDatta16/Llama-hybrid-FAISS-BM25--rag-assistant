Optimizing and compressing mysql db with drupal

I have developed a news website in a local language(utf-8) which server average 28k users a day. The site has recently started to show much errors and slow down. I got a call from the host saying that the db is using almost 150GB of space. I believe its way too much for the db and think there something critically wrong however i cannot understand what it could be. The site is in Drupal and the db is Mysql(innoDb). Can any one give directions as to what i should do. UPDATE: Seems like innoDb dump is using the space. What can be done about it? Whats the standard procedure to deal with this issue.
