Using a combination of InnoDB and MyIsam tables

I have 2 tables in which I want more robustness and fortunately don't require frequent rapid fulls of data and examination. All other tables would inevitably be MyISAM. Can I safely use both (I've read a handful of discouragements from this) without fearing bugs or data getting affected by differences between engines?
