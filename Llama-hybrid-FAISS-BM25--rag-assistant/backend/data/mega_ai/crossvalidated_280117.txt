Loss of information using categorical variables

I am new to data science, and I would like to know whether I can use n-1 categorical variables instead of the original n , without risking to lose information. At example: I have three categorical variables A , B , C , and I write C in function of A and B , therefore I have reduced the number of variables from 3 to 2 . Can I apply this reduction without loss the information of the original 3 variables?
