If you have already distributed the set of lipids into significant/non-significant classes, then what you presumably want to do is to compare the number of carbons, the number of double bonds, and the connectivity between the 2 classes. So you're really looking at between-group comparisons rather than regression per se (although between-group comparisons can be structured as regressions). For the number of double bonds, a chi-square or Fisher exact test on the 2 x 3 contingency table (significance class x number of double bonds) would be most direct. You could also do that for the 2 x 7 contingency table of carbon numbers (assuming only even numbers of carbons from 14 to 26 inclusive), although a simple comparison of average lengths might work. For connectivity, it seems that a t -test comparison between the 2 significance classes would do, although you might have to transform the measure of connectivity depending on its distribution among the lipids. This approach, however, has 2 difficulties. For one, it treats all the lipids equally, regardless of their prevalence or biologic significance. Second, it has already made a distinction into "significant" and "insignificant" classes that does not take advantage of the continuous nature of the underlying data on lipid concentrations. You might consider instead developing a true regression model with, say, the concentration difference between the cases and controls as the dependent variable. If baseline concentrations differ among the lipids, you might start with log-transformed concentrations so that differences in the log scale represent case/control ratios in the original concentration scale. Then you could use carbon number, double-bond number, and connectivity as independent variables to relate case/control differences or ratios to these lipid characteristics directly, without having to make prior distinctions between "significant" and "insignificant" classes of lipids. This would also allow you to weight the individual lipids in the regression based on prevalence, etc., if desired.
