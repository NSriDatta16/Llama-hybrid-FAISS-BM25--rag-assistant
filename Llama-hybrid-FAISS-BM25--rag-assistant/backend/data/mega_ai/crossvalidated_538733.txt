I would start out first by plotting the data. From the description, you have crossed random effects for subjects and items (all participants rated all 25 images, and each image was rated by each participant). So random intercepts for subject and items would be appropriate. I believe I want WHR and BMI as fixed effects, but sociosexual orientation as a random effect? I don' know why you thnk that sociosexual orientation should be a random effect, but since its "effect" is part of your research question, this would not make sense. A model such as: rating ~ BMI * WHR * SSO + (1 | item) + (1 | subject) would be a good place to start. I would also avoid categorising your data - using emaciated, underweight, average, overweight and obese for BMI and 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 1.0 for WHR does not make sense - it loses information, reduces statistical power and makes the model harder to interpret. A 3-way interaction, and 2 factors with 5 levels each is going to be somewhat cunbersome. Do you really want to treat someone with BMI 24.99 and one with BMI 25.00 as completely different ? I would retain the vaiables as numeric and centre them before fitting the model
