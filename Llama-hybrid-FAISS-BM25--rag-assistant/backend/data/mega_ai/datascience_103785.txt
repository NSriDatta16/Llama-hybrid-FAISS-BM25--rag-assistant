OK, I am happy with this. I define a "neuron" to be 2/pi arctan(lambda (date-date0)) and have about 99 neurons with steadily increasing date0. If I write any time series as a sum of these neurons then effectively that creates a smooth, piecewise constant approximation to that time series, which is what I'm after. So I add to those neurons an extra "neuron" which is measured temperature data giving me 100 neurons and then a simple L2 optimization to find the best fit of the whole shebang.
