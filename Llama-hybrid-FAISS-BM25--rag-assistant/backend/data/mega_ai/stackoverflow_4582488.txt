building opencv 2.2 under windows

I'm trying to get OpenCV working under windows 7. I am able to generate the visual studio solution file with cMake, but when I build the project in both release and debug mode, I get an error at the very end that says "unable to start program C:\opencv2.2\vs2010\release\all_build" I also don't see cv200d.lib, cvaux200d.lib, etc being generated, so I can't compile any projects using OpenCV. I'd appreciate some help with this, or at least a link to a good tutorial for installing 2.1 or 2.2 under windows. Apparently the process has changed a bit from 2.0 and the willow garage wiki really isn't too helpful here.
