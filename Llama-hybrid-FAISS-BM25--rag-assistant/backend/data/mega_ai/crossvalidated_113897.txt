I'm not an expert. I also don't know if your song variables are measured at the individual or species-level. Assuming the latter (if former, a simple thing would be to average to species and pick up directions from here), I would suggest running a PCA where rows are species and song elements are columns. Then pull out each species' position in however many dimensions you care to use (you'll have as many as you have song elements I think). That matrix would just be rows as species, columns as position along each successive PC axis. Then you can simply run distancesAmong And a Mantel test between these distances and the geographic distances. Make sure the matrices are in the same order, obviously. There are additional distance measures you can use, the default is Euclidean.
