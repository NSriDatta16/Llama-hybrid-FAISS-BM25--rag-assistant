Android multiple screen sizes and density problems

I'm having a real problem with my drawables that I just can't seem to figure out. The problem is this: There are screen sizes at approximately 320x480, 480x800, 480x854 Then there are most commonly densities at 1.0 (160) and 1.5 (240) Now, on a Droid, the screen size is 480x800 and the density is reporting using DisplayMetrics as 1.5 On the G1, it's 320x480 and reporting back at a density of 1.0 BUT tablet devices are reporting back at 480x800 with a density of 1.0 (160) So, I'm going mad because I can put 320x480 images in the drawables-mdpi folder and 480x800 images in the drawables-hdpi folder, but on Tablet computers, no matter what it's not resizing up anything to a full screen. Any help would be greatly appreciated. I just want all of my 320x480 images to scale up regardless of the device.
