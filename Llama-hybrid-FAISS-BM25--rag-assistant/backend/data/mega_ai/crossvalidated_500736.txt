It came to my attention this type of procedure has been described elsewhere. You'll find it under two-step, hierarchical, hypothesis testing. I'll reproduce the method described in Li and Ghosh, 2014 . Given $m$ sets of hypotheses $\left\{H(1),\ldots,H(m)\right\}$ which we want to test simultaneously. In each set, there's a screening hypothesis, denoted by the $H_0(i)$ null-hypothesis. The other hypothesis in the set will only be tested if the first one is rejected $H_0(i)$ . The procedure consists of: Correct for multiple comparisons (Benjamini-Hochberg FDR, in the study) the p-values associated with all screening tests and store the number of rejections $R$ . For each set where a rejection occurred, control for the family-wise error rate at the $R\alpha/m$ level. Authors posit that this simple procedure controls the Overall FDR (OFDR) across sets of hypothesis. However, the procedure requires that individual non-screening hypothesis in each set are independent of all screening hypothesis in other sets.
