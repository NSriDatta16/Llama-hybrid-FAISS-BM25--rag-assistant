This is the kind of problem where it is very helpful to use the concept of the CDF, the cumulative probability distribution function, of random variables, that totally unnecessary concept that professors drag in just to confuse students who are happy to just use pdfs. By definition, the value of the CDF $F_X(\alpha)$ of a random variable $X$ equals the probability that $X$ is no larger than the real number $\alpha$, that is, $$F_X(\alpha) = P\{X \leq \alpha\}, ~-\infty
