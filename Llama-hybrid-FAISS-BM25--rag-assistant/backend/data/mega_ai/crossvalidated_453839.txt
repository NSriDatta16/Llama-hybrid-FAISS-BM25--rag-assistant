How do I intrepret this graph?

Recently as part of my project, I created a CNN for text-classification. I am getting higher test accuracy than training accuracy at a lower number of epochs, but eventually as it reaches the final epoch, training accuracy becomes equal to or slightly greater than test accuracy. Is getting higher initial test accuracy a problem? I am using 4646 data samples for training and 1162 data samples for testing.
