Of course you give context for RMSE. While RMSE does not have quite the same interpretation of mean absolute error (or median absolute error), if about half of your errors are within $3$ of gigantic values, that sounds pretty good for values around \$30,000. In other words, you are within about three bucks of the price of a car. There is no rule about RMSE > 1 being bad. If you scale the $y$ to have a variance of $1$ , then such a rule is more reasonable, but even then, it is hard to make an absolute measure of performance with qualitative descriptions like “good” and “bad” that apply in any circumstance without consideration of the context.
