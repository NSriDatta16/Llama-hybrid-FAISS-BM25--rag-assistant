Is there any existed open source project for messaging infrastructure?

I want to know if there is any open source projects for messaging infrastructure. It will cover most functionalities listed in "Enterprise Integration Patterns". I know there are some open source ESB products which are following this book. But it seems they are too heavy. I only want an elegant messaging infrastructure.
