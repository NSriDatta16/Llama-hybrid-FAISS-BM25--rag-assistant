logistic regression ; covariates effect on each other predicting the outcome

I have a logistic regression model, where my outcome variable is a disease with yes and no outcome. We know that age is highly correlated with this disease. I have the data for a protein of interest and want to see whether this protein P has a relation with the disease. When I use protein alone as a predictor in the logistic model (in R), I get a significant p value for it. But when I add age in the model, my protein does not remain significant. I also looked at the correlation of my protein with age, and that is not correlated (0.08 correlation coefficient). So is it safe to omit age from the regression model? DISEASE ~ PROTEIN # significant ( p value : 0.00003) DISEASE ~ PROTEIN + AGE # Age is significant but protein no longer is (p value = 0.2)
