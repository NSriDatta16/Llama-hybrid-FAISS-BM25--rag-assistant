Computing average of data in multiple (different) columns in SPSS

I have a SPSS data file, which i am trying to reduce. However the data which belongs together is spread within multiple columns. I.e. I have one row per subject, but each subject has done multiple different conditions as well as procedures. The conditions are in columns condition_1 , condition_2 etc. The procedures are in rows procedure_1 , procedure_2 etc. The values (reaction times) are in columns reaction_time_1 , reaction_time_2 . Now I want to compute the average of all reactions times for each person where the condition and procedure is the same. So if condition_x is the same as condition_y and procedure_x is the same as procedure_y I want to get the average over all of those items reaction_time_x and reaction_time_y . How can I do this with SPSS? I easily know how to compute averages in general, but in this case I have to select only a subset of the rows based on the conditions, and I do not know how to do this.
