Robust Hausman vs Mundlak test to choose between FE and RE model?

What is the difference between robust Hausman test and Mundlak test? Wooldridge "Econometric Analysis of Cross Section and Panel Data" (Second edition page 870) mentions robust Hausman test is obtained by adding group averages to RE estimation and testing for joint significance. Isn't Mundlak test also the same see statapost ie; RE estimation with panel level means and covariates, and a similar joint hypothesis on the regression coefficient for panel level means. Also, does xtoverid module in stata software follow the same methdology?
