You would run out of storage before you run out of BIGINT primary key sequence. Unsigned BIGINT can represent a range of 0 to 18,446,744,073,709,551,615. Even if you had a table with a single column that held the primary key of BIGINT type (8 bytes), you would consume (18,446,744,073,709,551,615×8)÷1,024^4 = 134,217,728 terabytes of storage. Also maximum size of tables in MySQL is 256 terabytes for MyISAM and 64 terabytes for InnoDB, so really you're limited to 256×1,024^4÷8 = 35 trillion rows. Oracle supports NUMBER(38) (takes 20 bytes) as largest possible PK, 0 to 1e38. However having a 20 byte primary key is useless because maximum table size in Oracle is 4*32 = 128 terabytes (at 32K block size).
