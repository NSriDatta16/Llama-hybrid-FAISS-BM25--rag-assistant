Modify web.config of web application for connection string, safecontrol entry of AJAX Extension, enablesessionstate set to true of pages, add AJAX Extension tag entry, and uncomment the following line: Use class SPWebConfigModification to add entries in web.config ( examples on adding ajax entries in web.config with code ). Create a UserControls folder in web application root and copy all User Controls there. As SmartPart will (can only, I assume) locate User Controls If i`m correct, you can just create folder with name "80" (just like folder "12") and within predefined folders, deploy your own. From WSPBuilder documentation : The 80 folder represents the WebApplication folder and contains following subfolders 80\bin, 80\wpcatalog, 80\resources. The 80\bin contains the dll's. If you have some webpart definitions (webpart, dwp) files, they goes into the wpcatalog folder. Any file can be added to the resource folder. So maybe it would be a good idea to drop them inside resources folder?
