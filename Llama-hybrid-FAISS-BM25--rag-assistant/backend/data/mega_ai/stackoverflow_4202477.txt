The trend these days in working with very large volume data is to break the data up into smaller data bricks of say 64x64x64. If you want to do volume rendering with lighting, then you should have a 1 voxel overlap between neighboring bricks so that individual bricks can be rendered without needing neighboring bricks. If you want to do more complex image processing with the bricks, then you can increase the overlap (at the expense of storage). The advantage of this approach is that you only need to load the bricks that are necessary into memory. The rendering/processing time for a brick-based volume is not significantly slower than a non-bricked base volume. For a more involved discussion of this from the volume rendering side, check out papers on the Octreemizer. Here is a link to one on citeseer .
