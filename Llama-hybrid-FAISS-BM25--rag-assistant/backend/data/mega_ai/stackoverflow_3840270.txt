Fastest way to interface between live (unsaved) Excel data and C# objects

I want to know what the fastest way is of reading and writing data to and from an open Excel workbook to c# objects. The background is that I want to develop a c# application that is used from Excel and uses data held in excel. The business logic will reside in the c# application but the data will reside in an Excel workbook. The user will be using Excel and will click a button (or do something similar) on the excel workbook to initiate the c# application. The c# application will then read data off the excel workbook, process the data, and then write data back to the excel workbook. There may be numerous blocks of data that are required to be read off and written back to the excel workbook but they will normally be of a relatively small size, say 10 rows and 20 columns. Occasionally a large list of data may need to be processed, of the order of 50,000 rows and 40 columns. I know that this is relatively easy to do say using VSTO but I want to know what the fastest (but still robust and elegant) solution is and get an idea of the speed. I don't mind if the solution recommends using third party products or uses C++. The obvious solution is using VSTO or interop but I don't know what the performance is like versus VBA which I'm currently using to read in the data, or if there are any other solutions. This was posted on experts exchange saying that VSTO was dramatically slower than VBA but that was a couple of years ago and I don't know if the performance has improved. http://www.experts-exchange.com/Microsoft/Development/VSTO/Q_23635459.html Thanks.
