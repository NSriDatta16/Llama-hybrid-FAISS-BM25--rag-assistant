Regular Expression for Parsing Hashtags in Java

Here is the Twitter message I am trying to parse (as you can see, some of these are not tags, just part of URLs): #anothertag Arrogance and bad PR http://www.adobe.com/index.html#anchor1. John Nack on &#Adobe: Information about Photoshop&#169; CS3 on Snow Leopard #fail #design This regular expression is what I have so far, but it still picks up some the url tags: [##]+([A-Za-z0-9-_]+)
