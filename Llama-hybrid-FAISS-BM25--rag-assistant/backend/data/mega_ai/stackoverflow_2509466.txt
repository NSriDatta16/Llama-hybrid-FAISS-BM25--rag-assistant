Another point: You should organize your code, i. e. break it up in smaller modules and categorize it, because at some point in time you will end up writing a second and third function for the same thing, simply for the reason that you wont find that function that you knew it was there, but you don't remember it's name. I've got a (rather large) project with such a module and there is programming logic for which there are up to 5-6 implementations (for the same thing).
