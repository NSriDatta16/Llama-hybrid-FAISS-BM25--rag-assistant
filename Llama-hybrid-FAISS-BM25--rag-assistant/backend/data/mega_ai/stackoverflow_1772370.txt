Making ListViewItems that know how to build themselves is a good idea. If you extend that idea a little, you make the columns know how to build each subitem, which also allows them to be able to automatically sort the ListView, support grouping and copy/drag and drop rows. This is just a few of the things that ObjectListView does for you. ObjectListView is an open source wrapper around a .NET WinForms ListView control that makes the ListView much easier to use -- as well as adding some very nice new features and getting around some annoying bugs/limitations. If you did like @Rex's idea of using a BindingSource , the ObjectListView project also provides a data-aware DataListView which is data bindable.
