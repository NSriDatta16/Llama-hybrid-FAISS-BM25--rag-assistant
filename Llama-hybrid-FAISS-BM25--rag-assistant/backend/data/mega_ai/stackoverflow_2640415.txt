Excel support opening an HTML file containing a table as a spreadsheet (even with CSS formatting). You basically have to serve that HTML content from a django view, with the content-type application/ms-excel as Roberto said. Or if you feel adventurous, you could use something like Downloadify to prepare the file to be downloaded on the client side.
