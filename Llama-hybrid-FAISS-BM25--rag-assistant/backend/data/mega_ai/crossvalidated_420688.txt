How to model the Hazard Rate?

I'm interested in modeling the Hazard Rate $\lambda$ from a Survival dataset so I can calculate the Cumulative Distribution $F(t)=1-e^{-\lambda t}$ but I'm not sure how to go about computing $\lambda$ I know that in the continuous case the Hazard Rate is defined as $$\lim_{\Delta t \to 0} \frac{P[t t]}{\Delta t}$$ But I'm not sure how to implement this practically. I've seen so many suggestions online from Cox PH to B-Splines and Bayesian methods but without much elaboration and which only got me even more lost. Hope someone can clarify this for me. Thanks. EDIT: Here's a sample of the data: survdata It contains 50 observations with 4 attributes. First one is status of Checking Account that goes from 1 to 4 indicating different intervals of deposit amounts, second is the number of days Survived by that individual before default, third is the amount of credit given to the firm, and fourth is the status of default with 1 indicating a default event for that individual and 0 means no default.
