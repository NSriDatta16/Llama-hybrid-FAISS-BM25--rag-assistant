We have emails sent to us for Merge Replication failures. I have not used Transactional Replication but I imagine you can set up similar alerts. The easiest way is to set it up through Replication Monitor. Go to Replication Monitor and select a particular publication. Then select the Warnings and Agents tab and then configure the particular alert you want to use. In our case it is Replication: Agent Failure. For this alert, we have the Response set up to Execute a Job that sends an email. The job can also do some work to include details of what failed, etc. This works well enough for alerting us to the problem so that we can fix it right away.
