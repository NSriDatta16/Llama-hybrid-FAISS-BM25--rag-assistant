With a discriminative approach $f(x) = a'x+b$ your data should be linear separable. If they are not, you can make nonlinear mapping $\phi$ to transform input data and make them linear separable. In such case you will use $f(x) = a'\phi(x)+b$. In case that you have $x_i = x_j$ but $y_i \neq y_j$, your data is not linear separable, and you cannot define any mapping $\phi$ which will transform it to linear separable. So, in theory you should not use linear classifier $f$. However, many discriminative classifiers can be used with such data (like soft-margin SVM) as they not require that all data must be correctly classified during the training process.
