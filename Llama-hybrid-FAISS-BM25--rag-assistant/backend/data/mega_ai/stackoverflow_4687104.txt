The keywords meta tag is not important. Search engines don't pay any attention to it anymore. I wouldn't waste my time worrying about. Here's a quote from SEOmoz's Beginner Guide to SEO (http://guides.seomoz.org/chapter-4-basics-of-search-engine-friendly-design-and-development): "The meta keywords tag had value at one time, but is no longer valuable or important to search engine optimization." Instead, I would worry about making sure the content on your site is well-written, relevant to your topic, and keyword-focused (but not keyword-crammed...sound natural). Make sure your title tags are appropriate to what's on each page. That will get you farther than meta keywords. Additionally, it takes time for search engines to index changes. Be patient on any changes you make to your site.
