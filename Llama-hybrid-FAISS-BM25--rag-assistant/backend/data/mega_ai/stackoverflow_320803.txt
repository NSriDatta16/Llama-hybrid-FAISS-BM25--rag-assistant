Is SQLite suitable for use in a production website?

I'm rewriting a PHP+MySQL site that averages 40-50 hits a day using Django. Is SQLite a suitable database to use here? Are there any advantages/disadvantages between them? I'm just using the db to store a blog and the users who can edit it. I am using fulltext search for the blog search, but no complex joins anywhere.
