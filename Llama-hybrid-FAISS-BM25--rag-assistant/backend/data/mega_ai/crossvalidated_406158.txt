Based on the analysis you did, the claim is indeed about individual behavior. In your example, you are interested in the probability of being in B1 vs. B2 for an individual in A1. For that individual, their outcome of B1 or B2 is governed by a parameter that applies to them (it may apply to others as well, but the focus here is on the individual). You are interested in estimating this parameter. Again, you want to make a claim that says for an individual in A1, they are more likely to be in B1 than had they been in A2. It happens to be that the best way to estimate this parameter is to assume all units in your sample are independent and identically distributed and then estimate the parameter in the sample. It's true your sample estimate is based on aggregating your sample, but the interpretation of the estimated parameter (given the assumptions are correct) refers to each individual. I'm not sure how deep into your statistics education you are, but a conceptual shift that really solidified this concept for me is the distinction between sampling an individual from a population and sampling a score for an individual from the distribution that governs that individual's possible scores. That is, I personally have a probability distribution that governs my values on some variables, and each observation is a draw from this distribution. Note I don't need to make a statement about what group I'm in or what population I'm a part of to make this claim. It is this latter focus on the individual's probability distribution that makes it clear our inferences (in some cases) are about the data-generating model for an individual's score rather than an aggregate statement about some broader population distribution comprised of many individuals. That said, there are many instances in which patterns in groups are distinct from patterns that occur at the individual level; Simpson's paradox and the ecological fallacy are perfect examples of this. For example, larger animals tend to have longer lifespans on average, but within a species, larger animals have shorter lifespans (i.e., because of heart problems, etc.). The explanation for this apparent paradox is that species that are larger on average tend to live longer on average, but within each species, smaller members of the species live longer. In this sense, an aggregate finding about a population does not apply to the individuals because of group-level confounding (i.e., average size of a species causes both individual sizes and variation in lifespan). While it's true that larger animals do indeed live longer, this is a marginal claim rather than conditional claim, when a statement that more accurately depicts the relationship within individuals is a conditional claim. In your example, it may be that marginally being in A1 is associated with being in B1, but if you were to perform a conditional analysis, you might find that being in A1 is negatively associated with being in B1 within levels of some other variable C. For example, maybe older people are both more likely to be in A1 and B1, but among people of the same age, there is no association between A and B.
