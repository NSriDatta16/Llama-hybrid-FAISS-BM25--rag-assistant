The documentation . Sad to say, but I have come to the conclusion that the most hidden feature that developers are unaware of is the documentation on MSDN. Take for instance a Transact-SQL verb like RESTORE. The BOL will cover not only the syntax and arguments of RESTORE. But this is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to documentation. The BOL covers: the in depth fundamentals of recovery: Understanding How Restore and Recovery of Backups Work in SQL Server . end-to-end scenarios on how to deploy a recovery strategy: Implementing Restore Scenarios for SQL Server Databases . the issues around system databases: Considerations for Backing Up and Restoring System Databases . optimizing the recovery procedures: Optimizing Backup and Restore Performance in SQL Server . understanding how to to a restore. Backing Up and Restoring How-to Topics (Transact-SQL) . more corner cases and uncommon scenarios, there are examples like Example: Piecemeal Restore of Only Some Filegroups (Full Recovery Model) . The list goes on and on, and this is just one single topic (backup and restore). Every feature of SQL Server gets similar coverage. Reckon not everything will get the detail backup and recovery gets, but everything is documented and there are How To topics for every feature. The amount of information available is just ludicrous. Yet the documentation is one of the most underused resources, hence my vote for it being a hidden feature.
