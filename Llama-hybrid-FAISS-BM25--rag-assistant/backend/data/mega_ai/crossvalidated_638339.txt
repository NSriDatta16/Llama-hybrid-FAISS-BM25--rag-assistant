Is it advised to do treatment-covariate interactions to estimate the average treatment effect when using exact matching?

I am using method = “exact” from the MatchIt package. In the vignette of MatchIt , it is advised to run treatment-covariate interactions to account for treatment heterogeneity across covariates. I have two questions in this regard: I assume this is also advised for exact matching and not only when balance is not perfectly achieved? In my case, I use matching in the context of making immigrants coming from two country groups more comparable to each other using cross-national and cross-sectional data. To ensure that control units are interviewed in the same host country and time as treatment units, I match, besides a couple of covariates, also on host country and year. When using treatment-covariate interactions to account for effect heterogeneity, should these interactions exclude the country and time given that they are technically not pre-treatment, which would be in this case anything pre-migration? library(MatchIt) matobj_list
