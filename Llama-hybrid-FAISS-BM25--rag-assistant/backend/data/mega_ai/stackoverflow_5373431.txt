Removing certain characters from a string

I am thinking about using String.replaceAll() to remove certain characters in my string. It is unclear which characters are going to be removed (i.e. which characters I want to remove), but I would assume that any character is valid (like [a-zA-Z] and things like $%! , etc). I came across http://www.java-tips.org/java-se-tips/java.lang/strip-certain-characters-from-a-string.html but surely there is a better way than iterating over each character... Any thoughts on this? Thanks EXAMPLE: Just to clarify, I will have strings of varying lengths. I want to strip characters from it, the exact ones to be determined at runtime, and return the resulting string. Taking the paragraph above and allowing me to strip out the " ,. ", I would return the string: Just to clarify I will have strings of varying lengths I want to strip characters from it the exact ones to be determined at runtime and return the resulting string As an aside, I know that replaceAll() uses regular expressions, so if I wanted to strip out the characters "$,.", I would need to escape them too, right?
