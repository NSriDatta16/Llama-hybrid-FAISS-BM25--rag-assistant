Can I fit a bell curve to binomial data points?

I performed an experiment where participants jumped over a hurdle. Lift off distances and collisions/successes for two cohorts were recorded. I was doing logistic regressions ( success ~ lift_off_distance ), when I noticed that success rates decreased closer to the hurdle: (dramatic reenactment, original datapoints are 0 (collision) or 1 (success), a histogram with binned success rates would look like the drawing above) A logistic regression would predict a 100% success rate even for liftoff points behind the hurdle which is clearly wrong. Alternatively I have now used a (not normalized) standard distribution fitted to the 0/1 datapoints, with the idea that this gives me the "most successful" position as the mean and variability as the variance of the distribution. This of course is a non-linear regression, fitted with least squares. TL;DR and to make this a question: Can I use a normal distribution instead of the logistic one as my data looks more like a bell curve? Bonus: I probably have not invented this, how is this called? Just plain non-linear regression?
