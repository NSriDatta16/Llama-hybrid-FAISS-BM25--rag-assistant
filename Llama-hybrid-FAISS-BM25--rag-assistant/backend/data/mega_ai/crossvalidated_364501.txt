Accuracy is for the whole model and your formula is correct. Precision for one class 'A' is TP_A / (TP_A + FP_A) as in the mentioned article. Now you can calculate average precision of a model. There are a few ways of averaging (micro, macro, weighted), well explained here : 'weighted': Calculate metrics for each label, and find their average, weighted by support (the number of true instances for each label). This alters ‘macro’ to account for label imbalance; (...)
