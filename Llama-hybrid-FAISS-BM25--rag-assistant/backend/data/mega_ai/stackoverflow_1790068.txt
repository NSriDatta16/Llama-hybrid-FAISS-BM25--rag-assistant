Why don't people just stop developing sites to cater to IE6?

I don't understand why developers continue to program things to accommodate IE6. People should update the browser they use, right? I've already seen many firms completely stop developing for IE6, with a big article on their front page stating their update recommendations. What are your reasons to continue developing for this buggy old dinosaur? If you say you must for your work, state why your organization continues to develop for IE6. Of course, a community wiki, just because I'd like to see some reasons (if any).
