Can all neural network layers be used as either a supervised or an unsupervised model?

I am trying to understand neural networks and by reading different articles I always find conflicting information. I wanted to understand which neural networks can be used as supervised/unsupervised. One of the many articles I have read is this one and an answer is the following: "CNN is not supervised or unsupervised, itâ€™s just a neural network that, for example, can extract features from images by dividing it, pooling and stacking small areas of the image. If you want to classify images you need to add dense (or fully connected) layers and for classification, the training is supervised. But, if you want to cluster images based on similarities of a group of images, you will extract the features use the CNN and then use an unsupervised method like k-means." Following this logic, can all neural network layers be used as either a supervised or an unsupervised model?
