Switch between OpenGL ES View and UIKit View controllers

this is my question. I'm developing a game on iPhone with OpenGL ES. I began my development using the Xcode template OpenGL ES Application, with one EAGLView, etc. My menu view and game view use the same OGL view but now I want to add score ranking so I need a keyboard and a text field to write name, and some labels or a table view to show ranking. UPDATE : well, I think that the best solution is to have my current glView with another UIKit View where I will put the score ranking and do the switching. I have the Apress book Beginning iPhone Development and I follow the chapter about multiple views. I take the point of switching between two UIViewController but when I'm going to make changes in my game... glView is not a UIViewController, it's a UIView, so I'm lost. Can anyone help me with this? :-( Thank you very much.
