I'm interpreting the OnLogin function as starting an operation that will invoke the callback exactly once upon completion. In this case, the code is actually quite normal. This is not uncommon when writing a program asynchronously. Considering that the alternative is keeping a "state" with a (small) state machine in the callback function, I think different callbacks is actually the more elegant solution. It handles the asynchronous "state" implicitly instead of explicitly.
