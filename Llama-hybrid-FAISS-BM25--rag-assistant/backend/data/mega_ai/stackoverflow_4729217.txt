Easiest way is to create a semi-transparent PNG and just use that as your background image for the div. If you're using Photoshop (or similar tools) just create a 10px by 10px image that is all white -- then drag the opacity slider down to 50%. Save it as a PNG and you should be rockin'! Using RGBA is also a possibility, but you're not just losing IE6 then -- there are still quite a few people using browsers that don't support the alpha scheme.
