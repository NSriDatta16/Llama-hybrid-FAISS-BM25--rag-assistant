I can provide a partial answer to this. I hope to get up and running better with ClojureBox myself. I am familiar with emacs in general but not emacs with SLIME which is what ClojureBox provides. If you aren't comfortable with emacs itself I would suggest working with its own tutorial first to get the hang of it. How do I create a new clojure file in emacs? Use standard emacs file creation "C-x C-f" to open a new file. Chose a file name with the extension ".clj" and it will beauto-detected as a clojure file. Load an existing clojure file so the forms (values, functions) are available to the REPL? Use the load-file command (C-c C-l), note that you will have to have saved the file first (C-x C-s). It will now be available to the REPL. Alternatively to just try out a block of code, highlight the region containing it and use (C-c C-r) to eval-region with SLIME (which is running your clojure REPL). Does Programming Clojure http: //pragprog.com/titles/shcloj/programming-clojure answer these questions? Not that I am aware of. It doesn't really deal with development environments. For help using the book code with ClojureBox see this thread - http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/b52ca7becceca16a Also try the Clojure google group in general.
