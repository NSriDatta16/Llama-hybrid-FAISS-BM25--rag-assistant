Are there any algorithms that learn to learn a function mapping?

Typical algorithms involve learning and applying a single mapping e.g. $ f: X \mapsto Y$ Are there any algorithms that learn multiple mappings given an extra variable e.g. $ f(Z): X \mapsto Y$ (This feels like an abuse of notation.). Here we learn a mapping, given $Z$, that is then applied to $X$ to produce $Y$ One solution (although intractable) would be to train an algorithm (e.g. a neural network) whose output is then used as the weights of a second network. Any suggestions would be much appreciated and feel free to ask for more details. Thanks.
