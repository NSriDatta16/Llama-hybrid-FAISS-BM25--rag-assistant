Feature importance decision algorithms

I have a dataset with 100+ feature columns. My client asked me to choose "the top 10 most important features" from the 100+. From this post , I learnt that Random Forest can help me ranking the importance of features. My Question is, is there any other algorithms can do this job? (also if someone can direct me to some tensorflow examples on this.) P.S. To explain, the dataset is about eCommerce, with 100+ features and one column depicting "how much the user spent on the website". By "important features", I mean the features that can best predict the user-spent column.
