Can you simultaneously fit logistic and ordinal logistic regression models?

I have some response data that has the 5 following categories: strongly agree somewhat agree somewhat disagree strongly disagree don't know I want a two component model that uses a logistic regression for the probability of a "don't know" response, and a separate ordinal model for the ordered categories conditional on response in one of those categories. My question: is it possible to construct a likelihood function to fit the two components simultaneously , and if so, how would you do that?
