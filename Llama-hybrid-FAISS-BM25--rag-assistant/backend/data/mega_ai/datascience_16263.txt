David, you can use mean average precision ('map') or even better logloss ('logloss'). Yes, for unbalanced data precision and recall are very important. I would suggest individually examining these metrics after optimizing with whatever eval_metric you choose.Additionally, there is a parameter called scale_pos_weight, which will help tell the model the distribution of you data. I have found this to greatly improve the performance of "rare event" cases. The following markdown doc has a list of all the parameters and their options. https://github.com/dmlc/xgboost/blob/master/doc/parameter.md
