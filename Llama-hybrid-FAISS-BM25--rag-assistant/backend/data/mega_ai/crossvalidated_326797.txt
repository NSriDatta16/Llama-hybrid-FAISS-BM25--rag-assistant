EXP4 algorithm for contextual bandits: where do experts come from?

I am working on an implementation of the EXP4 algorithm in the context of a pricing decision (e.g. given a context, the user should be given a price from a few pre-determined options). The EXP4 uses "experts" as a mean to handle various aspects of the context. however, all the papers I've read where silent about where do these experts come from? how one decide how many experts are needed? how one trains these experts? are these experts get updated over time as a result of decisions and reward or only the MAB who evaluate and average across all these experts? I'd appreciate any reference with either an example or a more detailed discussion on "where do expert come from" in the context of contextual bandits. Thanks.
