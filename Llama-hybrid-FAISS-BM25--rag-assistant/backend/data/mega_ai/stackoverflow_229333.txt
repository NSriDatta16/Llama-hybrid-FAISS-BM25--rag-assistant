GWT Unit Testing TDD and Tooling

I m just starting using gwt and so far so good, however after reading some sample code I wonder is it necesary to have a high level of test coverage? (I can see that most code is declarative and then add some attributes I can see the sense in checking so me particular attributes are there but not all) Also i would be interested to know anything about what are the gotchas in TDDing with GWT I m using eclipse so also if you are really happy with some particualrs add ins for GWT I would be happy to hear about that Thanks for the input edit: maybe I m asking a very wide question, but even little pieces of information will help I come from having nvelocity views with jquery/extJs/prototype/scriptaculous and this is a bit different
