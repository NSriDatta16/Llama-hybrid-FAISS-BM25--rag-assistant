This largely overlaps with what @propofol has said. LAERD statistics has a tutorial on reporting Friedman's test that emphasises reporting the median and interquartile range. If your data contains many tied ranks , then an interpolated median is typically more sensitive than a standard median. See this discussion , and the interp.median function in R . Example reports You might get additional inspiration by doing a search on Google Scholar specifically for "Friedman's test" . However, I admit that when I had a quick look a fair few studies were not implementing best practice in reporting. One interesting example is Blana et al (2006, PDF HERE) . They graphically represented the change using box plots for each time point (i.e., showing median, interquartile range, outliers, and so forth). I think this is a good option.
