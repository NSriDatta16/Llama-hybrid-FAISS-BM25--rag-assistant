Using a Z-score suggests that you know the standard deviation of the population in question. Thus, if your question is whether a given worker is above the workers currently employed by you, then yes, it is appropriate. If, however, you are interested in the population of all possible workers, of which the current workers in your study are only a sample, then Z is not appropriate. In this case you would want to use the t-statisitic. and 3. It seems that both of these concerns could be handled by computing weighted averages. By this I mean use all of the scores but weight them by the number of observations for each employee. What you should consider significant is highly idiosyncratic to a given situation. How will this information be used? What are the consequences of a Type I (false positive) or Type II (false negative) error? In basic behavioural research .05 is considered reasonable to accept for the possibility of a false positive (this is known as the alpha level). In certain medical research much lower alpha values are justifiably demanded. Once you've decided what is appropriate, you can find critical values in a table easily enough ( e.g. ) or get them from most statistical software like R very easily.
