Choosing Location Based Control Group

I have a dataset that tracks activities at particular locations. The dataset is essentially, timestamp, latitude and longitude, indicating an activity at that lat-long and that time. I plan on collapsing this data down to daily data, a treatment location, a control location and dropping the remaining data. My question is in determining the control group for my analysis. I have a situation where I want to test the impact of a policy that is location specific. The policy encourages activity in a particular location. Assume for now that this location is well defined as 10 meters around a particular lat-long. Call this area A. Assume that all activities outside A are unaffected by the policy affecting area A and that the policy affects some of the activity within A. I then want to choose a location (geofence, area, etc; however you want to think of it) that will act as my control group. How, then, can I choose an appropriate control group area B? I plan on using some panel data techniques to analyze the impact. My initial thought is to do some optimization procedure that will attempt to choose the area beyond A such that the means and variances of the daily activities in the two locations are as close as possible. I don't have any real statistical reasoning behind this other than that it intuitively makes sense. Additionally, I am open to any statistical procedures that will allow me to infer the impact of the policy. If I am unclear in any way, please let me know and I can clarify myself.
