Is it possible for computers to tell how many people are speaking in a audio recording

Suppose I had a audio recording of 15 students saying "Here" all at the same. Can I tell how many students were speaking and who they were using machine learning? I want to create a school attendance application that the students can all scream "Here" when the teacher asks them and it would mark everyone in class absent or present based of what the model pridicted from hearing the students scream "Here".
