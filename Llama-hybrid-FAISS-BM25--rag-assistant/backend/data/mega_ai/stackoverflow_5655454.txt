Android Arrays contents are getting changed for no reason

I am trying to create an ExpandableListView inside my activity that shows shows types of wines on the top level, and individual bottles of wine on the second level. I am reading all of my data from a CSV file that I have created and filled with 8 specific bottles of wine which are all under one category for now. I am having a problem though, I am reading my data from the csv file into an Array and I can report it out to the log as I read it in and it shows correctly. But once I go to try to put it into my adapter and then into the listview the array is filled with 8 identical Wine objects which are whatever the last one in my file is. Here is the code I am using to read the file and create an Array of Wine objects. Edit: I changed my code to check my array write after the while loop finishes filling it and I am getting the same result. This is the newer version of the code. handler = new Handler() { @Override public void handleMessage(Message msg) { Log.i(myTag, "Notify Change"); //By the time I get to here every object in the array is identical for(int i = 0; i And here is the log output that running this creates: 04-13 15:45:09.390: INFO/One2OneWineMenu(6472): 0 Wine [name=Acre, place=Central Coast, description=Seductive apple pie crust and lemon blossom aromas introduce crisp juicy flavors enriched by a creaminess resulting from surlie barrel aging, year=2008, priceBottle=25, priceGlass=7] 04-13 15:45:09.390: INFO/One2OneWineMenu(6472): 1 Wine [name=Silver Palm, place=North Coast, description=Fermented in stainless steel* this wine's delicate fruit characteristics were preserved without any overbearing flavors that an oak barrel might impart, year=2009, priceBottle=30, priceGlass=10] 04-13 15:45:09.390: INFO/One2OneWineMenu(6472): 2 Wine [name=Franciscan, place=Napa Valley, description=Ripe* generous aromas of apple* pear* and honey with toasty oak.

I am stumped, I have never seen the contents of an Array just change for no apparent reason like this. Perhaps I am overlooking something relatively simple, does anyone have any idea what might be going on here?
