You are committing some classic mistakes that people make when first entering the world of data science. Your question should not be, "What model do I use?". The question should be, " What can I learn from my data? " First mistake you're making is jumping straight to modeling - never do that. You need to go through a period of exploratory data analytics (EDA) to help you understand your data. The whole point of an EDA phase is to enable you to ask smarter questions of your project and when you come up with those questions, you will be in a much better position to determine what models you will need. Also, keep in mind that EDA can also serve to answer analytical questions. In your example, your question of spend by card type can probably be answered during a thorough EDA phase. Second mistake you're making is thinking about the type of models you need without thinking about the questions you want to answer. What's the business case you're trying to solve? What's your hypothesis? What data will you have available when you will run predictions in the future? Do you have a supervised on unsupervised problem on your hands? Etc, etc, etc. These are all things that you need to have some answers to before you can even think about the models that will be used. Don't forget, this is data science . You need to approach your problems in a methodical, scientific manner in order to truly achieve the results that you seek.
