How can I catch mouse drag events in a Dashcode widget?

I have an OSX widget written using Dashcode. Currently any mouse drag event causes the entire widget to move on the desktop. I wish to be able to click and drag within a canvas on that widget, but I don't seem to be able to prevent the OSX dashboard from moving the entire widget instead. I'm already capturing mouse movements quite happily, but the click/drag combo is defeating me.
