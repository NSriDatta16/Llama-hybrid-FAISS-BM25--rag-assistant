The wikipedia page: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orthogonal_matrix has some more information on orthogonal matrices and the meaning of the determinant. It says for example that orthogonal matrices will have determinant -1 or +1 and that a +1 determinant implies that the matrix acts as a rotation. Meanwhile, with either determinant included the orthogonal matrix may represent a "rotation, reflection or rotoreflection". Others have noted however that for every solution to the PCA problem (which will have det -1 or 1) there is a simple sign flipping way to find a solution with the det of the opposite sign. The implication is that whatever the solution is in the less constrained problem it must have an equivalent in the constrained one, so perhaps it is the case that the constrained problem usefully reduces the solution space whilst keeping it optimal.
