Poisson likelihood for count data - comparing (scaled) model and observations

I have two 2D histograms - one has observed counts and the other has predicted counts from a model. I am comparing both of them using a Poisson likelihood while varying the parameters of the model. What is important to me is the shape of the 2D distributions and not that the total counts of the model Nmod be equal to the total counts of the observations Nobs. My question is how should I scale the model to handle this correctly? Can I just normalise my model by dividing all counts in the model 2D histogram by Nmod and then multiplying by Nobs? EDIT: I am using MCMC to find the optimum parameters for my model, so trying to find the maximum likelihood. The data are the equivalent of a monochromatic image, where a 2D histogram has an integer representing the counts in each pixel. Using a simulation, with a handful of variable parameters, I am able to produce a modelled image. The pixels in the model image contain non-integer values. As I said above it is the details in the image and not the brightness that I am interested in. EDIT2: I build the histogram out of observed data. Imagine data consisting of x,y coordinates and I build a 2d histogram with a binning in x and y that I have chosen.
