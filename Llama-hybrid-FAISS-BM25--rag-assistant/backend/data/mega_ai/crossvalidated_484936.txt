Oh, and one last thing If so, what is the necessity to do linear regression? Why we can't just work with the conditional expectation function instead of linear regression since is the conditional expectation function what we are trying to approxitamate to? Here are three (good) reasons why linear regression is widely used to approximate the CEF. Suppose $X$ has ten variables, and suppose we actually knew the true CEF, $E[Y|X=x]=f(x)$ . How can we grasp the implications of this function? That's really hard in general. If the function were linear and additive in those 10 variables we will find this much easier. So we might want to summarise the function with its best linear and additive approximation for interpretation purposes even if we knew its true shape. Interpretation is really important in many applications because at least part of the credibility of an analysis rests on whether the modelled relationship is consistent with domain knowledge, in addition to statistical measures. So you need to understand the modelled relationship, and also have an idea what features in the data drive it. Incidentally, linear regression is a good basis from which to model departures from additivity and linearity: Interactions relax the former, variable transformations the latter. The modeller can easily incorporate these into the analysis. And more systematic approaches (eg regression splines) exist too. We never know the true CEF in empirical work. We have to estimate it from data. We know from the theory of non-parametric regression that it takes an extraordinary amount of data to estimate such a function with any precision - if we really do not put any restrictions on it. An intuitive way of seeing this is to suppose you have 10 binary variables. Suppose you need about 50 data points for a particular value of $x$ (10 dimensional) to get a reasonable estimate of the average value of $y$ . There are 1024 unique values of $x$ for which you need those 50 data points if you want to estimate the CEF at that level of precision for all values of $x$ Estimating a linear regression with OLS is computationally faster and more robust compared to just about any alternative. When you estimate a more complex model you often need to spend much more time on fitting it and on checking how numerically stable and robust the result is.
