The purpose of the question is unclear, as well as the background of the OP in terms of exposure to Bayesian statistics. If considering the full posterior $f(\beta|\mathbf y,\mathbf u,\mathbf v)$ , which is given by (up to a multiplicative constant) $$\prod_{i=1}^n p_i(\beta,\mathbf u,\mathbf v)^{y_i}[1-p_i(\beta,\mathbf u,\mathbf v)]^{n_i-y_i}\varphi(\beta)$$ where $\varphi(\beta)$ denotes the multivariate Normal density. This means that the full posterior is the same as in the regular logistic regression when treating $\mathbf u,\mathbf v$ as constant. This is a standard model treated in Bayesian textbooks (as for instance in our Bayesian Essentials , Section 4.4, pp.124-6). This posterior is not a standard distribution and requires simulation tools to approximate it, incl. its posterior mean and posterior variance. (Once again, this is processed in textbooks like ours .) It is only asymptotically in $n$ that the posterior turns into a Normal distribution.
