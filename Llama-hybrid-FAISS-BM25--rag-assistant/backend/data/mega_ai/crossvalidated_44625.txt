Factor analysis (FA) of your questionnaire tells you whether the questionnaire measures more than one thing. For example, a questionnaire on happiness might reveal a factor on job satisfaction and one on happiness of personal life Comparing the output of the two FAs would tell you whether the questionnaire's structure is different under the two different conditions. If that were the case, the questionnaire would measure different things under different conditions and would be useless to you to compare your subjects' reactions to the two conditions. But I doubt you can do a meaningful factor analysis with just 18 subjects. For self-created questionnaires you can either treat each item as a DV or the average of a subject's response over all items of the questionnaire. I'm afraid, I'm not expert enough to answer the more pressing part of your question as to how to structure the analysis itself. Looking for the repeated-measures tag should find you some more answers.
