 are free to play, some games require additional credits to play. Eccky's physical and emotional states are subject to continual change, determined by 180 dynamic variables, and are influenced by the interaction with and treatment by users, both via the virtual world and via the chat. The levels of these physical and emotional states are continually assessed and are made visible to users via meters that gauge happiness, hunger, toilet needs, popularity, who Eccky's favorite parent is, etc. For example, if Eccky is not sufficiently fed, users will see this in Eccky's hunger meter. In worst-case scenarios, an Eccky can be neglected, physical and emotionally, to the point of needing to be sent to the hospital. During this time, gameplay continues and users may chat with Eccky, but may not interact with Eccky in the virtual world. Further, Eccky's physical and emotional states are reflected in the chat element, as Eccky will either comment, unsolicited, on how he/she is doing physically and emotionally, or respond to a user in such a way as to make his/her physical and emotional state known. It is also possible to send Eccky away for a period, either to live in other accommodations such as in a hotel, on vacation, or to stay with a babysitter. A babysitter may be anyone with an MSN Messenger account. Sending Eccky to a hotel or on vacation does involve additional costs (sending Eccky to a babysitter does not), and as with Eccky staying in the hospital, users may continue to speak with Eccky via chat but cannot interact with Eccky in the virtual world setting during this time. A user can retrieve their Eccky at any time during a stay away from home. Eccky was closed down in 2007 and until it was launched in a new format in 2009. Eccky 2.0 (Since 2009) In 2009, Dutch/Chinese developer TribePlay created a new version of Eccky and launched it in Hyves as one of the first social networking virtual worlds. In Eccky, players can make a character (an Eccky) with their social network profile. After that, they enter the Eccky world. In this world, they have access to various locations, such as a city center, park, mountain top and beach. Players can also visit their own or other users' houses. In any of these virtual locations players can chat, play mini games and do a variety of other things. Eccky is integrated into Hyves and Facebook. Together with their Hyves or Facebook friends, players can chat, play mini games and post their Eccky's activities on their social networking profile. Eccky has many games. Games can be played in single-player or multi-player format. Ecckies can also play with their Wobble. A Wobble is Eccky's own pet. Wobbles were the first inhabitants of the Eccky world. Wobbles live together with Ecckies and need to be taken care of. Once Ecckies advance in levels, they receive superpowers to be used in the game.
