PHP mysqli updating a blob value in table does nothing

I have a variable called $description that has a paragraph of information in it. Some of these descriptions are a sentence or 2, some are long, so im using blobs to save this instead of var char. This statement executes without a problem, but nothing actually gets saved. No errors reported. $query = "UPDATE event SET description=? WHERE id=? LIMIT 1"; if($stmt = $db -> prepare($query)) { $null = NULL; $stmt -> bind_param("bi", $null, $id); $stmt -> send_long_data(0, $description); $stmt -> execute(); } Is there something im missing?
