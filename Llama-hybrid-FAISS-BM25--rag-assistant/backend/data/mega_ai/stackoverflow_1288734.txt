You can use pseudo-selectors for any element you like, whether the browser/user-agent interprets or applies them is, sadly, entirely up to them. A detailed review of css pseudo-selectors (I couldn't find one specifically limited to pseudo-selectors) is over at: Quirksmode . In short IE6 is a problem for :hover and :active on anything but links; IE 7 plays slightly better, but only supports :active on non-links. IE8 seems to be pretty well up-to-spec, insofar as css2.1 pseudo-selectors go.
