Application Form in WordPress

My company uses the Genesis Framework and WordPress for the overall website. It's a multi-site set up and we'll have multiple child themes in Genesis. I need to create a multi-page application form with user-sign-up (WP-MU?) that will allow a user to register, complete the app and be able to quit and return to their stopping point. I'm looking for ideas on where to begin. I've gone in and created my own version of the 'page' template, so I can create the form from that. I've taken out the loop function and began writing my own custom code to replace it. I normally use PHP frameworks for this sort of thing, making CRUD much simpler for me, but working inside of WP has me a bit lost. Anyone care to offer up a bit of advice? Need more info? I'll edit the post if so. Thanks!
