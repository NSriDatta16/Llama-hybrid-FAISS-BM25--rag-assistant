You've got to pair the timestamp with the stored value somehow, you can create a wrapper object for each value and store the value and the timestamp in a single object. Assuming you have a value myvalue you want to store with reference myref : var d=new Date(); var storageObject = {}; storageObject.value = myvalue; storageObject.timestamp = d.getTime(); localStorage.setItem(myref, JSON.stringify(storageObject)); On the other page you then need to rehydrate your objects into an array and implement your compareFunction function. Your other option would be to use Web SQL Database and Indexed Database API which lets you more naturally store and query this sort of multifaceted info, but you would probably have to create some sort of abstract wrapper to make things work easily cross browser.
