How can I make predictions for new samples in the same subject, conditional on one observation?

I have fitted a Bayesian multilevel model. Example: $$ Y \sim Normal(\mu, \sigma)\\ \mu = \alpha + \beta * time + z_{subject}\\ z_{subject} \sim Normal(\bar{z}, \sigma_z) $$ I have fitted this to some data to get a posterior distribution for $\sigma, \alpha, \beta, \bar{z}$ and $\sigma_z$ I now observe a new Y at time=1 in a subject not related to my original data. Can I make predictions for observations in the same subject at time=2?
