Does bias have multiple meanings in Data Science?

What are the meanings of Bias ? And is Under fitting , which is used in machine learning contexts, the same as "Bias"? I have faced biased data in sampling in statistics but it seems this is a different thing to bias in learning concepts. I have heard that some data sets are biased , also have heard the model (for example neural network) has low bias or e.g. 'high bias' problem. Are these uses of bias different?
