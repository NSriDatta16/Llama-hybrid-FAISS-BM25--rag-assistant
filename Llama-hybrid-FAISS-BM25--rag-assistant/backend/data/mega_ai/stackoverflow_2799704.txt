Yes, the ApplicationName.sqlite database will be created if none exists already. It will be located within your application's Documents directory (assuming that's what your -applicationDocumentsDirectory method returns). If you are running this in the Simulator, you can generally find application data within ~/Library/Application Support/iPhone Simulator . On the 3.2+ SDK, different OS versions are used to group applications built using a particular SDK, so you'll need to go into the appropriate version directory, then Applications , then find the application's numerically coded directory (pretty much by trial-and-error). The Documents directory, and the sqlite database, will be found there. If running on the device, you can go to the Organizer, select your device (while connected to the system), and go to the Applications grouping in the Summary tab. Click the disclosure arrow next to your application's name and you can drag out the Application Data from there into a directory to pull all of your application's working data out of the application on the device.
