Inclusion of prior knowledge about forecast to a (Bayesian) time series model

I am trying to construct an inflation forecasting model with external regressors and seasonality. It came to my mind that a very useful information for prediction could be the consensus forecast of economists (obtained from Bloomberg or Refinitiv). Is there a more sophisticated way to combine the information from consensus with my own prediction rather than (weighted) mean? I was thinking using Bayesian methods, but I couldn't find a package that allows to specify the prior distribution for forecasts. One of the answers here refers to ba bsts package in R , which I am familiar with, but the approach in the answer uses the "prior" information as a regressor in model estimation. I do not have such an option, as I only have the consensus forecasts for the future. Some simplification of my problem in code form: set.seed(13) require(bsts) #Regressors reg1 $inflmm, type = 'l', ylim = c(-0.3,0.8)) lines(pred4$ median, col = 'red') #assume that I have concesus forecasts that bear relevant information for prediction consensus $inflmm inflmm+0.5*consensus pred4 $inflmm, type = 'l', ylim = c(-0.3,0.8)) lines(pred4$ median, col = 'red')
