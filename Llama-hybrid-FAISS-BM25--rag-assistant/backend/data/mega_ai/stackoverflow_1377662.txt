Encoding problems with ogr2ogr and Postgis/PostgreSQL database

In our organization, we handle GIS content in different file formats. I need to put these files into a PostGIS database, and that is done using ogr2ogr. The problem is, that the database is UTF8 encoded, and the files might have a different encoding. I found descriptions of how I can specify the encoding by adding an options parameter to org2ogr, but appearantly it doesn't have an effect. ogr2ogr -f PostgreSQL PG:"host=localhost user=username dbname=dbname \ password=password options='-c client_encoding=latin1'" sourcefile; The error I recieve is: ERROR 1: ALTER TABLE "soer_vd" ADD COLUMN "målsætning" CHAR(10) ERROR: invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0xe56c73 HINT: This error can also happen if the byte sequence does not match the encoding expected by the server, which is controlled by "client_encoding". ERROR 1: ALTER TABLE "soer_vd" ADD COLUMN "påvirkning" CHAR(10) ERROR: invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0xe57669 HINT: This error can also happen if the byte sequence does not match the encoding expected by the server, which is controlled by "client_encoding". ERROR 1: INSERT command for new feature failed. ERROR: invalid byte sequence for encoding "UTF8": 0xf8 HINT: This error can also happen if the byte sequence does not match the encoding expected by the server, which is controlled by "client_encoding". Currently, my source file is a Shape file and I'm pretty sure, that it is Latin1 encoded. What am I doing wrong here and can you help me? Kind regards, Casper
