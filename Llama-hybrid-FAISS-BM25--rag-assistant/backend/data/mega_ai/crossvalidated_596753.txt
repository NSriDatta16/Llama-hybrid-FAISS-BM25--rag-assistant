It sounds like you want a model that would be represented as follows: y ~ 1 + hours + gender_tutor + hours:geneder_tutor gender_tutor is a 4-category categorical variable containing the gender by tutor combinations (male with tutor, male without tutor, female with tutor, female without tutor). It sounds like you want to see if the odds ratio of hours differs for males with tutors and females without tutors. What you'll end up with is a ratio of odds ratios: the ratio of the odds ratio of hours for males with tutors and the odds ratio of hours for females without tutors. If that ratio is 1, then the two odds ratios are equal. More generally, interaction terms in logistic regression models represent ratios of odds ratios (i.e., once the coefficients have been exponentiated). They are not odds ratios; they are odds ratio ratios.
