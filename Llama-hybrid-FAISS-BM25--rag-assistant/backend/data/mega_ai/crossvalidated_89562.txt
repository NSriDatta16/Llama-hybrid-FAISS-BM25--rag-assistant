Not sure I understand the question. The limit of a unique SVM is two classes. One-vs-one, one-vs-all, ... are all kludges to go from two classes to several by using several SVM models. The memory footprint of an SVM model is proportional to the amount of support vectors, unless the model is linear. If the model is linear, it can always be summarized into a single vector plus bias term.
