Did you profile your program? You should profile your code. Objects are fast, unoptimal code is dead slow. After you optimize it, this task would be I/O bound anyway (which means it spends most of time waiting for disks to fetch another part of data). And yeah, your boss is better off doing bossy things like playing golf or dilberting around, not telling you bullshit about software design. 'cause you're not trying to play golf for him, do you?
