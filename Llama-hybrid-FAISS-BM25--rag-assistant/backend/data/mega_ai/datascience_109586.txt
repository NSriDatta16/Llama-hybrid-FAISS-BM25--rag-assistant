NLP to calculate similarity ratio between sentences of max 5-6 words

Im looking for a relatively simple NLP algo that would help me rate the similarity between two sentences. These sentences usually range between 1-5 words approximately. Context: A user can create as many categories as he wishes to group his photos. I noticed that a lot of these categories are empty and when diving a bit deeper I see that a lot of the categories created by a user have almost identical names E.g. FRANCE VS FRANC | SUMMER VS SUMER | BEACH VS BEACH ( HEART EMOTE) One assumption is that they are creating a category with a spelling mistake and instead of deleting , they create a new one. Goal: Quantify the amount of highly similar category pairs at a user level. So my question is essentially two fold: which straightforward NLP algorithm could do the job pretty well without being some convuloted neural network that a company like google uses. heard of cosine similarity for vector space but unsure what would be an appropriate threshold for similarity ratios? I guess thats subjective but any advice is appreciated
