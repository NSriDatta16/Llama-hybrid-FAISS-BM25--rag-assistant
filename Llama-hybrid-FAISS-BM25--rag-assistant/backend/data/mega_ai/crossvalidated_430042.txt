Logistic regression using rms: calculate odds ratio and p-value for specific unit of change

I try to calculate the odds ratios and p-values for continuous and categorical predictors at a specific unit of change (e.g. odds ratio for a change of 10 years, not 1 year) of a multiple logistic regression model. library: library(tidyverse) library(rms) my test data: data my analysis: dd What I tried: From https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24627237/convert-odds-ratio-of-unit-change-to-whole-range I learned that I could calculate the odds ratio for a specific unit of change with: #calculate odds ratio of age for a multiple of 10 years (10-units-change) unit.change=c(10) exp(coef(g)["age"]*unit.change) I do not know how to calculate a p-value for this odds ratio now. print(g) gives me p-values for the beta coefficients, can I use these p-values? From https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/rms/versions/3.1-0/topics/summary.rms I learned that summary.rms calculates inter-quartile range effects. Can I somehow use summary.rms to calculate odds ratios at specific unit of change (and corresponding p-values) for every predictor? (my real data has multiple categorical and continuous predictors...).
