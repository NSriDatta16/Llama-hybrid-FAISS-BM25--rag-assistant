classifications for many multiple classes (40)

I need to classify records in 40 different categories. What would be the best approach to it? Logistic regression? I though it is used for revealed preference and I don't have the other possibilities each line might had. One approach One to one would leave me with 40 taken by 2... a lot of models. IS there any package in R that can solve this type of problem? Also the sample is imbalanced.
