How can I compute the longest relaxation time?

Cross-posted at MMSE and at SciComp . In the case of Monte Carlo simulations: Autocorrelation Time ( $\tau_{\text{int}}$ ) : A measure of how many steps are needed for the correlations in the chain to become small; it affects the variance of estimators based on the Markov chain. Relaxation Time ( $\tau_{\text{relax}}$ ) : The time it takes for the Markov chain to approach its equilibrium distribution from an arbitrary starting point. Longest Relaxation Time ( $\tau_1$ ) : The slowest timescale on which the system relaxes to equilibrium, which is critical for understanding the overall convergence rate of the Markov chain. I realize that autocorrelation time is the sum of autocorrelation values over a given maximum lag time. So, the formula becomes: $$ \tau_{\text{int}} = \frac{1}{2} + \sum_{t=1}^{\text{max-lag}} ACF(t) $$ where $ACF()$ is the autocorrelation function: $$ ACF(k) = \frac{1}{(n-k)\sigma^2} \sum_{i=1}^{n-k} (x_i - \mu)(x_{i+k} - \mu) $$ I also realize that , relaxation time can be found by fitting an autocorrelation value to the exponentia decay function ( $A_0 \cdot e^{\frac{-t}{\tau_\text{relax}}}$ ). How can I compute the longest relaxation time ?
