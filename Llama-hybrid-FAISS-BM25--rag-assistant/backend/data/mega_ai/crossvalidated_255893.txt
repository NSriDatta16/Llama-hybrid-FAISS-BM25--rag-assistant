Let's take the easy question first. Because the boxplots clearly do not follow any nearly linear relationship with the proportions of cotton, a simple linear regression model is out of the question. (1) is a good question, one that always should be asked when performing an ANOVA: when you see seemingly large variation among the spreads of residuals, is that evidence of heteroscedasticity (and if so, what should be done about it)? The correct way to compare variances (or standard deviations) is through their ratios (rather than their differences, say). The ratios are unitless and have universal interpretations. As a rule of thumb, variances in two moderate-sized groups can easily vary by a factor of three. Thus, the apparent spreads among a small set of boxplots (which are proxies for the square roots of the variances--the standard deviations) will typically vary by around a factor of $\sqrt{3}\approx 1.7$. The variation will be greater with more groups and when the groups are small. Since both are the case here, we shouldn't be at all surprised to see one boxplot be two or three times longer than another. What we're doing, evidently, is comparing the longest boxplot to the shortest. It would be foolish to make that comparison based on the full range in each plot, because ranges are highly variable. In an ANOVA setting it makes sense to compare variances (or possibly interquartile ranges, which are depicted by the lengths of the boxes without their whiskers). The math needed to work out the sampling distributions of these ratios is difficult. A quick simulation is revealing. Here is one which computes $y$, the ratio of the largest of five variances to the smallest, a total of $10,000$ times. Each variance is based on five independent but identically distributed Normal values. It tells us how your boxplots might vary if indeed the within-group variation were homoscedastic and Normally distributed, which are the default assumptions you wish to examine. This figure needs a log scale because the ratios can get large. (The maximum ratio found in this particular simulation was $500:1$!) Their logs average around $1.5$ to $2$, corresponding to a ratio around $5$ to $8$: a little larger than suggested by the rule of thumb. This is due to the rather small size of each group. It means that in a dataset of five groups of five, we should expect to see the longest of the five boxes to be around $\sqrt{5}\approx 2$ to $\sqrt{8}\approx 3$ times as long as the shortest one. The vertical red dotted line marks the maximum variance ratio for these particular data, equal to $2.6$. It's actually unusually low ! Only $10\%$ of the simulated ratios were lower than this. We conclude that you have no evidence of heteroscedasticity in these data. It is very instructive to produce simulations like this for a variety of ANOVA settings so that you can get a feel for how much the spreads within each group can naturally vary. To provide a foundation for such simulations, I offer the code used for this one (written in R ). # # Compute the max ratio for the data. # x
