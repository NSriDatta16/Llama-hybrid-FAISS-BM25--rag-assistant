I agree with you and I see no information contamination from the test into the training. You do not use any of the xtest sets into the training. The most one can claim is that probably the Xtest is not that different that Xtrain, and the same for the ytest and ytrain given the autocorrelations of naturally occurring time series. If you can use the autocorrelation when the system is into operation, there is no problem. That mean that you have to use the xtest/ytest that you just predicted as the new xtrain/ytrain for the next prediction. You have to retrain after each prediction. If, other other hand, you cannot retrain the system, then the advise given to you is semi-correct, but the t+13 seems arbitrary, unless the experienced statistician knows that after 13 intervals the autocorrelation of the time series is very low. TLDR: if you can retrain after each/a few predictions your schema is OK, but know that you are probably benefiting from the autocorrelation of time series and if you use less correlated segments for test, your predictions should be of less quality.
