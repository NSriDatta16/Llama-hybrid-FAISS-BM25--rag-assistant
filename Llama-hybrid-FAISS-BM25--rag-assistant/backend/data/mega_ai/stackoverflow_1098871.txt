How to access Magento user's session from outside Magento?

Im trying to access the Magento customer session in another part of my website. domain.com/shop/ The shop itself works like a charm, however im trying to determine within test.php if a customer is logged in, so I can display his name with a link to his cart. Contents of test.php so far: 'frontend')); var_dump(Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->isLoggedIn()); ?> I keep getting bool(false) returned. I'm logged into Magento at domain.com/shop/ so ‘true’ is expected. Am I forgetting something?
