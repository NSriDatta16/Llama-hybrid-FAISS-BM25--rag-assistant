After trying about 100 different work arounds, we finally found a solution which works (for our needs anyway). We're inserting a disabled button with all the styles removed. For example, And then adding some code to onGetContent() to convert the input to plain text. This solution, although not very elegant, Makes the token behave as a single character/item. Makes it read only. Is dynamic in the context of the editor so we can display our token text. Edit : This is what we ended up with.
