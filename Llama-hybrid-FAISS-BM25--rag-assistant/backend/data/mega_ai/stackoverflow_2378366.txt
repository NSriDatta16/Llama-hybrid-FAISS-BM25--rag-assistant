MySQL: how to make multiple table fulltext search

I want to integrate the MySQL fulltext search function in my PHP site. I have the following problem now. SELECT * FROM testtable t1, testtable2 t2 WHERE MATCH ( t1.firstName, t1.lastName, t1.details, t2.firstName, t2.lastName, t2.details ) AGAINST ( 'founder' ); And i have the error code: #1210 - Incorrect arguments to MATCH Do you know why and how to solve it? Thanks very much! Edit: I adopt RageZ's method: SELECT * FROM testtable t1, testtable2 t2 WHERE MATCH ( t1.firstName, t1.lastName, t1.details ) AGAINST ( 'founder' ) OR MATCH( t2.firstName, t2.lastName, t2.details) AGAINST ( 'founder' ); And I have a new question. If i want to find the content which are : AGAINST('founder', 'initiator', 'employee'); How to write the query? Ok, i know against can only have one criteria. AGAINST('founder');
