An alternative: see our SD PHP Test Coverage tool. It doesn't use xdebug to collect coverage data, so it won't have xdebug's specific problems. It instruments a script to collect test coverage data; once instrumented, no matter how the script is executed, you will get test coverage data. (The instrumentation is temporary; you throw the instrumented code away once you have the test coverage data collected, so it doesn't affect your production code base). This approach does require you to explicitly list all PHP scripts for which you want coverage data; you can ignore some if you want. Usually it isn't worth the bother; most of the users simply list all PHP scripts.
