How to open call out MKAnnotationView programmatically? (iPhone, MapKit)

I want to open up the callout for an MKPinAnnotationView programmatically. Eg I drop 10 pins on the map, and want to open up the one closest to me. How would I go about doing this? Apple has specified the 'selected' parameter for MKAnnotationView's , but discourages setting it directly (this doesn't work, tried it). For the rest MKAnnotationView only has a setHighlighted ( same story ), and can ShowCallout method.. Any hints if this is possible at all?
