(Windows) Exception Handling: to Event Log or to Database?

I've worked in shops where I've implemented Exception Handling into the event log, and into a table in the database. Each have their merits, of which I can highlight a few based on my experience: Event Log Industry standard location for exceptions (+) Ease of logging (+) Can log database connection problems here (+) Can build report and viewing apps on top of the event log (+) Needs to be flushed every so often, if alot is reported there (-) Not as extensible as SQL logging [add custom fields like method name in SQL] (-) SQL/Database Can handle large volumes of data (+) Can handle rapid volume inserts of exceptions (+) Single storage location for exception in load balanced environment (+) Very customizable (+) A little easier to build reporting/notification off of SQL storage (+) Different from where typical exceptions are stored (-) Am I missing any major considerations? I'm sure that a few of these points are debatable, but I'm curious what has worked best for other teams, and why you feel strongly about the choice.
