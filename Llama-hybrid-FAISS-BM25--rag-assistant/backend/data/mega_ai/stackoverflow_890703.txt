I think Dave Hanson's C Interfaces and Implementations qualifies as both fast and elegant. It includes many different kinds of containers, some string processing, multiprecision arithmetic, exceptions, a couple of different memory managers. Nice stuff. There's a book, but you don't need to buy it to use the software.
