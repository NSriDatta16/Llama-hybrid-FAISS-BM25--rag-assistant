Ensure trained word embeddings get high similarity with particular words

I am trying out my hand at training a Word2Vec model using gensim. I made a simple training file that basically had just one line repeated multiple times entertainment films Movies cinema entertainment Movies entertainment films entertainment cinema The idea behind using a training file like the one above is to ensure that words like movies, etc come out to be most similar to entertainment. >>> wv_model = gensim.models.Word2Vec(sents, size=300, min_count=1, workers=8, window=1, sg=0) But when I check the results I entertainment actually has a negative similarity score >>> wv_model.most_similar(positive=['Movies']) [('cinema', 0.14602532982826233), ('films', -0.022810805588960648), ('entertainment', -0.030070479959249496)] The result I am trying to achieve is to ensure that the most similar word for movies , films , cinema comes out to be entertainment . How do I do this?
