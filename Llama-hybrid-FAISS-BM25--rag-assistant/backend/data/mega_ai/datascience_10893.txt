Understanding churn prediction model

guys! I have a dataset with a bunch of costumer-behavior features and the output being "Churned"/"Not churned". I applied a simple Random Forest Classifier and got a nice performance. With this, I can predict whether or not a given user will churn. But I need to understand what are the patterns among churned users and patterns among non-churned users. How could I achieve that? (Where I could present something like "Usually, users that churn do this, that and that") PS: No need for a full explanation, I'd happy enough if you give me some directions to what to study so I can achieve this knowledge Many thanks in advance!
