as it has no knowledge of what a api_struct actually is You need to define a managed version in a .NET assembly, that uses attributes (like StructLayoutAttribute ) to ensure it marshals correctly. This seems like a very long-winded [...] The other approach is to create a COM wrapper (e.g. using ATL) around your API. This might be more effort, but at least you avoid the double coding of struct and function definitions needed for P/Invoke. Correction : You have created a C++/CLI project: so just add correct '#pragma' to tell the compiler this is .NET code, and then the output is an assembly the C# project can just reference.
