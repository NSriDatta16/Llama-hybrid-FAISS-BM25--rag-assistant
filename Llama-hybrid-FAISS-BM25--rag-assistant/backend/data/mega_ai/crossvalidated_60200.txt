Choosing the right size of an out of sample data

I am beginner in forecasting, especially forecasting with R and I am really willing to improve my knowledge. Recently, I started practicing electricity consumption time series forecasting. The first barrier I faced is the choice of out of sample data for assessing the forecast accuracy of the forecast model i will be using (regression with ARIMA errors). I have data for 147 months and I want to forecast the next 24 months, for the period June 2013 to January 2015. Furthermore, I have read in @RobHyndman 's online text book Hyn­d­man, R.J. and Athana­sopou­los, G. (2013), Forecasting: principles and practice , (accessed 28 May 2013), section 2.5 under ' Training and test sets ', that: size of the test set is typ­i­cally about 20% of the total sam­ple, although this value depends on how long the sam­ple is and how far ahead you want to fore­cast If I divide the dataset with 20% of it being the out-of-sample data, the forecast model applied to the in-sample data is not quite accurate, since I guess it fails to capture the recent trend, (which began in the middle of the last year), of decreased electricity consumption due to a significantly raised electricity tariff. What do I do about this? Can you possibly give me instruction on what would be considered appropriate size of the out of sample data. I also tried with 7 months of out-of-sample data, but I am afraid that there might be an overfitting issue. Is that right?
