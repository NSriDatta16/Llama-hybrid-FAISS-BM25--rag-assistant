The type of task you are describing is sometimes called time series extrinsic regression. There's not a lot of literature about, this but a paper that provides a good introduction to and evaluation of some ML algorithms is Tan et al.'s Time series extrinsic regression . [Disclaimer: I'm part of the same research group as some of the authors]. I noticed you tagged this "neural-network". In principle, any NN for time series classification can be readily adapted for extrinsic regression by simply replacing the softmax output layer with a linear layer. However, 35 instances is not a lot of data to train a neural network.
