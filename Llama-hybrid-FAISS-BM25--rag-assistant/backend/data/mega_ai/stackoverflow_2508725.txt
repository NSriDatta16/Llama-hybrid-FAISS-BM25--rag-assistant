In browser HTTP debuggers are probably the easiest to use in your situation. Try HTTPFox for Firefox or Opera which has dragonfly built-in.

If you appear to be getting conflicting information, then wireshark/tcpdump will show you if the objects are being downloaded or not as it is monitoring the actual network packets being transmitted and received. If you haven't looked at network traces before, this might be a little confusing at first.
