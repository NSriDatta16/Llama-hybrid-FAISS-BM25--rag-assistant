The common perception of AJAX is flawed. Asynchronous just means it's happening in the background without blocking anything else from loading. An AJAX request can load an entire page's contents, but it certainly doesn't have to (and most of the time it doesn't). If asynchronous scripts are slower, then why are all the top web applications using them? For example, Twitter (when logged in) is a single page application. Literally EVERYTHING gets loaded asynchronously with JavaScript. It's only slow if you write garbage code, which is why learning JavaScript properly is so important. jQuery will most certainly be the easiest to learn due to the huge following, good documentation, and swarms of educational resources online. Pretty much any question you could possibly have about jQuery has been answered on Stack Overflow already. I would recommend a few good google sessions to learn the best practices of JavaScript though. I've been using jQuery for a couple of years now, but just recently began learning JavaScript. It's amazing how much sense everything will make once you learn the fundamentals of JavaScript. A few links to get you started: Your New Bible Really top-notch books from O'Reilly Daily JS Yahoo's Developer Center Also, something that has helped me out a lot is to follow the best developers. You'll learn more lurking on conversations that you could ever believe.
