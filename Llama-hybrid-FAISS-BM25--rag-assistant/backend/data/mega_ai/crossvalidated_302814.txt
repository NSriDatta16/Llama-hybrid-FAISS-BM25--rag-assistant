Does there exist someone faster than Usain Bolt today?

EDIT: I am more interested in the technical issues and methodology of determining the likelihood of a "true" maximum in a given population given a sample statistic. There are problems with estimating the likelihood of faster runners than Mr. Bolt from record-setting dash times that are both obvious and subtle. Humor me by imagining this not to be the case. Usain Bolt is the fastest human measured for the 100m dash. However, given the small number of athletes, it seems likely that the "true" fastest human alive is sitting on a couch somewhere and has never attempted a competitive running career. I am trying to use the fact that the difference between samples at the tails of the normal distribution become smaller and smaller. I'm using this to compute the likelihood there exists someone faster than Usain Bolt by comparing Usain to the 2nd fastest, 3rd fastest and so on. To do this, I'm trying to compute the largest value that exists beyond "Usain Bolt" by taking the derivative of the normal distribution's CDF with respect to $y$, raising that to the $n$th (where $n$ is about 7,000,000,000 or the number of samples less than the "maximum" - the logic behind this is described in the German Tank Problem Wikipedia page which generalizes among different distributions), e.g: $\int_{0}^{\infty}y f_{Y_N} (y)dy = \lambda n \int_{0}^{\infty} y \left [ \tfrac12\left[1 + \operatorname{erf}\left( \frac{y-\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}\right)\right] \right ]^{n-1} \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}\, e^{-\frac{(y - \mu)^2}{2 \sigma^2}}dy$ Is this a valid way to compute the probability that there exists someone faster than Usain Bolt? Is there a name for this sort of question outside of "German Tank Problem for other distributions" Is there a good way to estimate standard deviation from the extreme samples of a distribution? Finding information about the fastest 100m dashes of all time is easy, finding averages & variance is hard) Thank you for your patience in dealing with a programmer without a background in the topic.
