IMHO, I think although Naive Bayesian assumes independence between features, but in reality this is only an approximation. That means there exists correlation between features somehow. If the correlations differs in your subgroup, any subgroup's correlation end up being different from the overall population, which leads to bias. On the other hand, stratified sampling imposed exclusiveness between sample points, which destroyed independence between data points. Actually, I doubt it can be used in any inference about the population if you don't know exact parameters in subgroup.
