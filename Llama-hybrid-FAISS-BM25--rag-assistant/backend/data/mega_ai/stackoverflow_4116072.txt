I tried it out with Apple's PasteboardPeeper sample code (from http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#samplecode/PasteboardPeeker/Introduction/Intro.html ), and dragging a message into the main did show that the path of the message is available: PasteboardRef: 1395632 ItemCount: 1 Index: 1 item ID: 789514 "dyn.ah62d4rv4gu8y4zvanr41xxxxx30n25wqz4ca5pfsr30c35feb4he2pssrxgn6vasbu1g7dfqm1" "MV Super-secret message transfer pasteboard type" '' ______ 82 /Users/guest/Library/Mail/IMAP-me@gmail.com@imap.gmail.com/INBOX.imapmb "dyn.ah62d4rv4gu8zg7puqz3c465fqr3gn7bakf41k55rqf4g86vasbu1g7dfqm10c6xeeb4hw6df" "Super-secret Automator pasteboard type" '' ______ 454 I don't know what "MV Super-secret message transfer pasteboard type" is, but you might not want to rely on it as a key name; rather, maybe you could just walk through all the keys and see if any of them look like a file path.
