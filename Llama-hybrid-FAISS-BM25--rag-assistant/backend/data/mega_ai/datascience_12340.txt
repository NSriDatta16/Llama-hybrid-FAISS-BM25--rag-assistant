What is this formula, related to simple linear regression, called?

This is my first post here. I hope I can make myself clear. Right now I'm learning linear regression as part of an introduction class to machine learning. After going over the steps in the simple regression formulae, I realized that I had been doing something similar in the past to construct lines. In Python: data = [{'x': 1, 'y': 2}, {'x': 5, 'y': 7}, {'x': 6, 'y': 8}] coeff = sum([d['x'] / d['y'] for d in data]) / len(data) Here, we're calculating the mean ratio between the variables, which we can use as a coefficient for constructing a line. Does this method have a name, and how does it relate to simple linear regression?
