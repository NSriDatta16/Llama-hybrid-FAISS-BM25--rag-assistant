Further to Kjetil's excellent answer, I wanted to add some specific examples to help clarify the meaning of a conditional distribution , which can be a bit of an elusive concept. Let's say you took a random sample of 100 fish from a lake and you are interested in seeing how the age of the fish affects several outcome variables: Fish weight (Weight); Whether or not the fish are longer than 30cm; Number of fish scales. The first outcome variable is continuous, the second is binary (0 = fish is NOT longer than 30 cm; 1 = fish IS longer than 30 cm) and the third is a count variable. Simple Linear Regression How does Age affect Weight? You are going to formulate a simple linear regression model of the form: $$ \text{Weight} = \beta_0+\beta_1*\text{Age} + \epsilon $$ where the $\epsilon$ 's are independent, identically distributed, following a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation $\sigma$ . In this model, the mean of the Weight variable for all the fish in the lake sharing the same age is assumed to vary linearly with age. The conditional mean is represented by $\beta_0 + \beta_1*\text{Age}$ . It is called conditional because it is the mean weight for all the fish in the lake with the same Age . (The unconditional mean weight would be the mean weight of all the fish in the lake, regardless of their age.) Simple Binary Logistic Regression How does Age affect whether or not the fish are longer than 30cm? You are going to formulate a simple binary logistic regression model of the form: $$ \log\left(\frac{p}{1-p}\right) = \beta_0+\beta_1*\text{Age} $$ where $p$ denotes the conditional probability that a fish of a given age is longer than 30cm. In this model, the conditional mean of the variable "whether or not the fish are longer than 30cm" corresponding to all fishes in the lake sharing the same age is assumed to vary linearly with age after being fed to the logit transformation. The logit-transformed conditional mean is represented by $\beta_0 + \beta_1*\text{Age}$ . This model works because we assume that the distribution of values of the variable "whether or not the fish are longer than 30cm" for a given age is a Bernoulli distribution. Recall that for this distribution, the variance is a function of the mean value, so if we can estimate its mean value, we can also estimate its variance. (The mean of a Bernoulli variable is $p$ and the variance is $p*(1-p)$ .) See also https://www.theanalysisfactor.com/link-functions-and-errors-in-logistic-regression/ . Simple Poisson Regression How does Age affect the number of fish scales? You are going to formulate a simple Poisson regression model of the form: $$ \log(\mu) = \beta_0+\beta_1*\text{Age} $$ where $\mu$ denotes the conditional mean value of the outcome variable "number of fish scales" for fish of a given age (that is, the expected number of fish scales for all fish in the lake of a given age). In this model, the conditional mean of the outcome variable is assumed to vary linearly with age after being fed to the log transformation. The log-transformed conditional mean is represented by $\beta_0+\beta_1*\text{Age}$ . This model works because we assume that the distribution of values of the variable "number of fish scales" for all the fish in the lake of a given age is a Poisson distribution. Recall that for this distribution, the mean and variance are equal so it is sufficient to model its mean value. To sum up, a conditional distribution represents the distribution of the outcome values for specific values of the predictor variable(s) included in the model . Each type of regression model illustrated above imposes certain distributional assumptions on the conditional distribution of the outcome variable given Age. Based on these distributional assumptions, the model proceeds to formulate how (1) the mean of the conditional distribution varies as a function of age (simple linear regression), (2) the logit-transformed mean of the conditional distribution varies as a function of age (simple binary logistic regression) or (3) the log-transformed mean of the conditional distribution varies as a function of age. For each type of model, one can define corresponding residuals for the purpose of model checking. In particular, Pearson and deviance residuals could be defined for the logistic and Poisson regression models.
