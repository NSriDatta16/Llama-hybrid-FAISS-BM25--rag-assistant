Retain cell address when sorting list

Here is a reduced version of what I need. Essentially, we have a list of components and their status (imagine they have been tested). Component BBB has two sub-components, BBB1 and BBB2. I want their status to reflect that of the BBB component 'parent'. Easily done, apart from the list is very long, and I need to retain the option to sort it as I wish. If I user a simple cell reference to "=B3", then this is invalid once the list is sorted. Similarly with a named range as B3; the named range address is static and does not dynamically alter when the list is sorted. I could fix this by having a 'static' BBB status somewhere that is not in the sort area, but this is inelegant, and I don't like inelegance! Any ideas? http://FileHost.JustFreeSpace.Com/158complist.xls
