UIImage Performance solution

Is there a more elegant solution for this question? I have about 70 .png images I want to load and randomly pull from an array when a button is pressed. (Up to 50 images could be on screen at once and each is 40-68kbs in size with dimensions of 150X215, obviously there will be over lap and covered images behind foreground images at times) Should I use the following example to pull that off? EXAMPLE: -(void)viewDidLoad { UIImage *dogImage = [UIImage imageNamed: @"dog.png"]; UIImage *catImage = [UIImage imageNamed: @"cat.png"]; // And so on 68 more times followed by.... for (int i = 1; i Is this fine for performance or am I going to crash the app at launch or soon after? The Anyone alternatives to doing it this way?
