OK, so after doing everything I could possibly think of and reading every forum out there, here is what worked: Redo EVERYHING. Remove ALL your provisioning profiles from the Xcode Organizer. Close Xcode. Create a New App ID. Create a new Provisioning profile with the new App ID. Create a new Distribution Provisioning profile with the new App ID. Create a new App in iTunes Connect Start Xcode, install your two new provisioning profiles. Update yoru bundle ID to match. Also make sure your id strings that the app requests are updated to reflect your bundle id. Build your project in Distribution mode with the new Distribution Provisioning profile. Upload your new binary. (Leave it un-rejected) Set up your test in-app purchase. Build your project in Debug mode with the new Provisioning profile. Test request. This is what it took to get my store working. My best guess is that the Apple back end servers get screwed up sometimes and you just need to start from scratch. Hope this helps everyone!
