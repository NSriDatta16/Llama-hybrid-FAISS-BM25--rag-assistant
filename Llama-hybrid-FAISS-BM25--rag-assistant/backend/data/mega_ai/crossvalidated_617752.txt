Kaplan Meier but no individuals' data

I did an experiment where I have ten different treatments, with six replicates each. I noted the survival of my animals from Day 4 to Day 12. Each replicate had 12 animals so I noted how many survived each day. I don't have individual data for each animal. So my data looks something like this: Treatment Replicate Survival_D4 ... Survival_D12 Control 1 12 12 Control 2 11 11 Control 3 12 4 Control 4 9 6 Control 5 10 8 Control 6 11 12 Treatment 1 1 12 12 ... Treatment 9 6 12 8 My supervisor recommended a Kaplan Meier Survival Analysis, however, I don't have the 0-1 data for status. I calculated the cumulative survival probability for each replicate and was able to make a plot. I did this by calculating the survival probability each day by dividing the number of survivors by 12 (since I started with 12 animals). Then for the cumulative survival probability, I multiplied the survival probability with the cumulative survival probability of the day before. But I want to know whether there are significant differences between my treatments. I want to see whether f.e. a certain treatment leads to faster death. So my question is, can I still use Kaplan Meier and how would I do so? If I just use my own cumulative survival probability, how would I check for a significant difference? Also, I averaged the cumulative survival probabilities of my replicates so that I only have one value per day for each treatment. Is this okay to do?
