I am interested in knowing if there are more elegant solutions. My approach to the question is to discretize the time frame into 12 time frames, and then calculate the probability of each possibility (e.g. the probability that time frame {2,3} is occupied by B is (2!/4!)) Then I try to calculate the probability in which a time frame having 50% of occupation, and then the probability of each consecutive time frame having 50% of occupation time (which will be quite tedious) Then I can use probability inclusion-exclusion principle to do the final calculation.
