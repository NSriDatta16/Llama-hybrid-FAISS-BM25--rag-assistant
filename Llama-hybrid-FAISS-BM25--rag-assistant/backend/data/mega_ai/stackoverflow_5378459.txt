OpenID, MashSSL... multiparty web services anyone?

I've got a request from a customer which I can't get a clear answer/solution for and was wondering if anyone can "bring some light" to me on this. The customer has to integrate some web ecommerce sites into a generic portal (due to some acquisitions the company has made) and, for the time being, they don't want (can't?) take on the effort and budget needed to re-do each and every site on the small companies into a "one only" web portal that can offer the whole services' range. So, what he's asked us for is a way to integrate all the small companies web services (for example, a simple ecommerce system with payment) into the greater "portal site", but in a "transparent" way that however can let the great portal know (track) that a transaction was completed on a "minor" sub site. The problem is that as of now they can't access that information directly or integrate it automatically. Let me use an example to make it clear (just reading the above paragraph is not clear enough, I'm afraid): User A visits Major Portal (MP). User A authenticates in MP User A browses through MP. Finds a product she's interesed in and clicks a link. Link opens Small Portal (SP) on another browser page or the same, that doesn't matter. User A checks information and decides to purchase the service/good on SP. User A fills in the info requires, and purchases on SP. SP performs the online transaction with its payment method (Visa, Paypal, etc.) SP delivers the service/good to User A. MP gets notification of the purchase by User A on SP, and its value. (9 is the tricky part!) My question is: is there a way to make this work with minimal/no impact on SP's code/website setup? I've checked info on OpenID, MashSSL,... but I can't really see clearly if this can be done. Or how. Any info (or pointer to) will be very much welcomed, as I'm getting lost amongst all that! Thanks a lot!
