Interpretation of odds ratio (OR) below 1

I am running two logistic regression analyses, and I am very confused about the interpretation of the odds ratio, specifically in the case of an OR below 1. I have looked into all kind of different related posts on this forum, but nowhere I can seem to find a similar situation with an explanation. So I hope you will be able to help me out! This is the situation: Model 1: I have a dichotomous outcome: yes/no diagnosis I have a continuous predictor: score A Model 2: I have a dichotomous outcome: yes/no diagnosis I have a continuous predictor: score B For model 1 I have an OR above 1 (Exp(B), thus the OR, =1.17), I interpreted this as: "the odds of having a diagnosis was 1.17 times greater with one point increase in score A" I think this is correct isn't it? For model 2 I have an OR below 1 (Exp(B), thus OR, =0.91). Based on some other posts on stats forums I figured I have to take the reciprocal of 0.91 (being 1.10), so I interpreted this as: "the odds of having a diagnosis was 1.10 times smaller with one point increase score B" Is this correct? I started doubting because somewhere else I read that I should not take the reciprocal but instead do 1-0.91=0.09 and use this number for my interpretation. Although I am not sure how exactly I would use this number in my interpretation... I hope someone can shed some light on the different numbers and ways of interpreting my OR's! Thanks a lot! Sabine
