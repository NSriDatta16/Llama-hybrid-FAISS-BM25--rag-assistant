Bash shell script to prompt user for input with a (CLI GUI) dialog box

Hi and first of all thanks to all those that give helpful answers/pointers!! I'm writing a Bash script that at times may need to ask the user for input. I'm looking for a tool to present a input box (think GUI pop up message box) at runlevel 3 (no X Windows) that provides a selection list and option for manual input. It should provide a radio button next to each option. For example if it were asking the user for a name it would present a list like this (*) Johnny ( ) Ben ( ) Hillary. ( ) Where the line would be a text box to allow the user to enter free text. The output should be to standard out and should be the name e.g. "Hillary". In summary the requirements are: 1) It should pop up and be a bright color to grab the user's attention. Flat text is not suitable 2) Preferably allow selection using the cursor or a mouse 3) Provide a radio button selection list 4) Also allow for free text input 5) Write the selection to standard out 6) I don't want to wipe the status/log messages already on the screen Bash's read command is not "flashy" enough, it doesn't grab the user's attention. The tool dialog wipes the text already on the screen as it re-draws the whole screen and does not allow for both a selection list and a free text input box in one screen. Thanks again MC
