Linear DiD Methods You could stick with the linear probability model which you can easily estimate via least squares. Running a simple linear regression for your difference in differences analysis has several nice properties: the DiD coefficient is readily interpretable (which is not necessarily true for interaction terms in nonlinear models - see Ai and Norton, 2003 ); non-linear methods can nonetheless identify the incremental effect of the DiD coefficient (see Puhani, 2012 ) there are several options available for you to correct for serial correlation of the errors; Bertrand et al. (2004) discuss why this is important and offer several options on how to do it (I listed the available methods in an earlier answer ) the linear probability model is much faster which is particularly true if you have a large data set Drawbacks of the linear probability model are that it is heteroscedastic by construction though this isn't much of an issue given that this is easily adjusted for. For instance, the block bootstrap adjusts for both hetereoscedasticity and autocorrelation as suggested in Bertrand et al. (2004). If you are interested in prediction, the predicted probabilities can lie outside the (0,1) range but as far as I read your question you want to know the treatment effect from the DiD estimation. So if none of these problems are real issues for you, the linear probability model is an easy and quick solution for your estimation problem. Non-Linear DiD Methods There exist alternative models for non-linear DiD but none of them are straightforward. Blundell and Dias (2009) describe the popular index model under the assumption of linearity in the index. They note though that even with a very simple non-linear specification this type of DiD regression is difficult to implement. Another option is Athey and Imbens (2006) who develop a non-linear DiD estimator which allows for binary outcomes. Again the implementation is everything but easy, though for completeness I mention it here. Intuition for Interaction Terms in Non-Linear Models Karaca-Mandic et al. (2012) provide a discussion of the changing interpretation of interaction terms when moving from linear to non-linear models. They provide the mathematical background and support the reader's understanding with graphs and applied examples using publicly available Stata data sets. Thanks to Dimitry V. Masterov for pointing out this useful reference.
