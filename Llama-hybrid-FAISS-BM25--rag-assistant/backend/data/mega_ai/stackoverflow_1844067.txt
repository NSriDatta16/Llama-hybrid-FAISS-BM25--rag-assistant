Is this a Web Site project? I find Web Applications are more structured and easier to maintain. I'm not sure if they are more testable. Then do use namespaces where a web site does not. Have you considered using a UI pattern such as MVP? You also might get partial coverage with creating interfaces for your code-behinds and testing against the interface. Watch out for hidden side-effects (changing the state of a dropdown within a method, it hidden behavior). A book I found helpful was ' Working Effectively with Legacy Code ' by Michael Feathers.
