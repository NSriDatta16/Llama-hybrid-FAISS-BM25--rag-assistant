SparkNLP, Tensorflow, Pytorch for NLP

I used Tensorflow, Keras and Pytorch in the past for NLP related works. New company uses Hadoop, which I only have basic concepts. I looked around and found the NLP package associated with the distributed environment is called SparkNLP. I wonder do I need to give up using SparkNLP instead of Tensorflow, Pytorch to fully transit to SparkNLP to dofor NLP modeling in Hadoop from now on? My largest confusion is on what would be the best/better practice setting up a model using data in hadoop. as i have never modeled in such environment(except queried some data out in the past), i try to get a sense what are the steps i should do when i started working with hadoop data and building the model.
