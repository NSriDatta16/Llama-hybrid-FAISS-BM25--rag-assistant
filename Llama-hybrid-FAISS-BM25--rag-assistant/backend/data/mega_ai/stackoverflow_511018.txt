I guess there is no tool to support your migration but i'd try to start in an old Delphi Version like 1,2 or 3. This syntax should be much nearer on BP7 than the syntax of newer Delphi Versions. At this time, you should first try to just bring your app logic to delphi, without any visual stuff. Then use the form designer to rebuild your GUI. A important point you should pay attention to is that a DOS string is an ASCII-String, while the Delphi strings up to Delphi 2007 are ANSI-encoded. In Delphi 2009, the string keyword describes a unicode string.
