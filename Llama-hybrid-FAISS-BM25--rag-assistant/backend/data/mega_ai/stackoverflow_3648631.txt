I usually store both versions of the text. The escaped/formatted text is used when a normal page request is made to avoid the overhead of escaping/formatting every time. The original/raw text is used when a user needs to edit an existing entry, and the escaping/formatting only occurs when the text is created or changed. This strategy works great unless you have tight storage space constraints, since you will be duplicating data.
