I have a team with this situation. My solution is to run each project with week long iterations and allocate an engineer to that project for a number of weeks, where possible. That way each project is only an average of half a week from being worked on if needed. If you have higher levels of concurrency an alternative strategy would be to keep the short iterations and to set objectives for each iteration that include aspects of each project that requires attention. Multiple, concurrent burndown charts could be maintained to track the work for each project, but I would suggest these are a little academic if you aren't going to have effort expended on each project at a consistent rate. Using this approach would be unorthodox but would give you quick feedback, regular delivery of working software and progress on all the projects that need it so shouldn't rile the agile evangelists.
