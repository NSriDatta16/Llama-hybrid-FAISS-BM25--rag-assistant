How to read this LASSO Coefficient Path Plot?

I am seeing this plot (side 5) here a lot in machine learning literature. But how to read it? In general I know $\lambda$ is increasing from left to right, and we are getting larger coefficients. But What are the x and y axis? and two scales of each axis?
