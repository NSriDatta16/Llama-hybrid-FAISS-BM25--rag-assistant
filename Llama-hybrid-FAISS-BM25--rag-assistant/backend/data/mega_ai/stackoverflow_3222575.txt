Show EPUB on UIWebview page by page

I'm developing EPUB reader on iPad. So, I got a problem. We know that EPUB is not a paged format. But, I want to show it page by page. Of course, it will be more pages if font size is larger, it will be less pages if font size is smaller. I want to make it like iBooks. How to solve it? Thank you for attention.
