Principal components analysis with compositional data

Another beginner question: I'm trying to do PCA on compositional data. In other words, all the variables in the group add up to 100%. I've since learned on this forum that compositional data poses a problem for linear regression. Will compositional data also pose a unique problem when doing PCA?
