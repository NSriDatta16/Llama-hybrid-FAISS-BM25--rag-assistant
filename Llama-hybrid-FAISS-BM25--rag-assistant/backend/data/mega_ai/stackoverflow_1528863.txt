If you had PLW errors enabled, you'd have been alerted to the situation earlier - you'd have gotten a "conversion away from type" error. I re-wrote your query: SELECT t.period, t.asset_cost_company_code, t.asset_cost_center_id, t.depreciation_account_id, add.description, pd.project_num, pd.project_name, ROUND(t.activity_deprn_amount_us, 2), o.major_geography, o.business_unit || o.bu_desc, o.industry_sector_num || o.industry_sector_desc, o.hyperion_num, o.hyperion_desc, o.hyperion_reporting FROM DW_MGR.FA_TRANS_FCT t JOIN DW_MGR.PROJECTS_DIM pd ON pd.project_num = t.project_num JOIN DW_MGR.ORGANIZATIONS o ON o.cost_center_id = t.asset_cost_center_id AND o.company_code = t.asset_cost_company_code JOIN (SELECT TO_NUMBER(rffvd.flex_value) 'account_id', rffvd.description FROM RF_FND_FLEX_VALUES_DET rffvd WHERE rffvd.flex_value_set_id = '1002363' AND rffvd.summary_flag = 'N' GROUP BY rffvd.flex_value, rffvd.description) add ON add.account_id = t.depreciation_account_id WHERE t.period IN ('01-Jun-2009') AND t.asset_cost_center_id IN ('000296','000296') --doesn't work AND t.asset_cost_company_code = '0007' Changelog: Save yourself some typing by using table aliases (also makes it easier for others to read & help) Removed: hyperion_organization was a join to the same table, using the same criteria Specified TO_NUMBER(RF_FND_FLEX_VALUES_DET.flex_value) so the conversion occurs before the JOIN I don't know why the ORA error would occur on 2+ entries in the IN clause, but it you provide two of the same as you posted then it's not likely to be a data issue.
