The reason components resize is so stuff looks nice whatever size the window is, so Swing discourages straight X-Y position. You might want to have a look at GroupLayout http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/layout/group.html which is designed for GUI builders, and the page mentioned above describes using invisible components to absorb the stretches. eg: layout.setAutoCreateGaps(true); SpringLayout might also be useful - see the visual guide If you really want X and Y then set the layout manager to null, and use setLocation() or setBounds(). I REALLY REALLY wouldn't recommend this, but it does work. Have a read of this tutorial
