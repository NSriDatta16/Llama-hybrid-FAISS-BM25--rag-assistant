Draggables Jquery UI, disable individual div on droppable

I'm trying to make some educational site and one of the things I want to have the students do is drag items to an area before being able to proceed to the next stage. I was thing the way to do this was use the jquery droppables script and have the items draggable option disable when it is dropped in the droppable div. Then I was going to add 1 to a variable, when it gets to the right number the button to advance would be enabled. The problem is that I can't figure out how to make the droppable function work only for each particular draggable. So what I have is: $(document).ready(function() { $("#draggable").draggable(); $("#draggable2").draggable(); $("#droppable").droppable({ drop: function() { $( "#draggable" ).draggable( "option", "disabled", true );; } }); }); With these divs; Drop here Drag me Drag me But of course, all this does is disable the the first draggable whenever any are dragged into the droppable div. My javascript is not very good (im learning) and I don't know how I would make it only disable the one that I put into the droppable area. Can anyone help please?
