Firstly there are no dashcode books, a few make mention in passing but do not shed any light on the subject. They are either sub Apple documentation or just tell you to go to the Apple documentation. Your next source is apples documentation which is patchy. It deals very much with the subject at a higher level expecting you to only drag and drop in the library and for instance doesn't give you a listing of command calls per se. Assuming you do not have it this is probably the starting point from apple and you really do need to read round the subject to pick items up. Dashcode is as you allude only html, css and javascript but the trick is to understand the Javascript calls and functions (sorry blindingly obvious i know) There are other frameworks you can use to do the same thing such as Sencha Touch and IUI. I wrote a blog entry on these here . And Apple themselves have two other non-released non-documented frameworks called Adlib and Pastrykit that you might want to look at. I am afraid it is a very confusing and fast moving area, but interesting.
