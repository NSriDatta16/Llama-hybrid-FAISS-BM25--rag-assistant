How to adjust average rating for sample size on rating systems with more than two categories?

After reading How Not To Sort By Average Rating which deals with confidence interval for a Bernoulli parameter how would you extend it to more than two levels? For example: Items are scored between 1 and 5 (1 is worst 5 is best). What is the best way to adjust the average score per item in order to take into account the number of scores it received (one 5 score should not give it an average of 5!)?
