New answer: 2020 ! the main interest lies in the changes in hospital-level variation You have 15 years of data, with over 100 hospitals and around 100,000 observations per year, so an average of around 1000 observations per hospital per year. I think there is only one approach that will answer the research question, and that is to divide the data into subsets. How many subsets will depend on what frequency you wish to the changes in variation. Yearly would be one option, quarterly another or even monthly. You would then fit a model on each subset of the data, with random intercepts for hospitals. Since your outcome is binary, this would be a generalised linear mixed model, with binomial family and logit link. You would use the same model formula for each subset. Then you simply extract the hospital level variation for each time period, ie. the variance or standard deviation of the hospital intercept and present that in whatever way is appropriate - graphically would be my choice. If you think that there is likely to be a seasonal component, then you probably want to use quarterly subsets. Another approach (mentioned in another answer) is to model the time:hospital interaction as random. Here you would fit a model on the whole dataset but additionally with random intercepts for for the time variable interacted with hospital. Again you can choose whatever period for the time variable makes the most sense. You could also fit a model with just the hospital as random and use a likelihood ratio test to determine which model fits best. However, this will not answer the question of how the hospital level variation changes over time . The same applies to using a correlation structure, such as AR1, because this also will not say anything about changes in hospital-level variation.
