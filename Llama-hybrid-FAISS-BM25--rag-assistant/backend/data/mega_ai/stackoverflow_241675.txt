The SQL Server Agent does not have a schedule option like you need, so I think your workaround is as good as it gets for keeping it inside SQL Server. The Windows Task Scheduler however does have an option to run a job on the 'x' day of the month, maybe kicking your sproc off using sqlcmd via Windows Task Scheduler is an alternate solution? Hope this helps
