Simple is good. I'd start doing something like: 1) over a small rectangle, that surrounds a spot: 2) apply a weighted average of all the pixel coordinates in the area 3) call the averaged X and Y values the objects position 4) while scanning these pixels, do something to approximate the bounding box size 5) repeat next frame with a slightly enlarged bounding box so you don't clip spot that moves The weight for the average should go to zero for pixels below some threshold. Number 4 can be as simple as tracking the min/max position of anything brighter than the same threshold. This will of course have issues with spots that overlap or cross paths. But for some reason I keep thinking you're tracking stars with some unknown camera motion, in which case this should be fine.
