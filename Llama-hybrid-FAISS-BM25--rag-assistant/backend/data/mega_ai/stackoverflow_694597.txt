Migration from Winforms to WPF

We are using Winforms using the Infragistic framework. We are considering the move to WPF. The problem is that we have already several forms, dialogs etc in Winforms. We need common look and feel thus we need to migrate all to WPF. Is there a migration tool to take Winforms and migrate to WPF? I know it is not possible to do it completely but is there something that will do some of the work? Thanks
