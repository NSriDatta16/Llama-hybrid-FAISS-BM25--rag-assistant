How to make words into a category. (NLP)

I love to eat chicken. Today I went running, swimming and played basketball. My objective is to return FOOD and SPORTS just by analyzing these two sentences. How can you do that? I am familiar with NLP and Wordnet. But is there something more high-level/practical/modern technology?? Is there anything that automatically categorizes words for you, into " levels "? More importantly, what is the technical term for this process?
