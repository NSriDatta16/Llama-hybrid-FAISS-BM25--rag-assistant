How to deal with high dimensional data (binary classification)?

I would like to know if there is a common recipe for when you have a dataset with a lot of variables. I have read about PCA, ICA and feature selection, but I'm not sure what I should try first and how to mix those techniques, for example with logistic regression. What is the most recommended approach?
