You can use the following code to determine the status of the Location service: var watcher = new GeoCoordinateWatcher(); if (GeoPositionStatus.Disabled == watcher.Status) { // Watcher is disabled. } More realistically, you'll want to pay more attention to change to the status (just because the service isn't disabled doesn't mean you've got location data), so you shoudl take a look at the MSDN Documentation for working with the Location service. There's also a good post on filtering and emulating location data using the Reactive extensions , which is perfect for that pre-device testing, though to save you time on that front the Widnows Phone Team have released the Windows Phone GPS Emulator .
