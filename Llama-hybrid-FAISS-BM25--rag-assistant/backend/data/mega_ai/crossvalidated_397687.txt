Distribution of points in SVMs

Is that an assumption that in SVMs there is a separation of -1 to +1 for all the sample data points, i.e., if x_p is a positive label point then w.x_p + b >= 1 and if x_n is a negative label point then w.x_n https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=4&v=_PwhiWxHK8o that raises my doubt. Thanks in advance.
