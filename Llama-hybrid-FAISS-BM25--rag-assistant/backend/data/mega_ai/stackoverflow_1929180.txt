python-config ldflags on mac

I have a problem with python-config --ldflags on OS X 10.6.2. Using my non-system python.org python install: robin-mbp:~ robince$ which python /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/bin/python robin-mbp:~ robince$ python-config --ldflags -L/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.5/lib/python2.5/config -ldl -lpython2.5 But if I build a c program embedding Python with the above LDFLAGS, it results in the system python being embedded. It seems -lpython2.5 is picking up the system python first, before the one in the -L path. So far the only way I've got it to work is with LDFLAGS=-F/ -framework Python but when it comes to distributing I'd really like to be able to use python-config. What is going on with the library search path that stops it working as expected? According to the man page -L paths should be searched before the default path. Is there any option along the lines of 'forget the default search path and search only paths specified with -L' that I could add to python-config output to get it to work? Or is there any way to extract the working -framework flags from whichever Python is on the path (that would work for whatever the user is using, ie system, python.org, macports or own built)?
