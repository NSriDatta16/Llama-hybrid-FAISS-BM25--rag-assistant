Leveraging Images in Random Forest Predictive Model

I am using a random forest to make numerical predictions for the performance of products using structured variables, and am looking to leverage images to improve my predictions. One idea I have is to run them images through VGG and take the vector output from the final layer (just before classification). Question: How can I include this vector as a predictor in my random forest model? The only idea I have is to include each vector component as a field in my data, but then this massively increases the number of columns
