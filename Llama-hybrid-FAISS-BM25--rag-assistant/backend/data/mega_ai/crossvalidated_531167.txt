What means a log-odd very close to 0?

I'm running a binary logistic regression and when put in relation with one specific continuous variable, I get a log-odds (Beta) of 0.001 and a odd ratio (Exp(B)) of 1.001. No matter what other variables I add or remove to the model (ordinal, nominal, continuous), I get the exact same results 0.001 and Stand. Err. of (0.000) always p So I am wondering if there is a glitch with the data. What means such a low value. A odd ratio of "1 time more than..." seems odd to me :P Thanks for helping me clarifying it. Cheers
