Unsupervised Learning upon a column of dataset (graph shown)

Iâ€™m new into Machine Learning so here I am asking for a sanity check, if the question I am asking is even reasonable. I have a Dataset of columns, so I want to call one of the columns from the csv using pandas. Take one of the number from that column of numbers, do some unsupervised learning to determine if this value is an anomaly in this column and it belongs there or not. The graph below shows, how I would see this process going. I am not sure on what I would do regarding what unsupervised method would be best for this case.
