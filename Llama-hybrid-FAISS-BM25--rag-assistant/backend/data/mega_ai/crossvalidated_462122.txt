A different approach, I would reframe your problem into a regression format. In this modeling frame, assign a 0/1 dummy variable to speak as to whether awarded actors have a statistically significant impact on a movieâ€™s rating. I would take some random sub-averages of the movie rating scores for movies with the same 0/1 dummy variable (relating to quality of actors as having received an award or not). The averaging of the Y data is employed arguably/approximately to introduce normally distributed errors allowing the use of the more powerful t-test and avoiding less powerful non-parametric testing. I also like the regression format, as it allows one to easily enter possibly other more significant variables, which I believe are more likely generating the rating of movies rather than the nature of the actors. For example, a dummy as to whether or not the movie is very high budget or is actually part of the significant historical money-making sequel. Once you have a dummy for this variable, I believe the population would then reflect more of the market for lower budget movies which have been introduced, online, via Netflix, for example. As the latter has induced some highly awarded creative movies with many unawarded actors, this may be appropriate in assigning the correct rating weight to the unawarded actors not in very large budget or big name sequel movie productions.
