Suggestions for creating an in-house marketing campaign database in a Microsoft environment?

I'd like to create an in-house solution to store marketing segment, list, campaign, and communication data. Right now nothing is centralized/standardized. Data is located on a variety of SQL servers, Access databases, and Excel spreadsheets. It's been a real pain when it comes to reporting/tracking. I'm in a Microsoft SQL Server environment and have access to: Microsoft Access Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio Microsoft Business Intelligence Development Studio Security and compliance is pretty restrictive in my environment. Purchasing a third party software package doesn't appear to be an option. I may have the possibility of having a SQL server sandbox environment created for my use. I'm curious what suggestions you would recommend and why. I need to think about all aspects including existing data retrieval/parsing (some on a continuing basis), data import into the new marketing datamart, and reporting. Some kind of GUI may be required as there isn't currently one for tracking/categorizing much of the data. One other individual may need access to help with regular imports to help spread workload. Thanks.
