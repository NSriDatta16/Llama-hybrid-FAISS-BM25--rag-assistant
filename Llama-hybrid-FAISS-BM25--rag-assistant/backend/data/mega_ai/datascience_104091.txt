In time series you use data from the past to predict the future. So here your text at time t is the one you need to classify. But your data can have lagged data as input or even some aggregation function based on the past N points. In time series we use average and std over a moving window. For example like including lags: Input data for your model: [curent text, previous text, text before previous text] Converted using bag of words: [word 1 in text 1, ... ,word n in text 1, word 1 in text 2, ... , word n in text 2 ...] Here position matters, but neural networks can identify it.
