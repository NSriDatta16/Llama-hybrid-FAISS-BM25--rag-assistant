C# Control Parent

I have a winform project with a tabcontrol and several tabpages. Within each tabpage there is some unique panel controls. However, when the user interacts with the form in each tab page, I want a generic picturebox to show. So I don't want to create a new picturebox for each tabpage, rather show the same one. Which control should I therefore have as a parent to the picturebox, and how can I change the parent once I drag the control onto the form? Thanks.
