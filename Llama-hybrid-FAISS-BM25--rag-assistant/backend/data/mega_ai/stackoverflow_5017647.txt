What are the jQuery's draggable's true x and y coordinates respective to it's container and siblings?

I'm trying to find the correct placement of images inside a container relative to the container and to eachother in order to provide colision detection and do some other useful stuff. Right now, lest imagine there is an HTML like: and some JavaScript code on document ready: var positions = {}; // should already contain some x,y pairs of other dragged imagges $('#imagesContainer div').draggable({ cursor: 'crosshair', drag: function(event){ var id = // get the draggable's id positions[id].x = //find the x of the draggable positions[id].y = //find the y of the draggable // do calculations on the positions } // drag: }); What are the true or correct values for the x and y coordinates of the div's relevant to the top left corner of their container, and how to set them and get them for future use (saving/restoring from database, etc.)?
