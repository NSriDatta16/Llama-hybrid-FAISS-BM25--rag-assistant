There are two cases: If K-Fold Average Score is evaluation score average: Then you cant say there is underfitting or or not. You should check training scores average and compare it to unseen test score. If K-Fold Average Score is training score average: Then you should check evaluation fold score averages. In both cases, test score can be higher since (I assume) there is no sampling technique you used to split data train/test. You should compare eval scores and training scores in K Folds to interpret overfitting/underfitting.
