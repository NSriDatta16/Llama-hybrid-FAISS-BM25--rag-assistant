How to interpret PCA plots made using R

I'm using PCA for the first time and just experimenting with it. I used PCA on my dataset that can be found here wine produces this plot Questions How would I interpret the above graph? My aim is to apply dimension reduction to see which attributes can be taken out while not losing meaning of the data. How can I do this with PCA?
