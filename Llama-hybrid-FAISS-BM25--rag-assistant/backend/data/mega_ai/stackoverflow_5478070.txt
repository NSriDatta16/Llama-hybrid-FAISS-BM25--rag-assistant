VB.NET: Password encryption

What's the simplest way to upgrade a VB.NET site to using encrypted passwords? Are there easy to use encryption algorithms built in to System.UI? My site is using plain text password storage, and it will soon be going to a public server at godaddy from a private one on the local network. I'm going to have to start adding in encryption algorithms to all the password parsing functions, and it would be nice if I could just set a SALT key in the web.config file and Encrypt(password) or something like that.
