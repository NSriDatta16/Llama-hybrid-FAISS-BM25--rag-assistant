multivariate multiple regression with probabilities as the dependant variable

I have a problem that involves multiple dependant variables, where each dependant variable is a probability and for each observation the probabilities sum to 1.0. I also have a range of independent variables for each observation. I would like to model the dependant variables. This model need be a traditional "statistical" model, or it could come from the area of machine learning. My data could look like: OBS Y1 Y2 Y3 Y4 X1 X2 X3 1 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 12.1 8.2 7.8 2 0.7 0.0 0.1 0.2 8.1 1.2 3.2 3 0.1 0.1 0.1 0.7 7.3 1.5 7.2 4 0.2 0.2 0.3 0.3 1.5 4.6 5.6 ... The purpose is mainly predictive, ie given a set of values for X1, X2 and X3, what is the prediction for Y1, Y2, Y3 and Y4 subject to the constraint that Y1+Y2+Y3+Y4=1.0 and 0.0 I know that in R it is quite easy to model in this form by providing multiple Y variates to the left hand side of the '~'. But I don't know how to enforce a constraint or a knowledge that the Y's are all between 0.0 and 1.0 and must sum to 1.0. Thanks.
