Lecture video of how to get machine learning to work in practice

I remember that Andrew Ng had a very good lecture were he explained how to get Machine learning to work in practice. If I remember correctly, it was a lecture video companying the following slides: http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials/ML-advice.pdf I have not been able to find the talk/lecture video again. I was wondering if anyone knew where it was or had a link to it or had a copy to it?
