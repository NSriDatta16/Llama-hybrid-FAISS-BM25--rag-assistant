Let me add to the great explanation by Richard. Or actually let me try to explain the basic concept in (even) simpler (and therefore may be a little bit less correct) terms, since you asked for a very simple explanation. Let's start with the cointegration relationship : The two time series are cointegrated, which basically means that they both change over time ("they are non-stationary") but in a "similar" way. If they both "change in a similar way" this implies that the relationship between them does not change. Translating this into formulas: $y_t = θ z_t$ represents the relationship between the two time series. If $θ$ is the same for all t this means that the relationship does not change. However since we are dealing with real world data the time series the described relationship is only the long run "average" relationship. For any $z_t$ the actual value of $y_t$ will therefore either be a little bit above or below the value that we would have expected based on our equation. This is captured in the error term $u_t$ (which OLS tries to minimize): $y_t = θ z_t + u_t$ Since we claimed that the relationship (between $y$ and $z$) does not change over time, $u_t$ has to be stationary. Therefore the long rund relationship/deviation from the long run relation ship at $t$ is represented by $y_{t−1}−\theta z_{t−1}=u_t$ The actual Error Correction Model : Since we said that relationship $y_{t−1}−\theta z_{t−1}=u_t$ is stationary this means that if we deviate from this relationship in one period, it is likely that we will correct this deviation over the following periods. So if as an example $y_t$ was 1 unit higher than expected by the long run relationship the error in $t=1$ would be $u_t=1$. We would then expect $\Delta y_{t+1}=y_{t+1}-y_t To achieve this effect the error ("deviation from long run relationship") of the previous period is included in the Error correction model. The coefficient $\lambda$ provides information on how quickly this deviation is "corrected": $\lambda(y_{t−1}−θz_{t−1}) = \lambda (u_{t-1})$ Hope this naive explanation helped to understand the basic concept to then be able to go on to Richard's answer to understand the concept correctly :)
