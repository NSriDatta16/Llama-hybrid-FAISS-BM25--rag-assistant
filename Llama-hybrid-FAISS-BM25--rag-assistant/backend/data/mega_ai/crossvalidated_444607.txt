It seems me that, in comparison to previous answer, easier result are available. Infact if the $v$ parameter are known, the ML estimators for $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ mantain the usual OLS formulation. In other terms, the $\beta$ s ML estimators under Student-t distribution for error terms are the same as in Normal case. However their variance are considerably inflated if $v$ is small. Moreover usual t and F test remain valid. See, Arnold Zellner: Bayesian and Non-Bayesian Analysis of the Regression Model with Multivariate Student-t error terms - Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 71, No. 354 (Jun., 1976), pp.400-405 .
