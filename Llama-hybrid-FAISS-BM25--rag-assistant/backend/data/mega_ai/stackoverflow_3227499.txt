How to manage huge amount of data using filestream since only local paths are supported for data storage?

As pointed out in this question when using filestream with sql server 2008 the data must be stored locally. This means that I cannot use \\FILESERVER\FileStreamData\MyDatabase for Filestream filegroup path. So if I need to use filesrteam and have lots of data, is buying a very large hard drive the only solution (this could be quite limiting in many scenarios)? It is not possible to use a NAS? Typically one installs SQL Server on a perofrming machine but keeps the large documents in a NAS or anyway on some fileserver. With filestream this is not possible, so how to do it?
