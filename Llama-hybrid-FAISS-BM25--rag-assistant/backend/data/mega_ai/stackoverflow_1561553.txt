CKEditor 3.0 Plugins - Getting selected text/HTML

I have a plug in in the old FCKEditor I would like to rebuild. I saw an example that leveraged the iFrame code. The I've got the button defined and working, I get the dialog, but I cannot figure out how to get the selected text/html into the dialog so I can manipulate it. My plug in is an approximaiton of the MS File dialog box. When the user clicks on a file that is listed (or an html page in the list) my code updates the link text box with the URL to be used in the HREF property... I cannot find anything that will tell me how to get selected text from the editor and replace it with the edited code once my dialog does it's work... Any suggestions? I am intermediate with this so if you post code please comment on what's happening so I can understand. Thanks.
