Any performance difference is going to be so tiny on modern hardware that for all intents and purposes it'll make no difference. Try writing a couple of test harnesses and run them both a few hundred times, take the average loop completion times, and you'll see what I mean. It might make sense from a storage perspective if you have very limited resources - embedded systems with a tiny stack, wire protocols designed for slow networks (e.g. GPRS etc), and so on.
