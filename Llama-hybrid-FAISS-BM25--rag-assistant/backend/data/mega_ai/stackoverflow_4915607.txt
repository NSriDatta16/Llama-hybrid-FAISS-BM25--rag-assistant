Perhaps you a taking a path which requires you to write some lisp to get what you want. The org-mode manual gives an example of something similar, but I'm guessing you wanted a simpler format, when it describes the calendar/agenda integration http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/org/Weekly_002fdaily-agenda.html * Birthdays and similar stuff #+CATEGORY: Holiday %%(org-calendar-holiday) ; special function for holiday names #+CATEGORY: Ann %%(diary-anniversary 14 5 1956) Arthur Dent is %d years old %%(diary-anniversary 2 10 1869) Mahatma Gandhi would be %d years old I would think you have other options if you want a custom setup: either a new type of export or dynamic blocks might be used. This may highlight the different use-case of agenda over the diary. The agenda seems more geared towards day to day tasks.
