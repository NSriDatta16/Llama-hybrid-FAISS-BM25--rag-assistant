Is there an algorithm or NN to match two documents, basically not closely similar?

Is there an algorithm or NN to match two documents? One is a claim description (e.g. a CV or product offer) and another is a requirements description (e.g. vacancy description or RFP). They are not similar, so basically it's not a docs similarity per se. What's it better embedding to use on document corps (Doc2vec, Word2vec or just TF-IDF? etc) and what kind of further NN architecture would work to basically find a matching scores vector/matrix as output on how do input claim docs match to requirement docs? Or is there exists just any text analitics algorithm or something? Thanks in advance for help.
