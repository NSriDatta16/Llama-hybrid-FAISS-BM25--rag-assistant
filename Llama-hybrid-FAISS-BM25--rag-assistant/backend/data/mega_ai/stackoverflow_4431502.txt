Yes, I'd say this is bad - because you can't use all repositories in the same way. I would personally make the repository interface extend IDisposable - it's easy enough to implement it with a no-op, after all. This is exactly the same choice as is made by Stream , TextReader and TextWriter in the main framework. StringWriter (for example) doesn't need to dispose of anything... but TextWriter is still disposable. This all comes about because IDisposable is in some ways an odd interface: it doesn't convey something that is offered to callers... it conveys something which is required of callers (or at least, strongly encouraged with possible issues if you don't go along with it).
