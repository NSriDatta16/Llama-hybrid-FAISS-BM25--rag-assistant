If it's windows forms I guess you have to rely on the unicode control characters to mark the tooltip text as RTL. string myToolTipText = "aaaaaa"+Environment.newLine+"bbb"; char rle_char = (char)0x202B;// RLE embedding control.RightToLeft = RightToLeft.Yes; control.ToolTipText = rle_char + myToolTipText; Check this blog for more information on authoring RTL applications. If it's a web application you can check the w3c authoring RTL applications guidelines . Basically it comes down to the same solution as for windows forms, adding RLE chars.
