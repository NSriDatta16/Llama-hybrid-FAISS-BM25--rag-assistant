Neither of the points in Michael's response speak directly to Jim's question. Being on a Windows platform will prevent you from using the iPhone SDK emulator, but will not necessarily prevent you from deploying to and testing on an actual iPhone/iPod Touch. To my knowledge you do not have to own Mac hardware to register as an iPhone developer. You need to be a iPhone developer so that you can use the test deploy functionality that the iPhone supports though. I have not tried MonoTouch yet but this is my understanding of how it works. When you compile using MonoTouch it will output a binary ready to be run on the iPhone/iPod Touch device. You would then use iTunes to drag the binary over the application panel and sync the device. This approach will surely not be as automated as native development but it should work "Mac free".
