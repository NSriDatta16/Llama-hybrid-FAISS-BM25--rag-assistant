Swing isn't going to give you perfect fidelity with the hosting OS. Sun simply can't devote the considerable resources necessary to do so. My impression is that Swing has gotten much better, but is still going to look out of place by default. The minimum required to even hope to pass as a Mac app: package your .jar in a .app set the L&F to system default set apple.laf.useScreenMenuBar property to true must do this before any UI code Dock interaction is non-existent in standard Java. You'll have to use Apple's Cocoa-Java bridge, which is no longer supported. I have no idea how tractable JNI is on OS X, which is the only real alternative. Performance shouldn't be a problem. Drag & Drop is probably as hairy on OS X as it is everywhere else. Basically, if you're explicitly targeting OS X you're best off using Objective-C. Its far from impossible to build an app on OS X using Java & Swing, but its a lot of work to make it look "native".
