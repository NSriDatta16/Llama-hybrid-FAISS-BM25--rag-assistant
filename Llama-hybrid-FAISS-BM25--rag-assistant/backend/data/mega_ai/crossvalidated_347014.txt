The singularity issue that is mentioned in the answer is a problem with the MLE estimation for the GMM, when estimated using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm. If you use a Bayesian approach, you will not face singularity issues. Typically, for covariance matrices you need a prior with support over positive-definite matrices which can be achieved by using the Inverse-Wishart prior.
