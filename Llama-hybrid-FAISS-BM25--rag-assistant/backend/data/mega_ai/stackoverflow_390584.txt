Custom Binding of multiple fileds in Custom DataGridViewColumn(WinForms)

I have a question regarding a data binding(of multiple properties) for custom DataGridViewColumn. Here is a schema of what controls that I have, and I need to make it bindable with DataGridView datasource. Any ideas or a link to an article discussing the matter? Controls Graph Control(custom): Displayed in the custrom DataGridView column. Has properties like "Start Date", "EndDate", Windows Chart control, which is itself, bindable, etc. Custom cell(DataGridViewCustomCell inherits from DataGridViewCell) that holds the Graph control and processes some events(OnEnter event, for example, passes the focus to the custom Graph column for drag-n-drop type of events, etc.) Custom column(DataGridViewCustomColumn inherits from DataGridViewColumn) that defined the cell template type: CellTemplate = new DataGridViewCustomCell(); and also a primary choice for data binding Data Structure: Main table to be displayed in other DataGridView Columns Graph table - related to the Main table via parent-child relationship. Holds graph data Chart table related to the graph table via parent-child relationship. Holds data for the win-form chart, which is a part of my Graph control. So far I cannot even bind data from the Graph table to by Graph control or Graph-holding Column/Cell.
