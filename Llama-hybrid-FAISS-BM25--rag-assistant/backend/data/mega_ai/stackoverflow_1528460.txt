To answer your first question: color_new = min(cyan1 + cyan2, 100), min(magenta1 + magenta2, 100), min(yellow1 + yellow2, 100), min(black1 + black2, 100) If this had been RGB values it would result in saturated colours (i.e. colours at or near white). The converse will be true for the CMY part of the CMYK colour - they will tend to black (well practically dark brown). The addition of black means that you get pure black (thanks Skilldrick). After all if you have 100% black and any combination of CMY the result will be black. Re your second update I would expect that the results you obtained from Acrobat would apply universally.
