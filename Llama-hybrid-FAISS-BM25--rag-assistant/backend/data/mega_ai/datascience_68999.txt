What is done first, cross validation or grid search?

When I have the data set to train a model with SVM, which procedure is performed first, cross validation or grid search? I have read this in a couple of books but I don't know in what order all this should be done. If cross-validation is first performed, what hyperparameters do I use there if I have not found the optimal values provided by the grid search? In addition, throughout this procedure, where should the confusion matrix be calculated? Thanks in advance
