Expression blend for animations

I am trying to create a short animation of an object rotating in 3D space..I have all my images ready..I would like to know how I can change from one image to the other without the transition moves being shown Thank you Edit: What i mean is that instead of having a bouncing ball which all i need to do is move the ball in each frame, what if i had and object that in every frame I used a different image: eg. person facing forward, person facing facing right, etc...how can i do it without the image being shown as being dragged from the screen? I hope I'm making sense
