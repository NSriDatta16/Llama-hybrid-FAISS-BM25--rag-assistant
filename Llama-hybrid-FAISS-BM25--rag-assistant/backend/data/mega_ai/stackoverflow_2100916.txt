The issue with your code is the following : You are assigning getCard to 0 in your if expression, change it to == . Also, if getCard is not a property of your object, you need to declare it as int getCard = 0; What you should do : Instead of writing 5 if statements, just write this one line: [popCard setImage:[UIImage imageNamed: [ NSString stringWithFormat: @"Graphic%d.jpg", getCard ] ] ];
