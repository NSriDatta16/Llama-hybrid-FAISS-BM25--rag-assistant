One simple way in jQuery is to convert the the value to uppercase after every keyup event: $(document).ready(function(){ $('#myfield').keyup(function() { var t = $(this); t.val(t.val().toUpperCase()); }); }); Remember that this only changes the value in the UI on the client. When the user submits the form, it will send this uppercased value, but a malicious user could send data that was not uppercased, so you probably want to use an upcase method on your server, either in your CGI code (PHP, Perl, Java or whatever you're using), or in your SQL insert statement.
