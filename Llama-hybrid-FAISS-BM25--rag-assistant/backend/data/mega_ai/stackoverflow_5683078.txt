You might try replacing the sql subqueries in the 2nd statmenet with joins. Robert Vieira claims in his Sql Server books that sometimes joins are faster and sometimes subqueries are faster. Hard to believe that the same would not be true for MySql as well. Also, if there ia quite a bit of other data in the table, other than 'list' or 'sample', then you might want to insert this data into a temp table and run your queries from that table instead. This is especially true if you are going to be running multiple queries on that data.
