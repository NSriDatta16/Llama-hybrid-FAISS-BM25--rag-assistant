Relationship between logistic regression and linear regression

I've encountered a problem where I need to analyze the relationship between a movie's length, a movie's price and it's sale on a video streaming platform. Now I have two choices to quantify sale as my dependent variable: whether or not a user ended up buying the movie selling rate (# of people buying the movie / # of people watched the trailer) if I use selling rate I essentially would use a linear regression where I have $$selling\ rate= \beta_0 + \beta_1*length + \beta_2*price + \beta_3*length*price$$ But if I'm asked to use option 1 where my response is a binary output, and I assume I need to switch to logistic regression, will my coefficients change and how will them change? How would the standard error change? Will the standard error be an underestimate? This is just a discussion question and I don't have actual data for it, I'm confused on how is logistic and linear regression related and whether they are interchangeable in some way?
