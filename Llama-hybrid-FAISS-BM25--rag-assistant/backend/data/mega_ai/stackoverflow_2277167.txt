Depending on your version of Magento, it may not be implemented by default and you will need to add some extra code to the bottom of Magento's index.php: $mageRunCode = isset($_SERVER['MAGE_RUN_CODE']) ? $_SERVER['MAGE_RUN_CODE'] : ''; $mageRunType = isset($_SERVER['MAGE_RUN_TYPE']) ? $_SERVER['MAGE_RUN_TYPE'] : 'store'; Mage::run($mageRunCode, $mageRunType); If using the codes from the websites (not the store views) then you will need to set MAGE_RUN_TYPE to 'website'. I believe you will also need to set a store view for website B as it will not be inherited from website A.
