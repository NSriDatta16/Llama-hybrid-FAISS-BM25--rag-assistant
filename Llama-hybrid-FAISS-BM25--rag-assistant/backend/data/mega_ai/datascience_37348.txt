You should focus on methods that fall under the scope of Record Linkage rather than clustering, as Record Linkage methods are specifically targeted to solve this type of problem. The manuscript 'Automatic Record Linkage Using Seeded Nearest Neighbour and Support Vector Machine Classification' written by Peter Christen, provides a good introduction to using machine learning for Record Linkage link to the pdf . There is also a RecordLinkage Package available in R, which provides a good starting point to practice with techniques from stochastic record linkage, and supervised and unsupervised machine learning link to manuscript which describes the package
