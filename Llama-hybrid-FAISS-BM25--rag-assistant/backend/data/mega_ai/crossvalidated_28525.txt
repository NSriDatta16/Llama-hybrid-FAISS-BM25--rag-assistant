Yes, python is a good choice for building a machine learning application. The primary scientific libraries, numpy and scipy, use C and Fortran for core loops, so they are often as fast as libraries in other languages. Note that a drawback of python is that each python process can only utilize a single core for computation (because of the GIL ) and python performance suffers if you try to have multiple cpu-intense threads running simultaneously.
