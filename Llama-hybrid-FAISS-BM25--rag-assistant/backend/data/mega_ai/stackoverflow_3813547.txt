Problems with Object Member Corruption when using Session In-Proc

I'm currently working on solving a bug with a site I've been working on for some time now. The issue I'm having is my session objects are being overwritten occasionally when users call the site at the same time. My current session mode is In-Proc and after reading another thread regarding a similar issue I believe my problem may be related. The site uses Sql Reporting Services to generate some legal documents by querying a database and using XML from two different web services. In the session I store a custom object that contains members holding the data to generate the document in SRSS. The issue I'm having happens when I open two instances of the site at the same time. The Session IDs are different, but when I begin generating the forms the two objects tromp all over each others data somehow. I'm still not quite sure how it's happening. My thoughts thus far have been to attempt to store some of the more sensitive members of the class in the session explicitly to see if that would help correct some of the corruption, or to move over to another form of session management. I have access to a SQL server so I could use the SQL session storage mode. Anyone have any recommendations/ideas?
