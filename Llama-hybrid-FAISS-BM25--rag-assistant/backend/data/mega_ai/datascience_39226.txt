CNN kernel location for input image

Given a CNN, say AlexNet: How could one relate kernel locations at the 3rd conv block, i.e 13x13 filter size to the input image. Would that give a meaningful representation in terms of the input image. I was thinking of just upsampling the location, from 13x13 to 224x224.
