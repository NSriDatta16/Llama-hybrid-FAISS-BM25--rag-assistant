What about the following iterative procedure to evaluate a person's grade in category C: At the initial state $k = 0$ each person $i$ is given the initial grade $P_i^0$ which is the simple average of the grades $G(j, i)$ given by person $j$ $$ P_i^0 = \frac{\sum_{j \ne i}G(j, i)}{\sum_{j \ne i}1}. $$ At step $k$ we give more weight to $G(j, i)$ by multiplying by the $k-1$ grade of person $j$. That is $$ P_i^k = \frac{\sum_{j \ne i}P_j^{k-1}G(j, i)}{\sum_{j \ne i}P_j^{k-1}}. $$ You iterate over $k$ until convergence.
