Automatically saving video files to Android SD card

We are creating an app for a user who has about 350MB of video clips. Since most (if not all) Android phones won't have that much internal storage, I'm not sure how we are going to make this work. Is there a way to push the video clips onto the SD card when the user downloads the app? If not, is there any other way to do this?
