Logistic regression before decision tree model

I am trying to run several decision tree models (CHAID, C&RT, QUEST), but I have learned that several researchers have applied logistic regression model first in order to select risk factors. So, once they have significantly factors they used them to perform a decision tree. It is the best way to do that? Do I really need to do this before a decision tree? If so, what are the advantages?
