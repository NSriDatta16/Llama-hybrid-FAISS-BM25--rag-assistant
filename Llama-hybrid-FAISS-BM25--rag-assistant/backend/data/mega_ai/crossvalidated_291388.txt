You could use an ARMAX model (where the final X stands for the eXogenous variables). The use of a time series model instead of an ordinary regression is required if (as seems likely) your data has some temporal structure: serial correlation, for instance. An state-space model is, in my view, easier to comprehend and handle and really amounts to the same thing.
