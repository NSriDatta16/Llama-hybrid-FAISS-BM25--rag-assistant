Direction of PC1 and PC2 in Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

I am a bit confused by what is considered the direction for the principal components in PCA. For example: I do understand that the picture on the right hand side is correct. However, is the the PC1 direction just the northeast pointing arrow (i.e. direction is of increasing axis value) or is it double ended (e.g. it also includes a south west pointing arrow at the other end of the line? I have seen explanations for PC1 with no arrows, one arrow, and two arrows, so it's just a bit confusing which is considered the PC1 direction.
