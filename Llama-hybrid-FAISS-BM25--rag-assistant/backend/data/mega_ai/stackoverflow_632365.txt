I'm going to assume you are using Tortoise SVN. Suppose you have the following situation: /trunk /braches /branch1 /branch2 /tags /1.0 /2.0 Then all you need to do is: open the tortoise repo-browser go to the root and expand things so you can see what you are doing select the /tag/2.0 folder Ctrl-drag to copy it to the /branches folde rename the new folder (or not) And that's it. You then neded to check out /branches/tag/2.0 (or whatever you called it) to work on it. What you need to do is always think of SVN as simply being a file system. The names and the meanings you give things in that file system are up to you. The fact that you cannot edit "tags", for example, s just a convention - the underlying file system doesn't care if you edit them or not.
