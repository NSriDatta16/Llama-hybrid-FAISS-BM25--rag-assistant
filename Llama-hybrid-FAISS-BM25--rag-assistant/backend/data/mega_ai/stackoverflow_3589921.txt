Javascript SQL database

I'm wanting to deliver some data from the server-side to some client-side Javascript which can use said data to construct a database/table, and then query it using some user-input SQL. Persistence of data isn't what I'm looking for, so HTML5 stuff like localStorage isn't relevant, I'm only wanting to be able to create something like a mini-database in Javascript to query. Is there any Javascript libraries that have this capability? Thanks.
