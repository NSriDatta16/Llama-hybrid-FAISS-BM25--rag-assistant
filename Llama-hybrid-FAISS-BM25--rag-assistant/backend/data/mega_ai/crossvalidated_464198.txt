Can we use the results achieved in forecasting after employing min-max normalization on data?

I am working on time series forecasting with univariate data. After applying min-max normalization, I am getting results in terms of Mean Error , Root Mean Square Error etc, less than 1 of course and close to zero. If we are to accept the results as it is, it gives us accuracy closer to 100%. But I am confused, can we use those results as it is? Kindly guide.
