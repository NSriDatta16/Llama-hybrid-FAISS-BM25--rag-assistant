You are on a good track. Content-based filtering (recommending items similar to other items the user liked) is a valid and common way of doing recommendations. Collaborative filtering won't work for one user, because it needs data from multiple users (hence “collaborative” in the name). It produces the “other people who liked X also liked Y” recommendations. Association rules could be one of the next steps to improve the recommendations. However, unless you want to recommend the same items multiple times, you would need to have data from other users to make it work. For a single user, content-based filtering is the only algorithm that would work out of the box. It can be improved by finding better ways to find “similar” items (e.g. use a language model to create embeddings from the names of the products as additional features). You could also use external data, for example, if you recommended movies, you could use an algorithm trained on the public IMDB data.
