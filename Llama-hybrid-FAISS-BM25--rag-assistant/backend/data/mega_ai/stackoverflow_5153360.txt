You need to store the entire values what you required in a Dataset when you retrieve at first, and later setting the Report viewer's source to the Dataset. The values present in the Dataset can be loaded to the Report view by going, Database Expert --> Create New Connection --> Connect to the Server and on right clicking add a new Command, after adding the command the every column you have given in the Command will appear, so you can display them by dragging and dropping from the Field Explorer to the Report Viewer. Hope it will help you.
