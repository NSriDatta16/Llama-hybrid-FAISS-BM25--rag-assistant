p-values from frequency table?

I am doing a data science practice project, seeing if there is any correlation between crime and moon phase. I have created some frequency tables of crime numbers along with moon phase and it looks like there is no relationship, but how do I show this statistically? Here is a summary of all the data with moon phase from r: # A tibble: 4 Ã— 4 moon num freq 1 New 463776 0.2512627 2 Waxing 462739 0.2507009 3 Full 459885 0.2491547 4 Waning 459381 0.2488816 And an example grouped by crime category: Category moon num freq 1 Extortion New 167 0.279732 2 Extortion Waxing 119 0.199330 3 Extortion Full 143 0.239531 4 Extortion Waning 168 0.281407 p-values seem the right way to go with a null hypothesis that there is no difference between moon phases, but what method should I use to get them? Thanks
