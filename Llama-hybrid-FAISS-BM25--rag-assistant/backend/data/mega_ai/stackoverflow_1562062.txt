Cocoa-Touch, Core Data: Getting exception when trying to insertNewObjectForEntityForName:inManagedObjectContext:

I'm following this how-to to implement Core Data storage in my app: I have a Model.xcdatamodel which defines a Something model. I've used XCode to generate a class for that model. I've imported the class in my .m file where I'm trying to: Something* s = (Something *)[NSEntityDescription insertNewObjectForEntityForName:@"Something" inManagedObjectContext:managedObjectContext]; But this causes the following error: 2009-10-13 21:18:11.961 w9a[4840:20b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason: '+entityForName: could not locate an NSManagedObjectModel for entity name 'Something'' Am I missing something?
