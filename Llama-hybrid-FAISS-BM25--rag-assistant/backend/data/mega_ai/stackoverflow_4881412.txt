Accessing a 2D array between two friend classes

My question is how to access and modify a 2D array defined in one class that is friends with another class. Below are some details on my question: In class A I declare and allocate the appropriate space for my 2D array (pointer-to-pointer) u. Class A { public: friend class B; long double **u; int fun; void make(); }; void A::make() { long double **u = new long double *[nx]; for (int i=0;i Class A is friends with Class B ; I need to use the array I declared in Class A in a function defined in class B . Below is my Class B: class B { public: void get(A*); }; void B::get(A *pt) { using namespace std; cout fun; cout u[0][0]; } I get a Bus error on my second cout pt->u[0][0] . Is there a simple way to use this setup I have to access my u[][] array? I think that I get the error because the pointer points to the 1st entry of my array, thus my whole 2D array is saved in memory as a single row (thinking aloud here). I'm a Fortran guy so this stuff is a little new to me. Any help or "pointers" to other helpful threads would be appreciated. Thank you ! Alberto
