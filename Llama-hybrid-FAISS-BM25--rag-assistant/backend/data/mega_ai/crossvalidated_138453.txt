I mean if it violate some assumptions of the test Certainly it violates assumptions, because any machine that crops up in both samples will have scores for the two measures that are dependent (due to the impact of the unobserved $s_i$), when there is an explicit assumption is of independence . This will impact the behavior of the test. If so, which is the advantage of using Wilcoxon signed-rank test instead of Mann-Whitney U test? If dependence is substantial, the true significance level of the rank-sum test may be severely impacted (simulation in the case of paired data indicates the effect can be quite strong). By contrast, the signed rank test is designed for the situation, and it has better power in the presence of dependence (I'd guess largely due to the fact that its significance level isn't pushed down). If the dependence is low (e.g overlapping samples with very small overlap), it won't matter so much. If you do have overlapping samples and you know which ones are paired, you could separate into "paired" and "independent" subsets, apply signed rank to the paired and rank-sum to the unpaired and combine the two p-values (say via Fisher's method). If you have the option, take advantage of the pairing, and use all-paired data. What exactly does the p-value mean in the case of the Wilcoxon signed-rank test? The same as what it means for any other hypothesis test. See the second sentence of the second paragraph here [the] p-value is the probability of obtaining the observed sample results, or a "more extreme" result, when assuming the null hypothesis is actually true
