Comparing odds ratio of sample to odds ratio of population?

How would one compare the odds ratio of a sample to that of the odds ratio of its source population? For instance: I have child murder records/data from mortuaries for a geographical area (my "population"). Let's say I use a regression model (e.g. Poisson) with a regressor variable: race of child (black vs white), and I calculate that odds of child being black is 1.14 vs white. Now I do the same exercise but for newspaper coverage in the same geographical area and time period, and end up with odds of black child murder being reported is 0.74. If I theoretically subtract the crime coverage OR (0.74) from the epidemiological OR (1.14),I should get an estimate of media undereporting. But given that my two samples are dependant and non-parametric, how would I go about doing this?
