I appreciate everyone's responses and I'm sure your solutions are much more elegant, faster, and actually correct (still in the process of working through your link @sebastian_h). In the meantime, keeping AutoPostBack="true" in the first DDL and adding to the updatePanel started working. I must have changed some other setting in my last attempt at adding the target. Thanks again!
