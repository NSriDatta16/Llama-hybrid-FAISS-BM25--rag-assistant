With logistic regression you analyse the association of a binary outcome with a set of predictors. In particular you are modelling the $\log(\text{odds})$ of that particular outcome. The odds themselves are simply: $\text{odds} = \frac{\text{Pr(of Occurring)}}{\text{Pr(of Not Occurring)}} = \frac{\text{Pr(of Occurring)}}{1 - \text{Pr(of Occurring)}}$ where $\text{Pr}$ refers to proportions (or loosely speaking probability). Therefore the estimated coefficient $\hat{\beta}$ in your model shows the difference in $\log(\text{odds})$ between two subjects that differ by one unit of your predictor (here: hours ) when all other predictors are constant (or as in your case just absent). To find the change in terms of the proportions that are modelled you need to: Get the $\log(\text{odds})$ estimate. Exponentiate it to get the $\text{odds}$. Get the new proportions as: $\text{Pr}_{\text{new}} = \frac{\text{odds}}{1 + \text{odds}} $. (This follows from the equality shown above.)
