What direction should we go for maintaining a document management system?

We've built an application on top of ASP.NET MVC. We now need to allow our users to manage their documents online. As part of this system, users want to upload and share documents with other members of their organization. We have an existing web application that needs this functionality as a value add. We are trying to find out what our options are to accommodate this need. We are ultimately looking for a back end solution that will help us with a lot of the grunt work associated with version control. Access to documents still need to be maintained through our domain model, and web user interface. We need to be able to... upload documents see the version history of each document perform full text search calculate file size We're considering: building our own domain model, and storing documents in a database integrating with subversion to use it as our back end. Which approach has worked for you? What are some of the benefits and drawbacks for each? Are there any other alternatives? The solution that we choose needs to abide by the following criteria: needs to fit nicely into our automated deployments. we need to be able to run the application on our local developer machines, without needing a connection to a separate server we would like something light weight, and easy to upgrade & deploy
