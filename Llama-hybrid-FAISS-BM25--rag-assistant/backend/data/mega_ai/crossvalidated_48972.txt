You need a to specify a model that separates the signal from the noise. There is the component of noise at the measurement level that you assume gaussian. The other components, dependent across measurements: "This noise, for a fixed frequency, can probably be modelled as random with gaussian distribution". Needs clarification â€” is the noise component common to all timepoints, given the frequency? Is the standard deviation same for all frequencies? Etc. "At a fixed time, however, the data shows a different kind of noise, with large spurious spikes and fast oscillations" How do you separate that from the signal, for assumably you are interested on variation of the intensity across the frequency. Is the interesting variation somehow different from the uninteresting variation, and if so, how? Spurious oscillatioins or non-gaussian noise in general is not a big problem, if you have a realistic idea of its characteristics. It can be modeled by transforming the data (and then using a gaussian model) or by explicitly using a non-gaussian error distribution. Modeling noise that is correlated over measurements is more challenging. Depending on how your noise and data model are, you might be able to model the data with a general-purpose tool like the GAMs in the mgcv package, or you may need a more flexible tool, which easily leads to a quite customized bayesian setup. There are tools for such models, but if you are not a statistician, learning to use them will take a while. I guess either a solution specific to spectral analysis or the mgcv package are your best bets.
