A square seems like a good candidate since you are not worried about instances with more than four vehicles. I would take the average location of all vehicles in "overlapping" proximity, and set this as the "center" of the square, with length and width sufficently large that putting a vehicle on each corner will not result in any overlap. Then I would start with vehicle 0 at the top left and work my way around the corners of the square counter clockwise, adding the next vehicle to the next corner. Simple, and effective, you lose some accuracy, assuming thats OK (from your post it seems it is?) this is what I woul do.
