A simple discriminative classifier should train in seconds and generalize well after tuning l1 and l2 regularization parameters on a dataset of this size. There is no need to do dimensionality reduction. If you still needed to do dimensionality reduction for whatever reason, you could use random projections, independent components analysis, autoencoders, or any number of nonlinear techniques which work well in the absence of obvious linear relationships on the data.
