Help with PHP arrays and foreach

Hey guys. I'm building a simple blog and have my data returning from my database in an array. I want to show the comments associated with each blog post but I'm not sure how to organize this in a loop. This is my array: Array ( [author] => Administrator [post] => Testing entry number one [entry_date] => Fri, 23 Oct 2009 [commenter] => Sally Anderson [comments] => comment 1 post 1 [comment_date] => October 24th, 2009 at 5:24 AM [blog_id] => 1 ) Array ( [author] => Administrator [post] => Testing entry number two [entry_date] => Sat, 24 Oct 2009 [commenter] => Sally Anderson [comments] => comment 1 post 2 [comment_date] => October 24th, 2009 at 5:21 AM [blog_id] => 2 ) Array ( [author] => Administrator [post] => Testing entry number one [entry_date] => Fri, 23 Oct 2009 [commenter] => Mike [comments] => comment 2 post 1 [comment_date] => October 24th, 2009 at 5:21 AM [blog_id] => 1 ) Array ( [author] => Administrator [post] => Testing entry number two [entry_date] => Sat, 24 Oct 2009 [commenter] => Mike [comments] => comment 2 post 2 [comment_date] => October 24th, 2009 at 5:21 AM [blog_id] => 2 ) Notice that each post repeats based on the number of comments associated with it. In this particular case this array has 2 comments associated with each post. Could someone please help me write a foreach loop that will output 2 posts with the correct comments for each one? Thanks! Maybe I'm not explaining well enough. Here is what I am looking for. Array ( [author] => Administrator [post] => Testing entry number one [entry_date] => Fri, 23 Oct 2009 [commenter] => Sally Anderson [comments] => **[0] => Array ( comment 1 post 1 comment 2 post 1 )** [comment_date] => October 24th, 2009 at 5:24 AM [blog_id] => 1 )
