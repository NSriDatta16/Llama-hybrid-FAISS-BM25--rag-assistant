calculate Mean from means of different sizes

So, I have multiple lists of data of different sizes. I'm calculating the average of each list. So, I have the average of each list with the total number of elements in that list. Now I need to calculate the average of all lists. Is there a correct way to do this? I know that adding up the averages and dividing on the number of lists is correct only if all the lists are of the same size.
