Time Series Regression: serially correlated errors vs autocorrelation of residuals?

If I have a time series regression model with serially correlated errors: $Y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1X_t+\epsilon_t$ $\epsilon_t=\rho\epsilon_{t-1}+v_t$ why is the estimate of the correlation ($\rho$) in the second equation NOT the autocorrelation of the residuals from the first equation? The autocorrelation of the residuals ( from the first equation using OLS regression ) is easy to get, BUT the rho is estimated with more difficulty [e.g. nonlinear least squares]. But I'm not following why.
