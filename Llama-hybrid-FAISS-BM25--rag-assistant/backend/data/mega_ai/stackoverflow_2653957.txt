You might find evolutionary computing approaches to machine learning a little less front-loaded with heavy-duty maths, approaches such as ant-colony optimisation or swarm intelligence. I think you should put to one side, if you hold it as your question kind of suggests you do, the view that machine learning is trying to simulate what goes on in the brains of animals (including Homo Sapiens ). A lot of the maths in modern machine learning arises from its basis in pattern recognition and matching; some of it comes from attempts to represent what is learnt as quasi-mathematical statements; some of it comes from the need to use statistical methods to compare different algorithms and approaches. And some of it comes because some of the leading practitioners come from scientific and mathematical backgrounds rather than computer science backgrounds, and they bring their toolset with them when they come. And I'm very surprised that you are suprised that machine learning involves a lot of computation since the long history of AI has proven that it is extremely difficult to build machines which (seem to) think.
