Stop using TStringList for everything. TStringList is not a general purpose datastructure for effective storage and handling of everything from simple to complex types. Look for alternatives. I use Delphi Container and Algorithm Library (DeCAL, formerly known as SDL). Julians EZDSL should also be a good alternative.
