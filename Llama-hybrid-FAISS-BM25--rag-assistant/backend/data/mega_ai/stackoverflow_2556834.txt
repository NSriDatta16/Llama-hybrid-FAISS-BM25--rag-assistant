When interfacing with a database, you're far better off with a complex and ugly query than with an 'elegant' query which has you duplicating database search functionality inside your application. Each call to the database has a cost associated with it. If you write code to search a database within your application, it's virtually guaranteed to be more expensive. Unless you are actually writing a database (tall order), let the database do the searching.
