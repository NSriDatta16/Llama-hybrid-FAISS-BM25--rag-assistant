An even better way is to use a control that supports decimals (if that is you're using something like infragistics, componentone, devexpress, etc.) The user gets visual cues and can do neat things like click the arrows to advance the numbers. If you're using plain old winforms, have a look at the masked edit control. Personally I find it HUGELY irritating when applications try to correct me and i'm not done entering data. It's much more user friendly to let the user finish and then notify them if there are any problems.
