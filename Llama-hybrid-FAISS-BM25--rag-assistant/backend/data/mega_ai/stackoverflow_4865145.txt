Apple seems to discuss the "inconsistency" you're experiencing here: http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/EventHandling/Conceptual/EventHandlingiPhoneOS/MotionEvents/MotionEvents.html Under listing 4-2 it reads: ... However, there is one important difference between touch events and shaking-motion events. When the user starts shaking the device, the system sends a motion event to the first responder in a motionBegan:withEvent: message; if the first responder doesnâ€™t handle the event, it travels up the responder chain. If the shaking lasts less than a second or so, the system sends a motionEnded:withEvent: message to the first responder. But if the shaking lasts longer or if the system determines the motion is not a shake, the first responder receives a motionCancelled:withEvent: message. I would suggest adding a motionCancelled:withEvent callback to see if that's what's happening in those cases where you don't get a motionEnded call.
