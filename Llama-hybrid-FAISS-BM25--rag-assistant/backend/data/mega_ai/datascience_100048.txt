Did DeepBlue use machine learning?

Did IBM's DeepBlue, which defeated a human player in chess in 1997, use machine learning? I am a bit confused by this article that says that it is AI, but not ML. Whereas this article says it is AI and to some extent ML. Is it the case of an algorithm that is AI but not ML?
