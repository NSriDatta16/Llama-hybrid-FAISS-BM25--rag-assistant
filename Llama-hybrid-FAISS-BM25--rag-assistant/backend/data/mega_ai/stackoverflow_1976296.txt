Stumped. (C#, JSP)

So long story short, the company I work for, that is all about saving money, went from 1 service application, to 2 service web interfaces. They're not secure, have no cert's, not even over SSL...yet, they have a timeout associated with each interface. Which then breaks the page you're viewing, and you have to refresh IE, and then proceed to login again, and reset your dropdowns etc... So. I've tried using a generic webbrowser interface in C# to have a foundation in which I can refresh the connection to the server with the page open, as to avert the timeout. But, first attempt results in my app, going to the appropriate page, then opening a new IE window when a service ticket is opened, and there must be a lack of cached data, which results in the new IE window that opens, to revert back to the main page which prompts me to login. The interfaces are Jsp, but I'm more familiar with c#... Tried catching link clicks to navigate the destination in the current window, but it seems that the data you double click that prompts the new page to open, is merely a data in a table, and not technically a "link".... I've brought this to the attention of management, but like most huge corporations, I know nothing, and they never have to deal with it, so as they say in every meeting, "silence means compliance".... Any thoughts?
