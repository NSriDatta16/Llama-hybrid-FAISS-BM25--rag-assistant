Why do browser vendors make their own css properties?

Why do browser vendors make their own css properties, even they know these properties will not pass the w3c validation before approved and added by w3c? What is the purpose? Is for their own testing, or for web developers, or to demonstrate browser capabilities to the world and to the W3C organizations and to CSS development team of W3C? is it like a beta version of demonstration? if i use any browser specific for now can they remove that property's support from future versions.will i have to edit my css in future For example: https://developer.mozilla.org/en/CSS_Reference/Mozilla_Extensions
