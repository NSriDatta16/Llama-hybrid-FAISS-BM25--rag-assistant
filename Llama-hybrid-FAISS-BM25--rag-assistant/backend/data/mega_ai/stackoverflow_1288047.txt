IE7 jQuery Sortable bug?

I'm trying to create a 3 column page with jQuery where users can move boxes between the three columns (something simular to iGoogle). In firefox and safari the dragging works perfectly fine. In IE7, once you drag a box once it works fine but then that box cannot be moved after that. I've tried re-applying the jQuery Sortable plugin to any moved box again but it doesn't seem to be working. Any ideas anyone? Here's the code: http://www.marksblogg.com/dragging/
