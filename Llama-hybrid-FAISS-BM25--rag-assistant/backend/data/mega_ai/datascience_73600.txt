Logistic regression is a standard method of performing binary classification , which matches your task here. Categorical variables can be dealt with, depending on the model you choose. You can see from the Scikit-Learn documentation on logistic regression , that your data only really needs to be of a certain shape: (num_samples, num_features) . It might ignore the columns that are non-numerical, so you should convert e.g. strings to class IDs (e.g. integers) - see below. Computing the correlation can make sense for categorical values, but to compute these, you need to provide numerical values; strings like "bbc.com" or "US" won't work. You can map each of the values to a numerical value and make a new column with that data using pd.factorize like this: df["Country_id"] = pd.factorize(df.Country)[0] # taking the first return element: the ID values df["Name_id"] = pd.factorize(df.Name)[0] You don't need to do it really for the approved and political columns, because they hold boolean values, which are seen by Python as 0 and 1 for False and True , respectively. Now you can do something like this to see a correlation plot: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # plotting library: pip install matplotlib # compute the correlation matrix corr_mat = df[["Name_id", "Country_id", "approved", "political"]].corr() # plot it plt.matshow(corr_mat) plt.show()
