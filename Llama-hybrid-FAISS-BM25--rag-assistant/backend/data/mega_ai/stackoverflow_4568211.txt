Problem with Auto Complete Concept in Symfony

I am working on a Symfony application that works mainly with form submissions and our team needed extreme customisation on validations therefore we chose to not use the forms helper and widgets. Now each form has an action method for submission and retrieval. In between one of those forms I need an auto fill but I don't know how I should send this to a new action method on the keyup event and return data from there. I am completely unable to return the data from there I have checked using Firebug. I have found articles that submit the whole form for a search auto fill. I can't do that because my auto fill field is not the only one on the form. It's a city field which I have to give suggestions on. I am expected to use the jQuery framework. Please help. Moreover I don't understand the AJAX concept in Symfony very well. It would be really helpful if you could link me to some good articles. Appreciate all the help. Thanks a lot.
