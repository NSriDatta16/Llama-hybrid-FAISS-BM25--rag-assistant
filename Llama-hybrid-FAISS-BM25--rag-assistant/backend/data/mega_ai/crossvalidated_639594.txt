PERMANOVA with vegan (adonis) for three factors and repeated measures?

I have three factors (Status, Time.Point, Treatment) each with 2 levels. Time.Point factor is "before" and "after" (the repeated measures). The data is unbalanced though (e.g. some before sample with no matching after) I want to know if there are main effects of any of the three factors and if there are any interactions between Status:Treatment, Status:Time.Point, and Status:Treatment:Time.Point. Here is what I have so far: perm_design Questions: would the block in perm_design be Sample.ID or should it be Time.Point as I am blocking around Time.Point? EDIT: nevermind- it should be Time.Point and i have edited this in the code. I have set by=margin because I don't want the order to matter but obviously when I include an interaction term it just computes that. So to get around this, do I run this again and again for each interaction term (i.e. just for Status:Treatment, Status:Time.Point, and Status:Treatment:Time.Point)? Is that a valid approach? I absolutely want to avoid fishing for results but I don't know how else to do this.
