You can find the answer here page 42 Otherwise, if this is self-study here are the steps: 1) Look for an inner-product: $K (x, y) = trace(x^Tyx^Ty)$ ... 2) Propose a candidate RKHS $f(x) = \sum_i a_i K(x_i,x)...$ 3) Check that the candidate is a Hilbert space 4) Check that $\mathcal{H}$ is the RKHS
