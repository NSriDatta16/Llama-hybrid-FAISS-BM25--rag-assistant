I think what you are looking for is either getAssets().open("thefilename.xml") or getAssets().openFd("thefilename.xml") depending on what the end use of the file is. You can see from Dianne's response in this post awhile back that openXmlResourceParser() is not really usable just to gain access to files in the assets/ directory: http://goo.gl/2KfgT From there you will have a stream that you could feed into a SAXParser or do whatever else you choose. Side Note: On the points you mentioned you really can't edit files directly in assets/ or add new files to assets/ at runtime. You will need to work with files on either internal or external storage to do those things. You probably already knew that, but I thought I'd mention it. Hope that Helps!
