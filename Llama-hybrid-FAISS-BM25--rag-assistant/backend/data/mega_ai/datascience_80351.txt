Before we could begin to predict, we need a bit more information on the kind of customer activity you're talking about. Domain information is key in any ML task. That would also help us identify if there is any autocorrelation between the previous months activity and the next months. If there is no autocorrelation then the time series becomes stochastic and there is no predictive analysis that can be done here without introducing any other features. If there is correlation and seasonality, maybe we could look into training a SARIMA model on your data.
