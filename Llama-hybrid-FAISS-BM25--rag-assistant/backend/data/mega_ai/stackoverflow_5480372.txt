What's the best way to update an ObservableCollection from another thread?

I am using the BackgroundWorker to update an ObservableCollection but it gives this error: "This type of CollectionView does not support changes to its SourceCollection from a thread different from the Dispatcher thread." What's the best and most elegant way to solve this, with the least amount of work. I don't want to write low level lock-based multi-threading code. I have seen some solutions online but they are several years old, so not sure what the latest consensus is for the solution of this problem.
