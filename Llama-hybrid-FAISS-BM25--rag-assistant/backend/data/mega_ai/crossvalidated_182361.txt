In SVM you can assign a misclassification penalty per class. The most effective way to deal with unbalanced data sets is to increase the misclassification penalty on the minority class. Your class skew is not that large, so this approach will work fine. This functionality is available in LIBSVM, which is the most popular back-end for all SVM libraries. Hence, you should be able to do this.
