There is no reason at all not to re-invent the wheel. Seriously. This is one of the best ways to learn. Take an honest run at it, take surface looks at other implementations. Once you arrive at either a) a beta that does what you want or b) a deep dark corner where there be dragons - pull and read the source for an existing implementation. Not only will you have a better perspective for appreciating the code, you will understand better why some things are done certain ways. There is no reason at all not to re-invent the wheel.
