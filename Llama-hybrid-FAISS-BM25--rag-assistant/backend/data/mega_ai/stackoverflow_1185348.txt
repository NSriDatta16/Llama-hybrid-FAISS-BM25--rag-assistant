As a general rule, any identifier that starts with an underscore is a vendor-specific extension or an implementation detail. So _Get_container() is just an addition made by Microsoft because it simplified their implementation. It is not intended to be used. As for where to find the documentation, it's split into several parts. The authoritative source is, of course, the language standard. As Neil Butterworth said, there are draft copies available for free online (which are still very useful. The differences from those to the final version are really minimal). Alternatively, you can buy a copy. It should be available from whichever organization represents ISO in your country (and probably from a bajillion other sources as well). The document you're looking for is ISO/IEC 14882:2003 Programming Language C++ . (14882 is the standard number. 2003 is the year of the last revision. If you come across the 1998 version, you can use that too. The differences are really ridiculously small between the two, and basically just amounts to a few clarifications. It's probably best to stay away from the drafts for C++0x, as the changes there are far more extensive) Apart from that, every implementation of the standard library is required to document a large number of details (implementation-defined behavior, things which are not specified in the standard, but is left up to the library implementer). And in addition, most of them also put up a detailed documentation of the entire library as well. Microsoft has detailed documentation available on MSDN . The documentation respects the standard, and clearly marks all nonstandard extensions so you know which is which. SGI also has the documentation online (although it is older and in some cases, not entirely accurate). IBM has similar documentation available on their website, and I believe GCC does too.
