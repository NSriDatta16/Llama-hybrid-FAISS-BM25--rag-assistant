What are the key differences/drawbacks to be aware of if I am running a cox regression vs a logistic regression controlling for survival time?

A few times people have auggested to me to run a log reg with survival time as a covariate in place of a cox proportional hazards analysis. I am sure this has drawbacks but I am not sure what they might be. Anyone have an idea? When would you use one instead of the other?
