How to export and import an XSD file in Visual Studio?

How do i export and import an XSD in visual studio? I simply tried to do a copy-and-paste an xsd file into a new project and VS2008 automatically created some wrapper classes for it. When i tried to add a query to a table in VS, I get an error that the connection strings are broken. I slightly fixed that by inserting the proper connection string to app.config but i still get errors related to the connection string. My question is not how to fix this connection string but how do i just properly export and import connection string? is there a wizard I can use? Thanks Update #2 This XSD file that I'm using was created by using VS studio by dragging and dropping tables using this tutorial http://www.asp.net/learn/data-access/tutorial-01-cs.aspx . I copied this XSD file and pasted it into a new project and VS automatically generated code for it, which in this case a "typed dataset". In this new project, when i tried to add a query to a table in the XSD file (using the tutorial I mentioned before), I got an error stating that the connection string 'xxxxxxxxx' does not exist (im paraphrasing). This 'xxxxxxxxx' connection string exists only in the project where i copied the XSD file from and not in the new project. Therefore, this xsd contains information dependent on the web.config, specifically it's connection strings. So coping and pasting this XSD file does not work. I was hoping there was a wizard export tool that would strip away the depending information (ie: connection string) and its associated settings so that i could properly add it to another project and add a query to a table without errors. I hope that makes sense...
