The application bundle will, by default, only be writable by the owner (if it's installed by dragging into the Applications folder, this'll be whoever installed it; if it's installed by a .pkg, it should probably be root). The way you're doing this, if I follow it properly, requires a user to have write access to the app's Contents/Resources folder, which is a really bad idea (not that it's unheard of -- see the University of Utah's documentation about "Poorly-Made Applications" for examples). Actually, saving preferences inside the application is a bad idea anyway; that's what the various Library/Preferences folders are for (~/Library/Preferences for personal settings, /Library/Preferences for system-wide settings. But, of course, /Library/Preferences is only writable by admins (for very good reasons). I don't really know of a good way to handle this, as system-wide settings modifiable by non-admins is not exactly normal.
