Have a look at : https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/complete-tutorial-learn-data-science-python-scratch-2/ This has a step by step tutorial which will give you an idea of the entire process of Data Exploration, Data Analysis and Building a predictive model. Explanation regarding Data Exploration and Feature Engineering ( how to choose relevant features ) is here : https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/01/guide-data-exploration/ See the first 5 Datasets here which have tutorials and work on them to get practical experience: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2016/10/17-ultimate-data-science-projects-to-boost-your-knowledge-and-skills/ Also have a look at : http://machinelearningmastery.com/machine-learning-in-python-step-by-step/ where he uses multiple models on a single dataset which will give you a basic level understanding of different models. For understanding more about the model selection have a look at this : https://www.quora.com/Data-Science-How-do-Data-Scientists-perform-model-selection The above link has answers given by people working in the field. To get insights on different datasets you can always log into kaggle and go through competitions and have a look at the wide range of datasets, where you have access to people's code in kernels. The forums in Kaggle are helpful as people discuss about using different models for a problems and their approach. https://www.kaggle.com/
