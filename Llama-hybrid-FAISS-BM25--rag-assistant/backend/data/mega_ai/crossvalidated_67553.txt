Suppose we take ordinal values, e.g. 1 for strongly disagree, 2 for disagree, 3 for agree, and 4 for strongly agree. If four people give the responses 1,2,3 and 4, then what would be the mean? It is (1+2+3+4)/4=2.50. How should that be interpreted, when the four person average response is "disagree or agree"? That's why we should not use mean for ordinal data.
