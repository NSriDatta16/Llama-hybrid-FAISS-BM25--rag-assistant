As far as I can tell, in a binary “classification” model, the outcome is conditionally Bernoulli, end of discussion. Thus, it does not seem like there are any distributional assumptions to make. The binary model still needs to make assumptions about the relationship between the Bernoulli distribution parameter $p$ and the regressor/predictor variables, and this relationship can be a misspecification. The distribution that is considered is not just the binary class variable $Y$ , but also the regressor/predictor variable $X$ and the distributional assumptions are not only about $Y$ , but about the joint distribution $Y,X$ . See for example the situation below where a logistic regression without a quadratic term wouldn't be able to correctly fit the true probability. So interpreting the obtained fit as an estimate of the conditional probability $\hat{p}|X = f(X)$ does not need to relate to the true probability $p|X = P(class = 1| X)$ and is not only subject to statistical noise, but also to bias. The article proposes to estimate $\hat{p}$ seperately from the logistic regression.
