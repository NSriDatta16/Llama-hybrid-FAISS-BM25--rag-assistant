No degrees of freedom in LR rest of multinomial logistic regression

Possible Duplicate: Likelihood Ratio Testing in Multinomial logistic regression using SPSS I am doing multinomial logistic regression. Dependent variable is categorical with 6 categories. 15 Independent variables are measured on an interval scale (included as covariates in SPSS) Now I am watching the LR test. None of the independent variables have a chi-square value and no degrees of freedom are shown, so significance is not specified. (except for the constant, which is significant and has 5 df's). When I omit one IV in the model, there are chisquare values, df's and significance values for the independent variables. Was the first model over-parametrised or something? what is the explanation for this situation? And is it valid to omit one independent variable in the model?
