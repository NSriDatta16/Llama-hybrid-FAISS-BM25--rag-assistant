I'm not 100% sure what you're asking, but if it's what I think it is, the answer is that you can't have your cake and eat it too. It seems that you've moved jQuery to the button of the page but have some elements of the page that you want to use JavaScript on, but don't want to wait for document.ready for all of the? Maybe something like the following? ... /* javascript goes here that uses jquery for the above menu (or whatever) AND you don't want to wait for document.ready for this to happen */ ... If that's the case, then refer to what I said from the get-go. You'll have to move jQuery (at least the library, not necessarily all your other JavaScript) back to the top of the page. Either that or don't us jQuery for the things you don't want to wait for document.ready for. Edit: If you want to perform actions based on the page that you are, then there are two methods, each better and more preferable then the last. Use location.pathname to determine what functionality you need. Organize your JavaScript into separate, modular files by their functionality and include only those that are needed for the specific page.
