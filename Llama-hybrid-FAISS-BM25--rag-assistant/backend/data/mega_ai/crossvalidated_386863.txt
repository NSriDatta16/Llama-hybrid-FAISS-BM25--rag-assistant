For WGAN paper these are needed: Optimal transport problem statement: Given two probability measures $\mu, \nu$ on compact $X, Y$ , $c: X \times Y \to \mathbb{R}^+$ continuous find $$p \in P_{\mu, \nu}$$ that minimizes $$Ec = \int c(x,y) dp(x,y)$$ where $P_{\mu, \nu} = \{$ probability measure on $X \times Y$ with marginals $\mu, \nu \}$ Optimal transport problem has a solution * Kantorovich duality (general) $$\inf_{c \in P_{\mu, \nu}} Ec = \sup_{f, g \in L^1} \int f d\mu + \int g d\nu$$ Kantorovich duality when $c$ is a metric on $X$ (in this case $X=Y$ ): $$\inf_{c \in P_{\mu, \nu}} Ec = \sup_{f, g} \int f d\mu - \int f d\nu$$ where the $sup$ range is over 1-Lipschitz functions on $X$ . WGAN paper The authors use second form of Lipschitz duality. The $f$ is output of the discriminator, and it is guaranteed to be $d$ -Lipschitz because of weight clipping **. * - The set of $p$ that satisfy constraint on marginals is tight, and from Prokhorov's theorem it follows that it's precompact, and in fact it's also closed, thus it is compact, so $E$ attains infimum on $P_{\mu, \nu}$ . ** - weight clipping makes weight space $\Theta$ compact, and the space of possible discriminator $f$ s is parametrized continuously by this space, so function $$\Theta \to \mathbb{R}^+$$ $$\theta \to \inf \{d \in \mathbb{R}^+| f_{\theta}\ is\ d-Lipschitz\}$$ Attains its minimum. Books I've checked out two Villani's books: Optimal Transport: Old and New (the one I mentioned) Topics in Optimal Transportation Personally I found that second one has better pace - it gets to Kantorovich duality almost right away (in 1st chapter), and it is really good for getting intuition, as it first sketches the needed proofs, and fills in details later.
