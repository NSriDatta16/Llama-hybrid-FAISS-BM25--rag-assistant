Elegant ways of displaying a GridView with lots of columns (ASP.NET)

just a general design question that I'd like to hear some of your opinions on. I am designing a system for a client, and I'm using GridView' a lot. They need a lot of columns to be displayed in some of these, and I've had to resort to using a panel with a horizontal scrollbar. This presents some issues - keeping track of which row is which is difficult, even with alternating row colours, and it's generally pretty ugly. How have you dealt with these issues before? Are there any sort of AJAX controls that could help, so some data could be only displayed on hover or such? Or any other general ideas.
