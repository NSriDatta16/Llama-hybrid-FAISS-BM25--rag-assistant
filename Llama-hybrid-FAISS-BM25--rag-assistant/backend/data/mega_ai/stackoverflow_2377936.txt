By no means a complete coverage of Perl 6 PCRE's grammar, but it's a start: https://github.com/bkiers/PCREParser EDIT A bit of a late update, I know, but it may be of interest to future visitors of this Q&A. I've updated the grammar to conform more closely to the PCRE specs . Before delving in the code on Github, you can give the generated parser a test on the page: pcreparser.appspot.com
