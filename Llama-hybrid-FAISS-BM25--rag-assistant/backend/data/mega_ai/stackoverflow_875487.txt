For an artifical measurement: Create a blank filesystem on its own block device (e.g. vmware scsi etc) Mount it, call sync(), then record the number of IOPS present on that block dev. Run your test program against the filesystem, and do no further operations (not even "ls"). Wait until all unflushed blocks have been flushed - say about 1 minute or so Snapshot the iops count again Of course this is highly unrealistic, because if you created two files rather than one, you'd probably find that there were less than twice as many. Also creating empty or blank files is unrealistic - as they don't do anything useful. Directory structures (how deep the directories are, how many entries) might contribute, but also how fragmented it is and other arbitrary factors.
