For something similar I have used Google Gadgets, which are very simple to create because you can use javascript with the API Google provides. I wrote this post in my blog http://maricel-tech.blogspot.com/2008/11/how-to-create-google-gadget.html on how to create a google gadget that displays the news from CNN, it is a little outdated since Google changed their APIs, however the logic is the same you would just need to change the google method calls to use the new ones. The example in the post reads the RSS feeds from CNN news and displays as a list the title and description of each article, in your case you would need to add some more logic to add the extra functionality you need, but I think you can find what you need in the Google API for gadgets.
