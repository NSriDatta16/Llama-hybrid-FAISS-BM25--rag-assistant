There's nothing clever to be done here (pseudocode only, since this smells like HW): for each entry in the matrix: add the entry to a running sum compare the entry to a running min if it's smaller, it's the new running min compare the entry to a running max if it's larger, it's the new running max average is the sum divided by the number of entries You can micro-optimize that loop to make it more or less efficient, but there's nothing you can do algorithmically to be more clever. You need to look at all i*j entries no matter what.
