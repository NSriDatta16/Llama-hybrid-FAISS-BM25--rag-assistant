IIRC Fudforum used the file-storage for speed reasons, it can be a lot faster to grab a file than to search a DB index, retrieve the data from the DB and send it to the user. You're trading the filesystem interface with the DB and DB-library interfaces. However, that doesn't mean it will be faster or slower. I think you'll find writing is quicker on the filesystem, but reading faster on the DB for general issues. If, like fudforum, you have relatively immutable data that you want to show several posts in one, then a file-basd approach may be a lot faster: eg they don't have to search for every related post, they stick it all in 1 text file and display it once. If you can employ that kind of optimisation, then your file-based approach will work. Also, mail servers work in the file-based approach too, the Maildir format stores each email message as a file in a directory, not in a database. one thing I would say though, you'll be better storing everything in 1 file, not 3. The filesystem is better at reading (and caching) a single file than it is with multiple ones. So if you want to store each message as 3 parts, save them all in a single file, read it to get any of the parts and just display the one you want to show.
