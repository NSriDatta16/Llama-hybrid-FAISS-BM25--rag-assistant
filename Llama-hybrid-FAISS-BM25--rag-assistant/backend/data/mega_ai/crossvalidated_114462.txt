We need to make assumptions to convert a time series from quarterly to monthly. Sometimes, one must transform a series from quarterly to monthly since one must have the same frequency across all variables to run a regression. In Economics, it is common to use the cubic spline interpolation to convert quarterly data into monthly. Let's assume that we have n quarterly data points, which implies n - 1 spaces between them. Across each space, we draw a unique 3rd-degree polynomial connecting two points. If you are conducting your analysis in excel, you can do this: http://newtonexcelbach.wordpress.com/2009/07/02/cubic-splines/ There is a package in R that performs the cubic spline interpolation. http://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/splinefun.html If you plan to use the data with cubic splines in a regression, be careful with autocorrelation in the residuals. In this case, it is recommend to use the Newey-West standard errors as they are robust against the autocorrelation caused by the cubic splines.
