If you place the first quote in the broader context of what's being discussed, the meaning can be discerned. It's in a section titled Regression with time series data ; the term is mentioned here: An alternative approach is to use genuine forecasts for the predictor variable. For example, a pure time series based approach can be used to generate forecasts for the predictor variable In that context a "pure time series model" is one not including external predictors. That is, the model for $y_t$ depends on $x_t$ , but when it comes to forecasting $y_{n+1}$ (say), you need a value for $x_{n+1}$ ; so it, too must be predicted. An ARMA model for $x$ would be an example of a 'pure time series' model. Looking at your second link, again, the context in which it occurs gives us the clue. The question itself discusses trying to measure the impact of external variables ("the effectiveness of my sales campaign" and "the impact of competitors"). A pure time series model doesn't have those additional variables, just the series itself, as with the AR(1) model mentioned there.
