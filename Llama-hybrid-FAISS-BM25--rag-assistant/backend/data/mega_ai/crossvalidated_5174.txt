Let's start with the spurious regression. Take or imagine two series which are both driven by a dominant time trend: for example US population and US consumption of whatever (it doesn't matter what item you think about, be it soda or licorice or gas). Both series will be growing because of the common time trend. Now regress aggregate consumption on aggregate population size and presto, you have a great fit. (We could simulate that quickly in R too.) But it means nothing. There is no relationship (as we as the modelers know) -- yet the linear model sees a fit (in the minimizing sum of squares sense) as both series happen to both be uptrending without a causal link. We fell victim to a spurious regression. What could or should be modeled is change in one series on change in the other, or maybe per capita consumption, or ... All those changes make the variables stationary which helps to alleviate the issue. Now, from 30,000 feet, unit roots and cointegration help you with formal inference in these case by providing rigorous statistical underpinning ( Econometrica publications and a Nobel don't come easily) where none was available. As for question in good resources: it's tricky. I have read dozens of time series books, and most excel at the math and leave the intuition behind. There is nothing like Kennedy's Econometrics text for time series. Maybe Walter Enders text comes closest. I will try to think of some more and update here. Other than books, software for actually doing this is important and R has what you need. The price is right too.
