Here is the ugly Xpath 1.0 solution:- sub[number((substring-before(@time, ':')) * 60 + number(substring-after(@time, ':'))) &gt; 959][1] Note 959 = 15 * 60 + 59 which I'm sure you can do in your calling code. Give that node the previous node can be accessed as:- preceding-sibling::sub[1] However a pragmatic, common sense solution would be to load the XML data into a set of data structures and use a language more suited to this task to look the items up.
