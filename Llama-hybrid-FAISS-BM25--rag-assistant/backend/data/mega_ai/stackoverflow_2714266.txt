Structuring a website in Liferay Portal?

I am working on a project involving Liferay Portal and am hoping to get some input on how to properly utilize 'community' and 'organizations' in the site structure. I have thus far been frustrated with the lack of documentation on this subject, and Liferay's internal forum seems to be all but dead. Can the community assist me or point me in the right direction for my needs?
