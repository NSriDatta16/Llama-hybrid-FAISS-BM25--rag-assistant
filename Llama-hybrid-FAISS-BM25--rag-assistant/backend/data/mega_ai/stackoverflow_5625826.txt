Problem Nexus 1 running apps on my phone from Eclipse

I have a Samsung Google Nexus S. Great phone. I have been developing apps on it, not too much of a problem. Since last week I can suddenly not run apps from Eclipse on the phone anymore. I get the following error: [2011-04-11 20:12:48 - ImageBrowser] Android Launch! [2011-04-11 20:12:48 - ImageBrowser] adb is running normally. [2011-04-11 20:12:48 - ImageBrowser] Performing com.xxx.android.imagebrowser.ImageBrowser activity launch [2011-04-11 20:12:48 - ImageBrowser] Automatic Target Mode: using device '34315B519D6000EC' [2011-04-11 20:12:48 - ImageBrowser] Uploading ImageBrowser.apk onto device '34315B519D6000EC' [2011-04-11 20:12:48 - ImageBrowser] Failed to install ImageBrowser.apk on device '34315B519D6000EC': An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine [2011-04-11 20:12:48 - ImageBrowser] java.io.IOException: An established connection was aborted by the software in your host machine [2011-04-11 20:12:48 - ImageBrowser] Launch canceled! I am going out of my mind. Everything has been working perfectly before. I have tried just running a Hello world app with the same problem. My Machine: Apple i5, pretty standard. OS: Windows 7 32 bit Eclipse: Helios Service Release 2 ADB: Android debug birdge version 1.0.26 I have re-installed the google usb drivers as per this following link: http://developer.android.com/sdk/win-usb.html USB debugging enabled on phone I have hard factory reset my phone in case something is wrong. I am at wits end. Everything worked just fine, and then it all suddenly went berserk and now nothing works. 2 things: about a week ago I plugged in an ipod which had been in someones windows machine and it appeared to have a virus on it. I have run AVG and removed one or 2 things that were on there, but has not helped. Secondly I have a 3g dongle I use for internet, and that connects via usb. But I have been using this together with the phone no problem... When I plug in the phone, it immediately appears in Eclipse in the devices panel, and it is online and showing Honeycomb android version. Then, when I hit run, the above message/error occurs and then immediately the device is offline. I can only unplug and plug in again, and start from the beginning with same results. Very oddly, I have had issues when disabling USB debugging, and trying to copy photos from my phone. When I enabled the device as USB storage, it woudl connect fine, but not always stay on as stable. If I then went to the images folder, it would disconnect. Extremely odd. Help???
