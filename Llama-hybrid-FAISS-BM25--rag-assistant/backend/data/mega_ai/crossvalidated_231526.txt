I had the same doubt, this is how I reasoned about it. By "Markov state of the environment" I believe the question means does the agent have any notion of how the states in the environment transition. Based on this definition the first time the agent receives an image it has no notion of transitions hence it does not have a Markov state of the environment. Please feel free to correct this post if its wrong.
