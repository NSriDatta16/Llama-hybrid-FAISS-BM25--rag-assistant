Look at your code. The Save method takes a string argument, i.e., the file path. You obviously don't need the user to enter that, you can simply provide your own path. bitmap1.Save(@"C:\foo.bmp"); You haven't provided much info, so perhaps your problem is knowing where to actually save the files? If you don't need user input (i.e., you don't want to use a FileDialog), then you will need to determine some scheme for organizing these files.
