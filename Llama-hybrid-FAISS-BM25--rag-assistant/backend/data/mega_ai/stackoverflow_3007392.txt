There are a bunch of ways to do it. I would recommend something along the lines of Perl, Python, or Ruby. If you're looking to do this with a quick-and-dirty one-liner, Perl has an edge in that department. For example, this will do what you asked for: # Slurp entire file. # Convert newlines followed by lower-case letter. perl -p -e 'BEGIN {$/ = undef} s/\n(?=[a-z])/ /g' book.txt But this is probably better if paragraphs are separated by 2 newlines. # Process file a "paragraph" at a time. # Convert newlines followed by at least 2 characters. perl -p -e 'BEGIN {$/ = qq{\n\n}} s/\n(?=..)/ /g' book.txt
