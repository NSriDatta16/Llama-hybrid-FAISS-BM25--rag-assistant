I think this question is a bit confused, because an RNN does not model $p(y_i | y_{i-1})$ -- indeed, in most cases, such a simple conditional probability could be modeled just by constructing a large frequency-count table. In general, an RNN defines a distribution $p(y) = \prod_j p(y_i | y_{j . In most cases, you train by directly maximizing log-likelihood of entire sequences from the dataset.
