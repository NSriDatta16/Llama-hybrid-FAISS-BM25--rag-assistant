It's a far superior option to perform as few separate allocations as possible. This is because the allocation involves overhead which is reduced, both in memory and time, and in addition, the contiguous memory is far faster to access because there's far reduced risk of cache misses, and also reduces fragmentation (although I've never had a problem with fragmentation personally). The simple fact is that composing with subobjects is the fastest and smallest option in every possible regard. If you can do it, do. It also has many maintenance-related upsides, such as the automatic constructor/assignment operator generations.
