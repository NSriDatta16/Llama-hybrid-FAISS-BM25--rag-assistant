Thinking of a pure discrimination index such as the $c$-index (concordance probability) AKA the AUROC as something produced by sensitivity, specificity, and cutoffs is counter-productive and adds nothing but confusion IMHO. When you look at the computing formula for $c$ which comes from the Wilcoxon two-sample rank statistic you'll see that no cutoffs are instrumental and $c$ cannot be affected by imbalance in $Y$. To get a small value of $c$ as you did means that your manipulation of the data is suspect. It is unclear what you are doing with Freq or how the Titanic dataset was constructed. Am I right to infer that this is a categorical dataset where Age is arbitrarily categorized? If so then you are using the wrong dataset (there are Titanic datasets where age is a proper continuous variable) and are treating Freq improperly as a covariate instead of as case weights. To use logistic regression requires some amount of study, which will also show you why the word 'classification' should not have appeared in your post.
