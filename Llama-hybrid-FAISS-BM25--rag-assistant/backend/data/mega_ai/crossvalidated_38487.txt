Does using count data as independent variable violate any of GLM assumptions?

I would like to employ count data as covariates while fitting a logistic regression model. My question is: Do I violate any assumption of the logistic (and, more in general, of the generalized linear) models by employing count, non-negative integer variables as independent variables? I found a lot of references in the literature regarding hot to use count data as outcome, but not as covariates; see for example the very clear paper: "N E Breslow (1996) Generalized Linear Models: Checking Assumptions and Strengthening Conclusions, Congresso Nazionale Societa Italiana di Biometria, Cortona June 1995", available at http://biostat.georgiahealth.edu/~dryu/course/stat9110spring12/land16_ref.pdf . Loosely speaking, it seems that glm assumptions may be expressed as follows: iid residuals; the link function must correctly represent the relationship among dependent and independent variables; absence of outliers Does everybody know whether there exists any other assumption/technical problem that may suggest to use some other type of models for dealing with count covariates? Finally, please notice that my data contain relatively few samples ( A simple R example code follows: \########################################################### \#generating simulated data var1
