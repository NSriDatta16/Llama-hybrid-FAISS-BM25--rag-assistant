My approach is to follow theory to develop composite scales. I would make the choices listed below for the stated reasons: Sum the individual components if the individual components are part of a whole. Consider measuring intelligence using measures for verbal and quantitative intelligence. The overall measure of intelligence should be the sum of the verbal and quantitative components as the individual components are part of a whole. Average the individual components if they measure the same underlying construct. Suppose, that we measure verbal intelligence by a battery of 10 questions. Each question measures the same aspect of intelligence (namely our ability to parse language). Thus, averaging these scores will give us a better measure of verbal intelligence as random errors in the measurements tend to even out when you average the scores. Multiply them if the individual components have synergistic effect on the underlying construct. If for some reason you believe that verbal intelligence and quantitative intelligence have synergistic effects then I would multiply them. By synergistic effects I mean that a person who is verbally intelligent can leverage his language abilities to go even further in quantitative fields thus enhancing their quantitative intelligence.
