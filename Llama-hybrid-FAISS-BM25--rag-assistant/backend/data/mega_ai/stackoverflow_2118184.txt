JQuery Integration with JavaEE

I have been able to use Jquery with ASP.NET because I know where to drop the JQuery Library, but I am trying to integrate JQuery with Java Web Applications using JSP's,Servlets, etc. It seems like a trivial question, but for some reason I am unable to figure out where to drop the JQuery Javascript file.
