Code Analysis on a Code Generator Generated File - How to Suppress Warnings?

We run Code Analysis on all our source files. One of our source files is a Linq-To-SQL generated file, which we have no control over the generated output. The generated code is producing Code Analysis warnings that I would like to suppress. Is there any way I can suppress CA warnings in a code generated file that doesn't involve creating attributes and/or pragma's in the code itself (which will get overwritten each time the file is generated)?
