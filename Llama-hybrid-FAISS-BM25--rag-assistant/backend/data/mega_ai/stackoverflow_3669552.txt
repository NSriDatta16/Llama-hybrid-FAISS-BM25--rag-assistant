There are a lot of things you need to check/do. How much disk space is allocated to the database? Is there enough free to do all of the inserts without it auto increasing in size? If not, increase the database file size as it has to stop every so many inserts to auto resize the db itself. do NOT do individual inserts. They take way too long. Instead either use table-value parameters (sql 2008), sql bulk copy, or a single insert statement (in that order of preference). drop any indexes on that table before and recreate them after the load. With that many inserts they are probably going to be fragged to hell anyway. If you have any triggers, consider dropping them until the load is complete. Do you have enough RAM available in the database server? You need to check on the server itself to see if it's consuming ALL the available RAM? If so, you might consider doing a reboot prior to the load... sql server has a tendency to just consume and hold on to everything it can get it's hands on. Along the RAM lines, we like to keep enough RAM in the server to hold the entire database in memory. I'm not sure if this is feasible for you or not. How is it's disk speed? Is the queue depth pretty long? Other than hardware replacement there's not much to be done here.
