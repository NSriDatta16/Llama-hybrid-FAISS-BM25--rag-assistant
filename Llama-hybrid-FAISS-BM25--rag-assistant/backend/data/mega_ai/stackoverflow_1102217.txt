Ok, so there's how to get it working with proper TeamCity integration: Presuming you have TeamCity installed with at least 1 build agent available 1) Configure your build agent to execute manage.py test 2) Download and install this plugin for TC http://pypi.python.org/pypi/teamcity-messages 3) You'll have to provide your custom test runner for plugin in (2) to work. It can be straight copy of run_tests from django.test.simple, with only one slight modification: replace line where test runner is called with TeamcityTestRunner, so insted of def run_tests(test_labels, verbosity=1, interactive=True, extra_tests=[]): ... result = unittest.TextTestRunner(verbosity=verbosity).run(suite) use this: def run_tests(test_labels, verbosity=1, interactive=True, extra_tests=[]): ... result = TeamcityTestRunner().run(suite) You'll have to place that function into a file in your solution, and specify a custome test runner, using Django's TEST_RUNNER configuration property like this: TEST_RUNNER = 'my_site.file_name_with_run_tests.run_tests' Make sure you reference all required imports in your file_name_with_run_tests You can test it by running ./manage.py test from command line and noticing that output has changed and now messages like #teamcity.... appearing in it.
