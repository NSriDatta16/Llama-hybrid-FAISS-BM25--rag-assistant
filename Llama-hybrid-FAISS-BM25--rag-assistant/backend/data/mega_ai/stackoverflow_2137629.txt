iPhone View-Based Application Doesn't Have Core Data?

Possible Duplicate: iphone tab bar controller and core data In Xcode, I'd like to go File -> New Project -> and pick View Based Application. But it doesn't have the "Use core data for storage" (like some of the other projects). So I can't assign a core data to it. I'd like to know if this is an issue, and what's the best route to take for what I'm trying to do? (Which is build a core data based app ... but I was hoping to do it with the view-based since that has alot of things written for me).
