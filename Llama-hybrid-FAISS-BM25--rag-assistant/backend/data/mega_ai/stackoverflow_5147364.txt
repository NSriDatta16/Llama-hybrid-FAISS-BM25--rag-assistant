You can access any instance variables or global variables from blocks. [UIView animateWithDuration:1 animations:^{ blueViewController.view.alpha = blueViewController.myAlphaValue; yellowViewController.view.alpha = 0; }]; blueViewController and yellowViewController are automatically retained from the block because these are Objective-C objects, it is safe to access from the block without worrying about instance's life span. If blueViewController and yellowViewController are ivar, only self is automatically retained by the block. the __block storage type modifier is able to use for pointer as well. __block MyViewController *myViewController = self.viewController; However, this variable is not automatically retained from blocks even though this variable is Objective-C object. Be careful for life span of __block Objective-C object. ^{ myViewController = self.viewController; /* If myViewController is with __block modifier, it is ok. */ /* If myViewController is without __block modifier, this line is not able to compile. */ }; The __block Storage Type
