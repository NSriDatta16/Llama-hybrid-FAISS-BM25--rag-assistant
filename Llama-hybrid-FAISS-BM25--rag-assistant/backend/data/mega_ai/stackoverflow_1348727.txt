A quick and naive test indicates that for performance-sensitive code, yes, you want to pay attention to this: Don't generate 100K frames: 3ms Generate 100K frames: 1805ms About 20 microseconds per generated frame, on my machine. Not a lot, but a measurable difference over a large number of iterations. Speaking to your later questions ("Should I disable StackFrame generation in my application?"), I'd suggest you analyze your application, do performance tests like the one I've done here, and see if the performance difference amounts to anything with your workload. using System; using System.Diagnostics; namespace ConsoleApplication { class Program { static bool generateFrame; static void Main(string[] args) { Stopwatch sw; // warm up for (int i = 0; i
