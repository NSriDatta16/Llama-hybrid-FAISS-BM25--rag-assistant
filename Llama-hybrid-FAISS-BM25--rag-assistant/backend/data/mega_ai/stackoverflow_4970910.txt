Every object must occupy distinct storage, otherwise you can't deallocate one object without deallocating others that share storage with it. Suppose you have two distinct objects at one address: Type* object1 = new Type(); //first object Type* object2 = new Type(); //second object and they happen to be at same addresses, then you delete object1; what will be delete d if they both have the same address?
