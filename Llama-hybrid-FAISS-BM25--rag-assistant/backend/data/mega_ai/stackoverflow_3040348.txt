You can inspect and adjust the cron execution orders with the Supercron module. Some more details about this module (from its project page): SuperCron is a complete replacement for Drupal's built-in Cron functionality. It allows you to: See the list of all Cron hooks found in the enabled modules Change the order in which cron hooks are called Disable certain hooks Run the tasks you choose in parallel, so that cron tasks will be executed all at once rather than one after the other Identify the exceptions raised by individual hooks Call hooks individually on demand (great for identifying problems) Keep executing cron hooks that follow an exception, limiting the damage to only one module Measure the time it takes for a cron hook to execute (we display the last call timings and the average timings) Capture any output generated by the hooks Change the way Cron behaves when the site is under load (this optional feature requires Throttle to be enabled) Limit the IP addresses that may be allowed to call your cron scripts
