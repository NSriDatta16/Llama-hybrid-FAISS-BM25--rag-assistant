Storing a NULL value does not take any space. "The fact is, a NULL value occupies space â€“ 2 bytes." This is a misconception -- that's 2 bytes per row , and I'm pretty sure that all rows use those 2 bytes regardless of whether there's any nullable columns. A NULL value in databases is a system value that takes up one byte of storage This is talking about databases in general, not specifically SQL Server. SQL Server does not use 1 byte to store NULL values.
