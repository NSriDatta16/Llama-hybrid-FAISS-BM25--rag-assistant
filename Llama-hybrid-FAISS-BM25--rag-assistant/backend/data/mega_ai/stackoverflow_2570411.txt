Following up from @Ash's answer, here is some illustrative code. Notice that there is no reflection involved. Map myMap = new HashMap (); ... Object myObject = ... myMap.put("albert", myObject); // record something with name "albert" ... Object someObject = myMap.get("albert"); // get the object named "albert" // get("albert") would return null if there nothing with name "albert" EDIT I've edited the example to use the type Object, since that is more closely aligned with what you are trying to do (I think). But you could use any type instead of Object ... just replace the type throughout the example. And you can do the same with an ArrayList; for example: List dates = new ArrayList (); dates.add(new Date()); Date firstDate = dates.get(0); Notice that no typecasts are required.
