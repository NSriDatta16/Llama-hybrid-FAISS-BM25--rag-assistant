I'll attempt to answer this question based on my own experience. In contrast to the other answers, I prefer Sql for deep learning and big-data-related things. There are numerous reasons for that. As it can be seen here , Pandas provides an intuitive, powerful, and fast data analysis experience on tabular data. However, because Pandas uses only one thread of execution and requires all data to be in memory at once, it doesnâ€™t scale well to datasets much beyond the gigabyte scale. Sql engines usually keep the keys or special columns in data-structures like $B ^+$ tree in order to facilitate CRUD operations. This data structure keeps the status of all data in the database. This is not pandas can do because it can't access all the data simultaneously. On the other hand, it can't do some operations even with its chunk parameter used in read_csv. As an example, you can't have direct batch operations for large datasets that your memory can't accommodate them. Any other tasks which depend on your entire dataset need extra coding. All of these can be handled in Sql without extra coding, just with a simple query. Simple Sql operations are just used without any fear about the memory. Another difference is that CRUD operations in Sql can be applied distributed with different authorisation policies which are not possible in pandas. It is not meant to say which is better, it all depends on your task. For large scale computation I prefer Sql and for small ones, I prefer pandas. There are other things that are not in pandas which are really important for fast experience for data extraction that I'll refer to later. For now, just take a look at here .
