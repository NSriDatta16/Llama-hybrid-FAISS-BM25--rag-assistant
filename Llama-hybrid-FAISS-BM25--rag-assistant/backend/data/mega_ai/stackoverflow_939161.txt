How about this... String.Format("{0:P0}",0.13).Replace("%","") EDIT: This should work across cultures: var percentSymbol = CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.NumberFormat.PercentSymbol; String.Format("{0:P0}",0.13).Replace(percentSymbol,"") There is also this solution which may be more elegant but slightly more code.
