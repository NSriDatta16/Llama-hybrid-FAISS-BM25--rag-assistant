No, bootstrapped predictive distribution are not necessarily normally distributed. In general, they should follow the in-sample conditional distributions (which are, of course, hard to observe). As an illustration, assume that we are forecasting a low volume count time series, like retail sales on a SKU/day/store levels. This can reasonably be modeled using a negative binomial distribution, which is quite skewed. The simple bootstrap will of course not yield integer numbers (unless you round), but it will yield something quite skewed - and certainly not normal. Whether any given bootstrapped predictive distribution is normal will depend on the time series you feed in.
