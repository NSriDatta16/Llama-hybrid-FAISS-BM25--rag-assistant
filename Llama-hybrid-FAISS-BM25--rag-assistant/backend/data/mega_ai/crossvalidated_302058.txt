Multiple Imputation (mice) with interaction terms in model

Our model is a logistic regression. We have been adviced that in our case we should do multiple imputation (mice for exemple). However, in this particular model we have some interaction terms (like 4 or 5) and I've heard that we cannot do classical MICE when there are interactions. Can someone tell me why interactions are a problem for imputation? I'm not sure to understand where is the problem. What is the specific procedure that can be used then ? Thanks for your answers.
