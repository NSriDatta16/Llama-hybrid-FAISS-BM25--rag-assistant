Creating SQLDataSource

I have a table ( EmployeeID , EmployeeName , ManagerID ) How can I create a SQLDataSource to include the ManagerName from the EmployeeName given EmployeeID = ManagerID ? In my GridView after dragging a DropDownList what bindings should I do to display the ManagerName ? Is it possible to use it without writing custom SELECT , INSERT , DELETE or UPDATE ? If not what are the steps I need to do to write the whole thing i.e. custom grid and source?
