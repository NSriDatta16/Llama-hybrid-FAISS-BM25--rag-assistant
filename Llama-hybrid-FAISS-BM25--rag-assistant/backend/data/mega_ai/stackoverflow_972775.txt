I really don't know how this could be done elegantly. FWIW, I would go for a different approach: use a custom model class for the info you're handling, and have conversion to and from Xml for it. You're probably going to find it's a better way to handle the data, and it's even more succint. However there is a nice way to do it with Xml directly, I'd like to see it.
