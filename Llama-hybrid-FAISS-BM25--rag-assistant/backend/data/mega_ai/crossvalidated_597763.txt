SPSS Output - My Omnibus Test is insignificant, but I have significant predictors

I ran a binary-logistic regression in SPSS. Block 1 shows that the Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients is insignificant for step, block and model, p =1.06. However, I have two significant predictors in the Variables in the Equation Table. Because the Omnibus test is insignificant, are my two predictors also insignificant? I am not sure how to report the results. Thank you for any help! This is part of my dissertation research.
