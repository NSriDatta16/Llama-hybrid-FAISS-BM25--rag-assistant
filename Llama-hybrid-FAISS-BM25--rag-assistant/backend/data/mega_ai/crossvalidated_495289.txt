For the second question: Define a row vector $s$ = [1 0 0 0] for the initial status. Calculate $z_{i}=s\times P^i$ , where $i$ = 1, 2, ... up to 52 (since a year has 52 weeks), and $P$ is the transition matrix. Each of $z_{i}$ is a row vector of 4 elements. Denote the fourth element of $z_{i}$ as $z_{i}(4)$ . The average number of weeks in a year the machine works is $n = 52-\sum_{i=1}^{52} z_i(4)$ .
