I wouldn't say that it is an image classification problem. Instead of plotting it, and using the plot as image, I would recommend you to use the values directly. You can think of them as 1D images with 2 channels. You can use 1D CNN based models for it. You might also want to check the models which are used to classify EEG signals, since they also deal with similar format of input data.
