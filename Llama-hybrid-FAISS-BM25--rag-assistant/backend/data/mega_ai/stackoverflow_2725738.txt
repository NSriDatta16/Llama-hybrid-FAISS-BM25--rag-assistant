Alternate to control+drag to connect view element with file owner in xCode interface builder?

Working on an iPhone application through a TightVNC connection into a Mac Mini; the control+drag operation in Interface Builder to connect a view element to file owner doesn't work - I don't see the connecting line. It does work when I connect keyboard, mouse and monitor to the Mini and work on it directly, however it is a lot more convenient for me to run it through a VNC connection. Must be some quirk of the TightVNC connection that is preventing this. I tried different TightVNC settings for the cursor (let server handle it and so on) but no luck. Is there an alternative to control+drag to hook up outlets?
