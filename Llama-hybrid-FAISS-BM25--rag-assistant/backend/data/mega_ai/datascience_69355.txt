The probability mass function for a Poisson-distributed random variable $X$ is $f_X(x)=\dfrac{\lambda^xe^{-\lambda}}{x!}$ . The expected value is a sum over all possible values of $x$ , the natural numbers (non-negative integers). $$\mathbb{E}[X]=\sum_{x=0}^{\infty} x f_X(x)$$ When you evaluate that sum, the result is $\lambda$ . Yes, $\lambda$ often means a wavelength in physics. That’s just notation, however, and easily could be $\xi$ or $\beta$ or $\gamma$ . Your physics knowledge will also tell you that $\theta$ is an angle, yet statisticians often use $\theta$ as a parameter. For the Poisson distribution, $\lambda$ denotes a rate, and this is how you get five cars per hour as the average rate of cars passing through a remote intersection (or whatever they’re doing). EDIT I like JBStatistics. He derives the expected value of a Poisson distribution, if you’re interested in seeing how that series calculation works: https://youtube.com/watch?v=65n_v92JZeE .
