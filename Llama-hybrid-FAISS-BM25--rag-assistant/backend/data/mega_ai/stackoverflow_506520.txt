I wrote a Hold'Em AI in my undergrad. It wasn't particularly advanced, I used a Q-Value machine that traversed a number of states and updated Q values for each state. I found the University of Alberta's AI Poker project an invaluable source of info for avoiding pitfalls. As one poster above states, the first step is to nail in a couple of determinable poker rules - one-on-one poker can be developed programatically. One pitfall I fell into was not building in reconfigurability early on. For instance being able to switch the grade of learning/playing. I would be interested to hear how you get on drop me a mail stevekeogh at gmail.com
