Beware of fonts. System fonts aren't the prettiest but Asian fonts are too large to embed. We resorted to embedding Latin fonts for English and switching to system fonts for Chinese. Be careful about rotating system fonts - your text will disappear. I think Flash 10 might have fixed this. Also, be very careful with the font string you specify for Chinese. Most OSes have nifty fall-back logic - if you specify Trebuchet and try to render a Chinese character, your OS might decide to use some Asian font instead. Flash seems to mess up this fall-back logic and switch between two or more Asian fonts dynamically. We had cases where mousing over a text block would switch the font. To fix this, specify a font which includes all the characters you need (without falling back to some other font). You will need to test this across OSes, etc.
