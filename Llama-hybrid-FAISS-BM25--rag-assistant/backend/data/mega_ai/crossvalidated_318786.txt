What is Bayesian Deep Learning?

What is Bayesian Deep Learning and how does it relate to traditional Bayesian statistics and to traditional Deep Learning? What are the main concepts and mathematics involved? Could I say it's just non parametric bayesian statistics? What are its seminal works as well as its current main developments and applications? PS: Bayesian Deep Learning is getting a lot of attention, see NIPS workshop.
