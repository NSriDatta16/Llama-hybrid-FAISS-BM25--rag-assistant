gbm and h2o are two separate packages, both of which can used to fit a gradient boosted tree model to data. You cannot use h2o to tune parameters of a gbm (from gbm package) model. For more information about the h2o package, please refer: http://h2o-release.s3.amazonaws.com/h2o/rel-lambert/5/docs-website/Ruser/rtutorial.html
