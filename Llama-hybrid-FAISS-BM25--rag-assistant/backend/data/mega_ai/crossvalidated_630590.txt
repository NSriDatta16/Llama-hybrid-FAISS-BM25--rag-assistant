I'm trying to predict the probability of an individual progressing all the way through a series of tasks. Logistic regression seems like an ideal model, except that I would model the response as a 1 if the participant did perform all tasks and a 0 if the participant didn't perform all tasks. A 0 may mean they did 3 but not the 4th final task or it may mean they didn't do anything at all, 1 may mean they just finished all in the allotted time, or they had considerable time to spare. You can certainly fit a logistic model to non-integral responses on the unit scale, such as 0.33 or 0.66, (see other posts on this topic). But who are you to say how hard each task was and assign a number correspondingly? Consider that the 4th and final task may be impossibly hard so that no one in the sample completes it, but 1-3 are trivial, so that each participant is predicted to have a 75% chance of completing all tasks even though nobody actually did. That's why you shouldn't fit the logistic model with fractional responses.
