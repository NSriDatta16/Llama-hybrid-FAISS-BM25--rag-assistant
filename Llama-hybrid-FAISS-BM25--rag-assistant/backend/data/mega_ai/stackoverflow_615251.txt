If I understand correctly, then what you need is not a stemmer but a lemmatizer. Lemmatizer is a tool with knowledge about endings like -ies , -ed , etc., and exceptional wordforms like written , etc. Lemmatizer maps the input wordform to its lemma, which is guaranteed to be a "real" word. There are many lemmatizers for English, I've only used morpha though. Morpha is just a big lex-file which you can compile into an executable. Usage example: $ cat test.txt Community Communities $ cat test.txt | ./morpha -uc Community Community You can get morpha from http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/research/groups/nlp/carroll/morph.html
