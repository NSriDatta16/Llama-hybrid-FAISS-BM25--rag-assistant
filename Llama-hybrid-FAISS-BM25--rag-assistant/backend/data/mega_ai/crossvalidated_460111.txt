For sentiment analysis tasks like yours, you can either use "bag of words" or TF-IDF or "bag of vectors" or "bag of n-grams"(or others) to convert raw text to numerical features. The Bag of Words and TF-IDF which is based on Bag of Words are very simple and fast algorithms. The IDF is necessary because it makes a trade-off between frequency of the term and how many documents include the term. The primary algorithm assumes that words, like stop words, that appear in other documents frequently are less valuable than those only appear in a document, resulting in it may not fit in your case where keywords would be counted as stop words. You can utilize the "bag of n-grams" to prevent that, and you can also weight the n-grams by the Naive Bayes like that in this paper: Sentiment Classification using Document Embeddings trained with Cosine Similarity .
