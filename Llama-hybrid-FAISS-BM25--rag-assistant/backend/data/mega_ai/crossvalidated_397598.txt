What does the distribution of samples from an MCMC method converge to without repeated samples?

Suppose I have an absolutely continuous distribution with density $f(x)$ and I use an mcmc sampler which has accept/reject step to sample from this distribution. In the final samples, there are some singular points (i.e., samples on top of each other). Does the distribution of the samples without these singular points converge to anything meaningful?
