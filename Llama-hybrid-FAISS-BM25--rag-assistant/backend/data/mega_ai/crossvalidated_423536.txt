The crucial issue is surely the effect of treatment. If that remains substantial even with birth weight in the model then you can explain to the readers that the observed effect of treatment on development was over and above the effect of birth weight. Another way to look at it is to think that having entered birth weight into the model any other variable is predicting the residual of development given birth weight so you have removed birth weight. This all applies to regression in general, it is not specific to logistic regression.
