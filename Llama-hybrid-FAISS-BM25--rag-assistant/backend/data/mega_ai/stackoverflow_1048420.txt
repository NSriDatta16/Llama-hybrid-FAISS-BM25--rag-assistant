If you dislike creating too many packages, create just one and put into it everything you have now in the default package. Why may you need packages? It is: A way to avoid problems with duplicate filenames when you share you code A way to organize your code Like if you have your classes "in a wild" when they are outside the packages and then "domesticate" them and they can't do anybody any harm. If you don't wish to share your code, there's still a reason for using packages, because in time your code gets more complex and you want to have some means to organize it into some logical structure.
