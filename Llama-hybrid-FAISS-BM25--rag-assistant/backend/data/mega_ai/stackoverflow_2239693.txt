Best way to store this data in SQL Table

I am trying to best figure out a way to store this particular case of data in a static database table on the front end the user will be presented with a simple table (say 5x5 by default) but the user can expand or delete rows/ columns at will. The idea is that the first column will be labels that are the same as the headers, similar to a graph and that any change to either is reflected to the other, so the graph (not really a graph, but I feel it is a valid comparison) remains a square col1 col2 col3 col4 col5 row1 1 5 6 8 9 row2 2 3 4 5 3 row3 0 0 0 0 0 all values can be different row4 0 0 0 0 0 the row and column names will be the same always row5 0 0 0 0 0 IE (start with 5x5, if user removes row5 or col5 it becomes 4x4) so because of this dynamic amount of columns I am unsure how to represent it in a table in the database. each cell in the "map" will just contain an int and I am having a hard time finding an elegant way to map this in my database for usage with linq to sql any ideas? EDIT: I could simply wrap everything from the front end in a JSON object and have a bunch of code for that but i'm not sure if that would be easiest or not, mainly looking for some good input for now
