Decorrelating Two Time Series

Suppose that I have two time series $\{x_1, \ldots,x_t\}$ and $\{y_{1+k}, \ldots,y_t\}$ which have some level of correlation over an overlapping time period. What techniques can I use to decorrelate these two time series? Perhaps multivariate AR models or something of the like?
