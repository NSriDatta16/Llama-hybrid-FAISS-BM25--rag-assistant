Statistical analysis for non-human experiments

I am running an experiment where no humans are involved. My mobile robot performs a tracking task (following a line in the ground) under 5 different conditions (different control variables). I evaluate the tracking error at each instant and then I average it over time, so that I have, for each condition, a MEAN ERROR $\pm$ S.D. How can I tell if one condition is better than another one? I can see if the MEAN ERROR is lower, but if both have high S.D.s they may have been much closer than I think. Can I treat each instant as a subject and apply a standard stat analysis (e.g. repeated-measure ANOVA across the 5 conditions)?
