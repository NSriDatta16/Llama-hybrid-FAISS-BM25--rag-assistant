Can ordered logistic regression suffer from omitted variable bias?

If I ran an ordered logistic regression, with say a couple of explanatory variables, is it possible that omitted variables can bias the categorical outcome of the dependent variable similar to how this can happen in an OLS regression with a continuous dependent variable?
