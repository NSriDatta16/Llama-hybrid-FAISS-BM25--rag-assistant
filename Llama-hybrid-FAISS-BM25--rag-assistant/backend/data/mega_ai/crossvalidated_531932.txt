Meta-analysis effect size conversion: regression coefficient to correlation coefficient (r)

I am trying to extract data from an article for a meta-analysis. I would like to convert the following information into a correlation coefficient (r): Pre-covid period: Nov 19 2019 - March 2 2020 (104days) Covid: March 2 2020 - May 12 2020 (71days) Over the study period (November 19-2019 to May 12-2020; 175 days), 138,615 prescriptions for buprenorphine were issued. A mean of 911.13 (SD = 220.66) patients filled a prescription for buprenorphine each day. The interrupted time series model demonstrated that buprenorphine prescriptions declined insignificantly at a rate of 1.8 prescriptions per day in the COVID period (B = -1.75, 95%CI = -5.8 to 2.34). In the pre-COVID period, 358.79 (SD = 66.28) prescribers issued a prescription for prevalent buprenorphine patients each weekday, in the COVID period, the number of daily prescribers declined insignificantly at a rate of 0.32 prescribers per day (B = -0.32,95%CI = -1.47 to 0.82)compared to the baseline. Is the B regression coefficient given the unstandardized or standardized beta? and could i use the B's presented above as correlation coefficient (r) effect sizes in my meta analysis or do i have to do some conversion? if so could someone please tell me how I could do this? Thank you for your help.
