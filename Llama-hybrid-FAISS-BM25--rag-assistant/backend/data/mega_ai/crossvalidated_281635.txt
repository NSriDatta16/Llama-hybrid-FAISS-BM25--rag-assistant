Similarity between time series

Consider two sets A and B of time series, with dimensions (Txn) and (Txk) respectively and k Each time series in A is associated to one or more series in B. The association is based on some prior expectation that the series are "similar". I apologise as the question is vague at this stage. Any ideas on how to verify statistically the described association?
