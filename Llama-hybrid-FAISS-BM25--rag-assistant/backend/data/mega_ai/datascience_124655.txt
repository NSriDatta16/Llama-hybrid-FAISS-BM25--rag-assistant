Open Source Model or dataset for attention map visualization

Helloo (: I'm trying to develop a python application where users can upload an image e.g. of their website and receive a heatmap or attention map in return. This map should indicate where users are likely to focus their attention on the image. I'm seeking: Existing models suitable for generating attention maps for website images. Publicly available datasets with eye-tracking data or similar information for website images, which could be used to train such a model. The functionality I aim for is similar to what's offered by Zyro's AI Heatmap or Attention Insight. Any suggestions or guidance would be greatly appreciated!
