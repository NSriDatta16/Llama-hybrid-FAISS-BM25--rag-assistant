In general, databases resist that kind of thing. They're happy to store "prefix" characters in a separate column, though. If that column needs to be part of a composite key, they're happy to do that, too. But if you want to store different kinds of data in different rows of the same table, I hope I can discourage you. Databases--SQL databases, that is--are designed to keep different kinds of data in different tables. People in one table, addresses in another table . . . not addresses in some rows of a table of people. Of course, you might be aiming at something completely different.
