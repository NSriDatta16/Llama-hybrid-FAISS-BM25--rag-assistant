Only a good amount of accumulated statistics from previous projects can help you to give precise estimates. If you have a well defined set of requirements, you can make a rough calculation of how many use cases you have. As I said you need to have some statistics for your team. You need to know average bugs-per-loc number to estimate total bugs count. If you don't have such numbers for your team, you can use industry average numbers . After you have estimated LOC (number of use cases * NLOC) and average bugs-per-lines, you can give more or less accurate estimation on time required to release project. From my practical experience, time spent on bug-fixing is equal to or more (in 99% cases :) ) than time spent on original implementation.
