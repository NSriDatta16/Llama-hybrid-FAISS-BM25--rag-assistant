Censored logistic regression

I have the following problem: We have data with a 0-1 outcome which can occur precisely once. It can occur at any time within a certain time period (say 3 years). For this data set, for some observations we have been able to observe it over the full time period, some for less, so for those observations where we have only observed for 1 year the event might occur in the next two. If this was a poisson regression then we could use an offset to weight the observations accordingly, but for a logistic regression this is not possible, and using standard weighting isn't quite equivalent to what is occurring. So what's the best approach here? Pretend the data is poisson, weight the logistic regression by exposure, or some other approach?
