There are no classical tests which can confirm that a set of data follow a particular distribution. Even proposed tests of normality, or other distributions, all have the common pitfall that they are arbitrarily powerful in large samples. This means that you would expect to reject the null (to say the data do not follow the given distribution) even when it's practically true in every sense. Even stating as a null hypothesis that the data do follow a Pareto distribution, a pristine Pareto sample could lead to a Chi-sq test statistic of 1 and a two sided p-value of p=0.5, yet it would fail to convince that the null hypothesis is in fact true because that is not the correct interpretation of a "null result" as it is called. Furthermore, if you were to state as an alternative hypothesis that the data are Pareto, then what is your null? Could the data follow a Pareto except that the 99-th percentile of the distribution is truncated? What would the power of any test be to detect such a difference? If you take a pragmatic approach, the QQ plot and draw the imposed maximum likelihood estimate over the smoothed empirical density, you can attempt to show graphically when there are egregious departures from the Pareto distribution.
