Multiple regression for pricing an airplane ticket

I am trying to find the relationship between price of an airplane ticket and multiple variables like (how early you can book the ticket, the season of flying, the day of week of flying, minimum stay, one-way or return). The Goal is to have an total average ticket price and the price effect of the variables. I have the data available and I am looking for a suitable approach to solve this problem. Can you give any suggestions for regression approach?
