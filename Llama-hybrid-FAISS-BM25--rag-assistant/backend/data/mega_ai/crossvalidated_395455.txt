There exists explicit (closed-form) solutions for the MLE's you are struggling to find. In fact, a little intuition, after the re-parametrization in step 1 shown below, reveals that the average of the diagonal elements of xx' is a reasonable estimator for the variance and the average of the off-diagonal elements of xx' is a reasonable estimator for the covariance. But to be specific, follow these steps. For simplicity, let the mean vector be equal to the zero vector. 1) Parameterize the problem so that the diagonal elements of the variance-covariance matrix are each "a" and the off-diagonal elements are each "b". 2) Use well known formulas for the inverse and determinant of the matrix constructed in step 1 to set-up the likelihood equation. 3) Re-parameterize the problem again by letting c = a - b and d = a + b*(p-1). 4) Find the MLE of c and d (very easy): you should obtain c = (x'x)/(n-1) - (x'j)^2/(n(n-1) and d = (x'j)^2/n 5) Use the invariance property of the MLE to show that a = ((n-1)*c + d)/n and b = (d-c)/p
