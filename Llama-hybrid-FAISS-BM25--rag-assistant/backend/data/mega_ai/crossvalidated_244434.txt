Estimating percent change on average

Suppose I want to estimate the percent change of something over a fixed amount of time. I have some values of before and after, so I can either choose to get the average of the "before" values and the average value of the "after" values and take the percent change, or I can calculate the percent changes and then take the average. Which should I use? Edit: Here is an example: Suppose in one test I have a before value of 29.53 and an after value of 28.49. For my second test I have a before value of 22.7 and an after value of 23.1. Method 1: The percent change in the first test is -3.52%, and the percent change in the second test is 1.76%. The average of these is -0.88%. Method 2: The average of the before values is 26.115, and the average of the after values is 25.795. The percent change is then ((25.795-26.115)/26.115)*100%=-1.225%. So which would be a better estimate? -0.88% or -1.225%?
