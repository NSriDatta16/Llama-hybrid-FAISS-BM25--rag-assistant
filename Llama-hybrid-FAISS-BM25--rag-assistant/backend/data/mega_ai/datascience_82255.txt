How to use time-sequence data with "meta data" of single value per sample?

I'm, trying to estimate a fish weight by a time-sequence signal of the change in resistance when the fish goes through a gate with electrodes installed. When the fish pass through the gate there's a spike in resistance, and the shape of it supposedly derives from the fish weight. Here is an example of resistance readout of 340 gram fish experiment: And here is an example of the extracted spikes from the same 340 gram fish experiment: However, there are other parameters that governs the signal's shape such as: Water Temperature Water Salinity Gate formation (the proximity of the electrodes) I wonder how to incorporate this type of data, which is single-valued per sample (for example, for all of fish #12 samples, temperature=28.2 Celsius, salinity=410, gate formation=80mm) with the time-series data of the sample itself (which is ~80 data points series). So far I tried mostly neural networks (fully connected and 1-D convolutional architectures) and linear regression. I searched the internet quite a while and couldn't find a suggested architecture for such data. Would adding a channel for each parameter with the fixed value work? Or alternatively, adding these parameters as part of the spike vector? Any ideas / reference to some research? Many thanks!
