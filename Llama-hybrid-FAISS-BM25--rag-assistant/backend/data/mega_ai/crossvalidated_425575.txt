Can we actually get the probability of a text using recurrent neural network?

I know that recurrent neural network is used to generate text and to model the probability of $P(x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3)=P(x_0)P(x_1|x_0)P(x_2|x_1,x_0)P(x_3|x_2,x_1,x_0)$ where $x_i$ is words/text. If RNN can model probability, Can we calculate the probability of a text? for example: It produces low probability for text with no meaning and high probability for normal text. What about CNN, Can we generate probability for images(for example: low probability for fake images)?
