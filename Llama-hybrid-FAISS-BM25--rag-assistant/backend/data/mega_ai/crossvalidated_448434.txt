Kernel selection for one-class SVM learning

Has anyone seen compelling research on kernel selection for one-class SVM learning? I've not tracked this work in some time and am wondering if there's new work I've missed, particularly from the random projections world related to data-dependent kernel learning, that might be relevant here. Thanks! Chris
