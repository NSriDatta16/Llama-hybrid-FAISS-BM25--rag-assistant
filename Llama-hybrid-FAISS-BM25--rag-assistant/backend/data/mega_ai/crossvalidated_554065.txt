Bayesian Linear Regression vs Least Squares

Suppose $X,Y$ are random variables and we wish to use linear regression $Y=aX+b + \epsilon$ . We can determine $a,b$ by using a very straightforward least squares computation. Alternatively, we can give $a,b$ prior distributions and use Bayesian methods to find the maximum likelihoods for $a,b$ and get a linear regression that way instead. It appears that the Bayesian approach here is certainly a lot more difficult to do computationally. However, I have seen statistics books reference this method. My question is, why would someone use the Bayesian approach instead?
