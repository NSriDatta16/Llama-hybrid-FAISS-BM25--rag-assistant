How you combine different model forecasts is your own decision and has nothing to do with scoring rules, just like it wouldn't have anything to do with accuracy. You obtain multiple forecasts (whether they be probabilistic forecasts or "classifications"), you then combine them somehow (for ex. simple average), and then you use these with your scoring rule (or classification metric) of choice. So in a sense it's the same as using only one model results, it is your job (and a separate task) to combine multiple forecasts.
