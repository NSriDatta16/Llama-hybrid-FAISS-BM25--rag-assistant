You do seem to have found an error in the source you cite, but you have to be careful in general. Note this sentence from that source: Previous use has been split into two components (according to whatever contrasts were specified for this variable). Exactly what is being displayed in the output of a model for a multi-level categorical variable depends on how the contrasts for that variable were coded, which isn't shown in the excerpts you quote in your question. In this case it seems that the R default treatment contrast was used. In that case, you are correct that the coefficient (and statistical tests) for each level's coefficient is relative to the reference level for that variable. Several other types of contrasts are possible, however, as explained for example on this page . One might be able to devise a contrast that provides, for each of 2 levels, a comparison of that level to the average of the other levels, as the source claims for this example. It just doesn't appear that such a contrast was actually used in this particular case.
