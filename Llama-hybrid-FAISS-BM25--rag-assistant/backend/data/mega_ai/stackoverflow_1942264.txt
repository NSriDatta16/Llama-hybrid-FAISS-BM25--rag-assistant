How could I implement new JFrame functionality

I am trying to remove the drag bar across the top of the JFrame. I would like to keep the minimize maximize and close options that appear on this bar available. What I was thinking was to remove the bar (and icons). Then add the icons as embedded images, that implement the JFrame actionlistener. It would also be necessary for this to work with JInternalFrames. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
