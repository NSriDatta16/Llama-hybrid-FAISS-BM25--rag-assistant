It helps to have a very basic method of giving statuses clearly and universally. Whereas strings can easily be typed differently depending on dialect and can also have grammatical changes, Numerals do not have grammatical formatting and do not change with dialect. There is also the storage and transfer issue, a string is larger and thus takes longer to transfer over a network and store (even if it is a few thousandths of a millisecond). Because of this, we can assign numbers as universal identifiers for statuses, for they can transfer quicker and are more punctual, and for the programmes that read them can identify them however they wish (Being multilingual). Plus, it is easier to read computationally: switch($status) { case '404': echo 'File not found!'; break; case '500': echo 'Broken server!'; break; } etc.
