The kind of analysis you need is called " longitudinal analysis " on " panel data ". The time series deals with a behavior of one or maybe a few customers across the time, while you have hundreds of customers. I think you should read the first chapter of " Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis: Modeling Change and Event Occurrence " by Judith D. Singer and John B. Willett, a popular text on the subject. You also mentioned "peaks". From the scarce description of yours, it appears that you may need "event studies", which is also covered in the text above -- read the first chapter in the second part of the book. The standard techniques for panel analysis are mixed effect models and hierarchical linear models . These are available in most stat packages such as SAS, Stata or R. Time series techniques are very powerful when you focus on the time aspect more than anything, and the number of customers is low. In this case you could apply vector autoregression ( VAR ), seamingly unrelated regressions ( SUR ) and the host of other techniques. However, I'm afraid that this may not work for you, because you don't seem to have the grouping for customers yet. Usually, you can't apply time series for hundreds of customers separately, so you have to group them somehow, aggregate the data. You can't usually apply time series methods on hundreds of customers also because the covariance and coefficient matrices become too big, and there's not enough data to estimate them robustly. So, at the very least you need to apply data exploration techniques on panel data , and this topic is covered in the text I referred. Next, you may identify a few distinct groups, then apply time series to them separately or together, when the number of groups is manageable. Alternatively, you may decide to stick to longitudinal analysis.
