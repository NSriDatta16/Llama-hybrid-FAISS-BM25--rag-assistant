how to pass information from php to javascript

I'm working on a web UI control called Folder - it basically mimics Windows Explorer folder - you see a grid of items inside a rectangle and can drag an item around, drop an item inside a different instance of the control, add new items and so on. each item is made of an item template - basically some php code that dictates the look of the item, for example an item template might look like this: my_item_template.php: my item i'm an item when dragging the item i want to replace it with a different template, for example: my_item_drag_template.php: my item i'm being dragged one page may host many different kinds of items, each with its template, its load template, its drop template and so on. my problem is moving all these templates from the server side to the client side. what i'm doing now - in the server side stage i figure out all the templates that i'll need and include them on the page, hidden (display:none). whenever i need a template (for example when the user starts dragging an item and i need its drag template) i locate it, clone it and use. i'd like to avoid having all this code hidden in my page, maybe store it in a jquery's $(folder).data or something. however, i still need to move it from the php. one option would be to insert the templates to $(folder).data and remove them from the page on page load, but i'd rather avoid it (it adds unnecessary dom manipulation). are there any better ways?
