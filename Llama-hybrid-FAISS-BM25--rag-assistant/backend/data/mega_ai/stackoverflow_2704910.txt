Yes, it is possible to use a variable as indice , when accessing an array element. As an example, consider this portion of code : $results = array( 'a' => 'sentence a', 'b' => 'hello !', ); $indice = 'a'; echo $results[$indice]; Which will give the following output : sentence a Here, $indice is a quite simple variable, but you could have used whatever you wanted between the [ and ] , like, for instance : functions : $results[ my_function($parameter) ] array element : $result[ $my_array['indice'] ] Which seems to be what you want to do ? object property : $result[ $obj->data ] ... Basically, you can use pretty much whatever you want there -- as long as it evaluates to a scalar value (i.e. a single integer, string) In your specific case, you could have $results declared a bit like this : $results = array( 'q1' => 'first question', 'q2' => 'second question', ); And $i would be declared this way : $i = array( 'question' => 'q1' ); Which means that $i['question'] would be 'q1' , and that the following portion of code : echo $results[ $i['question'] ]; Would get you this output : first question Edit : To answer the specific words you used in the title of your question, you could also use what's called variable variable in PHP : $variable = 'a'; $indice = 'variable'; echo $results[ $$indice ]; Here : $indice is 'variable' and $$indice is 'a' which means you'll get the same output as before And, of course, don't forget to read the Arrays section of the PHP manual. The Why is $foo[bar] wrong? paragraph could be of interest, especially, considering the example you firt posted. Edit after the edit of the OP : If $value['questions'] is 'q1' , then, the two following portions of code : if($results[$value['questions']]==4){blah blah blah} and if($results['q1']==4){blah blah blah} should do exactly the same thing : with $results[$value['questions']] , the $value['questions'] part will be evaluated (to 'q1' ) before the rest of the expression, and that one will be the same as $results['q1'] . As an example, the following portion of code : $results = array( 'q1' => 4, 'q2' => 6, ); $value = array('questions' => 'q1'); if($results[$value['questions']]==4) { echo "4"; } Outputs 4 .
