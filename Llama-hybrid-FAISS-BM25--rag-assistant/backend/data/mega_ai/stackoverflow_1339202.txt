Regex to extract part of a url

I'm being lazy tonight and don't want to figure this one out. I need a regex to match 'jeremy.miller' and 'scottgu' from the following inputs: http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/archive/2009/08/26/talking-about-storyteller-and-executable-requirements-on-elegant-code.aspx http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2009/08/25/clean-web-config-files-vs-2010-and-net-4-0-series.aspx Ideas? Edit Chris Lutz did a great job of meeting the requirements above. What if these were the inputs so you couldn't use 'archive' in the regex? http://codebetter.com/blogs/jeremy.miller/ http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/
