NetBeans and Android image

New to Android development and have decided to use NetBeans 6.9.1 as my IDE. So far the process has been somewhat painful, but I'm getting things rolling. However, I am creating an ImageView subclass for my first custom View and I can't figure out how to add my Box.png file to the project. Drag and Drop doesn't work, there are no right-click options to add a file to the Resources folder, no dropdown menus to add images, no way to add the image to a package. Could use some insight, thanks!
