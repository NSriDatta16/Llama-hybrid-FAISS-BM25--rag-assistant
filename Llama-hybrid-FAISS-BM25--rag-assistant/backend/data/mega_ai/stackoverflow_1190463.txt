This really should be more a concern of HTML markup and CSS than ASP.NET specifically. That will help your search. For me this has been an issue of learning the hard way, along with a lot of Google searches. Quirksmode.org is a good reference as Agent_9191 suggested and there are other more specialized & detailed references scattered throughout the web. However, if you try to read and understand all the incompatibilities between browsers it's easy to be overwhelmed. So often times I really need specific examples to learn from. For that, I really like alistapart.com . There is a ton of good stuff on that site when it comes to creating layouts in a cross-browser compatible way.
