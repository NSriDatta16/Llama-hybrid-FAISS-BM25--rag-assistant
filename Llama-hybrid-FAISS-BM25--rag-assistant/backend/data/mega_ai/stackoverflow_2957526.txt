I think this is a Tomcat bug. I filed a bug report but the fix is complicated. Tomcat can deploy application in 3 ways, Directory, like webapps/myapp. WAR, like webapps/myapp.war. Context fragment, which is what you are using. If you use #3 but the app or war are in webapps, Tomcat will be confused with #1 or #2. When redeploying directory or war, it supposes to remove context fragment. My workarounds are, If you use directory, put it somewhere other than APPBASE (webapps). If you use WAR, put it somewhere else also and don't explode it. We deploy our app using a script. In the script, the fragment is copied over every time after app is undeployed. Here is a sample fragment for WAR deployment, Please notice not every app runs in unpacked mode. You can't read any resources as files from the WAR in unpacked mode.
