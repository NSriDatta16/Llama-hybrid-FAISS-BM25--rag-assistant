There are many nonparametric measures of relation. There is even a whole book on the subject *Nonparametric Measures of Association*by Gibbons , which is one of the "green books" series from Sage, although I have not read this book. Agresti, in Categorical Data Analysis , has excellent coverage of these. For count data with a lot of 0's, you could use one of the ordinal measures.
