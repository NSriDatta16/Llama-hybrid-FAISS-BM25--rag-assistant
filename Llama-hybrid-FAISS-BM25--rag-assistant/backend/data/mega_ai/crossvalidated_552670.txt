I would saying nAGQ = 0 is acceptable when it's "good enough", e.g. you simply can't get the model to perform adequately with nAGQ > 0 (although I would be highly suspicious of this case; it would be better to fix the problem and/or use multiple optimizers (via allFit() ) to confirm that the fit with nAGQ ≥ 1 is actually getting an adequate fit). Using nAGQ >0 is computationally infeasible. ( glmmTMB may be faster, especially if there are many top-level (variance/covariance + fixed-effect) parameters, although it can only handle nAGQ=1 (i.e. Laplace approximation); MixedModels.jl is likely to be fast as well. GLMMadaptive does nAGQ >1, but I don't know about is speed.) You have tested on similar cases where both nAGQ=0 and nAGQ=1 work and found that nAGQ=0 is generally close enough for your purposes (this is a scientific, not a statistical, criterion). There is an example here : The best description I have found of the profiling assumption is in section 16.2 of the TMB documentation , which states that "one can apply the profile argument to move outer parameters to the inner problem without affecting the model result" when these assumptions hold: Assumption 1 The partial derivative $\partial_\beta f(u,\beta, \theta)$ is a linear function of $u$ . Assumption 2 The posterior mean is equal to the posterior mode: $E(u|x)=\hat u$ They hold exactly for linear mixed models. It's hard to guess exactly when they are likely to hold, but I would very tentatively speculate that (1) will be OK when the inverse link function is "not too nonlinear", i.e. when the linear predictors are mostly in a range where the second derivative of the inverse link function is small (e.g. for a logit link, values near zero) and (2) will be OK when the "effective sample size" per group is large so that we can wave our hands in the direction of the Central Limit Theorem (e.g. binomial observations with $\textrm{min}(pN, (1-p)N)$ not too small, or Poisson observations with average counts not too small — these are also the cases where penalized quasi-likelihood is likely to be OK, see Breslow 2003). But , I'm not aware of a systemic exploration of these issues. Breslow, Norm. “Whither PQL?” UW Biostatistics Working Paper Series, #192, xx xx 2003. http://www.bepress.com/uwbiostat/paper192 .
