I found the same problem. BTW, if you look at the iPhone Settings -> General -> International menu, it makes the distinction between language and region quite clear: Languages: -English Region Format: -United States -United Kingdom The localization framework only appears to pay attention to the language, not the region. I'm tempted to raise an enhancement request for this with Apple, as IMO it is reasonable that a user might want to use British English (for the text) whilst being in the United States (where, say, phone numbers should be in US format).
