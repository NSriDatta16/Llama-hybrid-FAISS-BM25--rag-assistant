Turns out that the solution was to enter the full location of the network drive, (even though it wasn't visible in the file browser) into the Folder Name box. Also, the command above needed to be tweaked to be caspol -q -machine -addgroup 1.2 -url file://networkname/codestorage/* FullTrust After that, the full folder was loaded into VS2008, and we were able to edit it properly. Quite why it doesn't use the same dialog box as "Open Project" though I don't know!
