Statistics for multi-test replicated correlation analysis

I'm analyzing pairwise correlations of time series between two different types of microarrays done for several samples as biological replicates. So, I have M1 number of variables on type 1 array, M2 number of variable on type 2 array, N samples and T time points. For each sample, I calculate M1 x M2 correlation coefficients (Pearson or Spearman) and p-values using T points. Due to batch effect between samples I cannot average measurements between different samples for each time point. My question is which statistics to use to find which pairs of M1 and M2 variables have statistically significant correlation consistent between samples? How to apply multi-test correction? Please help.
