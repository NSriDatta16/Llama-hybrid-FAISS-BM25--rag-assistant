Conducting a t-test on differences?

I'm interested in looking at how employment changes in a treatment and control group measured at the census block level after the start of an employment-related policy. There are 1,250 census blocks in my treatment group and 1,250 census blocks in my control group. I have employment numbers for 2000 and 2010, and I'm interested in seeing how employment changed from 2000 to 2010 in the average census block in the treatment group compared to the control group. Here's an example of what my data looks like: Is it valid to conduct a t-test of the employment difference column (2010 employment - 2000 employment) so that I could see whether mean employment difference in the treatment group is statistically different than the mean employment difference in the control group? Specifically, the code that I would run looks like this: t.test(employment_different ~ treatment_flag, data = df)
