Calculate time elapsed from log timestamps using Ruby

I am parsing a log and would like an elegant way of calculating the difference between these time stamps shown below: [Mar 2, 2010 1:54:40 AM] [Mar 4, 2010 10:54:40 PM] I've looked at DateTime however I wasnt sure if it was ncessary to seperate the Date from the actual time part and create a Time object. If there is an easier way please fire away. Regards. Snappy
