EDIT: Noah Roberts' comment on your question is the bigger issue here, but this answers the question asked even if the example code is wrong.... ... without overloading ... If you want to do it without overloading, the only option that's going to work for all of these is to make the method take a dumb pointer parameter. Can I cast the smart pointer to uint32* for this case? No. Use std::auto_ptr ::get() .
