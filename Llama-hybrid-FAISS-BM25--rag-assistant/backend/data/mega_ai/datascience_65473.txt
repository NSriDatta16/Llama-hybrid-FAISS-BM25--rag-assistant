Nice and necessary question to be clear when doing machine learning preprocessing, there are two points here to take into account: depending on the learning algorithm , you may need to convert your categorical data into a numeric format; e.g. decission trees do not need it and can handle categorical data , whereas another regression algos do need numbers as input in case you have to convert data into numbers, you have two possibilities : integer encoding : this is the case you are correctly describing; with this, you have no problem with just changing the labels by integers keeping the ordinal order (in fact it is better so the algo can learn the natural distance between cold and hot as bigger than cold and mild. Nevertheless, for a decision tree algo, it should not matter as these keep being as labels one-hot-encoding : when the algorithm type requires numbers and there is NOT an ordinal nature among the data , this is the option required to prevent not ordinal data to be understood as being ordinal.
