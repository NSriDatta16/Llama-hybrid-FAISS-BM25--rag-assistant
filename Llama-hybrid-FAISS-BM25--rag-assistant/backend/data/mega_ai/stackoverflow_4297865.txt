Listening on two devices at once with libpcap

I am trying to listen on two devices with libpcap but I still cant find out how to do the trick. I tried to set device to "any" but it isnt working. I am trying to write dhcp relay agent so i need to listen on eth0 and eth1. I tried to create two pcap_loops, each with different device and handler, but only first pcap_loop works, second one is ignored. Is there any way how to do this or should I leave libpcap and try to do it with raw sockets?
