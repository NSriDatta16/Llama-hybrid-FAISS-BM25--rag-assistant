Probably the simplest solution is to set the timeout yourself via: ini_set('default_socket_timeout', 60); // 60 secs Of course if these files are big, another option is to use file_get_contents() as you can specify the filesize limit. You don't want to assign this to a value, as it's more efficient to wrap it like so: $limit = 64 * 1024; // 64 being the number of KB to limit your retrieval md5(file_get_contents($url, false, null, 0, $limit )); Now you can create MD5s off parts of the file, and not worry if somebody tries to send you a 2GB file. Of course keep in mind it's only a MD5 for part of the file, if anything after that changes, this breaks. You don't have to set a filesize limit at all, just try it like so: ini_set('default_socket_timeout', 60); // 60 secs md5(file_get_contents($url));
