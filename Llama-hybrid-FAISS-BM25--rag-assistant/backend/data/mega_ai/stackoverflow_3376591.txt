NServiceBus: How to configure a subscriber when using DB subscription storage

I have a logical publication which is basically a bunch of MT servers, who all access a DB subscription storage. These MTs are typically upgraded by taking 1/2 out of rotation, installing the new MT version, bringing them back online, and then repeating for the other half. I am confused how a subscriber would subscribes to such a publication. In all of the examples I have seen, a subscriber needs to have a publisher's InputQueue specified in configuration in order for the subscription request to be received. But what InputQueue would I specify in this situation? I don't want subscription to fail if some of my publisher MT's happen to be down. Would I just subscribe manually by adding a record to the DB subscription storage?
