AIC does guard against overfitting, but it will not completely prevent it. No metric can do that. So it is still important to sanity check one's model. I find AR or MA orders of 8 or 10 on seasonally differenced data rather questionable. I could not really imagine a data generating process that really looked back 10 years, rather than just 5. There are good reasons why automatic ARIMA modeling procedures do not consider orders above 5. Also, you are only modeling the seasonal part: your model is ARIMA(0,0,0)(10,1,8)[12]. The seasonal part is extremely complex per above, but the nonseasonal part is a flat line. That looks strange. You may want to follow the seasonal ARIMA modeling workflow illustrated here or here to see how one can set both seasonal and non-seasonal orders. I personally am not a big fan of interpreting ACF/PACF plots and differencing back and forth to decide on ARIMA models. On the one hand, it's extremely hard, requires a lot of statistical understanding and is likely not replicable between analysts (if you have classmates, ask them what model they got - I would be surprised if half the class agreed). And you can't do it if you have more than one or a handful of time series. The newer order selection process based on information criteria makes more sense to me. (However, your teacher likely won't accept "I threw the time series into auto.arima() , and this is what came out" as a solution.)
