What is the easiest way to read/manipulate query string params using javascript?

The examples I've seen online seem much more complex than I expected (manually parsing &/?/= into pairs, using regular expressions, etc). We're using asp.net ajax (don't see anything in their client side reference) and would consider adding jQuery if it would really help. I would think there is a more elegant solution out there - so far this is the best code I've found but I would love to find something more along the lines of the HttpRequest.QueryString object (asp.net server side) . Thanks in advance, Shane
