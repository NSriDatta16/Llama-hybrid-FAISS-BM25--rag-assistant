"Weights" may refer to: (1) observation weights that come from sample surveys -- consider tagging "survey-sampling"; (2) Monte Carlo sample weights that arise when sampling from intractable distributions -- consider tagging "weighted-sampling"; (3) variable weights in statistical or machine learning models such as regression, factor analysis, or learning networks -- consider tagging with that specific model. Other odd uses of weights go here.
