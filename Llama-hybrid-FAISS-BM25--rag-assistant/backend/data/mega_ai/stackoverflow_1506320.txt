As pointed out, the maven way to launch a goal (lets say mvn install ) on a set of modules is to organize them as a multi-module project and to launch the goal on the parent pom. Behind the scene, Maven will use a "Maven reactor" for this work. The reactor will calculate the build order by doing a topological sort of the nodes of the directed graph constructed by the dependency relation between modules. This graph is constructed by looking at and tags in poms. But launching maven from a parent is not the only option and maven offers more possibilities to play with the reactor (e.g. making a project and its dependencies or those that depend on it): With maven 2.0.x you have to use the reactor plugin : http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-reactor-plugin/ (see Reactor: My New Favourite Maven Plugin too) With maven 2.1+ you can use native command line options : http://www.sonatype.com/people/2009/03/maven-210-released/ (see the new build mode options -amd , -rf , -am , -pl ) Check it out, it might help you to achieve your goal.
