To quote your quote, In general, a stationary time series will have no predictable patterns in the long-term . This means long-term forecasts will tend to the mean value. However, short-term predictions may well differ from the mean. Consider an MA(1) process as an example: $$ x_t=c+\theta_1 \varepsilon_{t-1}+\varepsilon_t. $$ A one-step-ahead point forecast targeting the conditional mean is $$ \hat x_{t+1|t}=\hat c+\hat\theta_1 \hat\varepsilon_{t}. $$ This is generally different from the estimated mean $\hat c$ that is also the long-term point forecast (where "long" in the context of MA(1) is $h>1$ steps ahead): $$ \hat x_{t+h|t}=\hat c. $$
