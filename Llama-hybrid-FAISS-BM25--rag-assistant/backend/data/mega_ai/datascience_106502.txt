Extracting the metadata form Json file making it columns

I have the following json data file which I have converted to pandas dataframe. The columns are as follows Index(['id', 'title', 'abstract', 'content', 'metadata'], dtype='object') I am particularly interested in the column 'metadata' an element of the column looks like df_json.loc[78, 'metadata'] "{'classification': {'name': 'Manufacturing, Transport & Logistics'}, 'subClassification': {'name': 'Warehousing, Storage & Distribution'}, 'area': {'name': 'Southern Suburbs & Logan'}, 'location': {'name': 'Brisbane'}, 'suburb': {'name': 'Milton'}, 'workType': {'name': 'Casual/Vacation'}}" So I want to make columns extracting the information out of 'metadata' columns for example location. I am not sure how to extract it and put it beside the same json file with added columns such as location etc. id title abstract content metadata clean_content 0 38915469 Recruitment Consultant We are looking for someone to focus purely on ...
