Interesting problem. Not sure the previous solutions are generic on the number of matched groups - in the cases so far, it's fixed at 2 I think. Although there is probably a way to make them variable. Another way I describe here on the grails messageboard - http://www.nabble.com/has-many-through-relationship-query---GORM--td23438096.html Including commentary from the author, Robert Fischer, of "Grails Persistence with GORM and GSQL". @chadsmall
