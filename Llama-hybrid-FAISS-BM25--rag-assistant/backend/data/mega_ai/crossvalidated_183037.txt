1 or 2 independent variables,18 dependent variables

I am having trouble selecting the right statistical analysis to answer my question. I have 1 categorical (two-levels) predictor, 1 categorical (two-level) independent variable that I would like to control for, and 18 dependent, continious variables. I need to find out which of the dependent variables are significantly different as a result of the predictor. The data meet the assumptions of normality and homogeneity of variance. A MANOVA does not provide me with enough information, as I really need to single out the dependent variables. Otherwise, I suppose I could perform 18 t-tests, and correct to minimize the type-I error, but that does not seem very elegant. Is there perhaps a test that I have overlooked? Thanks in advance! * 4 groups of mice have been trained in a learning paradigm during either 3 sessions (2 groups) or 5 sessions (2 groups). In both condition of training duration, some animals were "sham operated" (SH) and some other were lesioned in the dorsal hippocampus (H).n1 hr after the last session, mice were sacrificed and the number of zif immunopositive cells per surface unit was counted in 19 structures. In these conditions, we can consider that this measure reflects the activity of the structure during the last session of the task. - Which are the structures that are differentially activated depending on the duration of training ? *
