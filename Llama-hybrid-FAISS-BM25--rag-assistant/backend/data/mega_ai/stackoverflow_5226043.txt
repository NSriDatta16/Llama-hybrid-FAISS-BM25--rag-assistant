Java: What is a good data structure for storing a coordinate map for an infinite game world?

I am used to coding in PHP but I am not really proficient with Java and this has been a problem for some time now. I expect it to be a fairly easy solution, however I cannot find any good example code any way I search it, so here goes: I am programming a game that takes place in a 2d random generated infinite world on a tile based map (nitpicking: I know it will not be truly infinite. I just expect the world to be quite large). The usual approach of map[x][y] multidimensional array started out as a basic idea, but since Java does not provide a way for non-integer (i.e. negative) array key shenanigans like PHP does, I cannot properly have a (-x,+x,-y,+y) coordinate system with array keys. I need to be able to find the objects on a tile at a specific x,y coordinate as well as finding "adjacent tiles" of a certain tile. (Trivial if I can getObjectAt(x,y), I can get(x+1,y) and so on) I have read about quad trees and R-trees and the like. The concept is exciting, however I haven't seen any good, simple example implementation in Java. And besides I am not really sure if that is what I need exactly. Any advice is welcome Thank you
