How to get validation accuracy in neural network training?

The following plot shows over fitting in training using training accuracy and validation accuracy during training. How to get that plot in training? My understanding is that we have training set and test set of data for training. Using test data set, we test the training model how is the accuracy. To have that plot, do we still need another validate data set and validate net to be used during training? I am confused about that. Then my another query is that, during training we have train net and test net. Example using caffe training, how trained weights in train net are transferred to test net, so that test net is used to test in training. How is that implemented?
