Understanding statistics numbers vs. counters

Suppose I analyze text and find that there are: Word count: 3465 Number of lines: 130 Number of paragraphs: 5 Are these actually statistics of the text? I am not sure because statistics involves "collection of data" but these are just "counters" of some variables. I have also seen similar examples in other fields like games where you have "game stats" which are also simply "counters". How are these counters "statistics", wheres "collection of data samples" in this?
