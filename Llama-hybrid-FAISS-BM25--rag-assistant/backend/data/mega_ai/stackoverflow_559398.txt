Work on Embedding Mozilla within Delphi appears to have stalled some years ago but there is a still an article from Irongut on embedding it. It was never a fully satisfactory solution as I understand it because it required a hefty additional distribution of Mozilla files (even if the user already had Mozilla/FF installed). As Gamecat suggested, Google Earth can achieve some nice results. I found a simple sample project of Embedding Google Earth within a Delphi Application on a the " Google Earth Airlines site ". This might be enough to show you whether this solution might fit your needs.
