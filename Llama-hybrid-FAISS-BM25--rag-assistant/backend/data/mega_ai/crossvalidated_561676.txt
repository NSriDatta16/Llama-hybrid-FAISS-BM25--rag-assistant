Wilcoxon test for independent groups, but with repeated measurements

I need to compare the average amount of money earned by the control group versus the experimental group on a trial level. Each group has 25 subjects. The variable doesn't have a normal distribution, and the people from each group are different, so they're independent samples , and I should do a Wilcoxon sum rank test/ Mann-Whitney. BUT: each subject earned money 240 times, So I have 240 trials/observations coming from the same subject . Meaning I have repeated measures on this level. The following is what I currently have in R: wilcox.test(df$Earnings ~ df$Group, mu=0, conf.int=T, conf.level= 0.95, paired= F, var.eq=F, exact = F, correct= F) Is there a way to account for the repeated measures of the trials when comparing two independent groups?
