getting userbase vote average and individual user's vote in the same query?

Here goes: T1 [id] [desc] 1 lovely 2 ugly 3 slender T2 [id] [userid] [vote] 1 1 3 1 2 5 1 3 2 2 1 1 2 2 4 2 3 4 In one query (if possible) I'd like to return: T1.id, T1.desc, AVG(T2.vote), T2.vote (for user viewing the page) I can get the first 3 items with: SELECT T1.id, T1.desc, AVG(T2.vote) FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.id=T2.id GROUP BY T1.id and I can get the first, second, and fourth items with: SELECT T1.id, T1.desc, T2.vote FROM T1 LEFT JOIN T2 ON T1.id=T2.id WHERE T2.userid='1' GROUP BY T1.id but I'm at a loss as to how to get all four items in one query. I tried inserting a select as the fourth term: SELECT T1.id , T1.desc , AVG(T2.vote) , (SELECT T2.vote FROM T2 WHERE T2.userid='1') AS userVote etc etc but I get an error that the select returns more than one row... Help? My reason for wanting to do this in one query instead of two is that I want to be able to sort the data within MySQL rather than one it's been split into a number of arrays.
