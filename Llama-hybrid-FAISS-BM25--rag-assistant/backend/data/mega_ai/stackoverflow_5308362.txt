Android : Minimum Length of password in edittext

In android is there any simple way of setting minimum password length in edittext? In xml there is only an option of max length but not minimum. Options like setting ems and width fits for restricting the length but what about when to set minimum length??? I found this in the documentation: DevicePolicyManager mDPM; ComponentName mDeviceAdminSample; int pwLength; ... mDPM.setPasswordMinimumLength(mDeviceAdminSample, pwLength); But is there any simpler method other than this?
