Notation for conditional within a probability distribution

I'm reading an excellent tutorial on variational autoencoders by Carl Doersch. However, he uses the following notation to define the generative distribution: $$ P(X|z;\theta) = N(X|f(z;\theta), \sigma^{2} * I) $$ I interpret this to mean that our reconstruction of the observed variable $X$ is a normal distribution with $\mu$ defined by some function $f(z;\theta)$ and covariance $\sigma^{2}$ . And he uses this notation to describe the latent deep Gaussian distribution on $Z$ : $$P(Z) = N(Z|0,I)$$ Which I interpret to mean that the latent variable Z is drawn from a (potentially multi-variate) normal distribution with $\mu$ vector of 0 and covariance $I$ . I don't understand what the difference between the above and simply writing $$P(Z) = N(0,I)$$ and $$P(X|z;\theta) = N(f(z; \theta), \sigma^{2} * I) $$ . What is the difference conceptually? Is there any, or is it just a matter of style?
