Human emotions are infinitely complex. However, humans emotions are sometimes reduced to the binary classification of positive or negative. That reduction makes the problem more tractable for machine learning. In your example, the term "iPhone" can be labeled be as positive because the word "good" can be labeled as positive. There should be caution generalizing a single sentence to entities that are not included (i.e., "Apple" or "Samsung").
