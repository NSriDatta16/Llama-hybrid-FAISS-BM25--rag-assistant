Just googled this topic and came across a techcrunch article regarding visual.ly , a company that automates infographic generation for brands like Nat Geo, The Atlantic, GOOD Magazine CNNMoney.com, and Ebay. Their website indicates they will eventual.ly allow anyone to create these infographics. Hope this helps.
