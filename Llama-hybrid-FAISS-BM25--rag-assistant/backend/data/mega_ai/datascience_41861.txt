I guess its common to start with "An Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie and Robert Tibshirani" and then, if you want a deeper picture, move to "The Elements of Statistical Learning, by Jerome H. Friedman, Robert Tibshirani, and Trevor Hastie". I also really like the video course based on the first book, taught by Hastie and Tibshirani ( if im not mistaken) - a real gem in my mind. From my perspective its a good way to get both practical and teoretical background for machine learning.
