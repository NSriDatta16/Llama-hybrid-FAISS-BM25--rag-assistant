Help needed in interpreting the loss, val_loss vs epoch plots for an autoencoder training?

I am training a variational autoencoder and I am getting a loss-plot as follows: Rigt after epoch 224, val-loss overtakes train-loss and sort of getting bigger but at an extremely slow pace as you can notice. I trained for 300 epochs. Any opinion about the training. I don't think it is overfitting the data. But I want to be sure and hence seeking opinion from the data science community. Thanks.
