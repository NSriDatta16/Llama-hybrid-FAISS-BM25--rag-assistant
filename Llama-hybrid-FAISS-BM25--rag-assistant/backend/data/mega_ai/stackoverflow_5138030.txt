SOLR for indexing, Jackrabbit for document storage. Managing Liferay Document Library in code is fairly easy, just look at the DL*LocalServiceUtil classes, namely DLFolderLocalServiceUtil and DLFileLocalServiceUtil . By default Liferay just creates a matching folder/file structure on the hard drive (with names changed) so you'd only need to write code or use Jackrabbit if you wanted more than this since Liferay allows up/download and viewing out of the box via the control panel and various portlets. I haven't used JackRabbit with Liferay but once configured everything should be managed under the covers and you shouldn't need to worry about it on the front end. When you say "with all metadata available" I'm not sure what is retained, but aside from renaming the file so that it can be tracked there shouldn't be any other changes. It should be quick and easy to test by uploading a file of each type and checking the entries in the LIFERAY/data/document_library directory and subdirectories. Again this would be different if Jackrabbit is used.
