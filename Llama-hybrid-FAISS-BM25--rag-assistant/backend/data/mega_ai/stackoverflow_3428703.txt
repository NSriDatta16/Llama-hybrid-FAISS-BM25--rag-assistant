The proper way to do that is to override the drawRect: method of the UIView subclass (your draggable views in this case.) When you subclass UIView to create a custom class that draws itself, implement the drawRect: method to draw the view within the specified region. This method is invoked the first time a view displays or when an event occurs that invalidates a part of the viewâ€™s frame requiring it to redraw its content. You can see some instructions for doing custom drawing at: drawrect: Good luck.
