Converting latitude/longitude to Alberta 10 TM Projection

I need to convert latitude/longitude coordinates into Easting/Northing coordinates in the Alberta 10 TM Projection. The 10 TM projection is similar to UTM, but it is a custom projection for the province of Alberta, Canada. I think (with some effort) I could code it myself but would rather not reinvent the wheel if it's been done already.
