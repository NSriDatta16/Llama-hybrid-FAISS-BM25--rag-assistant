It might be the backwards way and not helpful in this case, but anyway: If you want to check out what's in the loaded CSS files, you can get the loaded stylesheets with var sheets = document.styleSheets; , and access the first one with sheets[0]; Then, get the rules from it: var rules = sheets[0].cssRules ? sheets[0].cssRules : sheets[0].rules; Then loop through the rules to check them out: var rule, selector; for (var idx=0, len=rules.length; idx '+ rule.style.cssText); } This is more or less straight from David Flanagan's great book "Javascript, the Definitive Guide (5th ed.)"
