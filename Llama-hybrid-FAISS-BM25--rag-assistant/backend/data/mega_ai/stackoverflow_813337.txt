Grow organically. Pre optimization is the root of all evil, Dijkstra once said. Also keep YANGI (you ain't gonna need it) in mind. Every application gets its own folder with trunk/tag/branches. If the a project within an application gets really big, then it gets pushed to it's own separate folder and can be linked to the application at build time (or even svn:externals). That said, if your project requirements are to develop a complex application written by 10 developers and you are the gatekeeper or build master then you can consider more complex alternatives.
