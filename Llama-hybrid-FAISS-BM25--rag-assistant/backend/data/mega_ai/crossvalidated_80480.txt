Since there seems to be some structure in your data, I think using a model and replacing the missing values with fits would be adequate. Perhaps a simple basic structural model (BSM) with local trend and seasonality would be all that is needed ( StructTS affords an easy way to fit these models, and tsSmooth gives you smoothed values, using past and future observations). Replacing real data with smoothed values is not really satisfactory: the replacement values are "too regular", lacking the noise present in real observations. Depending on your purposes and the amount of effort you want to put in this, you might turn to the simulation smoother (see for instance Time Series Analyisis by State Space Methods ) or multiple imputation methods (see for instance package Amelia in R).
