I would create a separate project containing only your tests. Reference your infrastructure project from the testing project. It doesn't make much sense to ship your production code out with your unit tests, even if they are not accessed via the winform or web interface. Additionally, consider using MVP architecture pattern with Dependency Injection to organize your classes and make your presenter and other components more test friendly.
