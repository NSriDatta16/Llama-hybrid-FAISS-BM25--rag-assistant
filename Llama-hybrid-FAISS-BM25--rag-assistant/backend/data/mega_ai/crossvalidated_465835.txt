removing outliers in skewed data for xgboost

i have a couple of columns in my data which are postively skewed. they are non-normal from the hist plots. plotting a qq plot further cinfirms this. i should remove outliers from my data for xgboost. however what method should i use to remove outliers from postively skewed dataset. i have considered log transform and cube root to transform but this still leaves it skewed (note i do have some negative values which are expected)
