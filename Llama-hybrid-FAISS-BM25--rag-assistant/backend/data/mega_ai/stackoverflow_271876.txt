You can write a custom login hook for mediaWiki. I've done it for LibraryThing so that login credentials from our main site are carried over to our mediaWiki installation. The authentication hook extends mediaWiki's AuthPlugin. There are several small issues: mediaWiki usernames must start with initial caps (so if you allow case sensitive user names it could be a problem if two users have colliding wiki names) underscores in usernames are converted to spaces in mediaWiki But if you can deal with those then it is certainly possible to use your own user/password data with mediaWiki. Advantages: The user doesn't have to login to each area separately. Once they login to the main site they are logged into the wiki also. You know that usernames are the same across the systems and can leverage that in links, etc.
