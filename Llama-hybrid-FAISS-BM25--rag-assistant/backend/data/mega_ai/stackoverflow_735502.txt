Our Data Dynamics Reports product includes a End User Designer Control for Windows Forms that you can drag & Drop onto a Windows Forms and provide a full-featured report designer to your end users. Visit the Data Dynamics Reports Product Page , select the Features tab and look at the heading "Designer control" near the bottom of the features page. Although not the main focus of this screencast , it does show a bit about the End User Designer control. Finally, if you download the free evaluation (click Download the main product page ) select Sample Gallery from the Start Menu (under Data Dynamics). The Sample Gallery form that pops up is a detailed demonstration of using our End User Designer control. Scott Willeke Data Dynamics / GrapeCity
