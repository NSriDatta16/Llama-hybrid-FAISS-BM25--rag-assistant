How to generate an alternating range?

I need to search for an item in a list around a given index with in a given radius. Currently I use this function to generate alternating offsets for the search: def generateSearchIndizes(radius): for i in range(1, radius + 1): yield i yield -i The code that does the search looks something like this: for i in generateSearchIndizes(): if pred(myList[baseIndex + i]): result = myList[baseIndex + i] break # terminate search when first item is found My question is, is there a more elegant way to generate the search indizes, maybe without defining a special function?
