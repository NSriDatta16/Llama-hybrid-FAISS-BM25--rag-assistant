How to apply PCA for principal component regression?

I am pretty new to PCA so please bear with me. I have already read some papers and articles online talking about how PCA reduces the dimension, but I'm still not sure how to actually use it. Say I have a dataset represented as a matrix: $$[X_1\ X_2\ X_3\ X_4\ X_5\ Y]$$ where $Y$ is my response. Now, do I apply PCA to this whole matrix or only to the independent variables $[X_1\ X_2\ X_3\ X_4\ X_5 ]$? I suspect that we are supposed to apply PCA only to $X$'s. Applying PCA to $[X_1\ X_2\ X_3\ X_4\ X_5]$, we will have some eigenvectors and we may pick two of them: $$\alpha = 0.3X_1 + 0.4 X_5$$ and $$\beta = 0.5X_3 + 0.8 X_4$$ Then we regress $Y$ against $\alpha$ and $\beta$?
