Is this summary of MCMC correct?

I'm making some self-study notes for Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and want to check my understanding before proceeding. After reading a few papers and tutorials this is what I've synthesised: What We can't directly evaluate the posterior as the normalising constant is too hard to calculate for interesting problems Instead we sample from it We do this by engineering a Markov chain that has the same stationary distribution as the target distribution (the posterior in our case) When we have reached this stationary state we continue to run the Markov chain and sample from it to build up our empirical distribution of the posterior How All Markov chains are completely described by their transition probabilities We therefore control/engineer the Markov chain by controlling the transition probabilities All MCMC algorithms work from this principal but the exact method for generating these transition probabilites differs from algorithm to algorithm If we have a particular algorithm for generating these transition probabilities, we can verify that it converges to the stationary distribution by using the detailed balance equation on the proposed transition probabilities Thus the remaining challenge is to come up with a method to generate these transition probabilities
