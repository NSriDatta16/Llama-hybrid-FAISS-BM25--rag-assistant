Fastest place to retrieve images in android

I'm developing a small social networking app that makes use of something like profile pictures. Images are stored on a server and I have scripts set up that will send the image for each user to the app, which then displays it in an image view for each user, and then saves the image to external storage. The way I have it implemented now is that anytime the app needs the image after it downloads it from the server, the app will get the image from external storage unless a user has uploaded a new image (I thought this would be faster than redownloading it from the server every time). However, it seems to be taking longer to get the file from external storage than it does to get it from my server (and the server is pretty slow, running on wifi from 3 floors away...budget constrains :) ). My question is what is the fastest way to get these images if the user hasn't uploaded a new one. Should I just downlaod it from the server everytime (I'm assuming not) or is there a better place in the filesystem to store the images that makes for faster retrieval?
