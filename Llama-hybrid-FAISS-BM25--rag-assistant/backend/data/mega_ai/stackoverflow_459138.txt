I have used AIR quite successfully for this sort of thing, and intend to converge with you at the MVC abstraction level. From one of my SO questions, my attention was directed to this . Maybe you could look it over and let me know what you think. At a high level it seems to coincide with your description of your design. I'm using AMF - tried starting with JSON but AMF is more direct and for my purposes functionally equivalent. My app is used by a couple dozen people across random platforms, Windows and Mac and Linux. Installation is painless. I post one installation package, and the Adobe installer figures out what runtime stuff is needed for the platform being served, and makes sure things are set up correctly with no attention on my part. It completely abstracts out platform dependencies, and there was no learning curve.
