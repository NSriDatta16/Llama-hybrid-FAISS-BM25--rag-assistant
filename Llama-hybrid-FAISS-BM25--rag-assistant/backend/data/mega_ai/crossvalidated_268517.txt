At what level are covariates held constant in multiple logistic regression?

I'm running a multiple logistic regression with several continuous and categorical covariates. I was wondering how to interpret the results of each covariate if the others are held constant. At what level are continuous control variables held? Are they held at their mean? I believe that for categorical control variables, the reference category is the level at which it is held. What if I want to hold it to another level, such as one coded, 1 or 2?
