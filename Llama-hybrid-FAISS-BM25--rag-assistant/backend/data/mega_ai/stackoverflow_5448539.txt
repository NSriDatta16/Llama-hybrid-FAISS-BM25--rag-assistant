It looks like you are using the ApplicationBar like you would use a TabBar within iPhone (or similar in Android, Bada, etc too) In WP7, the Metro style is typpically to use a Pivot or Panorama rather than a "Tab Bar" for this type of navigation. If you do want to use the ApplicationBar like this: then you can (the WP7 Marketplace will allow it) but users might feel it's not very Metro. then you might want to consider disabling the appropriate button rather than just stubbing out the action. then you can detect the currently shown page using CurrentSource on the NavigationService Also, please do note that if you try to navigate from MainPage.xaml to the same url MainPage.xaml then you will see an exception - as I recall, the navigation service complains about url fragments not being supported.
