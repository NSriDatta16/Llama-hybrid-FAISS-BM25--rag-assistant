How to compute feature-space distance?

some CV research papers use nearest neighbors techniques to compare images, such as PROGRESSIVE GROWING OF GANS FOR IMPROVED QUALITY, STABILITY, AND VARIATION Next five rows: Nearest neighbors found from the training data, based on feature-space distance . What is "feature-space distance" in this context? How to compute the feature-space distance" in this context? Could someone please give a hint?
