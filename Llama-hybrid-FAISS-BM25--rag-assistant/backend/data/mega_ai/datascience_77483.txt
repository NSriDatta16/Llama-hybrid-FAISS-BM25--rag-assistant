In the convolution layer of the convolutional neural network (CNN), each output value depends on a small number of input values, known as the sparsity of connections. In neural network usage, "dense" connections connect all inputs. By contrast, a CNN is "sparse" because only the local "patch" of pixels is connected, instead using all pixels as an input.
