iOS Legacy Support, is it worthwhile?

I need to add a method to an app I am writing that only works on iOS 4 (and above), there is a way I can do it that works on anything above iOS 2 but Apple says that the use of this older method is discouraged in iPhone OS 4.0 and later. My question is if I go with the newer iOS 4 method will I be severely limiting the user base of the app. I would assume that most folks have upgraded to iOS 4, but I really have no idea on the numbers involved. I am just curious as to what others think?
