I have an app with a pretty large cache (>100mb). This takes a particularly long time to swap the cache in (and pretty much locks the browser while this is happening). So I display a message indicating that the app is updating (please wait...), then call swapCache() , then display a new message when it's done indicating completion. Not sure if this answers your question (as to why it's necessarily needed ), but I think it provides a valid use case for swapCache() at least.
