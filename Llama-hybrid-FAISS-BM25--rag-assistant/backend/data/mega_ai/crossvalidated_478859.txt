Why does BERT has a limitation of only allowing the maximum length of the input tokens as 512?

I have seen BERT was one of the state-of-the-arts word embedding method in 2018 and then XLNet is proposed in 2019 to take care of the limitations of BERT. I have seen one limitation of BERT is the the maximum length of input tokens (which is 512, see this link ). Does anyone know the reason?
