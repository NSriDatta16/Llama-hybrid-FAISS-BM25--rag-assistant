Determine accuracy of model on train data with Pandas DataFrame

I am trying to compare the accuracy of my XGBoost model output to that of a test set (data encoded in binary). My data is stored in a Pandas DataFrame. I am doing this with SKLearn by: accuracy = accuracy_score(testData,predictions) However, I am getting the error: ValueError: Can't handle mix of multilabel-indicator and binary I am getting this despite both DataFrames containing the same columns and datatypes. I am not sure what to do next. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks! Edit: Upon inspection, it seems that my predictions DataFrame is instead a Numpy array. I believe this may be causing the problem.
