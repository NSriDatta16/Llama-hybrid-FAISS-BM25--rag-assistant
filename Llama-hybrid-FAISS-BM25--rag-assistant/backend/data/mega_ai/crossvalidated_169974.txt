If I understand you correctly, the method you are looking for is multinomial (polytomous) logistic regression (mlogit in Stata, for R see http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/r/dae/mlogit.htm ). In most packages the outcome category that is most frequent becomes the reference category and you get two sets of regression results for the other two categories as compared to the reference category outcome. You can always change the reference outcome if preferred. The interpretation of the coefficients is the same as logistic regression - log odds, and again in comparison to the reference outcome. Another possibility is to use conditional logistic regression.
