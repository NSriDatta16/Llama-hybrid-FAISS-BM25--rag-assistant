Aside from switching to a Bayesian approach, how can I quantify the strength of evidence for a null result of a linear mixed effects model?

I've run a linear mixed effects model with a null result that would be quite interesting for the field. Is there a test I can run that would bolster the claim that the two groups are indeed equivalent? I know that Bayesian analyses are ideal for this, but I am hesitant because of a lack of previous literature that could provide a prior. Would simply running a post-hoc power analysis be enough?
