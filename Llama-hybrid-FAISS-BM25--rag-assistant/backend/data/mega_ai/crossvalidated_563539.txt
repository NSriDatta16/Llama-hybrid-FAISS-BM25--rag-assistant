The reason for this is that we might potentially want to look arbitrarily far back in time and so we set up the mathematics of our problem in a way that allows us to do that. This doesn't even hinge on making $t=1$ the current time --- even if we were to take some higher positive value $t_0 > 1$ as the current time, if we wanted to look back $t_0+2$ time periods before the current time we would get a negative index. If you were to proceed in the contrary fashion, by limiting the time-series to non-negative time indices then your time index would be bounded from below , so there would always be a limit on how far backward you could look from any time period. We generally don't wish to limit ourselves in this way a priori and so it is usual to define time series over the unbounded set of time values $t \in \mathbb{Z}$ .
