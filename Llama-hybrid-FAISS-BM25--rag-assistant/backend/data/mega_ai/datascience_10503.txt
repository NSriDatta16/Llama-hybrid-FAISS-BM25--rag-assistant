I don't think there is any academic work on the subject, at least that I know of. One simple way of using that data would be to use the mean of the ratings or other average like measures such as a moving average , a time weighted average , the median , etc. But this approach is probably not exactly what you're looking for. Try to look at collaborative filtering approaches with temporal dynamics, there might be something interesting for you.
