Is there a name for a moving average when it is done not across time but some other variable?

The moving average is defined as A method of smoothing a time series to reduce the effects of random variation and reveal any underlying trend or seasonality. (Oxford Dictionary of Statistics, ed. by Graham Upton and Ian Cook) What if we apply similar measures to non-time series data? E.g. if we plot (say) height on the x axis and weight on the y axis, we could do something very similar to an MA. Is this still called a moving average? Or does it have some other name? (A general term would be a smooth, but MA is a specific kind of smooth).
