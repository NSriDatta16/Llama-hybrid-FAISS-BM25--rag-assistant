The answer is to not run the servers as daemons. We were doing this so that the servers were automatically shut down when the junit task had completed, but in reality, the Cobertura instrumentation wasn't picking up the fact that the servers were shutting down and so never wrote out the various cobertura.ser files. The solution was to remove the daemons task, and to add an explicit server shutdown mechanism which we could call from Ant once the tests were complete.
