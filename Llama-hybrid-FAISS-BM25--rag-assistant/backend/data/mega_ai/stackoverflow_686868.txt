Java implementation of planarity testing/planar embedding

Is there a free Java implementation of any of the major planarity testing algorithms? Boyer-Myrvold, de Fraysseix-Rosenstiehl, heck, even Hopcroft-Tarjan. I've been reading the papers and they all seem fairly complex, and I'd rather skip all the work of implementing them myself if someone else has already done so.
