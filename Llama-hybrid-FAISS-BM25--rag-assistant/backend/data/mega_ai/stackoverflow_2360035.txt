How to set a value in a ViewModel from binding?

Kind of an odd question- if I'm thinking of this the wrong way please let me know. I am using an infragistics dock manager, which manages tabs as well. So I can create a TabGroupPane , and then add multiple ContentPanes , each of which has its own tab. In each content pane, I set my viewmodel: So here's the problem- while using a mediator pattern for communication, my viewmodels have no idea if they are on the visible tab or not, so they are always working even if hidden. The TabGroupPane does have a SelectedTab property, as well as each ContentPane having an IsActive property. So the question is how do I set that information in my ViewModel? Making my VM a dependency object seems like a bad idea since I already implement INotifyPropertyChanged . Using a CLR prop in my VM also doesnt work, since you cannot bind to it. How can I get my VM to know if it is the datacontext of an active tab? Thanks!
