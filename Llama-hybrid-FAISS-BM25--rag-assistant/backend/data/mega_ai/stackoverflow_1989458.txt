I don't think it is possible to indicate a specific threshold for marshalling. It is application dependent. What you should do is measure how long each call takes on average. Write a test application that simply makes a bunch of calls to unmanaged code and time it. Then using the "Chattiness" counter on your application, you should be able to estimate the total cost of the switches between managed and unmanaged code. I had to do this exact thing a couple of years ago. I was using an unmanaged DLL to read values from a chunk of data. I measured the calls and found it to be relatively expensive due to the high number of calls, so I made a single call to retrieve the chunk of data and then extracted the values from that data in managed code. It was more work to code but provided a fairly significant speed increase.
