How to generate a sanitized dataset using Differential privacy?

I'm learning about differential privacy. I understand the concept behind differential privacy, that you can add a small noise to the query to mask the true value using transformations like Laplace or exponential. I'm not able to grasp how can I use it to generate a synthetic dataset from real data for data analysis or machine learning. Also, It will very helpful if someone can guide me towards papers or materials related to this.
