Why do coefficients in a binary logistic regression model differ according to the number of predictor variables?

I fit a binary logistic regression model with a single categorical variable, for which I received a coefficient. When I added further categorical predictor variables, the coefficient of the original categorical variable changed. What is the reason for this? That is, why is the coefficient of a predictor variable sensitive to the presence of other predictor variables in the model?
