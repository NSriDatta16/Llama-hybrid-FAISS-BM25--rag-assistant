This is probably best handled by using a SVM library that allows you to create a custom kernel function (e.g. libSVM, SVMLight, scikits). Then you would have to write a Hamming distance function to compute the distance between two strings and plug it in as the kernel function. The only problem is, I'm not sure Hamming distance actually is a kernel, as in it satisfies Mercer's conditions . It's obviously symmetric, but I don't know whether it's positive definite.
