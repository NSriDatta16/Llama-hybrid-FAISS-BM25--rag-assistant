Why the length of the weight vector is likely to grow?

In the book Michael Nielsen's Neural Networks and Deep Learning, in chapter 3 he writes: "Heuristically, if the cost function is unregularized, then the length of the weight vector is likely to grow, all other things being equal". Can you explain why the length of the weight vector is likely to grow?
