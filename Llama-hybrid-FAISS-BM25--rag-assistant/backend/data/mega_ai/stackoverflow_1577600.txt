Folder permissions is just to make sure your httpd/Apache user can write to that folder. Actually you don't need to chmod 777 for your storage folder. Just make sure to either set owner to root and group to the Apache/httpd user you are running or just simply set the folder owner to your Apache user. chmod 774 /upload/folder : writable for owner and group and the others just read. PHP: if somehow that folder refers to user document root folder you can disable the PHP engine for that particular virtualhost. If that folder is part of your system/application document root folder editing the .htaccess file and using the removeHandler Apache directive might do the trick.
