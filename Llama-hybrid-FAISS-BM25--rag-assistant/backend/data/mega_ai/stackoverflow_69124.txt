So? Dedicate a server to your Access databases. Now you have the benefit of some sort of usage tracking, and also the ability to pay more attention to some of the important decentralised data that is stored in these apps. This is what you were going to do anyway, only you wanted to use a different database engine instead of NTFS. And now you have to force the users onto your server. Well, you can encourage them by telling them that you aren't going to overwrite their data with old backups anymore, because now you will own the data, and you won't do that anymore. Also, you can tell them that their applications will run faster now, because you are going to exclude the folder from on-access virus scanning (you don't do that to your other databases, which is why they are full of sql-injection malware, but these databases won't be exposed to the internet), and planning to turn packet signing off (you won't need that on a dedicated server: it's only for people who put their file-share on their domain-server). Easy upgrade path, improved service to users, greater centralization and control for IT. Everyone's a winner.
