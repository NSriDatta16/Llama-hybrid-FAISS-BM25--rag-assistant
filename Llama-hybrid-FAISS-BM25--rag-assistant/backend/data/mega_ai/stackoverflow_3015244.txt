1 - The Smarty engine is very useful and probably the most popular in PHP application development. 2 - I use Aptana studio for PHP development. It's pretty complete and has nice tools coupled with it. It's based on the Eclipse IDE, so it's pretty customizable. The major drawback is that it uses a lot of resources. 3 - I recommend learning development patterns like MVC (Model - View - Controller) to get a good base of how data should be organized. Also, look up Code Igniter, It's an amazing framework to work with (it uses the MVC pattern). Building something with it is really easy and very easily manageable. If you want simple tutorials, you can check on NetTuts for a serie of tutorials.
