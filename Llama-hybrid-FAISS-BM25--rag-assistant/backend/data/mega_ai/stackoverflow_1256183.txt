What about using strip_tags , which should do just the job ? For instance (quoting the doc) : Test paragraph. Other text '; echo strip_tags($text); echo "\n"; will give you : Test paragraph. Other text Edit : but note that strip_tags doesn't validate what you give it. Which means that this code : $text = "this is Will get you : string 'this is ' (length=8) (Everything after the thing that looks like a starting tag gets removed).
