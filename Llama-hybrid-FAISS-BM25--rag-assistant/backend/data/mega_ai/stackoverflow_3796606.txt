Chrome, Javascript, JSON and __proto__ -- where are my methods?

I've got a function: function createOrLoadDB (host) { var db = JSON.parse( window.localStorage.getItem(host) ) if ( db == null ) { db = new InitDB(host) } else { db.__proto__ = InitDB.prototype } return db } That to me seems like it would work, but when I call db.flushDB() I get TypeError: Object # has no method 'flushDB' Which is funny, because I've got that in my object def: function InitDB ( host ) { ... stuff this.flushDB = function () { window.localStorage.setItem( this.host, JSON.stringify( this ) ) } ... stuff } Am, I missing something. The __proto__ made it say # , but it still isn't picking up the methods...
