I think it really depends on your coding style. If you read " Clean Code " by Uncle Bob, you (which I personally loved), you're encouraged to write methods or functions that are called by each other closely together. In this case, using the visibility of a method as in example B would make sense: class Foo def method1 method2 end def method2 .. end private :method2 end Uncle Bob actually makes a good case for having methods close together, since this prevents scrolling in your code.
