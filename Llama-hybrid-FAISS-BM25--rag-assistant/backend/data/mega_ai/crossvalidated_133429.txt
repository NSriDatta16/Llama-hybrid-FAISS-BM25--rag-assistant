Using monthly product usage data to predict customer churn

I've been reading tons of papers detailing methods on predicting customer attrition, but none of them have mentioned using product usage data over time. We keep detailed logs of how many times User A uses X feature in the past month, but I'm not sure how to incorporate these into a predictive model. For example, the model ideally would look at past cancellations and look at their trending behavior a few months before they cancel their contract. Unlike other time series papers I've read, we don't want to predict the customers' usage based on their past usage -- we want to predict whether or not based on present usage, a customer is on track to cancel.
