Given that this has now been taken off hold, I will re-enter my comment, which was in effect an answer, as an answer. In the Wikipedia article example, each individual data point is not supposed to get different weights. In this case, all len_mc + len_ac number of individual data points are equally weighted. The 2 different weights (in this case, 0.4 and 0.6) only come into play if we want to consider the averages of mc and ac as being 1 data point each (i.e., one data point for mc, and one data point for ac); then we apply the Wikipedia weighted average formula to combine the averages of mc and ac. What you have done with weighted_mean2 is to more heavily weight each individual data point in ac than each individual data point in mc, and that is why you don't get the correct answer - or put another way, you have solved a different ("wrong") problem.
