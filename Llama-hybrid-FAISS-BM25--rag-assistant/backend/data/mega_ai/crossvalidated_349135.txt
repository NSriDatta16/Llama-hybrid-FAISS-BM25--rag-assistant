What are the optimized "data" given parameter? Use of "symmetry" of Bayesian theorem

I am interested in "reverse" way. Suppose you already managed to get the model parameter$\theta$, given data $D$ through optimization. What you did is exactly below. $p(\theta|D)=\frac{p(D|\theta)p(\theta)}{p(D)}$ What are the likely "model parameter $\theta$ " given data $D$? Now, by using " Symmetry of Bayesian theorem", one can also say, $p(D|\theta)=\frac{p(\theta|D)p(D)}{p(\theta)}$ What are the likely "data $D$ " given model parameter $\theta$ ? So, after calculated parameter $\theta$, now you are in search for Data $D$ ,... better data,.. data that explains a given parameter/Model best. I am wondering if there is any research or paper talking about this by using the symmetry of Bayesian theorem. Thank you
