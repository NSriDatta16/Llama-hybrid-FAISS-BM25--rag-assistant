Keep ConnectionString in LINQ designer file

Whenever I drop a new database object from server explorer into the dbml, Visual Studio replaces the connection string in the designer file with a new one that it automatically adds to the connection strings in my config file. They both have exactly the same parameters, just different names. How do I force Visual Studio to use and keep the connection string I already have? For example, in the dbml-designer.cs, I have this: base(global::System.Configuration.ConfigurationManager.ConnectionStrings["ConnString1"].ConnectionString, mappingSource) which is automatically generated. In my config file, I have: Where ConnString1 is added automatically whenever I drag a database object to the dbml. I want the designer.cs to use DefaultConnstring.
