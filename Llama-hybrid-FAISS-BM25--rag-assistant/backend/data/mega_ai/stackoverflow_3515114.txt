What is the best database/storage to store statistic data?

I'm having a system that collects real-time Apache log data from about 90-100 Web Servers. I had also defined some url patterns. Now I want to build another system that updates the time of occurrence of each pattern based on those logs. I had thought about using MySQL to store statistic data, update them by statement: " Update table set count =count+1 where .... ", but i'm afraid that MySQL will be slow for data from such amount of servers. Moreover, I'm looking for some database/storage solutions that more scalable and simple. (As a RDBMS, MySQL supports too much things that I don't need in this situation) . Do you have any idea ?
