actually, validation uses Page.Validators where all the validators are stored (the actual routine is quity tricky) - so it does not matter, where you add them. source of BaseValidator protected internal override void OnInit(EventArgs e) { base.OnInit(e); this.Page.Validators.Add(this); } i would leave them in th view, as you could use object sender -parameter (which represents the validator) to get the associated control ... i believe, your CreateChildControls - which does the attaching of the validators - is called to late, so it misses the validation phase ... could you maybe try to call EnsureChildControls in OnLoad -event, to see if it changes something? another chance might be, that your validators are not visible or disabled... EDIT according to your edits, i would encourage you to use a CustomValidator - a RequiredFieldValidator will return true on each case (property is true or false ), because it is not empty :)
