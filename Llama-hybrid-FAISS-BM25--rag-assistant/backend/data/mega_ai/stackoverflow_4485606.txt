Using various Eclipse ini files

I am using a software client based on Eclipse (Ganymede) and its all working fine. However, one small thing would make my world perfect... In the Eclipse home folder, there is an ini-file. Is there a way to have various ini-files and choose (for example by arguments or environment variables) a specific ini file and create a shortcut for it? Many thanks,
