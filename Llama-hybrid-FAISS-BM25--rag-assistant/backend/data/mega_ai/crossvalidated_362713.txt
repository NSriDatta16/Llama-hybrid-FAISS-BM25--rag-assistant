time series decomposition seasonal_decompose

I have two time series and I did a decomposition for both in python using seasonal_decompose from statsmodels.tsa.seasonal using freq = 7. I'm thinking they have weekly seasonality. This one shows weekly seasonality as I think. The second one I also used same parameter,but somehow there is jitter in the seasonal component. What do you think what might cause this behavior? Thanks.
