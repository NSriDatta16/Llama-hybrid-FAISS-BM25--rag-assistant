Selecting optimal number of input features and optimal number of hidden layers for a MLP?

What is the best way to select parameters for a binary neural network classifier? More specifically I have 265 features ranked according to Mutual Information Criterion. I have to determine the optimal number of inputs and the optimal number of hidden layer nodes for use in a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). Note: The selecting of the optimal number of hidden nodes and optimal number of input features are not independent.
