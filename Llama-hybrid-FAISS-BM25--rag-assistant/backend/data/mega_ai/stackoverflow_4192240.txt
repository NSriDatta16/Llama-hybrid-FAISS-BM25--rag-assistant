Moving an object without animating it in an animation block

I'm animating a bunch of buttons so they move to the left of the screen then they should magically move to the right of the screen. I do this by calling: [NSTimer scheduledTimerWithTimeInterval:0.20 target:self selector:@selector(moveTheButtons) userInfo:nil repeats:YES]; in viewDidLoad. They animate quite happily to the left, but then they animate back to the right. I just want them to disappear and reappear to the right-off-screen. Because I'm new I assumed that since it was after the commitAnimations call that it wouldn't animate. I think the problem is that the animations actually 'commit' after the moveTheButtons function returns, but I can't think of an elegant (or standard) way around this. How do I move the UIButton off screen without animating it, preferably still in the moveTheButtons function? As you can probably infer, I'm new to animations on the iPhone, so if you see any other mistakes I'm making feel free to give me some pointers. -(void)moveTheButtons{ NSLog(@"moveTheButtons"); [UIView beginAnimations:@"mov-ey" context:cloudA]; [UIView setAnimationDuration: .20]; [UIView setAnimationCurve:UIViewAnimationCurveLinear]; cloudA.center = CGPointMake(cloudA.center.x-pos.x,cloudA.center.y); [UIView commitAnimations]; if(cloudA.center.x
