Have you looked at scripting repositories: http://www.hotscripts.com/category/php/scripts-programs/auctions/ Bearing in mind the nature of auction services, and the need for secure transaction placing/processing, any script that has this in place to a reasonably safe degree is more than likely priced, and will have a far more enriched featureset that the one you are looking for. If you are looking to create a public auction portal, I would recommend a paid for service/platform and/or leveraging off the toolsets from major vendors like ebay. If it is for your own personal use, you can create something pretty easily using PHP/mySQL/(JS) and then plug it into paypal or similar for payment processing. That said, again, because you are dealing in monetary exchange- I would strongly recommend a professional solution.
