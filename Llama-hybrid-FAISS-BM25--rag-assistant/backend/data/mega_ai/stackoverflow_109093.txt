What do you means with "Best algorithm"? The shorted code or the fasted code? Your code look very elegant and it has a constant execution time. The code is also very short. But if the speed is the major factor and not the code size then I think the follow can be faster: static final int[] BIT_COUNT = { 0, 1, 1, ... 256 values with a bitsize of a byte ... }; static int bitCountOfByte( int value ){ return BIT_COUNT[ value & 0xFF ]; } static int bitCountOfInt( int value ){ return bitCountOfByte( value ) + bitCountOfByte( value >> 8 ) + bitCountOfByte( value >> 16 ) + bitCountOfByte( value >> 24 ); } I think that this will not more faster for a 64 bit value but a 32 bit value can be faster.
