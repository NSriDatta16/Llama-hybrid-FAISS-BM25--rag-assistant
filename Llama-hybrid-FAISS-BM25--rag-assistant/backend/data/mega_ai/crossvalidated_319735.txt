In a frequentist approach this fixed effect model has an unindentifiability problem ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Identifiability ) for $\beta_1$ and $\alpha_i$ for those subjects that have only one measurement. These subjects do not have a slope and do not contribute to the estimation of $\beta_2$. In a Bayesian approach whether and how the subjects with one measurement contribute to the estimation of $\beta_2$ depends on the specifications of the priors.
