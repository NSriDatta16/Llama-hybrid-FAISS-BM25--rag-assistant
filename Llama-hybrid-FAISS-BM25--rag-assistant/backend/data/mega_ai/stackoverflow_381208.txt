IEnumerable as return type

Is there a problem with using IEnumerable as a return type? FxCop complains about returning List (it advises returning Collection instead). Well, I've always been guided by a rule "accept the least you can, but return the maximum." From this point of view, returning IEnumerable is a bad thing, but what should I do when I want to use "lazy retrieval"? Also, the yield keyword is such a goodie.
