If you consider that an ant farm is an efficient way to explore a complex problem space (the ant farm) through the use of simple agents (the ants) then this starts to look decidedly less anti-patternish. Critiques of OOP based on the complexity of 'fitting it all in your head' always ignore that (a) its hard to fit all of anything in your head (regardless of whether its OO or not) and (b) that OO actively reduces the need to have it all in your head anyway
