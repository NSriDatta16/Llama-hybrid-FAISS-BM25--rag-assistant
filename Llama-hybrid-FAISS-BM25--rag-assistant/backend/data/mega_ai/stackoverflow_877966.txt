I can see where this may be blowing your mind. All those languages you list are indeed quite similar (procedural). Once you get this down, I highly encourage you to learn a functional language as well. You may also find it tough going, but learning it will help your general coding skills greatly. You'll have a whole new bag of tricks (even in procedural languages), and you will never be afraid of recursion again.
