"Always" is a very strong word - of course not always. 50% is used when you have two outcomes and you want to test the hypothesis that they are equally probable. Clearly you should not compare the 66% to the interval, because 66% is the percentage of "tap preferrers" while the interval applies to the percentage of "bottle preferrers". Other than that, the quote from the book is full of inaccuracies. They have a one-sided hypothesis - why use a two-sided interval? The standard deviation should use p=0.5 and result in 0.05 (rather than 0.043). They should compare 0.66 to 0.5+1.65 x 0.05 = 0.58. Although the null hypothesis is rejected in both cases (one- or two-sided hypothesis), it does not mean that the water company is "probably right" - all it means is that we could not prove otherwise. Claiming that the company is right involves some Bayesian beliefs.
