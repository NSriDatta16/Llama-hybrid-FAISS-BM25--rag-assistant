It sounds like you want a tool to allow you to enter text in paragraph form without needing to write your own markup for it. You probably want a WYSIWYG editor. There are free JavaScript implementations that offer nice input formatting tools. You definitely don't want to insert tags with CSS - that is just nonsense. CSS defines formatting for markup. It doesn't create new markup. If you want to apply some sort of markup transformation, use JavaScript or a server-side scripting language. CSS is not a general-purpose programming language.
