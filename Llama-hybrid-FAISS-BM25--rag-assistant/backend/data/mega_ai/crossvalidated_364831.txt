Welcome to CV. If you want to learn the statistics part of data science, you could start by reading some introductory books and taking some courses, either at a university or at one of the sites that offer them online. The simple answer to your question is "if that is all you have, you can't solve your problem". However, as @Tchakavarty alluded to in a comment, if you have the raw data you can run a regression. But I wouldn't do that now, if I were you. This is too hard a problem for your first problem. Your first computer program said "Hello World". You need to start with the basics in statistics, just as you did with programming.
