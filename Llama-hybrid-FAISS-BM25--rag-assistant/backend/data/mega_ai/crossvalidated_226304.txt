How to do regression on a time series by learning from historical time series?

I have a data set of customer purchases from the day of their registration to 120 days. There is a time series for each customer. However, some new customers do not have a history of 120 days yet. I want to predict how many purchases they will do by the time their history reaches 120 days. I have created a feature set including frequency of purchase, recency and monetary, and product category ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RFM_(customer_value) ). How can I train the model from the time series to make a regression for each customer?
