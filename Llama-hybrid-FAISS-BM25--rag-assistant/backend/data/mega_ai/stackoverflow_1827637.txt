organizing admin related controllers and viewpages

admin section is at www.example.com/admin so I have an admincontroller. But I also have user admin related controllers, and configuration controllers, I want the url to be like: www.example.com/admin -> adminController www.example.com/admin/user/ -> adminUserController www.example.com/admin/user/edit www.example.com/admin/user/add I hate the name AdminUserController, any suggestions? View pages are organized like: /views/admin /views/admin/user/ so in just manually reference the view page like return View("~/views/admin/user/add"); What other options do I have?
