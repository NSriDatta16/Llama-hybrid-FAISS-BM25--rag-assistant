Creating an Excel Sheet with ADO.NET (OleDb) --> What DataTypes are Supported?

I try to create an Excel (2003) Sheet with ADO.NET (OleDb). I was able to create the Sheet with an OleDbCommand: var cnnString = "Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;..."; var cnn = new OleDbConnection(cnnString); var cmd = cnn.CreateCommand(); cnn.Open(); cmd.CommandText = "CREATE TABLE MySheet (ID char(255), Field1 char(255))"; cmd.ExecuteNonQuery(); That works as expected. Here my Question: What DataTypes (like char(255)) are Supported by Excel within the CREATE TABLE command? I did google but didn't find any documentation or hints. Thanks for your help.
