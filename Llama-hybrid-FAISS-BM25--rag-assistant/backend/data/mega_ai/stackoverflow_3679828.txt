Success!!! The problem was that I had one foo.png resource in drawable-hdpi-v4/ that was not present in the drawable/ directory. When I referenced R.drawable.foo from my layout file, the 1.5 emulator was therefore not able to find a suitable resource for that id. What made it so difficult to track down was that the error didn't happen immediately when referencing foo.png, but rather the error was thrown on the NEXT resource referenced, which was bg.png. Google has confirmed this is a bug. Adding an mdpi version of foo.png to the drawable/ directory fixed the problem.
