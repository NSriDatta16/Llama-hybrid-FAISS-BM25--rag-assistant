What does the notation $\chi_{(V\ge1)}$ mean in probability / statistics?

I reading Benjamini and Hochberg's paper on controlling the FDR , and I came across this notation "$\chi_{(V\ge1)}$" in section 2.1 paragraph (b), and I'm guessing from context that: $$ \chi_{(V\ge1)} = \left\{\begin{matrix} 1 & V\ge1\\ 0 & Otherwise \end{matrix}\right. $$ Can anyone confirm that this is correct or provide a correction, and also give the name of this construct/notation?
