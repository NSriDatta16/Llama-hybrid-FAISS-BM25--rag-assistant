It is working perfectly for me... Am using the hidden field in input tag to capture the value of the dropped item. However, i'm not able to actually capture the value of the dragged variable in IE.. It works fine when i do it in Firefox using this peice of code... $("#userList").bind('sortreceive', function(event, ui) { var itemList = ui.originalTarget.innerHTML; alert(itemList); }); I also tried doing this... alert(ui.item.attr('id')); However, the windows apparently is not able to recognize the id of the li or the inner html present in the li which is being drag-dropped..
