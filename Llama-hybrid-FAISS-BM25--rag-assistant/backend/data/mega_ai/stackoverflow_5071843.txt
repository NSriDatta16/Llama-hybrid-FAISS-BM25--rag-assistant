Drag to dynamically resize a pair of adjacent layouts on Android

I have a pair of adjacent views in an Android application. I'd like to give the user the ability to drag a widget to change the relative size of the two views within a larger container. If SlidingDrawer let the user pin the drawer wherever they wanted, that'd likely get me what I want. My Google 'fu is failing me. I can't find a single example of this anywhere. Thanks!
