Identifying Early Indicators Time Series Analysis

I have a time series representing demand for a product which looks as follows: Clearly, this time series shows an upward trend and it's variance does seem non-stationary as well. Further, I have a set of time series for the same timeframe, among which I would like to identify potential early indicators for changes in product demand. The potential indicators are on a very different scale, and also appear "more stationary" both in variance and in trend. One example of a potential indicator looks as follows: Now, I would like to start my process of identfying indicators. I have an idea of what I want to do but I am struggling to find the literature to back my ideas. My current plan is the following: Make product demand series and indicator candidate series stationary (for example through differencing) Iteratively compare the product demand series with the indicator candidate series' using cross-correlation - looking for lags with high correlation and picking indicators with high cross-correlation at "early" lags My question is: Is this approach valid? Are there other/better approaches that I could take? Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you very much in advace!
