Bootstrapping vs Bayesian Bootstrapping conceptually?

I'm having a trouble understanding what a Bayesian Bootstrapping process is, and how that would differ from your normal bootstrapping. And if someone could offer an intuitive/conceptual review and comparison of both, that would be great. Let's take an example. Say we have a dataset X that is [1,2,5,7,3]. If we sample with replacement multiple times to create sample sizes equal to the size of X (so, [7,7,2,5,7], [3,5,2,2,7], etc), and then we compute the means of each, is that the bootstrap distribution of the sample mean? What would be the bayesian bootstrap distribution of that? And how is the bayesian bootstrap distribution of other parameters (variance, etc) done in the same ways?
