The standard test to use for this type of study is McNemar's test. The usual McNemar's test is for only 2 outcomes, but you can extend it for more, the R function mcnemar.test does this for 2 or more outcomes. This basically just tests the null that the matrix of choices is symmetric, but does not give detail on where any differences occur. Another approach would be a proportional odds logistic regression where you use the "before" results as the predictor and the "after" results as the response variable.
