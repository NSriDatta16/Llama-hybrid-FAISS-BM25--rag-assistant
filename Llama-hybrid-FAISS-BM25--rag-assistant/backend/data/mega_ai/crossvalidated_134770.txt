I don't see too much to say here. I think you have done a good job. There are several ways that people have discussed to test effects and get p-values for complicated mixed effects models. There is a good overview here . The best is to use computationally intensive methods (bootstrapping or Bayesian methods), but this is more advanced for most people. The second best (and best convenient) method is to use a likelihood ratio test. That is what anova() (technically ?anova.merMod() ) is doing. It is important to only use a likelihood ratio test of models that were fit with the full maximum likelihood , rather than restricted maximum likelihood (REML). On the other hand, for your final model, and for interpretation, you want to use REML. This is confusing for many people. In your output, we see that you fit your models with REML (this is because the option is set to TRUE by default in lmer() . That would mean that your test is invalid, however, because this is such a common mistake, anova.merMod() contains a refit argument which by default is set to TRUE , and you didn't change it. So the foresight of the package developers has saved you there. Regarding your strategy for unpacking the interaction, what you did is fine. Just bear in mind that the interaction uses all the data for its test. It is possible to have a significant interaction but have neither of the stratified tests be significant, which confuses some people. (It doesn't seem to have happened to you, though.)
