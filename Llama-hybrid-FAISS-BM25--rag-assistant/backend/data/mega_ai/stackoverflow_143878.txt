Not all opensource projects are great examples as of how things are done. Take a look at PEAR , ezComponents and the Zend Framework . All three are pretty popular in the PHP world, they solve a ton of different problems [each sometimes with a different approach] and they all follow great coding standards. Also, there is often a trade-off between beautiful/elegant code and code that is very optimized. For example, if you want to see code that is powered to run a large website which needs to handle a lot of traffic, check out Mediawiki . It's build on very efficient code, but it's not very pretty.
