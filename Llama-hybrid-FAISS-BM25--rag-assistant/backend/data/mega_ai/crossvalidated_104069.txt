Question about normalize/scale data before using neuralnet

I have read several threads about the issue on same outputs after people fitting a neural network model with R neuralnet. Posted Solution is to normalize or scale the data before fitting model. Since I am a newbie in this area, I feel confused in the inconsistence between the normalized training data and normalized testing data. The thing is people fit neuralnet after they normalizing training data. Then they use the fitted model on normalized testing data to forecast. Since the training data and testing data are separate, the normalizing or scale method might be different which might result in in-correctness of forecast. Can anyone help me about this concern?
