Javascript, possible to check whether function exists in HTML tags?

I have the following setup: a Javascript file (containing a google visualization function which Ajax will put into a new Div) and a vbscript file, containing implementation function for the Ajax call, which writes google visualisation javascript within tags. In the Ajax call in the javascript file, I put the content of the Ajax call into a new div and append this to the container div. I then call one of the google javascript functions, which is the new content the Ajax call is adding to the html. If i have an alert or setTimeOut() before the google javascript function call, it works. If i just immediately call the function it doesnt. So it appears there is some delay before the newly Ajax-added javascript code can be recognised. Is there any elegant way to call the function without a timeout? I did write a while loop to keep looping until the new appended node was found, but the function call was still not recognised. function ProcessAjaxCall(DivID, ResponseText) { var NewDiv = document.createElement("div"); NewDiv.id = "myscript"; NewDiv.innerHTML = ResponseText; document.getElementById(DivID).appendChild(NewDiv); //alert('Function below only works when this outputs'); MyGoogleJSFunction('Arg'); } So MyGoogleJSFunction is part of the code being written via the Ajax call and is within NewDiv.
