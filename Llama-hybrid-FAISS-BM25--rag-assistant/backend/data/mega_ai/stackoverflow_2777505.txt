Forget osCommerce - it's not developed anymore and there are many other products out there that have the same functionality and are actively maintained. If it's not maintained, then newly found vulnerabilities are not fixed. I'd suggest checking out these: http://www.opencart.com/ - actively developed and seems to do all the things you need. I'm planning to start moving osCommerce sites onto this. http://www.prestashop.com/ - has a lot of extensions, most of them are sold at their shop http://www.magentocommerce.com/ - they say that this is THE e-commerce solution. It probably has the most functionalities, but it also knows how to eat up your server resources. Hosting this on a shared hosting is not suggested.
