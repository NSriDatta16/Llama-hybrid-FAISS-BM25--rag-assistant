I think this answer on another, related question should be a good starting point for you. Shortly, there are many neural network based methods specifically tailored for object detection ; "Single shot object detector (SSD)" , "(Fast(er)) Region-CNN (R-CNN)" , "You Only Look Once (YOLO (9000))" , just to name a few. There are many tutorials describing how they works, they have open implementations, and they are well described in respective articles. I recommend you having a look at those and start from there, rather than developing/coding your own network. These methods are perfect for the task that you are trying to accomplish.
