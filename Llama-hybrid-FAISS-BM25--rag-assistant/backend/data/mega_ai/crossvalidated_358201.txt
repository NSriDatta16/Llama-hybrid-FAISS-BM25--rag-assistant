Here are a few tips you may want to try: Standardize your dataset Perform some EDA to get an idea of underlying patterns in data Do some visualization to see data regularities Do dimensionality reduction Now, again try your classifier If RBF gives poor result, try a brand new SVM kernel method, called `CJSD Kernels' which gives improved classification accuracies over RBF. Here is the description about CJSDs: https://www.quora.com/Is-the-Jensen-Shannon-Divergence-limited-in-0-1-Given-two-models-is-it-correct-that-the-larger-JSD-is-the-more-similar-they-are-to-each-other and here are the references for CJSD Kernels: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7424294/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7796903/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs41060-017-0054-1 The following paper will tell you the limitations of traditional SVM kernel methods, and why it lead to the development of CJSD based kernels: "Investigating Manifold Neighborhood size for Nonlinear analysis of LIBS Amino Acid Spectra" See if you can get hold on the following PhD Dissertation: "Finding a Suitable Model For Novel Data Using Range Transformation" as the above work is a subset of this broader research work.
