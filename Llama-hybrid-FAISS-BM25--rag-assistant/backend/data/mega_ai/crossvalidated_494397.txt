What does "Aleatoric and Epistemic uncertainties" mean?

While studying Bayesian Learning, I have encountered the term, Aleatoric and Epistemic uncertainty , but I have just found it a bit confusing to understand. I believe I haven't found good references to understand the term. What do they mean and what could be examples for these two terms? Hope some plain literal explanation.
