Image Gallery Manager for PHP and MySQL?

Can anyone recommend a plugin or library that allows people to upload images which automatically gets cropped and resized? I don't mind editting some config files to specify how images should be cropped and resized. Additionally, after uploading, the front end user should be able to drag and drop for re-ordering. Can someone recommend something that works with php?
