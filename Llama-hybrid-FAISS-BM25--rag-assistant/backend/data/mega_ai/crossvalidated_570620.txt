Binning throws away data. It is often good to look at a histogram, which is binned, to understand your data. If you have a well-founded hypothesis about the underlying distribution, then it is OK to use a parametric approach, and estimate the Probability Distribution Function, and you can do all that with binning. But if you don't, then non-parametric methods are preferable, e.g. the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. In this case you use the Cumulative Distribution Function. A graph of the CDF is often harder to read, but statistically better practice. In particular, there is no unbiased estimator of the PDF. In your case, a graph of the CDF has as x axis bone mineral density and as y axis % of the population with an actual average density lower than x - this would seem to be a quite natural graph to plot in your context.
