Basic Bayesian updating priors

I have a question about simple Bayesian reasoning. Suppose there are N datasets, two mutually exclusive models, priors for models can be chosen as 0.5 to 0.5. The datasets have different characteristics and can not be mixed. Among two models, only one is true for all of the datasets. So, Bayesian updating: I test one dataset and update priors, than take the other dataset. But when should I stop? Should I re-test datasets in a recursive way until convergence, or stop when all N datasets will pass updating procedure?
