If it's only the static content, html/swf/... then I suggest you use blob storage to put them in instead of using compute power of several instances as these are not needed. This will cut down on your costs as blob storage is publicly accessible but is very cheap. If your Flex application needs integration with services then you need to host them in a compute environment like an instance.
