Is there a Bayesian equivalent to a Wald-Wolfowitz runs test?

I have a sequence of observations and I would like to determine if the observations in the sequence are mutually independent. Wald-Wolfowitz is a non-parametric test that can be used to check for randomness in the sequence. I think I have a general idea of how to formulate the problem, but don't want to sprain my brain if it's been done before. [My literature searches and Google searches didn't turn up anything, but I may not be asking the question properly.] Thanks in advance.
