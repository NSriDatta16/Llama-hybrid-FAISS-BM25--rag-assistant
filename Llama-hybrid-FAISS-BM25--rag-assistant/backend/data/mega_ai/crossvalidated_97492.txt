Well, there is a way to get an asymptotic probability that gets closer as the size of the sequence gets bigger. For a 1000-lenght sequence I think it can give you a good approximation. Call $L_{i}$ the letter in the position $i$. Consider the Markov Chain $X_{i} = \max(n|L_{i-j}, 0\leq j The transition probabilities of that chain are simple: $p(n,0)= 0,75$ for every n between 0 and 5. $p(n,n+1)= 0,25$ for every n between 0 and 4. $p(5,5) = 0,25$ Then you get the equilibrium distribution of the states $\pi_{n}$ by solving $\pi_{n} = \sum_{m} \pi_{m}.p(m,n)$ When you get $\pi_{5}$ you can get approximation by considering that you have a binomial distribution with 1000 tries and probability $\pi_{5}$. It gets better with bigger sequences.
