Automate Elasticsearch optimization

I am planning to do a thesis in the Elasticsearch(a search engine based on the Lucene library) parameter optimization using some machine learning or optimization algorithm(automate the optimization of Elasticsearch parameters/settings based on current data/conditions). Which Machine learning or optimization algorithm do you suggest for it?
