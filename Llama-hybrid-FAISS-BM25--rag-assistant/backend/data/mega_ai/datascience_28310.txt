Why do pre-trained CNNs use low image resolution?

I want to use a pre-trained convolutional network for image classification. My base data has resolutions of 500x500px up to 1000x1000px. Pre-trained architectures often expect less (between 255 and 299px in case of Googles Inception network). Firstly: Would it potentially have a big impact to use higher resolution images? I.e. is it worthwhile investigating it? Secondly: Does it make sense and is it possible to use a pre-trained network on low resolution and re-training the last layer/classifier with higher resolutions?
