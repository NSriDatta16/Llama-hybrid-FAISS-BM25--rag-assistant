If the response time is increasing, you must be doing more with this table than just pulling images for ids? What other data columns are stored in your images table? If you have a clustered index on an id (probably identity), that's fine, but adding an additional nonclustered index which can be covering for search criteria will probably help. Say you also have columns for name or tag or region or whatever in this images table (and assuming you aren't going to vertically partition this table into separate tables), then having a nonclustered index on tag, id INCLUDE(name), say or something which matches your usage patterns will help a lot. Remember: A clustered index is not an index, it's just the way the data is organized. It will usually not help much in any kind of search operations - it primarily works well on identity lookups, when you are reading almost every column, and streaming data in the order of the clustered index.
