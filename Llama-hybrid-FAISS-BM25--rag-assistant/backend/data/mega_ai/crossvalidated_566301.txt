R modeling relationship between binary outcome and binary predictor among different categories

I could use some advice. I am trying to model the relationship between a binary outcome (impact present/impact absent) and a binary predictor (threat present/threat absent), and see if that relationship varies among threat categories. In other words, does the correlation between threats and impacts vary significantly among threat categories . Since I am modeling a binary outcome, it seems like logistic regression would be a reasonable approach, and I will discuss what I have so far below. If anyone has suggestions for other approaches they would be welcome. My end goal is to be able to say, for each threat category, the likelihood of an impact being present if a threat present is x . My dataframe looks like this: species = a categorical variable with 128 levels threat_category = a categorical variable with 17 levels impact.pres = a binomial variable with present = 1 and not_present = 0 threat.pres = a binomial variable with present = 1 and not_present = 0 Example data (smaller than actual dataset): dat I am running a no-intercept model because I am interested in the true coefficients for each threat, not the difference between each threat and a reference threat. My model and output looks something like this: mod |z|) threat.pres -6.931e-01 1.323e+00 -0.524 0.600 threat_catclimate 6.931e-01 8.660e-01 0.800 0.423 threat_catfire 6.513e-16 1.000e+00 0.000 1.000 threat_catinvasive_spp 1.099e+00 1.155e+00 0.951 0.341 threat_catpollution -9.163e-01 8.367e-01 -1.095 0.273 threat_catrecreation 6.931e-01 8.660e-01 0.800 0.423 threat.pres:threat_catfire -9.163e-01 1.987e+00 -0.461 0.645 threat.pres:threat_catinvasive_spp -1.099e+00 1.958e+00 -0.561 0.575 threat.pres:threat_catpollution -1.596e+01 2.284e+03 -0.007 0.994 threat.pres:threat_catrecreation 1.099e+00 1.958e+00 0.561 0.575 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 69.315 on 50 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 56.785 on 40 degrees of freedom AIC: 76.785 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 16 In my real data, threat.pres and most of the individual impacts are significant, but none of the interaction terms are. I am wondering if I have specified the model correctly to be able to answer my question , and if so, how best to interpret these coefficients, and the significance levels associated with them . Thank you for your time.
