By reading a little bit the paper you attached, GA is used for feature selection. It seems to me that they are trying to optimize the weights of a logistic regression model in order to predict an increase or decrease of the stock price that is represented as a binary variable. The weights represent the importance of each feature they have chosen empirically to add to their model.They use training and testing datasets from previous years. So they know if their model is predicting well or not. Once they extract the optimal weights using the GA they can apply their model in the present to predict future increases or decreases of a stock price.
