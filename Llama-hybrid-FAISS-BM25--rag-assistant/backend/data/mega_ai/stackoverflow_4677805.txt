Hanoi From your code I can not see how you want to solve your problem. Step 1 for you would be, I think, to formulate how you want to approach your problem, and describe without a programming language -- maybe in pseudo code , or as a bullet-list in Word. Then, you might start programming in a programming language from that. C++ Your code looks a bit too much like some random code fragment. Lets see if you can get a bit more started with this basic C++ code fragment. It is not really problem specific, but it might give you a start for a real C++ program. //file: hanoi.cpp // Tower of Hanoi #include //! std is without '.h', add a space after 'include' //! ' ' only needed for C-ish; maybe later, and then use //! first try it without '#include ', try using 'cout //! assert() using std::cout; //! do this, or always writw `std::cout` using std::cin; using std::endl; //! DECLARATION class HanoiTowers { const size_t disks_; //! some people mark class fields with a ending '_' public: explicit HanoiTowers(size_t disks); //! use 'size_t' for indexes into array void move(int n, size_t srcpole, size_t sparepole, size_t dstpole); }; //! IMPLEMENTATION HanoiTowers::HanoiTowers(size_t disks) : disks_(disks) { // ... more init code ... } void HanoiTowers::move(int n, size_t srcpole, size_t sparepole, size_t dstpole) { //! ... is your algorithm going to work? I dont know ... if(n==1) { // sparepole and dstpole are swapped cout > disks; //! let user enter a number //! create a data structure HanoiTowers hanoi(disks); //! execute your algorithm hanoi.move(0,0,0,0); //! ??? //! ...more...??? return 0; //! '0': program succeeded } and compile it with g++ -o hanoi.x hanoi.cpp on Unix for example.
