Recall that logistic regression is a model that predicts the odds $$ \frac{p(x)}{1 - p(x)} = e^{\beta_0 + \beta_1 x} $$ Now look at the Preposition 1 in the paper (p 5062) $$ LR_\text{logistic}(\ln \tfrac{s}{1-s};a,c) = \exp[ a\ln\tfrac{s}{1-s}+c ] $$ It seems like Algorithm 1 (p 5063) is a "univariate logistic regression" with $y_\text{train}$ being the dependent variable, $s'=\tfrac{s_\text{train}}{1-s_\text{train}}$ being the independent variable, $a$ being the slope and $c$ intercept. In Algorithm 2 , it is a "bivariate" model with $s'=\ln s_\text{train}$ and $s''=-\ln (1-s_\text{train})$ as features and $a,b$ as parameters.
