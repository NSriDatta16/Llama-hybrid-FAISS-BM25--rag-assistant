Both answers are great, however (mt) Media Temple doesn't store plain text passwords. In November and December of 2009, a major security overhaul was performed. All passwords are stored hashed. Employees can not see customer passwords and authentication is performed using either a short term PIN or via password match since that time. For your own security, maintaining more than one password should be standard practice. While many people enjoy the convenience of a single password for multiple logins, it is most definitely not a recommended method. A pass phrase that changes in relation to each login would be a more secure method of protecting your accounts online. In addition, periodic changes to your password is encouraged. We all get busy, and for sake of convenience, tend to let personal security lapse at times. M Handa Support Supervisor (mt) Media Temple, Inc
