Your example is from Dive Into Python, and statsout is an imaginary module used as an example. To quote from http://diveintopython.net/power_of_introspection/getattr.html : For example, let's imagine a program that prints site statistics in HTML, XML, and plain text formats. The choice of output format could be specified on the command line, or stored in a configuration file. A statsout module defines three functions, output_html , output_xml , and output_text . Then the main program defines a single output function, like this: "For example, let's imagine" being the key words there :) Actually, reading it again I can quite see that that paragraph is easy to misparse...
