Differences between Static Factors, Dynamic factors and Exploratory factor analysis in Time Series

I came across many types of factor analysis techniques in the context of time series data. I am not sure whether exploratory factor analysis refers to the same static factor analysis methodology. If I use exploratory factor analysis and use rotated factors as predictors to forecast GDP , what is that analysis called? If I take lagged terms of the factors obtained through exploratory factor analysis and build a VAR model , can I call it a dynamic factor model ? My target is to evaluate the forecast accuracy between static and dynamic factors. How can I achieve my target.
