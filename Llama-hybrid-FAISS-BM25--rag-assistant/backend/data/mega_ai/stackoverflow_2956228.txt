The fastest way is to create your own in memory model of data available in XML, convert it to simple objects and simple types, and organize it in the structure that suits your queries best. Index it additionally as appropriate for your problem (using Dictionary/SortedDictionary). This approach will be significantly faster then the one with using SQL database, and using SQL database will also be a lot faster then querying each XML. Depending on the complexity of your queries, this could range from a fairly simple thing to do, to a very hard in which case you should definitely go for embedded database.
