For a system this small, you can do everything by hand. Let $x_i$ be the probability that you end up paid in full starting in state $i$. Use the transition probabilities to write one equation per state, saying that $x_i$ equals the weighted average of $x_j$, where the weight is the transition probability from $i$ to $j$ in one step. In other words, the chance to end up paid in full equals the expected value of the chance to be paid in full after the next step. For example, $x_G = 0.1 x_F + 0.8 x_G + 0.1 x_A$. This gives you $4$ equations in $4$ unknowns, which should sound promising. However, $2$ of those equations are $x_F = x_F$ and $x_B = x_B$. You should replace those with $x_F = 1$ and $x_B = 0$.
