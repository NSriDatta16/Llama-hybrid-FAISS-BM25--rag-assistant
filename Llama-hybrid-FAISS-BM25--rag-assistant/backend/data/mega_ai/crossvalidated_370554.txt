Can I calculate odds ratio for Firth's Bias-Reduced Logistic Regression?

I have data that I apply a test called Firth's Bias-Reduced Logistic Regression. I am using R with package called brglm. I got coefficient and I will try to find a way to calculate a confidence interval Is it valid to take exponentiation to calculate and report odds-ratio in this type of test?
