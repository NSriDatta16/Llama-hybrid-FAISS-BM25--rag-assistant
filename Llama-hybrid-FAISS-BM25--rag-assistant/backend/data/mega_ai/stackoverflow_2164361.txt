Java client program calling a .NET 3.5 web service

i have written a simple java stand-alone program that calls a .net 1.0 web service. no problem. if i take that same program structure and call a .net 3.5 web service, the java program fails. for whatever reason, the parameters passed to the 3.5 service are NEVER received. so can someone point the way to an example or tutorial where i can call a .net 3.5 web service from a java stand-alone application (without using glassfish, tomcat, etc). i didn't have to install a server (tomcat) when i called the 1.0 service and so i am assumming that you can do the same when calling a 3.5 service. i've been spending numerous days researching this topic and i'm getting desperate. thank you. ac p.s. i don't want code fragments.....i need a full blown tutorial from top to bottom.
