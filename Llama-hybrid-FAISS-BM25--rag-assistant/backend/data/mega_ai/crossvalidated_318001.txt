how to handle the sparse data in machine learning for novelty detection using SVM in r?

I have a data frame wherein 89000 records 60% of the values are missing I am replacing the missing values by zero which is a legitimate zero which is making the data sparse. Now when I train the model with SVM for one class or novelty detection which is giving me good accuracy but I have another test datasets for_prediction1 which has 100K records and sparse when I pass the for_prediction1 to predict using the generated SVM model but it is predicting almost all of them as true which is not correct only few records should be true. Is there any way to handle the sparse data so that it predicts the data accurately? Can anyone help me in suggesting the pre-processing techniques that are available ? smp_size
