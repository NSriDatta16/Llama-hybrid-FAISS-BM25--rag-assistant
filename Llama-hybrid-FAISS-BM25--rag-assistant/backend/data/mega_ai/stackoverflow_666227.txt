You'd probably have to create a custom control for that, but do you really need a round button? Every platform has its UI conventions, and the iPhone is no exception. Users expect the buttons to be rounded rectangles. UPDATE in response to comment: If I'm getting this right, you're not looking for a round button, but rather a clickable (touchable) image. You can use an UIImageView and its touchesBegan method. UPDATE 2: Wait a second. What kind of radio button are we talking about? For some reason I thought you were trying to imitate a real radio. If you're talking about a radio button group, please use a UISegmentedControl or a UIPicker .
