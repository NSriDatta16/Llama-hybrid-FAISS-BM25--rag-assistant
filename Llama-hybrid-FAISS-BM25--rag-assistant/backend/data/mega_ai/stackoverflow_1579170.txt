You can set its isPopUp property to false to prevent it from being dragged in the first place. var popupWin:TitleWindow = PopUpManager.createPopUp(this, TitleWindow); PopUpManager.centerPopUp(popupWin); popupWin.isPopUp = false; I don't know if the DragManager class in flex supports bounds checking, but if you really want to allow dragging but limit its bounds, you can still set isPopUp to false and implement the dragging code yourself so that the component never goes outside the limits specified by you. Check startDrag() method for an example. Bounds rectangle is the key.
