Bayesian update with the shifted and scaled data

Suppose I have data $y$ (N observations) which follows a normal distribution: $y \sim N(\alpha+\beta*\mu,\sigma^2)$ while $\alpha$ and $\beta$ are known parameters. I want to update $\mu$ and the prior is $\mu \sim N(\mu_0,\sigma^2_0)$ . My question is what is the posterior distribution for $\mu$ ? I know the posterior when $X \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ ( here ). But in my case, $y$ is a shifted and scaled version of $X$ . For my own derivation, I treat the above as a regression problem, and I get $\mu \sim N(\frac{\beta^T(y-\alpha)+\mu_0/\sigma^2_0}{\beta^T\beta+1/\sigma^2_0},\frac{\sigma^2}{\beta^t\beta+1/\sigma^2})$ However, the above formula does seem correct. For instance, suppose I have two data, $y_1$ and $y_2$ . Updating with $y_1$ then $y_2$ vs updating with $y_2$ then $y_1$ will result in different posteriors. Any help is appreciated!
