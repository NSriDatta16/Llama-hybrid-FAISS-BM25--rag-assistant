I don't know if R has a package but the Machine Learning Group of TU Berlin has written a MATLAB toolbox for nonstationary time series decomposition called Stationary Subspace Analysis . Other references are Satoshi Hara, Yoshinobu Kawahara, Takashi Washio, and Paul von Bunau. Stationary subspace analysis as a generalized eigenvalue problem . In Proceedings of the 17th International Conference on Neural Information Processing: Theory and Algorithms - Volume Part I , ICONIP’10, pages 422–429, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2010. Springer-Verlag. Motoaki Kawanabe, Wojciech Samek, Paul von Bunau, and Frank Meinecke. An information geometrical view of stationary subspace analysis .
