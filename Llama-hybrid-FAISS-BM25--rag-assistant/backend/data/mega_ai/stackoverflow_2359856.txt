SMO missing dll on a clients

I've created an app that connects remotely to SQL Server 2008. SQL connections work and all traditional oCommand.ExecuteNonQuery(), work great! But my SMO class using server.ConnectionContext.ExecuteNonQuery(scriptfile); ERROR: missing batch parsing.dll . I can't install these independent utils on a client machines, and then take them all off when done: as suggested by: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?displaylang=en&FamilyID=228de03f-3b5a-428a-923f-58a033d316e1 Since my bulk-inserts are large memory hogs containing complete tables, I wrote the tables to a temptable.sql files and used SQLCMD Util and later switch too SMO and I have the same problem. Neither of these can be leveraged on the client's PCs . Any suggestion? thanks :-)
