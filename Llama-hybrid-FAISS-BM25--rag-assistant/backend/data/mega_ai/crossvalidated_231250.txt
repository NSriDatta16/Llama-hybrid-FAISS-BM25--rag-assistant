MCMCglmm and lmer are both functions that can be used for fitting linear mixed models. MCMCglmm takes a Bayesian approach where priors must be specified for fixed and random effects, enabling inference via Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling, whereas lmer takes a likelihood approach within the frequentist paradigm. To answer your questions: Yes, you have specified an equivalent model in MCMCglmm to the one in lmer . That is, you have specified fixed effects for trait1 , trait2 and trait3 and crossed or nested (depending on how your data are coded) random effects for species and plotID . Yes, you can use interactions and polynomials in the usual way. You can use any package for fitting linear mixed models that supports crossed or nested random effects. If you are specifically interested in Bayesian models, then another option is the new rstanarm package. This utilises stan , which adopts a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method, rather than MCMC.
