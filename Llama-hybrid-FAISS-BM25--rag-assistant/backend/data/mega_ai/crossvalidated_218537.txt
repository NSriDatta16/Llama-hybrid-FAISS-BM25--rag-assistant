Help interpreting the output from a mediation analysis

Currently I'm working on some organisational research. Just to get a bit of a idea of what I'm research; I'm looking at impact of leadership on how enthusiastically work. I believe the relationship of the leader, and follower impact are important, as is the ambition of a worker. So I'm looking at: Leadership = TFL_MEAN = X Enthusiasm = ENGAG_ME = Y Relationship = LMX_MEAN = M Ambition = Growth_N I examined the impact of TFL (X) on ENGAG_ME (Y), where I take LMX_ME (M) as a mediator, and Growth Need (W) as moderator of the relationship between X, and M. This gives the following model: I used the PROCESS macro, using model 8, to instantly test the model (the output is below). I'm wondering whether I'm interpreting the output right. I Interpret it as that: Growth_N is moderating the relationship between TFL_MEAN, and ENGAG_ME (due to the significant interaction, b =0.449, p=.028) Significant direct effect of SL_MEAN on LMX_MEAN (b=.665, p Growth_N is not moderating the relationship between SL_MEAN, and LMX_MEAN, due to the insignicant interaction (b=.098, p =.276) So far, so good (I think). Next up are the "Conditional direct effect(s) of X on Y at values of the moderator(s)". I interpret this as (now I really don't know if this is right): for low Growth_N (defined as minus 1 SD) there is an impact on ENGAG_ME, so when one has low levels the positive association between SL_MEAN, and ENGAG_ME strengthens. And for the "Conditional indirect effect(s) of X on Y at values of the moderator(s):", I interpret this as (I don't really know whether this is right either): The moderated mediation, and they are all significant, and their effect increases as their values increase. Thus the impact of SL_MEAN on ENGAG_ME, increases, as LMX_MEAN, and Growth_N increas. After this the line "Indirect effect of highest order product:" pops up, showing LMX as insignificant. Does anyone know what this means? ************************************************************************** Model = 8 Y = ENGAG_ME X = SL_MEAN M = LMX_MEAN W = Growth_N LMX MEAN Sample size 122 ************************************************************************** Outcome: LMX_MEAN Model Summary R R-sq MSE F df1 df2 p ,693 ,481 ,133 36,442 3,000 118,000 ,000 Model coeff se t p LLCI ULCI constant 3,904 ,033 118,077 ,000 3,839 3,970 SL_MEAN ,664 ,064 10,402 ,000 ,538 ,791 Growth_N ,016 ,047 ,342 ,733 -,078 ,110 int_1 ,098 ,089 1,094 ,276 -,079 ,275 Product terms key: int_1 SL_MEAN X Growth_N ************************************************************************** Outcome: ENGAG_ME Model Summary R R-sq MSE F df1 df2 p ,558 ,311 ,675 13,209 4,000 117,000 ,000 Model coeff se t p LLCI ULCI constant 2,270 ,812 2,794 ,006 ,661 3,879 LMX_MEAN ,629 ,207 3,034 ,003 ,218 1,039 SL_MEAN ,322 ,199 1,617 ,109 -,072 ,716 Growth_N ,348 ,107 3,258 ,001 ,137 ,560 int_2 -,449 ,202 -2,220 ,028 -,850 -,048 Product terms key: int_2 SL_MEAN X Growth_N ******************** DIRECT AND INDIRECT EFFECTS ************************* Conditional direct effect(s) of X on Y at values of the moderator(s): Growth_N Effect SE t p LLCI ULCI -,702 ,637 ,235 2,709 ,008 ,171 1,103 ,000 ,322 ,199 1,617 ,109 -,072 ,716 ,702 ,007 ,254 ,026 ,979 -,496 ,509 Conditional indirect effect(s) of X on Y at values of the moderator(s): Mediator Growth_N Effect Boot SE BootLLCI BootULCI LMX_MEAN -,702 ,374 ,133 ,169 ,715 LMX_MEAN ,000 ,418 ,132 ,208 ,733 LMX_MEAN ,702 ,461 ,148 ,221 ,797 Values for quantitative moderators are the mean and plus/minus one SD from mean.
