My naive attempt would be select a.*, b.* from table a, table b where a.col1 = b.col1 and a.col2 = b.col2 and a.col3 != b.col3; but that would return all the rows twice. I'm not sure how you'd restrict it to just returning them once. Maybe if there was a primary key, you could add "and a.pkey Like I said, that's not elegant and there is probably a better way to to do this.
