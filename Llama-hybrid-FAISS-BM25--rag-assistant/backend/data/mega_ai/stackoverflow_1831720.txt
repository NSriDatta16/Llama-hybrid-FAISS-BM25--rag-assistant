prototype newbie, Element.identify(element) vs Element#(identify)

i have the following in my code and want to add all of them to Droppables, using Droppables.add, which means i need the id of each of the elements. my read of the prototype documentation is that the following should be interchangeable and should both return the string 'seating1': $('seating1').identify and Element.identify($('seating1')) i've reduced what i actually do, as i could clearly just do Droppables.add('seating1'). what i'm really doing is $$('.unbooked') and then extracting the id using identify across the elements. but only the second form works. i'd prefer to use the first form as it's more oo-friendly. when i run it from the firebug console, the first form returns a function. the second form gives me 'seating1' as expected. what am i missing? this would seem pretty fundamental for me to figure out if i want to have any luck. as always, any help or insight is appreciated. thanks, hubert
