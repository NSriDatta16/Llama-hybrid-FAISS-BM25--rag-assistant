If objects have an ID that can be mapped 1-to-1 to an array than that will be O(1) access as well, and in practice will be slightly faster than a hashmap lookup (you don't have to compute the hash). However, the issue will be what happens when you delete an object. You will be left with a hole in the list. When creating new objects you can then keep appending to the list and leave it to get slowly more fragmented or try and find a spare slot in which case you'll be doing an O(n) search for a spare space. In short - a hashmap is probably more appropriate.
