(Sorry for posting a new answer, I can't reply to comments directly yet) I don't really agree with the statement: "Apparently, if you cross either the UCL or LCL, there has to be an assignable cause" To keep things simple, if your in control distribution is N(0,1), then you will still obtain false alarms once every 370 observations, on average, using a UCL of 3 and LCL of -3. When the chart signals, the process needs to be investigated. Only then can a reason for the signal be assigned (ie process change or random error.) Setting the UCL and LCL requires the user to balance the desired false alarm/missed detection rate (analogous to the Type I/Type II error trade off in hypothesis testing.) You can also wait until a few signals to actually stop and investigate the process, but in that case, you may detect the shift too late if it really occurred at the first signal. Again, you can't have something for nothing and the user must use their judgment to decide on how to set up the control chart and monitor the process.
