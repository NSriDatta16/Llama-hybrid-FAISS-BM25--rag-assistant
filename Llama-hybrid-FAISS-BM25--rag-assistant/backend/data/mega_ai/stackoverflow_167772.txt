What is the simplest way to allow a user to drag and drop table rows in order to change their order?

I have a Ruby on Rails application that I'm writing where a user has the option to edit an invoice. They need to be able to reassign the order of the rows. Right now I have an index column in the db which is used as the default sort mechanism. I just exposed that and allowed the user to edit it. This is not very elegant. I'd like the user to be able to drag and drop table rows. I've used Scriptaculous and Prototype a bit and am familiar with them. I've done drag and drop lists, but haven't done table rows quite like this. Anyone have any suggestions for not only reordering but capturing the reorder efficiently? Also, the user can dynamically create a new row in JS right now, so that row has to be reorderable as well. Bonus points if it can be done with RJS instead of direct JavaScript.
