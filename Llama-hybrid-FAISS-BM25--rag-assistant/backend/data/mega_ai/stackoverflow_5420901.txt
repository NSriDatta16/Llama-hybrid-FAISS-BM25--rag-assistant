it's a Queue, so you can save the first node in it, and print each element, delete and push it back to the queue, until you see (for the 2nd time!) the 1st element. yes, you shouldn't write all the program in main, but use functions and other files, organized by some logical meaning. EDIT: 1. car first = q1.dequeue(); q1.enqueue(first); //ADD HERE: print first... while (q1.peek() != first) { car element = q1.dequeue(); q1.enqueue(first); //ADD HERE: print element... } add your printing where the comments "ADD HERE:..." are 2. you should add functions like getUserInput() and printQueue() to handle all this scenerios, the main will just call these functions
