Should I rescale inputs for a neural networks? (Application on predicting stock market)

I'm implementing an ANN that predicts the stock market but I have a doubt about which inputs should I take into account and the best way to normalize them. I want to predict the daily highest value and for this reason I want to consider 'open value', 'lowest value', ' close value', 'volume value, and 'Adj close value'. The problem is that the 'volume' has a value way bigger that the others (i.e. datum1: 2071.820068,2073.850098,2052.280029,2065.300049,4704720000,2065.300049 ). How should I normalize these inputs?
