You should normalize the latent space data to have 0 mean and unit covariance before PCA. This will reduce the impact of latent variables that are high in scale and variance. See this post here: PCA on correlation or covariance? This seems like an interesting approach! The key here would be how to translate the PCA importances to the neurons â€” since each PC is a linear combination of neurons, how are you going to transfer these importances based off of the weights in the linear combination? The interesting exploration will be here. I would first run through the process in (2), make observations, and then read into further PCA methods to see if they align better with what you learned in (2).
