Bayesian variable selection -- does it really work?

I thought I might toy with some Bayesian variable selection, following a nice blog post and the linked papers therein. I wrote a program in rjags (where I am quite a rookie) and fetched price data for Exxon Mobil, along with some things that are unlikely to explain its returns (e.g. palladium prices) and other things that should be highly correlated (like the SP500). Running lm() , we see that there strong evidence of an overparameterized model, but that palladium should definitely be excluded: Call: lm(formula = Exxon ~ 0 + SP + Palladium + Russell + OilETF + EnergyStks, data = chkr) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.663e-03 -4.419e-04 3.099e-05 3.991e-04 1.677e-03 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) SP 0.51913 0.19772 2.626 0.010588 * Palladium 0.01620 0.03744 0.433 0.666469 Russell -0.34577 0.09946 -3.476 0.000871 *** OilETF -0.17327 0.08285 -2.091 0.040082 * EnergyStks 0.79219 0.11418 6.938 1.53e-09 *** After converting to returns, I tried running a simple model like this model { for (i in 1:n) { mean[i] but I found that, pretty much regardless of the parameters to the chosen gamma distributions, I got pretty nonsensical answers, such as an unvarying 20% inclusion probability for each variable. I also got tiny, tiny regression coefficients, which I am willing to tolerate since this supposed to be a selection model, but that still seemed weird.

Or am I making some glaring error?
