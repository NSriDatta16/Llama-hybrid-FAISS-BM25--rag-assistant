Getting object value from a string

I've got a problem to share with you all. The thing is, I would like to extract the value of a complex object having its name stored in a string variable. As you may know, you can do the following: $foo = 'Hello World'; $var = 'foo'; echo var_dump($$var); // Output: string(11) "Hello World" The problem comes when you try to do: $data = new stdClass(); $data->param["foo"]["bar"] = 'Hello World'; $var = 'data->param["foo"]["bar"]'; echo var_dump($$var); // Output: NULL I can imagine why the parser can't do this. The only workaround that I can think of is to split $var into smaller chunks ('->', '[', ']', ...) and evaluate it step by step. Does anyone know a more elegant solution? Thanks a lot
