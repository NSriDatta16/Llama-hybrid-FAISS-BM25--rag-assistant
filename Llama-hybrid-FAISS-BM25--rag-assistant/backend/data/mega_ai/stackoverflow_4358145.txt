Algorithmically they are they same. They both resolve to the same hashtable lookup, average time O(1). The difference is constant, mostly from the function call overhead. On my machine the closure is ~2.2 times slower than the metatable lookup (which is 2.5 times slower than a direct lookup). Testing on Codepad's server , the difference is ~2. Bottom line, on a fast machine (circa 2010), the function call is adding about a tenth of a microsecond of constant overhead, otherwise the performance is the same. BTW, much LÃ–VE from Mud. :)
