Approaching a multi-class classification problem but without labels

I am working on a business problem where I have a movie description dataset. In this dataset I've columns as - Movie title, Movie plot summary, Date of Release. Now based on this information and using machine learning I want to predict which category the movie falls into. For example The Conjuring should fall into Horror and Thriller i.e a multiclass classification problem. Now the problem is I don't have a label column besides the movie description and other info. Now I want my model to predict which categories a movie(unseen to model) should fall into. I have decided 5 labels that I want to consider - Horror, Thriller, Comedy, Romantic and Emotional. So, I want the dataset to look like this - Conjuring| Description | Title | Horror,Thriller The notebook| Description| Title | Romantic,Emotional I believe if I want to proceed this problem as a classification problem then I have to think of some way to create labels to existing dataset by some script and logic. If not supervised then maybe if I can do clustering first and then based on where the data point lies I can do classification later on. What I have tried ? Once I decided what my 5 labels should be, I made 50 synonyms for each and then iterated the description of the movies and based on the number of occurrence of words I made frequency and based on majority of the occurrence I decided which category a movie should fall into. Very bad results from this approach. I used K means clusters from the data and tried to extract information from the clusters. Could not get very meaningful information though. To be very honest I am pretty clueless and just want a direction how to approach this problem.
