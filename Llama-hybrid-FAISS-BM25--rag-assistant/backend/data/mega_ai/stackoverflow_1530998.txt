Setting NSMutableString Element To Number

Ola Folks, I want to populate an NSMutableString at runtime by both assigning a specific number (0-255) to an element and appendFormat to add to the string. If this were an unsigned char array, I could just directly assign the number using: UnsignedCharRay[SomeIndex] = 5; For reasons I think I understand but do not like, NSMutableStringObject[SomeIndex] = 5; will not work. As far as I can tell, there are no NSString or NSMutableString methods to directly set an element of the string array. Is there a way to do this? If so, what is it? Until I find an answer and can do this with NSMutableString, I am going to use an unsigned char array and create an NSString using the unsigned char araay. Aside from specifying NSUTF8StringEncoding when I create the NSString, are there other considerations I should pay attention to? What is the most effective method of creating an NSString from an unsigned char array? The goal is to retain the values of 0 to 255 during the conversion. Note: 0 would only appear at the end of the string ... sometimes. TIA -isdi-
