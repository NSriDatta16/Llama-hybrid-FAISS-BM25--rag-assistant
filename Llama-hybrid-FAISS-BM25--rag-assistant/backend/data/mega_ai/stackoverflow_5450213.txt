If you want to stick with using only 1 Activity, then I recommend checking out the ViewFlipper widget, it'll be useful. You could also utilize the new Fragment framework. On 3.0, you can use it right away. Below that, you have to use the static lib Google just released, with which you can use Fragments from Android version 1.6 and up. This way, you could use only 1 Activity, and assign a Fragment for every wizard-step. Then, you only have to switch the fragments accordingly. They even have a separate Fragment-stack. And the code'll be clean.
