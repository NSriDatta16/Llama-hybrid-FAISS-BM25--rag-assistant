Inter-rater reliability simultaneously on multiple binary data

I have drug prescription records on 5 different drugs (A,B,C,D,E) on 2 different time points over a bunch of patients. 1/0 stands for use or not-use the specific drug, respectively. My questions are, If I want to estimate the inter-rater reliability of 2 different time points simultaneously on 5 different drugs at same time, what test should I apply? Should I separately calculate the kappa on each drug and reported them individually ? or Could I just average the kappa score (geometric or arithmetic mean?)?? Thank you ~
