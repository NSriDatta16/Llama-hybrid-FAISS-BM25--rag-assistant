Always use generics! Using object's results in cast operations and boxing/unboxing of value-types. Because of these reasons generics are faster and more elegant (no casting). And - the main reason - you won't get InvalidCastException s using generics. So, generics are faster and errors are visible at compile-time. System.Object means runtime exceptions and casting which in general results in lower performance (sometimes MUCH lower).
