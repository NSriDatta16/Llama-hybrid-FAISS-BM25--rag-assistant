When setting up something like this, you have 2 options. You can either pipe mail out to a php handler, which is a little dangerous if you have to process a lot of mail at once, or you get mailbombed. Like @B Mitch said, a .forward file will do the trick. myemail@example.com,"|/our/script.php" Alternatively, can you use something like Zend_Mail_Storage to connect to a mailbox as if it were a client. Zend also supplies some useful helpers for parsing mail.
