Measuring average from a scale

I am not even sure my question makes sense but hoping one of you might see what I'm trying to achieve. I have a survey which has the following responses: Unhappy, neutral, happy I am not sure what values to assign these responses to draw out an average % conclusion of the survey responses I have got. Any ideas would be greatly appreciated!
