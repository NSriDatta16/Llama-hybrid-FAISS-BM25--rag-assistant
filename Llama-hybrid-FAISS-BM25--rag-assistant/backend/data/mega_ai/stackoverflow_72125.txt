How do you pass an authenticated session between app domains

Lets say that you have websites www.xyz.com and www.abc.com. Lets say that a user goes to www.abc.com and they get authenticated through the normal ASP .NET membership provider. Then, from that site, they get sent to (redirection, linked, whatever works) site www.xyz.com, and the intent of site www.abc.com was to pass that user to the other site as the status of isAuthenticated, so that the site www.xyz.com does not ask for the credentials of said user again. What would be needed for this to work? I have some constraints on this though, the user databases are completely separate, it is not internal to an organization, in all regards, it is like passing from stackoverflow.com to google as authenticated, it is that separate in nature. A link to a relevant article will suffice.
