I believe @Glen_b has answered your question about the use of $y$ in your formula. Here is a little more about standard normal CDFs. The CDF of a standard normal random variable $Z$ , the $\Phi_Z(z)$ of your question, cannot be expressed in closed algebraic form. Of course, it can be closely approximated by numerical integration, as you suggest. Printed tables of this CDF (with probabilities accurate to four or five places) are widely available---likely in your probability or statistics textbook. It is also possible to find a (piecewise) rational function that approximates this integral very well (accurate up to double precision arithmetic in most computer programs). This excellent approximation is implemented in R as pnorm (with mean $0$ and SD $1$ as default. Three examples are shown below. You may want to look in a printed normal table to see corresponding values there. pnorm(0) [1] 0.5 pnorm(1) [1] 0.8413447 pnorm(2) [1] 0.9772499 In the figure below, these are areas under the standard normal density curve to the left of the dark green, maroon, and blue vertical lines, respectively. R code for figure: hdr = "Standard Normal Density" curve(dnorm(x), -3.5, 3.5, lwd=2, ylab="Density", xlab="z", main=hdr) abline(h=0, col="green2") abline(v=0, col="darkgreen") abline(v=1, col="maroon") abline(v=2, col="blue") The corresponding inverse CDF (quantile function) is implemented in R as qnorm . This is roughly equivalent to finding the approximate value of a probability in the body of a printed standard normal CDF table and looking for its z-score in the margins of the table. [You will get about two-place accuracy.] The following output shows $a,b,c$ with $P(Z \le a) = 0.975,$ $P(Z \le b) = 0.95,$ $P(Z \le c) = 0.90,$ respectively. qnorm(.975); qnorm(.95); qnorm(.90) [1] 1.959964 # a (khaki) [1] 1.644854 # b (magenta) [1] 1.281552 # c (cyan)
