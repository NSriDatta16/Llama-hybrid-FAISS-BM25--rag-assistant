I can attest to Coursera's R Programming and Practical Machine Learning courses, as I've taken both. Once comfortable, read through the hard or free online copy of Hadley Wickham's Advanced R. This should give you a solid understanding of R programming. Although, if you need a solid foundation of object-oriented programming in general, I'd try sites like CodeAcademy or CodeSchool mentioned below.
