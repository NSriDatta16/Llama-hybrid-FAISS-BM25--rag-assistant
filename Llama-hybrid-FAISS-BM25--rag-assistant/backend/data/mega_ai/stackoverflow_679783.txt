The label is preferred to the input title attribute. If the label is present, JAWS reads that, otherwise if the title is present JAWS reads that.

From http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/struct/global.html#adef-title : Audio user agents may speak the title information in a similar context. For example, setting the attribute on a link allows user agents (visual and non-visual) to tell users about the nature of the linked resource: I tested using JAWS on this code: First name Label: email Label: Male Female I should also point out that Freedom Scientific has a trial download (ftp) which will give you a vastly deeper understanding of what web pages look like to users.
