This is how the SVN book recommends you do it. It seems pretty painful and basically revolves around having a working copy for each repo and literally copying changes between the two (you could probably also do this with SVN patches). Alternatively you can look into using SVK (which is distribution layer for SVN, adding Git-ish functionality to SVN) to setup repository mirroring or merging to external repos. Beware, the documentation for SVK is a little disorganized. Apparently the command-line help is good.
