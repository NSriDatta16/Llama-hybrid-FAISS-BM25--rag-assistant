Multivariate linear regression with dependant observations

the Multivariate linear regression model is given by $\underset{n \times d}{\mathbf{Y}} = \underset{n \times k}{\mathbf{X}} \hspace{2mm}\underset{k \times d}{\mathbf{B}} + \underset{n \times d}{\mathbf{E}}$ With $\mathbf{Y}$ is data, $\mathbf{X}$ is a non stochastic design matrix, $\mathbf{E}$ are normally distributed model errors, and $\mathbf{B}$ are the regression coefficients to be estimated. Also $n$ is the number of observation (e.g.,time samples in my specific context), $d$ the number of variables (e.g., time series at different pixels of an image) and $k$ the number of explanatory variables. All the books i read until now treat this problems using the assumption that the obervations (the different rows of $\mathbf{E}$) are independants whereas the different variables (the different columns of $\mathbf{E}$) are dependant with the $d \times d$ covariance structure $\boldsymbol\Sigma_d$. In this context, the model can be reparametrized as a multiple linear regression model: $\underset{nd \times 1}{\mathbf{y}} = \underset{nd \times nk}{\mathbf{D}} \hspace{2mm} \underset{nk \times 1}{\boldsymbol{\beta}} + \underset{nd \times 1}{\mathbf{e}}$ with $\mathbf{e}\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{I}_n \otimes\boldsymbol\Sigma_d$) where $\otimes$ is the kronecker product and solved using Generalized Least Square or Feasible GLS if $\boldsymbol\Sigma_d$ is unknown. QUESTIONS: 1-What happens when the observation are not independants ?. 2-Can we reparametrize the model using with $\mathbf{e}\sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{0},\mathbf{\Omega}_n \otimes\boldsymbol\Sigma_d$) and solve it using the GLS when $\mathbf{\Omega}_n$ and $\boldsymbol\Sigma_d$ are known . 3- Why this general problem (non independance of observations) is not treated in textbooks . Is it because the FGLS is too complex (i.e., find an estimate of both $\mathbf{\Omega}_n$ and $\boldsymbol\Sigma_d$) Best
