The standard deviation can be interpreted as a summary measure that captures variability. It is measured in the same units as the original variable. With additional assumptions, other interpretations are possible. For instance, if n random variables are statistically independent with standard deviation $\sigma$, then their average has standard $\sigma/\sqrt n$, and because of the central limit theorem, it gets closer and closer to normally distributed as $n$ increases. For some random variables, these assumptions are not satisfied. In financial markets, one should expect certain random variables to be correlated: if you see 3,999,999 foreclosures, expect number 4 million soon. This may prevent standard deviation from decreasing with $\sqrt n$ as many observations are averaged. In addition, some heavy-tailed random variables have infinite standard deviation, and any finite-sample description or inference using a standard deviation becomes misleading. You could instead consider the expected absolute deviation $E[|X - \text{median}(X)|]$, which always exists.
