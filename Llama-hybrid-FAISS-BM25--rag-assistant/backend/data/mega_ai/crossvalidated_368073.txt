The relationship between the number of bookings and the price is non-linear in your case. This means that increasing the price by 1% will have a different effect on the price depending on the price you start from. Starting from the price in the control group, an increase in the price seem to have less of an impact than a reduction in the price. Given the non-linearity, it is difficult to know for sure the effect of a 1% change of the price upwards or downwards. If we do a linear interpolation to estimate the effect of going from A to B and from A to C, it might be better to use the information symmetrically, both from A-B and from A-C. So you could proxy the impact of 1% change of the price as (B-C)/10 = -6. I.e. an increase of the price of 1% around the price in the control group would be associated with a loss of about 6 bookings. Now, if you wanted to do something more sophisticated, you could also try to fit a polynomial for the relationship between the price. In your case, it looks roughly like the opposite of a cubic polynomial (especially with the number of bookings in logs). If you're ready to make this functional-form assumption, you can refine the estimate of the local average effect of a 1% change.
