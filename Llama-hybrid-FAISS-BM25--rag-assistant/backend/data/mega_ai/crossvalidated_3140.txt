Knnclassify() matlab

I am currently working on matlab and I am new to it. I would like to know how do i average the results from the folds (or otherwise combined) to produce a single estimation. My dataset has 2 class labels +1 and -1. and k=5. I use the knnclassify() method in matlab in order to perform cross validation. Kindly help!
