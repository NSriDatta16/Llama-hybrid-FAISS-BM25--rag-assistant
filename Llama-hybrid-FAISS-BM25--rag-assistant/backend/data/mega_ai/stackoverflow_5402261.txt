Generate Pick & Pack List of Ordered Items in Magento, and send to Third-Party Logistics Company

In Magento, is it possible to provide a Pick & Pack list of items of available completed orders, to the 3rd-party Logistics company? There are, however, some additional problems which are:- Which all 3rd-party logistics companies be available & how? Will they be registered as customers or will they be available in some other way in Magento (just like Customers, but with very minimal permissions)? How will they be provided with the Pick & Pack List? Will they be mailed or they can view the list in some way in the Admin? If they (3rd-party logistics companies) are provided with login in the Magento admin, then they can also provide the Tracking Number of the dispatched goods. All queries & answers are welcome, and many thanks in advance to all of you for providing any suitable / probable way.
