Web SQL sync using a GoogleDocs spreadsheet?

I need to sync the WebDB of an extension I'm building, and was thinking about using a GoogleDocs spreadsheet as storage, so the extension should be able to read/write the "file" to keep the sync. (each line of the spreadsheet would be a DB record ) Is this feasible, or there are perhaps better solutions?
