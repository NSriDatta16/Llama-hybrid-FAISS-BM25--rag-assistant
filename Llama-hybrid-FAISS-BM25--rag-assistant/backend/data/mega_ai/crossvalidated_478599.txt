Presenting crosstabs in addition to multinominal logistic regression results (SPSS)

I'm using multinominal logistic regression (MLR) in SPSS to build a predictive model to identify which variables have an independent effect on an outcome, all things being equal. I then want to use crosstabs to pinpoint and discuss where exactly any differences lie between the statistically significant explanatory variables by comparing column proportions, particularly as I feel crosstabs results are more accessible and visually interpretable than MLR. My question is: is it acceptable practice to use and present both MLR and crosstab results in this way?
