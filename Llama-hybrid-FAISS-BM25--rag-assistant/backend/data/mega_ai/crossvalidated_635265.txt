This seems like a fairly standard case: I'm not 100% clear on what's worrying you. I guess you're more used to a disaggregated format where the response variable was binary, with many observations for each country/gender/age combination? The aggregated data are actually IMO better than the disaggregated data because of (1) computational efficiency (many fewer individual log-likelihoods to calculate!) and (2) possibility of testing for/accounting for overdispersion, e.g. see Hilbe, Joseph M. 2013. “Can Binary Logistic Models Be Overdispersed?” . The maximal model for this case would be cbind(denominator, numerator) ~ gender*age + (1 + gender*age | country) This model may be too complex for your data (singular fits, blah blah), but you should probably include at least the variation in gender effect across countries (i.e. (1+gender|country) if you are going to test the population-level effect of gender, e.g. see Schielzeth and Forstmeier 2009. To simplify the process of testing the main effect of gender, you should probably specify sum-to-zero contrasts ( contrasts = list(gender = contr.sum, age = contr.sum) , or globally via options(contrasts = c("contr.sum", "contr.poly")) Schielzeth, Holger, and Wolfgang Forstmeier. 2009. “Conclusions beyond Support: Overconfident Estimates in Mixed Models.” Behavioral Ecology 20 (2): 416–20. https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/arn145 .
