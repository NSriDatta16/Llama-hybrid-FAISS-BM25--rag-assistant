What size of intraclass correlation coefficient or design effect indicates clustering can be ignored?

I am working on a project where people are clustered into "agencies". Because there are a lot of other complications to the design, I would like to ignore the clustering. I found one relatively old reference from Muthen in Sociological Methodology that said it can be ignored if the "design effect" is less than 2 where $$\text{DE} = 1 + (\text{average cluster size} - 1)\text{ICC}$$ but I'd like confirmation from any other source. EDIT: The other complications are substantial missing data that I plan to multiply impute and that I need to test mediation models.
