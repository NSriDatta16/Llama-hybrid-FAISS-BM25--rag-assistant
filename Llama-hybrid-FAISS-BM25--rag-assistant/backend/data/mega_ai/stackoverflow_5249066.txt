How to get a callback function in vb6 with TaskDialogIndirect?

I'm using TaskDialogIndirect in VB6. It's working great, and I even have links working (with enabling TDF_ENABLE_HYPERLINKS) in the pszFooter member of TASKDIALOGCONFIG. The problem is that while the cursor turns into a "hand" when hovering over the link, I don't know how to get the TaskDialogIndirect's TASKDIALOGCONFIG.pfCallback member to point to a custom function of mine, so I can actually direct the user to the hyperlink shown. tdi.pszFooter = StrPtr(" www.cnn.com ") Can anyone help me? Thanks!
