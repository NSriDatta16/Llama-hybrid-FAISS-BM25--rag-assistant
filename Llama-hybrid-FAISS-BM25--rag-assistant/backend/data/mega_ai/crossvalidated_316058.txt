Since same summary statistics may be produced from samples taken from different distributions, and estimating the parameters for gamma distribution may differ when using moments as compared to maximum likelihood, you need to take into consideration that what you have is just the approximate description of your data. The first thing that comes to my mind in here is using approximate Bayesian computation , i.e. sample the parameters from the priors you assumed, simulate your data using the generative model, calculate the summary statistics from the simulated data, compare the simulated summary statistics $\hat S_\text{sim}$ with real summary statistics $S$ using some distance measure $\rho$, and when $\rho(S, \hat S_\text{sim}) The naive implementation should be very easy to code by hand in your favorite programming language, however this may be very inefficient, so comming up with more clever implementation may need some more research on your side. You can find friendly introduction to ABC on Rasmus Bååth's blog (see also the accompanying video ).
