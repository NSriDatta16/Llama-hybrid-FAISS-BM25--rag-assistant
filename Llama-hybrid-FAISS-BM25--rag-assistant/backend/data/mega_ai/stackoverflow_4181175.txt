Disable warnings in Visual Studio 2008

Env: Visual Studio Warning Level is set to 4, Code in the only file in solution: #pragma warning( push ) #pragma warning( disable: 4503 ) #pragma warning( disable: 4702 ) #include #pragma warning ( pop ) //mark #include "iostream" int main() { boost::property_tree::ptree pt; for( boost::property_tree::ptree::const_iterator it = pt.begin(); it != pt.end(); ++it ) { std::cout second.data() Problem: Warning 4503 still show up when compiling. Something else I have tried: put the line with '//mark' as last line of the app, no effect. if I use #pragma warning( disable: 4503 4702 ) without push/pop, it works, but it affects what's been compiled afterwards for whole solution, even I put #pragma warning( default: xx ) somewhere, it doesn't seem to set the warning back to default status. Who knows why this is happening and what's the best solution for suppressing warnings in visual studio. cheers.
