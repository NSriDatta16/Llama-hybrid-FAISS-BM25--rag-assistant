Why is this page's font-size overriden by reset.css's font-size?

Go to this page and look at any paragraph's text font size using Firebug. The font size is 13px. Here reset.css body: font-size 100% is overrding master.css body: font-size 62.5%. Why? My understanding is that if the same tag is defined in two css files, the one that comes last takes precedence. I expected it would use the one from master.css line 10. Don't the the two Body tags have the same specificity?
