All politics/religion aside, licensing makes a difference for some organizations. Nexus is GPL now AGPLv3 and now Eclipse Public License (EPL) . Artifactory is Apache licensed LGPLv3 licensed as of version 2.1 of the product. You may also want to consider Archiva , just for comparison's sake. It's Apache 2.0 licensed.
