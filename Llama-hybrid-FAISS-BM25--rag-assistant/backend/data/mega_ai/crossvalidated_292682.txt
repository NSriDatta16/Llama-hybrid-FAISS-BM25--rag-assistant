Which measure of dispersion is this function related to?

Consider a sample $x=\{x_1,...,x_n\}$. Define the average as $\bar x$. Consider the following formula: $$ \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(\dfrac{x_i}{\bar x} \right)^c}{n} $$ or equivalently: $$ \dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^n\left(1 + \dfrac{\epsilon_i}{\bar x} \right)^c}{n} $$ where $\epsilon_i = x_i - \bar x$ and $c$ is a constant. To me, these formulas "look like" a measure of dispersion from the mean. But I have not found to which known measure they resemble (at least nothing from this long list ). So, my questions: Do they measure dispersion? Maybe for particular values of $c$ only, e.g. $c=2$ or $c=1$? If so, do these have a name?
