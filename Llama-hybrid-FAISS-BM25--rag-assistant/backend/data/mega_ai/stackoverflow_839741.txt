You are right about the fact that the subclass will often take more space than the parent class. However this is not a problem because the subclasses aren't really stored in the array at all -- the only thing that is stored in the array are references to the actual object, which are always of the same size. To use your analogy, imagine that you have a number of garages where your wife has her cars. Obviously the cars are of different sizes, but that does not prevent you from having a list with the number of each car (your wifes first car was labeled 1, the next 2) and where that car is currently parked (your wife has so many cars that you have to keep your own parking lots numbered). The cars have different sizes and are different models, but you can still write them all on the list and they are still all cars, so they have something in common (you can for example drive them, each get so and so many mpg). One of the benefits of object oriented programming is that subclasses can be used in place of their superclass.
