So, I'm posting the answer to my original question. I was able to circumvent the 5000 row limit on FQL queries by chunking the array of UIDs (using the appropriately-named array_chunk() PHP function) and looping through the chunks to execute mini-queries, and then appending it all back into one array. The whole script averages 14 seconds for over 12,000 rows so that is a huge improvement. You can see the application at work here: givememydata.com Oh, and Facebook should reconsider their (still undocumented) FQL row limit. What is more taxing on their servers? A single query that executes in 5 seconds or 500 queries that take 180 seconds? Sorry, had to vent. ;-)
