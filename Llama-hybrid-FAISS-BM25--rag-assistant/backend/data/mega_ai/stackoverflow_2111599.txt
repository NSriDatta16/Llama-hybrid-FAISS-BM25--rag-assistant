Best practice for harvesting COM file file to WiX fragment

I have made a dynamic deployment project based on WiX 3.0, that uses mainly HEAT to consume directories in dynamic way (files + DLL that need to be registered). The question is that i don't understand what attribute should i use in heat in term of the COM, Should i use "-SCOM" or not (what does it effect e.g. patching) thanks
