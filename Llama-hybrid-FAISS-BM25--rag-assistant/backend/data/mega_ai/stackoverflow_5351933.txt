Zend Framework Action Stack Alternative

is there a way in Zend to call one controller from another? I have seen the action stack but that does not seem to work for me and i have read that alot of people think it to be EVIL! What i am trying to acchive is as follows: Reports Controller scans through all the modules in the system, it then checks to see if a route has been registered for that module called MODULENAME-reports-run The controller then reuns that registered route to generate all the reports from all the modules. The idea is that i can create modules for my application that clients can simple drag and drop into place and the system picks up on the reports.
