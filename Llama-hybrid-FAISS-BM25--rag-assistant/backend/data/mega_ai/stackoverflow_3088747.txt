To achieve basic code coverage what tests should I run against an ASP.NET MVC Controller?

My controllers are utilizing StructureMap and AutoMapper. Presently, there is nothing exceptional with my routes. For the basic CRUD controller actions what tests should I be writing to ensure good code coverage?
