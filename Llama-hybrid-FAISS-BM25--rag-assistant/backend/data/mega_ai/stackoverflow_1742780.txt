A union can be used to store any one of its members, but (unlike a struct) no more than one at the same time. You can think of it as containing enough space to store the largest of its members, and re-using the same storage for whichever member you actually assign a value to. C++ also has unions. Java doesn't. Object members in Python work completely differently from C, they're stored in a dictionary rather than laid out consecutively in memory. I don't know whether Python has some handy library class somewhere that acts a bit like a union, but it's not fundamental to the object like it is in C.
