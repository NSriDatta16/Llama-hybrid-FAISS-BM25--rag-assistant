Using a supervised learning to compare two conditions

I've got to analyze data about two signals x and y using machine learning but am stuck with how to proceed. Conditions are: 1) signal x and y are known to be linked to one another, but no parametric model exists 2) we performed a manipulation in the system to see whether the manipulation changes the relationship between x and y. My hypothesis is that the manipulation decreases the link between x and y compared to baseline condition (no manipulation). Since no parametric model exists, I use a machine learning algorithm to approximate the function to map x to y. Then I want to show that model performance is worse in the manipulation condition, expected for the hypothesis that the manipulation decreases the link between x and y. My question is, how should I use a machine learning algorithm here? More precisely, which in the following do you think I should do? A) Fit a ML separately in baseline and manipulation conditions, and compare cross-validation scores between these two B) Fit a ML only in baseline condition and test in manipulation condition to see if information to predict y in x is lost in manipulation condition (showing that prediction accuracy in manipulation condition is worse than cross-validation score in baseline)
