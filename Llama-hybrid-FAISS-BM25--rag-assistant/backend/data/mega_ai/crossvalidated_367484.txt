Gamma Conjugate Prior & Poisson Process

I am analyzing daily data transaction data. I am assuming that The number of transactions in every day of length t has the Poisson distribution with mean 位 t The number of transactions in evert collection of disjoint days are independent Xi = {number of transactions on day i} And thus, X~Poisson(位) where 位 is the mean number conversions per day. I want to take a Bayesian approach - specifically, as I get more days of data, I want to update 位 with the conjugate prior distribution to the Poisson, Gamma. What are the parameters of this Gamma distribution and how do they relate to the Poisson process?
