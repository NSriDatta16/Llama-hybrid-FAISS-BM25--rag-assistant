“What are the differences in the co-movements between the GB market and the treasury, corporate, stock, and carbon markets pre and during the Covid-19 crisis period?“ Using the same model for the two subperiods intuitively seems wrong since if there are any changes in the markets volatility in-between these two periods, the model created to fit data over the entire period could be a bad fit for at least one of these periods? Or can the model be a good fit for the entire period since it is developed for time series with inconsistent volatility? If the data generating process changes over time, then fitting a single model with time-constant parameters indeed cannot reflect that. It would be a simplification, and an unwelcome one at that if your goal is to assess whether there have been changes and what they have been like. So it would make sense to fit the model on subsamples and compare the results. If you believe some of the model's parameters stay constant over the entire sample period, you could fit the model for the entire period and use some dummies to account for the variations in some parameters (the ones that are not supposed to have stayed constant). A problem with that is that it may not be an option in the software you are using. Another problem of this method would be that I only got 254 observations for the “during crisis period” Regarding the sample size and estimation precision, this is a genuine problem. If there is little data, it is fundamentally difficult to estimate a model's parameters, and I am not sure there is any nice way to circumvent this. Simplifying assumptions (such as assuming some parameters stay fixed for the entire sample) may be necessary to make modeling feasible.
