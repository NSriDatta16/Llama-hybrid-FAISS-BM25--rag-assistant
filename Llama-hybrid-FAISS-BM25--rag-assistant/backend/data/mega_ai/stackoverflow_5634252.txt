W7P ListBox doesn't stay scrolled in the emulator

I have a ListBox in a xaml page for a Windows Phone 7 app. It starts out empty, then I populate it with some items once they are retrieved from a web service. So far that all works fine - the items show up in the list and all seems fine. The problem I have is when I try to drag the list to scroll to the bottom (in the emulator): I can scroll down, but as soon as I release the mouse button the list springs back to the top as though I hadn't scrolled it at all. Any insights into why it would behave this way? And the method that populates the list: foreach (InfoBoard entry in boards.Values) { item = new ListBoxItem(); item.Content = entry.Name; item.Name = entry.Id.ToString(); //used to tell which entry was clicked InfoBoardListBox.Items.Add(item); }
