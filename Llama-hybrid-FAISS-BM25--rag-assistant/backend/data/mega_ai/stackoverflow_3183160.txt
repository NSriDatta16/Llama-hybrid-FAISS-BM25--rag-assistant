Qt uses Unicode and should be able to display (Unicode) text in any language you have a suitable font for. For example, Roberto Alesina's simple "Hello World" program on the PyQt Wiki -- which I transcribe for readability (and w/o the comments for brevity) since it's pretty unreadable in the wiki -- should let you use as the button's text any such Unicode text (so I've taken the liberty of translating it so it uses an accented letter;-)...: # -*- coding: utf-8 -*- # (or w/ever other coding you use for unicode literals;-) import qt, sys a=qt.QApplication(sys.argv) w=qt.QPushButton(u"Ol√° Mundo", None) w.show() a.exec_loop()
