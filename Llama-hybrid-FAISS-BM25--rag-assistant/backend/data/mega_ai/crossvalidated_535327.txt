My current best answer to my own question: Bayesian structural models can be useful for time series imputation and time series forecasting. One way to implement Bayesian structural models is using the TensorFlow probability library (Others include Stan and Pyro). In TensorFlow probability, missing values can be included using MaskedTimeSeries . One way to include the time series nature of the missing channel is with an auto-regressive component. Depending on the the series you want to model other options include for instance LocalLevel or LocalLinearTrend. One way to model the relationship between the channel with missing values and the other channels is with a linear regression component. See the second part of this example.
