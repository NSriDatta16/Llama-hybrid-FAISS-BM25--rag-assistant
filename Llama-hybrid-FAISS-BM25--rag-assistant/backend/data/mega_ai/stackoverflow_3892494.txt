Sharing code across mobile plataforms

Is it possible to share a Java application across several mobile platforms (Android, BlackBerry, Symbian, etc) regarding of Android is a Java SE (almost compliant), BlackBerry is JavaME, etc? Thanks in advance. EDIT: I'm not talking about GUI which it won't be possible. There is another things which do I have to take care ?, i.e Vector instead of List. Threads? Memory management? Storage management? Items referred above is where my interest particularly is focused on. Thanks all for your answers.
