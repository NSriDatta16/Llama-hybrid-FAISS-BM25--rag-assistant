Before answering your question, I would suggest you to read An Introduction to Variational Autoencoders which is a more detailed and extended version of the referenced paper. So $f$ is used as a general term for an objective function which we aim to optimize. Monte Carlo Methods use repeated sampling from random processes to estimate a value. This means that we draw $L$ latent variables $z^{(l)}$ from $q_{\theta}(z|x^{(i)})$ and then take the average of the gradient ( $\frac{1}{L}\sum_{l=1}^L$ ). In this case with $z$ being iid, the total variance is the sum of variances . Therefore, the variance increases when $L$ increases (and this only for one datapoint). In the next section, they say that $L$ can be set to 1 if the batch size is large enough.
