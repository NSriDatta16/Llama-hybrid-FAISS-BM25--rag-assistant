JavaWebStart app randomly fails

I have a JAR signed with a self-signed certificate and deployed by JWS. It usually runs ok (most of the times) but sometimes fails which is quite annoying, It shows the splashscreen but nothing else. These are the last log lines: 2009-09-08T16:55:33 1252421733468 173 com.sun.deploy FINE com.sun.deploy.util.LoggerTraceListener print 10 network: Conectando socket://127.0.0.1:4590 con proxy=DIRECT 2009-09-08T16:55:37 1252421737171 174 com.sun.deploy FINE com.sun.deploy.util.LoggerTraceListener print 10 security: JAVAWS AppPolicy Permission requested for: http://127.0.0.1/ikuspro/ikuspro.jar 2009-09-08T16:55:37 1252421737171 175 com.sun.deploy FINE com.sun.deploy.util.LoggerTraceListener print 10 security: We were not granted permission, exiting And this is my jnlp file Ikuspro MyName Ikuspro Desc+ As I've said It doesn't always happen and the certificate has been accepted permanently. Besides I see that the debugging is in FINE level, How can I make it more verbose? Thanks in advance
