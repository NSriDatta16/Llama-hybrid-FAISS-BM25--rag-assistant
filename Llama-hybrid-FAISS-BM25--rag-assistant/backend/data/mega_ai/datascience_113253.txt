A time series model such as SARIMAX would likely be the best option, but under a few conditions. Most important is having historic data on restaurant traffic. Say that the restaurant opened a while ago but next month it will become very popular for some reason not captured by your data, one of the most important predictors for todays traffic will be the last few days of traffic - this would not be present in a linear regression unless you transformed the variable into a moving average or similar, at which point you're just replicating the inherent functionality of a time series model. SARIMAX requires a long history of training data however, as it needs to learn that, for instance, if your restaurant is an ice cream shop, the yearly seasonality would likely imply that august shows higher demand for ice cream than december. You have a predictor for temperature, which sort of covers that, but seasonality would be more robust. Weekly seasonality is also important, as there's probably higher demand on saturday than tuesday. So essentially, if you have enough historic data and believe that there is a trend in traffic (going up or down instead of randomly distributed) use time series. Otherwise, sounds like you have a decent enough set of predictors to make a linear regression, just try to transform your predictors to take the time-series nature of your data into account
