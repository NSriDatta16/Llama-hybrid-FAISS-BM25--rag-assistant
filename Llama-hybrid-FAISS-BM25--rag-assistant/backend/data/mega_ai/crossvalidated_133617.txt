A binomial process is a descretization of the Poisson process, which depends on an artificial binwidth. Thus, when performing regression on continous (time-series) data such as fish caught or neuronal spiking, the advantage of using Poisson regression (such as w/ a GLM w/ an exponential link function) over bernoulli regression (such as logistic regression) is that once you have the estimated poisson rate function $r(t)$, you can always recreate the bernoulli firing probability in every bin as $P(event-in-\Delta_t)=\int_{\Delta_t} r(t)dt$ tl'dr: you can always transform from Poisson to bernoulli, but you cant transform the other way. Thus Poisson has more information
