Combine two single-level perceptrons

Suppose we have a training dataset with $s$ instances, and we split it to 2 sets, of lengths $n, m$ such that $s = n + m$ . We train two perceptron models $p$ and $q$, both are defined by a k-dimensional vector of weights, $w_1$ and $w_2$. Such that $p$ was trained on $n$ instances, and $q$ on $m$ instances. In order to combine them to a single model, is it possible to simply use a weighted average of the weights? i.e.: $w_3 = (1/(n+m))[n * w_1 + m * w_2]$
