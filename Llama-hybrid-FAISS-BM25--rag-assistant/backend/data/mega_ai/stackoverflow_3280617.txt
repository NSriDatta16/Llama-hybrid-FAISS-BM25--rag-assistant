I would strongly encourage you to use a ping/echo model between client and server, so that if no data is sent for x seconds a ping message needs to be send. A typical reason for a break might be a firewall, which shuts down socketss because of inactivity. The typical issue where the TCP model fails are physical problems e.g. a pulled/broken cable and hangs on one side, where technically someone is listening until a queue overrun kicks in (which might never happen given your amount of data).
