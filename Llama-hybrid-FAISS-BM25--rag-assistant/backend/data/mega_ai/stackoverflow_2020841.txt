I think this excellent document on how to use org-mode to it's fullest potential will be very helpful to you: "Org Mode: Organize Your Life In Plain Text" . It is lengthy reading, but trust me, completely worth the effort. UPDATE: You can use the remember-mode section mentioned in the document for your use-case. (I use it for the same use-case) Remember-mode is extremely handy to make quick notes. I use it when I have to store random observations or information that won't go anywhere else. I use the following templates for remember: (setq org-default-notes-file (concat org-directory "/remember-notes.org")) (setq org-remember-templates `(("Todo" ?t "* TODO %?\n %i\n" ,(concat org-directory "/remember-notes.org") bottom) ("Misc" ?m "* %?\n %i\n" ,(concat org-directory "/Notes.org") "Misc") ("iNfo" ?n "* %?\n %i\n" ,(concat org-directory "/Notes.org") "Information") ("Idea" ?i "* %?\n %i\n" ,(concat org-directory "/Notes.org") "Ideas") ("Journal" ?j "* %T %?\n\n %i\n" ,(concat org-directory "/journal.org") bottom) ("Blog" ?b "* %T %? :BLOG:\n\n %i\n" ,(concat org-directory "/journal.org") bottom) )) As you can see, misc notes and other information goes in the notes.org file under the headings Misc and Information. If the note I'm making doesn't fall in any of the categories defined above, it gets filed in the default file (remember-notes.org) and I can always refile it to another location at a convenient time. This makes my note-taking, jotting down random ideas, and such things extremely simple, without taking away the focus from the job I'm currently doing.
