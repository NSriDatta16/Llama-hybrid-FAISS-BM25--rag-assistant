The fact that your labels are binary does not imply that the predictions have to be binary. Most classification methods can output probabilities, even though they are trained on binary targets. Specifically, logistic regression, kNN, random forests and gradient boosted decision trees (GBM) can all do that. I agree that only a probabilistic prediction makes sense here. For one thing, I'm guessing the conversion rates are low, and if so, most or all of the the hard predictions would be 0. Obviously, with probabilities (or just decision values), you can get a ranking of the leads and use that.
