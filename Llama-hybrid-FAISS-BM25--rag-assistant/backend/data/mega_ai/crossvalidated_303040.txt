Network Equipment Availability and Significant Figures

looking for assistance in solving what I thought would be straightforward question but am struggling with. I monitor large numbers of Network gear including switches, routers and firewalls for availability. I report monthly from a network monitoring system database on combined uptime availability using 5 significant figures, for example 99.742% I am concerned that this may overstate the precision based on our polling frequency (we check most devices every two minutes but some longer, the simple average is 169 sec.) Is there a formula or methodology I can use to determine polling frequency to report 5 significant figures? Similarly what is the number of significant figures I could legitimately report using the current polling? Thanks for your time.
