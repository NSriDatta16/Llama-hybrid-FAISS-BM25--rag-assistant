Markov property on non-stationary time-series

I am working with a dataset with several time-series, and I want to test the Markov property on all of them. However, some of them are non-stationary and following the definitions on the text "Testing for the Markov Property in Time Series" from Chen and Hong, the beginning of the theoretical description is "Suppose ${X_t}$ is a strictly stationary $d$ -dimensional time series process, where $d$ is a positive integer. It follows a Markov process if the conditional probability distribution of $X_{t+1}$ given the information set $I_t = \{X_t , X_{tâˆ’1} , ...\}$ is the same as the conditional probability distribution of $X_{t+1}$ given $X_t$ only." So my question is: can the Markov property hold for a non-stationary time series? If the answer is positive, how could I test it on my non-stationary data?
