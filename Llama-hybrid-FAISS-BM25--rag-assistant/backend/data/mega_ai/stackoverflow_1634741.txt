The SystemVerilog extensions to the IEEE Verilog Standard include a variety of constructs which facilitate creating thorough test suites for verifying complex digital logic designs. SystemVerilog is one of the Hardware Verification Languages (HVL) which is used to verify ASIC chip designs via simulation (as opposed to emulation or using FPGA's). Significant benefits over a traditional Hardware Design Language (Verilog) are: constrained randomization assertions automatic collection of functional and assertion coverage data The key is to have access to simulation software which supports this recent (2005) standard. Not all simulators fully support the more advanced features. In addition to the IEEE standard, there is an open-source SystemVerilog library of verification components available from VMM Central ( http://www.vmmcentral.com ). It provides a reasonable framework for creating a test environment. SystemVerilog is not the only HVL,and VMM is not the only library. But, I would recommend both, if you have access to the appropriate tools. I have found this to be an effective methodology in finding design bugs before becoming silicon.
