Setting up a TreeView in Silverlight with a HierarchicalDataTemplate and Binding with ItemSource

I am trying to build a TreeView and have it set up like this link: Silverlight vs WPF - Treeview with HierarchialDataTemplate As a comment to the first actual answer provided the poster says how they solved it but they didn't provide code and I understand what they said but I am really new to this and can't get it right. I have the same set-up structure with the entities and groups. I was wondering if some one could explain what the xaml ended up looking like. I am assuming by saying they made a new node class it just means they made a class that contains essentially a list of groups. Something like class groupHolder { public List myGroups {get;set;} public groupHolder() { myGroups = new List (); } } I am just trying to go three levels deep: Group 1 - - - - AnotherGroup1 - - - - - - - - entity1 - - - - - - - - entity2 - - - - AnotherGroup2 - - - - - - - - entity1 Group2 - - - - Entity1 - - - - Entity2 - - - - AnotherGroup1 - - - - - - - - entity1 - - - - - - - - entity2 - - - - AnotherGroup2 - - - - - - - - entity1 and so on... Like I said, I am new to this. I've also been trying to use this tutorial: http://blogs.microsoft.co.il/blogs/davids/archive/2009/06/04/hierarchicaldatatemplate-and-treeview.aspx but when I try and set another HierarchicalDataTemplate it says that ItemTemplate is set more than once. I'm lost. edit: found this link on the web, it helps, too.... I think... http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/36451/Organizing-Heterogeneous-Data-on-a-WPF-TreeView.aspx
