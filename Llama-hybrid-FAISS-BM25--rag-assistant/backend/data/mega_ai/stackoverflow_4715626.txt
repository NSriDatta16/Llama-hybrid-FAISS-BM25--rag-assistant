If you subclass UITableView , override touchesBegan and make a BOOL or some other sort of check that would prevent it from calling [super touchesBegan]; . The other alternative solution would be to subclass a UIView and place it over the table, make it transparent and then make it disappear after it gets touched. Both of these are not optimal solutions, however it sounds like this is a pretty small task, it should do the job.
