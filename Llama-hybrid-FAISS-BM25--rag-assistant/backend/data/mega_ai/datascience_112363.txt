a. For a beginner I would suggest the fullstackdeeplearning course, it's a modern overview of tools and best practices for ML in production. As you can see below, there are a lot of moving pieces. b. What you are asking for can be done with Spark + Airflow. In particular Airflow (or similar tools such as Luigi) allows to create very customised data pipelines. The learning curve is a bit steep, but there are good resources available online. c. The course above should answer your questions, as the data side is not really deep learning specific, but can apply also to data-science workflows.
