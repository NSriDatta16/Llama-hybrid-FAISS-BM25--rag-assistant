How do I check for bias of an estimator?

I need to check if an estimator $\hat\theta$ for the parameter $\theta$ is biased. Theory says I should compare the expected value of $\hat\theta$ versus the expected value of $\theta$. I assume the expected value of an estimator is the "weighted average" of the estimator and its distribution: $E[\hat\theta] = \int_0^\inf \hat\theta f(\hat\theta) d\hat\theta$*. If I'm right, to compute $E[\hat\theta]$ I need to know how $\hat\theta$ is distributed. For example: $X$ is a random var with support $0 *is it $E[\hat\theta] = \int_0^\inf \hat\theta f(\hat\theta) d\hat\theta$ or $E[\hat\theta] = \int_0^\inf \hat\theta f(x) dX$?
