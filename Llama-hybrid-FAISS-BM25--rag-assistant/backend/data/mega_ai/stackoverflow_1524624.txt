Recovering HyperSQL Database

We are using JBoss 4.0.3 SP1 using Hypersonic as its internal storage engine (timers, queues, etc.) The database is no longer accessible (most likely data corruption) giving error; Caused by: org.hsqldb.HsqlException: old version database must be shutdown . Is there a way or command to shutdown the database to recover the data (~150MB) stuck in the flat file? Edit Resolved the connection problem by downgrading to Hypersonic 1.8. How ever the database itself is corrupt. You have rows with duplicate keys, and lots of null fields. Having read this article and this one , i'm in the process of changing the default JBossMQ database to MS SQL
