Gibbs sampling for one variable in a row

In the gibbs sampling, if I sample only one variable repetitively (say 3 times) while other variables remain the same, and sample next one variable for 3 times and so on.. $x_{1_1}^* \sim p(x_1^* |x_2,x_3) $ , $x_{1_2}^* \sim p(x_1^* |x_2,x_3) $ , $x_{1_3}^* \sim p(x_1^* |x_2,x_3) $ $x_{2_1}^* \sim p(x_2^* |x_{1_3}^*,x_3) $ , $x_{2_2}^* \sim p(x_2^* |x_{1_3}^*,x_3) $ , $x_{2_3}^* \sim p(x_2^* |x_{1_3}^*,x_3)$ Scan order1 : $(x_1,x_1,x_1, x_2,x_2,x_2, x_3,x_3,x_3)$ Would this Markov chain sample from target distribution as original gibbs sampling? In addition, would sampling a block of variables in a row be valid as well? Scan order2 : $(x_1,x_2,x_3,x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4,x_5,x_6,x_4,x_5,x_6,â€¦)$ In my opinion, no matter how many times the chain samples one variable from proper conditional distribution, it always samples from target distribution, even if samples are highly correlated. If my thinking is right, is there any algorithm using this kind of scan order?
