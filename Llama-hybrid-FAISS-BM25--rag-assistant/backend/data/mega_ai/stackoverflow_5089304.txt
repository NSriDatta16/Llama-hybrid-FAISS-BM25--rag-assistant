How to pass table name as parameter to database query in Kohana 3

I have a complex 3 layer query in wich I`d liked to pass table name as parameter. I use code like this: DB::query(Database::SELECT, 'SELECT SUM(volume) AS `volumeTotal`, MIN(volume) AS `volumeMin`, MAX(volume) AS `volumeMax`, AVG(volume) AS `volumeAverage`, STD(volume) AS `volumeSD` FROM ( SELECT TIMEDIFF (DT,CAST( @dt AS DATETIME )) AS Ival, CAST( @dt AS DATETIME ) AS `start` , @dt := DT AS `stop` , `volume` FROM ( SELECT @dt := NULL) dt, ( SELECT * FROM :table WHERE id = :XID) vals ORDER BY dt ASC) vI') ->param(':table', $tableName) ->param(':XID', $ID) ->execute(); It is not suitable for me to use query builder for this (and I think it is not optimal way). Of course, I may input parameters into query directly like " .$tableName. ", but I think there should be a more correct way. The question is: How to pass table name as parameter to database query using Kohana?
