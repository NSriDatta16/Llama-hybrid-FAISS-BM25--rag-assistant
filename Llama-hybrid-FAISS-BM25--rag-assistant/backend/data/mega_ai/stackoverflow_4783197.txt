.NET button in div with style="display:none" not firing

I have a pretty simple web-form set up in .Net where I am leveraging jQuery for some of the functionality. I am using the DOMWindow portion for part of the presentation layer. There is a login form in a div that is set to display:none. When a user clicks a button on the page, it displays the login form. However the .Net button for the login form will not fire it's event when display is set to none. If i take this out, it fires fine. I have also tried using the visibility attribute, but no luck. the div code is: The launching code is: click here to login. the jQuery code is: function LaunchLoginWindow() { $(document).append("#Login"); $.openDOMWindow({ loader: 1, loaderImagePath: 'animationProcessing.gif', loaderHeight: 7, loaderWidth: 8, windowSourceID: '#Login' }); } Any help or explanation that anyone can offer is appreciated. I noticed i had some code in there defining a client-side function on the Login div. I removed this so as to eliminate it as a possible issue.
