Simply drag the .a files into the Xcode project and choose "copy files into project". I'm not familiar with OpenLDAP but I think the _r version is just a threadsafe version. I would recommend using that and not copying the other. You should probably not copy both files into Xcode or you will get link errors. Then do the same for the .h files that define the client APIs of OpenLDAP - again I'm not sure which these are but I'm sure you can find out easily. I would advise organising the .a and .h files together in a Xcode group under resources. Include the header files in your source and you should be good to go.
