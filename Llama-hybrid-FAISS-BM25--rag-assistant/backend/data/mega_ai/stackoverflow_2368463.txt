Automation Error - Not enough storage is available to process this command

VB6 CreateObject() is advising this error message: "Automation Error" - "Not enough storage is available to process this command" The object being created is a DLL written in C. I'm running the application that's trying to create the object on my machine, and the object itself is being created on my machine also. I'm running Windows Vista 64bit. Any help would be much appreciated.
