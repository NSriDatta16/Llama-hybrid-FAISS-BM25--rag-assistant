Time series analysis on small dataset

I am new to time series and therefore trying to feel my way around. I am required to do some analysis and possibly come up with a model. However, I have at most 2 years worth of quarterly data (at most 8 datapoints). Can I build any meaningful model based on the data? What possible model apart from linear regression with time as regressor can be built? Thanks
