why are they giving me different results? Why should they not give you different results? AIC and BIC are not the same. They serve different goals and are optimal in different ways (e.g. AIC is efficient while BIC is consistent). If you want to use the model for prediction, you could prefer AIC due to its efficiency. For explanatory modelling, BIC could be chosen for its consistency. In any case, the models are quite large for a sample size of mere 131 observation. Since you could expect monthly seasonality here, consider using just the first few lags plus the lag number 12, or seasonally adjust the data in advance and rerun the lag order selection. Edit Responding to a relevant comment: Since you used seasonal differencing when constructing the Housing price time series, there is probably no need to look for seasonality there. I do not seem to see the direction of the cause, is it possitive or negative (and increase in B produces an increase or a drop in House prices at t+1?) Take a look at impulse response functions (IRFs). Consider a positive impulse to B and see how House prices react over time. You could do that using "vars" package in R. Select model order (may do it manually or use function VARselect ), estimate the model (function VAR ) and extract impulse responses (function irf ). is the conclusion valid that changes in B produce changes in House prices? what are the weakness in this line of argument? If you conclude that B Granger-causes House prices , the model must have shown (with, say, 95% confidence) that indeed changes in B produce changes in House prices . If you believe the model is alright and there are no hidden problems (e.g. there is no hidden factor that causes both B and House prices ), the argument is fine. Note: I did not proof-read your code but I assume it does what you say it does.
