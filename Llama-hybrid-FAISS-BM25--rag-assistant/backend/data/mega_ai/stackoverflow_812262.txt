creating a Paging List View in MFC

How can I create a List View (or List Ctrl) with paging ? that means that whenever there are too many items in the List Ctrl, those items are organised in different pages. hope u get wht i mean. It would be better if there is already such control built (for example in Codeproject). thanks.
