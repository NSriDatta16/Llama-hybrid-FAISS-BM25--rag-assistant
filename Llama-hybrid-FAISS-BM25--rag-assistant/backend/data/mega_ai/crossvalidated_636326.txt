As Erik Ruzek points out in another answer (+1), the PC1 coefficient is the value when all the predictors with which it interacts have values of 0: all of pH , DominancePattern , Region , and WT . In the default treatment coding used by R, those last 3 categorical predictors have values of 0 when they are at their reference levels. The concept of a "mean value" is a little difficult for your 3 categorical predictors. It might be best to interpret that the way that this ggeffects vignette explains: ggemmeans() - like ggeffect() - averages over the proportions of the categories of factors. That is why you have small differences in Predicted over the range of PC1 values that you provided despite the apparently large PC1 coefficient. As the answer from Erik Ruzek notes, the type="random" argument only affects the widths of the confidence intervals, not the point estimates. If you want to know whether PC1 has a significant association with outcome, use the anova.lme() function on your model , with a Terms argument specifying all coefficients (individual and interaction) that involve PC1 . That provides a Wald "chunk test" evaluating the joint null hypothesis that all those coefficients have values of 0.
