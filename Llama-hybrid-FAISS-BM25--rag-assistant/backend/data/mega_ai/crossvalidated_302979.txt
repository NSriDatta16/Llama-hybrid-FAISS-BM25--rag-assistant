As @user20637 points on the the comment below, the result of a t-test of your squared data against the squared US population mean will not necessarily imply that your data are shifted relative to the US population. You cannot assess that from what you have. Instead, you are just testing if your mean is above a fixed point. Beyond that, you are just making assumptions. If you have enough data, and can assume that the distribution of your data is a good representation of the population distribution from which they were drawn, you could bootstrap your mean to get a better test. Another possibility would be to run a set of sensitivity analyses and report the range of results. For example, what if the reported value is the population mean, but the population distribution were as skewed as yours? Other possibilities exist. You could also be upfront about the assumptions you are making about the population by using a Bayesian analysis.
