Using memcached as a session storage with CodeIgniter

I am researching possibilities of using memcached as a session storage for a system built on CodeIgniter . Has anybody done this before(that's probably a stupid question :) and if so what's your experience folks? Have you used any existing libraries/extensions? As far as performance improvement what have you seen? Any caveats?
