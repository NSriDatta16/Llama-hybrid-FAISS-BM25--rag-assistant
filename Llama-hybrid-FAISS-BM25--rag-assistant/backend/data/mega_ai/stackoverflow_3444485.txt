The best practice is to have the form rendered once and change the values according to the nodes selected. As already mentioned, data isn't the field to use. To assign values in a bulk manner, you should use Ext.form.BasicForm.setValues( Array/Object values ) method. You are getting BasicForm object using FormPanel's getForm() method. Summarizing, var form = new Ext.FormPanel({/*...*/}); tree.on('click', function (node){ form.getForm().setValues(node.attributes); }); Pay attention, that form fields' names and attributes' names should correspond.
