When calculating a standardized change score, what do you divide by and why?

I understand that, in most cases, one calculates a standardized change between two scores as ( Lakens 2013 ) i.e., the mean of the change scores is divided by the standard deviation of the change scores. My question is: Why don't we divide by the standard deviation of the scores at baseline , instead? It seems more intuitive to me to present a standardized change as a measure of variability in the scores at baseline rather than variability in how much scores changed. For example, imagine a medication for headaches; at baseline, people's headache pain scores have a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 2. After taking the medication, their headache pain scores have a mean of 8. The drug works about the same in everybody; the standard deviation of the change score is only .25. Wouldn't it be more useful to say "this drug helped move the average person a whole standard deviation down from their baseline pain score" rather than "this drug moved the average person down eight times what the average person changed"? What is the rationale here?
