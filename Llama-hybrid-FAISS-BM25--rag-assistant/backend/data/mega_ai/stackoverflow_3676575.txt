I solved the issue, however it is not the most elegant solution. Essentially what I do is this: 1. After the site loads I look at all the objects that are in window and push them into an array. This basically says to my code, ignore these objects. When I modularize my code I keep track of the length of the files and fileNames being place into a module. The last line of the modulizer takes the fileLength array and lineLengths and calls a function in my error handling object; The error handling code finds new objects in window. If they exist, set a property to match fileLengths and fileNames; Recurse through the new objects and add decorate the functions to have try catches around them. When one of those catches is hit, traverse upward and find the properties. Calculate the file and line number based on the properties. Output the new error based on the correct file and line number; Yes ugly... but it works.
