Classifying sequences of handwritten digits

What's the best approach for recognising a sequence of handwritten digits? EDIT: By this I mean a program that might, for example, take this image as input, and output: 123. Initial idea: Separate digits Recognise them individually using a multilayer feed forward neural network My thoughts are that separating the digits could be tricky (if they overlap), and that perhaps there is a better approach using a recurrent or convolutional neural network?
