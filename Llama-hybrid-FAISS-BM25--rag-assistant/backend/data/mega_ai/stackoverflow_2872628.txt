Example non-trivial Java EE web service implementation?

My organization is considering switching from an in-house proprietary application server (and adhoc protocols) to a Java EE 5 / Java EE 6 framework + web services for new development, and we're trying to get our heads around how we'd do that. We're experiencing something of a culture shock; we're comfortable with emacs/vi, command-line tools, shell scripts and calling libraries; all the documentation we encounter seems to assume we're using Eclipse, IDE plugins, ant and/or maven and some huge framework which makes it hard to even understand what code is executing. I think an example would help enormously, so my question is: Is there a modern, non-trivial example Java EE application (or real-world open source application) out there that provides a WS-I style web service interface and ideally also demonstrates using a relational database? I've found various "hello world" applications and tutorials that create some sort of web service using a Java EE framework, but never anything more complicated than a temperature conversion service!
