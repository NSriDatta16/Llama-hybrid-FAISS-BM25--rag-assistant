Dimensionality reduction can be explained very easy: Consider you have a huge matrix, all countries are listed on the horizontal and all possible features on the vertical and for each feature and each country there is a flag set in the matrix. A lot of the features share similarities from the patterns in which they appear, so that those features can be combined into groups of features. What we are doing now is just a simple matrix factorization from our huge matrix at the beginning, into a small matrix of grouped features on the vertical and countries on the horizontal and another small matrix of all the original features on the one and all the grouped features on the other. This is all the magick, just a simple matrix factorization.
