Is there a best way to organize Javascript code?

I've been doing a small web application, adding behaviors and appending DOM objects in Javascript using jQuery. The problem is that the code is starting to grow really fast and I don't know where to store it (either in the same page it's being used, or in a big js file). At this point, I have: 1 js file with an object storing some synchronized information from a server, and with the most important methods (which should be used across the application). One of these methods include a DOM element generator (which then I add from within the desired web page). 1 js file with a big method which is called when window.ready that adds behaviors to a bunch of DOM object (only related to a webpage). Some tags filled with code in the pages that didn't use the second js file. This code is also webpage related. Now, you may be killing me with your eyes, and I know. This is definitely not a good (or at least not consistent) way to store Javascript. So, my question is: Is there a best way to organize Javascript code? I suppose that at least I should follow a rule, though the problem is that I'm not sure if it's best to have a js file for all the "global data and methods" and then store the other ones in smallers js files or , or simply give up and go for a tea. What do you guys think? Thanks in advance! PS: Obviously code reutilization is a good point. However, the scripts I will be reusing the most are saved in the first js file (the one with global stuff).
