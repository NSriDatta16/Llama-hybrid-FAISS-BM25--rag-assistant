If you have entities in the database, and corresponding files associated with those entities in the filesystem, there's nothing preventing them from getting out of sync (deleting an entity from the DB but not cleaning up the files, etc. It also means backing up the database must happen at the same time as backing up the filesystem. I used to feel that BLOBs in the database created fragmentation and can slow down reads when that data isn't needed, but you can get around that by putting the BLOB in a parallel table, so you only read it when it's needed.
