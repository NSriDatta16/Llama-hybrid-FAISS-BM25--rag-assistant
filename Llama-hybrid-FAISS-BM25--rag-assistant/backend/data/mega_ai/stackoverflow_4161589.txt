Personally, I would start with Robert C Martin's Agile book, and Eric Evan's book on Domain Driven Design. Those are theory books, but Uncle Bob's book specifically talks about revamping code to be manageable, just like your situation. It's pretty essential to layer your software so you can start to remove dependencies, which will make everything very simple and easy to maintain. I am a database guy, so I started with a good ORM like Entity Framework or Fluent NHibernate. I prefer websites, so I went with ASP.NET's MVC 2, then started writing all the parts of those books, namely a data Repository, Services to pull data and Control to push it. MVC is a very nice separation of data concerns and "View" concerns which are your screens. Before long, you would have very clean and easily maintained software.
