How to appropriately set weights for weighted KNN

I'm currently trying to predict a continuous variable using KNN. Instead of treating each neighbor equally I would like to use the weights to create a weighted average. The weights by themselves are not ideal, as the closer a neighbor the more I would like that neighbor to influence the final results. This lead me to consider the inverse of each of the distances, but this doesn't handle the case where an instance is the exact same -> with a distance of 0. Any recommendations on how to properly set the weights of each neighbor relative to their distance? Similar to how the inverse would handle this, but one that allows for 0 values.
