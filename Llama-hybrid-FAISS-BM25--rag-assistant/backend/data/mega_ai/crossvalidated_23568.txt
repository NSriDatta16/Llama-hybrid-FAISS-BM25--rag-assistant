Exactly, as you state in the question and as @tdc puts in his answer, in case of extremely high dimensions even if the geometric properties of PCA remain valid, the covariance matrix is no longer a good estimate of the real population covariance. There's a very interesting paper "Functional Principal Component Analysis of fMRI Data" ( pdf ) where they use functional PCA to visualize the variance: ...As in other explorative techniques, the objective is that of providing an initial assessment that will give the data a chance “to speak for themselves” before an appropriate model is chosen. [...] In the paper they explain how exactly they've done it, and also provide theoretical reasoning: The decisive advantage of this approach consists in the possibility of specifying a set of assumptions in the choice of the basis function set and in the error functional minimized by the fit. These assumptions will be weaker than the speciﬁcation of a predeﬁned hemodynamic function and a set of events or conditions as in F-masking, thus preserving the exploratory character of the procedure; however, the assumptions might remain stringent enough to overcome the difﬁculties of ordinary PCA.
