Online editor for word documents

Can anyone recommend a really good online wysiwyg editor? I'm looking for the following features: saving of document in a Word-compatible format (.doc, .docx, .rtf) accurate cut/paste from Word support of most Word features, including paragraph numbering customizable. I need to add my own special handling for changes Because the app will be used in a company intranet, it's not vital that it runs in all browsers.
