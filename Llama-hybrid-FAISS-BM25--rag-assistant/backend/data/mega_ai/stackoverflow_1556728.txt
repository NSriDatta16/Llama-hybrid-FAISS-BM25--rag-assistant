There is no single "fastest way" it depends on A) What the string actually is build of (length, character distribution, ...) B) On which hardware this runs C) If you want all results in parallel or sequential D) Other parameters (e.g. can found elements overlap, are you searching once or multiple times) E) If you see this implementation specific or just academic. In implementation there are lots of additional ways to optimize stuff. E.g. temporary storage (like in your suggestion) is often very expensive. The Idea you have e.g. would totally trash any CPU cache for long strings. So it would be VERY slow in those cases.
