How about Markov chain process? You could have for example two channels: add in the print and web banner where you have links to the product/service page in you companys web pages. In print it could be an QR code which is read through mobile phone. Now you know transition probabilities and perhaps even shares of potential customers who will accept you offer. You can then easily attribute some part of the revenue into channels. You can easily extend this setting into further channels if you have some knowledge about transitions between channels.
