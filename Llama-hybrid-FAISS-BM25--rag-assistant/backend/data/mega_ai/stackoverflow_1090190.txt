You would need to use the source code to build the component and then add it as you described. Per comment: I'm not able to repro your problem. If the project is in the same solution as the winform project, it should appear in the toolbox automatically and be draggable to the form. But, even when I use the Browse ... feature in the Choose Items dialog I am able to add the component and then drag it to the form without error. What is the error you see precisely?
