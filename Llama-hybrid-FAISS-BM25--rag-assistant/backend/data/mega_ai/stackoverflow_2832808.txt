How to detect if google chrome rss plugin is installed?

I'm working on a word press project. I noticed that rss is not working fine on google chrome. After I googled about it, it turned out that I need to install a plugin for google chrome so rss works. I want to know how to detect if the plugin is installed or not in case the user is using chrome browser. Currently I'm doing the following: function is_chrome() { return(eregi("chrome", $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'])); } if(is_chrome()) { // I want to check if plugin installed or not here. }
