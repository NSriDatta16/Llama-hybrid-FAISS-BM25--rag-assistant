In python images are processed as bit bitmaps using the colour depth of the graphic system. Converting a PNG image to a bitmap is really fast(20 x times) when compared to jpegs. Deepace - Currently accepting only 2 types of image input formats. PNG/Jpeg. there is no way you can use other formats images directly as you are using thier libraries. If you want to use another input formats so then atlast you need to convert either to PNG or Jpeg to give input to the functions. Which may costs you extra execution time while bringing other format images to PNG/Jpegs. If want to improve the face recognition and face detection with deepface library then use some preprocessing filters Some of the filters you can try for better results. utlimate guide Grayscale conversions Face straightening Face cropping (#Deepcae automatically do this while processing so no need to this) Image resizing Normalization Image enhancement with PIL like sharpening. image equalization.
