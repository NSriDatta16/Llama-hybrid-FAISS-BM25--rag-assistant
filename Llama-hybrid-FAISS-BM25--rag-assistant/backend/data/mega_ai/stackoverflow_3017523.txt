Sometimes RegEx is the only elegant solution. This should be what you're looking for. It will give you the names of every property in the code file, and nothing more: (?:"(?:(?:(?:\\.)|[^"\\\r\n])*)"|'(?:(?:(?:\\.)|[^'\\\r\n])*)'|@"(?:(?:(?:"")|[^"])*)")|(?:(?://.*)|(?:/\*(?:(?:[^*]|\*(?!/))*)\*/))|(?:[\w?<>]\s+(\w+)\s*\{\s*(?:get|set)\s*[{;]) It will not match similar code in comments or strings and needs only a small modification to return the property's type. The name appears in capture \1, but will be blank if not a true match.
