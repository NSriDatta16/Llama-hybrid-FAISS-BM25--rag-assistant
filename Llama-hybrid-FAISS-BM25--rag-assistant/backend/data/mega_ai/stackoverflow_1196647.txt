Custom slider UI Swing

I'm trying to create a custom extension of BasicSliderUI. I'm just trying to make the thumb a circle (note I'm in the Windows L&F). I've created a very simple implementation that just calls g.drawOval, but whenever I drag it, it leaves a "trail" behind. Any ideas why this is? thanks, Jeff
