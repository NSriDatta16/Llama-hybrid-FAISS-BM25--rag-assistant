What is a "safety variable"?

I was just reading an article about different ranking algorithms . One thing I'm a bit confused about is stumbleupon's algoritm: (Initial stumbler audience / # domain) + ((% stumbler audience / # domain) + organic bonus – nonfriend) – (% stumbler audience + organic bonus) + N N is a "safety variable" so that the assumed algorithm is flexible. It represents a random number. Could someone explain the purpose of N to me? I don't understand how it's making the algorithm more flexible.
