Isn’t this what placebos are for? Use interest in participation as a screening factor for all randomization units, however, administer a placebo in the control group. Robert’s answer initially agrees with you (ITT not reliable) but then captures a lot of scholarly skepticism on the alternative, mITT. Interest/consent in the treatment might be correlated with the treatment effect, itself, so tread cautiously. By removing observations where units do not consent to the treatment, you could overestimate the effectiveness of treatment. For example, suppose radiation is used for cancer patients, but some patients with terminal illness opt out of radiation in favor of hospice, instead. They do not consent but note that consent is corrrlated with treatment efficacy. When consent is not present, the efficacy of radiation could be much lower. But by excluding lack of consent, you overestimate effect of radiation. In this context, I’d prefer a multilevel model where the global coefficient for treatment effect is a function of two subgroup group coefficients, namely with-consent and without-consent (censored, imputed as zero.) In this case, you could both differentiate the consent from non-consent contexts but also be aware of correlation between consent and treatment effect.
