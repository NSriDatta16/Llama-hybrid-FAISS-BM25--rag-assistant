Combining features to improve F1 score in random forest

In a project we have to use random forests to classify data into 5 sets. The data set is large (300k data elements and 9 features) and the result is based of F1 score rather than mean square error. A suggested method is to use new features apart from the given 9 features. Can some one please suggest why would taking combinations of features like X1+X2*X3^2 where Xi is a feature improve the accuracy? I am skeptical since all the trees in random forest are already grown to full depth.
