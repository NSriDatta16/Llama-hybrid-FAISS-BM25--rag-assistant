We just updated NCover to handle multiple coverage runs under NCover.Console much more efficiently. Assuming you are running the same application each time I would make sure that you're updated to NCover 3.4.12 and run NCover.Console with the //coverall option on the script that you're using to spawn your application rather than NCover each time you start your app. That will generate one merged XML file that should handle things for you. Feel free to drop an email to support@ncover.com and we can help you out with it, if needed. Be sure to mention this url.
