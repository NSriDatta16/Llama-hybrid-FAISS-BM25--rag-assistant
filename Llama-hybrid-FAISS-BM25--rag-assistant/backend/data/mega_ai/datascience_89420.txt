Does sigmoid facilitate modeling non-linear decision boundaries or does this come from high-dimensional data?

I'm writing up a neural network using sigmoid as the activation function. According to one lecture, sigmoid simply squashes numbers onto the (0,1) interval. To model non-linear decision boundaries, you need high dimensional data. Another lecture, this one on sigmoid in neural nets context (MIT S.191), suggested sigmoid's non-linear behaviour is the reason why a neural net can model a non-linear decision boundary. So, I'm a bit confused. Does sigmoid facilitate modeling non-linear decision boundaries or does this come from high-dimensional data because you can use the sigmoid to produce a linear decision boundary w/o incident?
