This is to some extent a string-lenght question, but here are my random thoughts: Just because a piece of software is commercial and backed-up by a support organization, it isn't hassle-free to install and set up. Compare the licensing cost with the time needed to set up (and maintain) an open-source solution. Will the open-alternative be functional in a day, week or month? The problem with scope creep is really a management problem. If you aren't really sure what you need, trying out an open alternative first is a great way of building experience in what functionality is essential to your organization.
