I'm not objective about this, but the argument for YUI 3 is that it's concise, efficient, and scalable -- and with 200 modules now in the YUI 3 Gallery, it's got a community making it better every day. My take on why YUI 3 is the best choice, now about a year old, is here: http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/theater/video.php?v=miraglia-yuiconf2009-yui3 Since that time, the team has continued to build on the fundamentals discussed there...and YUI 3, for me, is as fun and productive as JavaScript development has ever been. -Eric
