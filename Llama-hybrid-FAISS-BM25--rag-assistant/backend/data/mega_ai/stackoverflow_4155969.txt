Separate the problem into two parts: Match the double-digit number. Fuzzily match the residue against 'New York'. In the example, you know that 'New York' consists of 2 words; you might be able to leverage that to eliminate alternatives like 'Detroit' (but not necessarily 'San Francisco') more easily. You might even be able to use ' String::Approx ' after all, though it mentions: ... the Text::Levenshtein and Text::LevenshteinXS modules in CPAN. See also Text::WagnerFischer and Text::PhraseDistance. (My Perl was unable to find Text::PhraseDistance via CPAN - the others are available and install OK.)
