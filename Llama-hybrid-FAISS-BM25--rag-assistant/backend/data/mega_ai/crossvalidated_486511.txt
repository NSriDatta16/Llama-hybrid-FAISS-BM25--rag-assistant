How to perform post-hoc with logistic regression in SPSS? (Two dichotomous IVs)

I performed a logistic regression in SPSS using two IVs (both dichotomous) and found a significant interaction effect. Now I want to understand where the differences come from. ⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀ V1_a⠀⠀⠀⠀V1_b V2_a⠀⠀group A⠀⠀group B V2_b⠀⠀group C⠀⠀group D In this case, how can I compare group A with group B? Is there any Syntax code?
