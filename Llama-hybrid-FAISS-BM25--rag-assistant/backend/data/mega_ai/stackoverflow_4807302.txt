Is there an easier way to replace files in XCode?

Whenever I need to replace a file in my projects, I always have to select the ones I want to replace in the project, delete them, then drag the new files into the project. This becomes a real pain when I'm changing out many resources, for example, if I'm replacing all the art in the project or changing out plists of data. I've looked in the preferences but could not find any sort of "Prompt to replace" or similar.
