This behavior in Magento is intentional, as you may not want to let a customer order a PC without a CPU or memory. In your case, this assumption appears not to be the case, but that remains the method for using bundled products. There are a few options open to you to avoid this situation. Firstly, you could use some product type other than bundle, and actually add simple products to your cart rather than the bundled ones. This would allow customers to add options at will, but would not preserve any promotional pricing on the products, as Magento checks those prices/discounts on every page load, and would kick out any changes you set manually. The other option would be to allow customers an easier path to changing the bundle product that they have chosen. When rendering the bundle product, you could render a little X button (or whatever you find appropriate), which would lead to an action you specify, whose job it is to change the bundle options, resave the cart item, and redirect the user back to the cart. This is probably the cleanest solution to the problem. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
