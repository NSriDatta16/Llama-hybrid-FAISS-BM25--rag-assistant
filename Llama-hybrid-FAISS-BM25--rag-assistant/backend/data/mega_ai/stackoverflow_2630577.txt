Entity Framework Multiple associations to a table causes error 3033

I'm using EF 3.5 SP1. I have 3 tables: Pendants PendantAccessories PartsData Basically #1 and 2 are used for product selection, so #1 has a "Number of Buttons" property and other options. #2 has fields like "Cable Type" etc. The third table contains property information for all of our parts, such as what plant it's manufactured in, it's weight etc. What I'm trying to do is set up an association between #1 and #3 and also between #2 and #3. The PK in all 3 tables is the PartNumber. I set it up between #2 and 3 by going into Mapping Details and adding a Maps to PartsData and mapping the columns. Everything worked good. I then tried the same thing between #1 and 3. However, now when I compile I get "Error 3033: Problem in Mapping Fragment starting at line 713: EntitySets 'pendants' and 'pendantAccessories' are both mapped to the table 'PartsData'. Their Primary Keys may collide." Does anyone know what I'm doing wrong here?
