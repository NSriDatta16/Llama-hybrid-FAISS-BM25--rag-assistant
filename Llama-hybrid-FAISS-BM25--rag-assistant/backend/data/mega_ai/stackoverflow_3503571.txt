Just found out what was wrong by following PatrickS logic. What I had done was create a Movieclip which had some inventory slot graphics and link it with the Inventory class. I had then dragged an instance of the MovieClip onto the stage. What Flash did then was probably to use the default constructor instead of "Inventory.getInstance();" to create that instance. Creating the inventory with mainInventory:MovieClip = Inventory.getInstance(); addChild(mainInventory); in Main() does the job of fixing this. One has to be careful I guess when doing gymnastics in code and then using the drag and drop Flash timeline.
