If you are talking about $|\bar{x}-\mu|$ then LiorKogan is right, there's no guarantee that the error is bounded. Now, to compute this confidence interval, you need to find the $x$ such that $P(X>x)>\eta$, where $\eta$ is some bound in the probability that you define. To compute it, you would need to know the distribution of $x$, which usually you don't know, but if you say that the mean of your random variable IS defined, then you can be sure by the generalized CLT that the mean follows a Levy Stable Distribution: if you can infere the exponent, you get an estimate for what you want. If the variance is defined, then you get the usual Gaussian case (case $\alpha=2$ of the Levy Stable). The classic example of this problem is in the context of election polls: "How many people do I have to ask to get a confidence interval lower than 1%?".
