Ad hoc and for very short term forecasting, yes, you can do that. IIRC, you lose some desirable statistical properties, but you would need to consult a textbook on mathematical time series modeling to learn more, or hope for a real time series modeler to come along - I'm just a forecaster, and as such would happily do this. (After all, "yesterday's weather" is often very hard to beat as a forecast.) Long-range forecasts would be problematical, because you would need to include much longer lags to capture the seasonality. Because of the length of the seasonal cycle (365), you would presumably need to include multiple such long lags, and suddenly your model is very large. SARIMA does not work well with daily data and yearly seasonality, at least when you do automatic modeling (e.g., the forecast and fable packages in R), which runs for a long time to determine the model. It may be better to look at BATS/TBATS models, which model seasonality using Fourier terms.
