FLVPlayback component in Flash 8 (AS2) and support for HD H.264 video

I have developed a video player using Flash 8 Professional and the FLVPlayback component. Recently I have been testing a few 720p .mov files converted to FLV by FFMPEG running on an encoding server. I am noticing that these files do not play back in my video player. It appears that they do not have any audio attached to them but when I play them in Adobe Media Player the audio is there. Is this due to the FLVPlayback component in Flash 8 not supporting HD videos? When I test locally the video picture plays with no sound but when I run in a browser the video freezes and does not play. The progress bar appears to move as if the video is playing however. So I want to try and recreate my work as a Flash CS4 project, still publish as AS2 but hopefully be able to use the updated FLVPlayback component in CS4 that can support h264 video. Will this work? ------------------------------------ UPDATE --------------------------------------------- I noticed that the video would not play until it had completely loaded, this was true in Adobe Media Player and Flash Player. It seems that progressive downloading is not working for my video, Flash Player requires that the whole video loads before it will begin playing. I found the following information on this - Another SO question on this topic Scott Morgan post about Progressive H264 video Here is the metadata attached to my FLV video - Your Flash Version = WIN 10,0,45,2 filesize = 1936004 audiocodecid = 10 stereo = false audiosamplesize = 16 audiosamplerate = 44100 audiodatarate = 93.75 videocodecid = 2 (This is Sorenson h263) framerate = 24 videodatarate = 683.59375 height = 240 width = 320
