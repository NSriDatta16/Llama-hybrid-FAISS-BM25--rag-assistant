Could you provide further information? For example: - when you are referring to "that" store and the "other" store, are you talking about two store views in the same installation or about two different installations? - Is it possible that an extension is removing the links in "that" store? - Is it possible that you are using different languages for the two stores? Both links belong to the customer module. Maybe there is a difference in the customer settings or (whyever this would be) the Magento customer module is deactivated? The page source or a URL would be helpful.
