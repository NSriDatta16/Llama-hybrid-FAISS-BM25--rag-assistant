Problems with time series prediction

I got a question about modeling time series in R. my data consist of the following matrix: 1 0.03333333 0.01111111 0.9555556 2 0.03810624 0.02309469 0.9387991 3 0.00000000 0.03846154 0.9615385 4 0.03776683 0.03119869 0.9310345 5 0.06606607 0.01201201 0.9219219 6 0.03900325 0.02058505 0.9404117 7 0.03125000 0.01562500 0.9531250 8 0.00000000 0.00000000 1.0000000 9 0.04927885 0.01802885 0.9326923 10 0.06106870 0.02290076 0.9160305 11 0.03846154 0.00000000 0.9615385 12 0.00000000 0.00000000 1.0000000 13 0.06028636 0.03843256 0.9012811 14 0.09646302 0.05144695 0.8520900 15 0.04444444 0.06666667 0.8888889 these matrix has in total 200 rows. as you can see in each situation the sum of each row is 1, that becomes because the values are the percentage of a whole. for example row 1 contains 3.33% of variable a, 1.11% of variable 2 and 95.5% of veriable 3. the first collomn indicates the year that the values are measured. my target is to make a prediction for the next 5 years, so from year 200 to 205. I can doe that by making three normal time series forecast. But for that forecast the total sum is never equal to 1, which is very important. Normaly is use techniques like arima and exponential smoothing. Does somebody know a method to make a forecast for such a problem?
