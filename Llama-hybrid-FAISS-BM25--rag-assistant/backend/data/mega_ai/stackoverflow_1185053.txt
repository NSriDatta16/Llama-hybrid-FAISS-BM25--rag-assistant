I can't say from only this. And that code is barely readable indentation is worse than just non-existant and the way you are embedding your post variables in your query doesn't make it any clearer either (and it might actually cause a security vulnerability). Try writing echo $sql; after your $sql = ... monster. You will be able to see if two queries are executed or if it is just one query that inserts two rows, and in the last case it will probably give you quite a hint why it did that. If it does not help you, post your results of that there, and I or someone else here can have a look at it. But note that it will not be easy or pleasant for us with such ungraceful code.
