Creating adversarial sample against logistic regreession

I performed a binary classification using logistic regression. My goal is the following: I know the coefficient w of the hyperplane equation $y = wTx + b$ . What I would like to do is create opposing instances by disrupting my points so that they come out just behind my hyperplane. That is to say ensure that the points classified as 0 go to 1 and those classified as 1 go to 0. I would like to find the minimal perturbation allowing to do this, that is to say, the perturbation which orthogonally projects the points a little further than the hyperplane.
