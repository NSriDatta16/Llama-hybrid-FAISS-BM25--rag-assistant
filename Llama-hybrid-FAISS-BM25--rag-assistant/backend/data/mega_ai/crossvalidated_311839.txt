Any monotonic transformation will not change the output of a tree-based algorithm such as random forest. That's because trees choose their splits based on how a feature orders observations, not on is absolute value. If you apply a non-monotonic transformation (like inverse U-shaped one that you described), output of a tree can change. But if the tree is large enough (and Random Forest can be safely built even with very large trees), it is fully capable of capturing such a U-shaped dependency by itself. So your intervention will probably not help much. The real change you can do is to engineer some features based on more than one input (e.g. their ratios or linear combinations). Trees look on one feature at a time, so if you combine multiple features into one wisely, it can make the difference.
