How to extract skills from job description using neural network

I am doing a project where I have to extract skills from Job Description. I have attempted by cleaning data(not removing stopwords), applying POS tag, labelling sentences as skill/not_skill, trained data using LSTM network. But while predicting it will predict if a sentence has skill/not_skill. Glimpse of how the data is description skill/not_skill Datacience and machine_learning skill not information extracted not_skill learn skill Python skill I have read articles and research papers but I am not sure how to proceed after this. How do I extract skills. This method I am following is from this research paper (using Supervised approach) . https://confusedcoders.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Job-Skills-extraction-with-LSTM-and-Word-Embeddings-Nikita-Sharma.pdf
