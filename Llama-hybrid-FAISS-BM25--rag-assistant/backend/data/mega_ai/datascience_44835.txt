If you are looking for current trends, you would choose Hadoop without question. The issue with items like SAP, SAS (or other massive enterprise packages like that) is that they are all 4th generation programming languages with a lot of overhead and the corresponding licensing fees. I would be concerned that more & more enterprises will find themselves moving towards Hadoop and away from the enterprise packages. I see those packages edging more and more towards the trend of serving as a "data lake" whereas Hadoop will be more of an active, day-to-day environment relied on for data science (and that's a good thing!).
