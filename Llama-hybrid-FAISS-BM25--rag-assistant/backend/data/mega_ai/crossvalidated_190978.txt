numerical attributes with random forest

I am working on a problem of COPD exacerbation likelihood prediction, I have a total 62 attributes out of which 38 variables/attributes are of numeric/continuous type and remaining are either binary or ternary. I want to apply random forest to it but I am a beginner in ML and so far I have observed that in my data several of continuous variables are heavily correlated. I want to know if I can use this facts to boost up accuracy of random forest. I am using R for my computation and below attached is the corrplot of continuous variables.
