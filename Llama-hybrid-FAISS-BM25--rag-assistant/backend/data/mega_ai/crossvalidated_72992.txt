Binary Logistic Regression Multicollinearity Tests

I like Peter Flom's answer to an earlier question about multicollinearity in logistic regression, but David Garson's Logistic Binomial Regression states that there is no valid test for multicollinearity for binary-dependent logistic regression, even if the independent variables are ratio scale. Can anyone supply one or more references? My own experience is that OLS correlation matrices and VIF worked for me, as my logistic coefficients went haywire before removing entangled independent variables based on the OLS tests for multicollinearity. But I have to publish my results and methods, and would like a reputable way to cite the practice, if one or more exist.
