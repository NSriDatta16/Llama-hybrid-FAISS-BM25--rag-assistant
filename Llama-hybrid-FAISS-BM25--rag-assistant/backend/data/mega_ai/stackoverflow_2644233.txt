If you really need to do something like that you can override the toString() method in your class and create a static method (or create a converter class) that returns a Hello object from it's toString(). Something like this: class Hello() { public String h1; public String h2; public String toString() { return "h1:" + h1 +", h2:" + h2; } public static Hello fromString(String input) { Hello hello = new Hello(); hello.h1 = // Some logic to extract h1 from input hello.h2 = // Some logic to extract h2 from input return hello; } } That way you should be able to: Hello hello = new Hello(); String helloString = hello.toString(); Hello newHello = Hello.fromString(helloString); I encourage you to check Serialization (as many others had) or find what's your real problem and the best way to solve it.
