It all depends on the sample size. For large samples, the Bernstein von Mises theorem tells you that both approaches will be very close. For small or moderate samples, the frequentist and Bayesian approaches may differ in some cases. This is usually referred to as the "Prior-Data conflict". This is a well-known and widely studied phenomenon. For some specific examples, please take a look at: http://projecteuclid.org/download/pdf_1/euclid.ba/1340370946 This phenomenon is common on shape parameters with "highly informative" priors.
