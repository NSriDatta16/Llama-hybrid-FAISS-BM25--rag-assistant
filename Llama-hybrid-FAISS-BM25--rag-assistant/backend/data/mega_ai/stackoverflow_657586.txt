What is a good filesystem for embedded NAND drives?

I am working on an embedded application that uses NAND flash for storage. As it looks now, we won't use Linux or any other RTOS. The application must handle unexpected power downs. We have been looking on different file system solutions, including YAFFS2, JFFS2, FAT+FTL as well as solutions from HCC Embedded . I have heard FAT+FTL is a normal choice, but I am worried about data loss in case of unexpected power downs as well as performance. Would be grateful if anyone could share insights and experience about this
