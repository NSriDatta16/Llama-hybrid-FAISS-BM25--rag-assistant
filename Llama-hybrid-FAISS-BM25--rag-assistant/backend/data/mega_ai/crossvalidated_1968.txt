I haven't had the problem you're talking about for a while but I used to. It might be that when you're selecting the output that you want you release your mouse drag somewhere off of the output (ie you're selecting a large region and you start at the bottom right and drag to the upper left and let go of the mouse somewhere in the explorer area). I know when I did that it wouldn't go through with the copy. I needed to release the drag inside of the output window to allow a copy to go through. Like I said the version I'm using now doesn't have this problem so I can't actually test this but I believe that's how I fixed that problem before.
