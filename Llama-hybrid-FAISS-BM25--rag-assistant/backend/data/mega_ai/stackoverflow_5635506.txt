A Temporary Table will not last beyond the DB session that created it. A Global Temporary Table can be shared across DB sessions but based on your scenario it might not be predictable when the sessions start and end so that might not give predictable results. I would suggest creating a real table to hold the results and just query that. When the queries are done just DELETE all of the data. If it is possible to have multiple connections using different result sets (hence a Temp Table would have been great), then you can add a UNIQUEIDENTIFIER field as the "key" for which set of data to use for this set of queries. Meaning, generate the GUID on the app side, and pass that into the query that populates the real table so that each of the queries against it can use that app-generated value as an additional WHERE clause. When all of the queries against that "temporary" result set are done, do a DELETE based on that GUID. If for some reason the queries against a particular result set are disconnected and you don't know when the last one executes, add a DATETIME field to the result set and create a SQL Agent Job to DELETE records older than 30 or 60 minutes or whatever. Edit: Also, to be clear, IF all of the queries are really being done by a single connection then you might be able to still use a Temp Table if you enable MARS (Multiple Active Result Sets) as I think MARS keeps a consistent session, but I am not sure as I have never used it.
