Angle brackets may not be your only challenge. Other characters can also be potentially harmful script injection. Such as the common double hyphen "--", which can also used in SQL injection. And there are others. On an ASP.Net page, if validateRequest = true in machine.config, web.config or the page directive, the user will get an error page stating "A potentially dangerous Request.Form value was detected from the client" if an HTML tag or various other potential script-injection attacks are detected. You probably want to avoid this and provide a more elegant, less-scary UI experience. You could test for both the opening and closing tags <> using a regular expression, and allow the text if only one of them occcurs. Allow , but not , in that order. You could allow angle brackets and HtmlEncode the text to preserve them when the data is persisted.
