How to remove the layout from a JPanel using NetBeans?

I'm using a MainWindow (JFrame) with a JPanel using a simple CardLayout, the CardLayout is filled with some JPanels. It's working fine if I drag & drop JPanels from the palette to the CardLayout and then place the contents in the panels. However, I want to place the different JPanels in separated files so I've created some JPanel Forms with NetBeans. The only problem I have now, when I put my derived JPanel class onto the CardLayout (e.g. using the "Choose Bean" function from NetBeans) NetBeans always sets a new layout for the panel, so my original layout from the JPanel class gets overridden and all I get is a blank JPanel. So does anyone know if there is a way to simply remove the layout from my JPanel classes? I mean I cannot set the Layout to "None" or something with NetBeans, if I set it to "Null Layout" it still invokes "jPanel.setLayout(null);" off course, but I just want no call to setLayout at all, isn't that possible somehow? And sorry if I'm just to stupid to find the solution here. I'm quite new to NetBeans, but there must be a way to manually change the code, I can't just use the "Customize Code" option because it says "// Code of sub-components and layout - not shown here"... I hope anyone understands what my problem is here. :)
