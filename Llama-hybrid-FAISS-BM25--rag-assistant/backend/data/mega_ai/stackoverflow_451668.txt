Highly recommend this paper by Andrei Alexandrescu and Petru Marginean, which presents ScopeGuard patten. This is an elegant and a very robust solution for managing transactions specifically in presence of exceptions. Applicable to the problem that you are trying to solve ScopeGuard will allow you to define the scope of your transaction, and easily (meaning automatically) manage that for you whether transaction involves methods A,B,C,D or calling individual methods.
