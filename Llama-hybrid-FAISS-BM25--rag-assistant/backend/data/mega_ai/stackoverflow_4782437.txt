The choices of Property vs getter method and lazy loading vs full object graph are orthogonal, you can pretty much have any combination of them. I'd probably choose a Property here since it's more idiomatic to C#. As for deferring the object retrieval, it depends on your context - like anon wrote, when drawing from database data lazy loading can be appreciable.
