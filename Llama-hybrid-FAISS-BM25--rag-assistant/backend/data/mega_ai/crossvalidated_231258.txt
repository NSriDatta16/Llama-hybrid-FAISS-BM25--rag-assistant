Logistic Regression in R with multi level categorical variable

After using weight of evidence & Information value mechanism, of the 40 odd variables I am left with 8 variables which are highly or moderately significant. One of the independent variable which is categorical has 60+ categories. This is a very highly predictable variable hence please suggest as to how should I use this variable in the model. When I add this variable in the model my null deviance and AIC decreases and makes other predictors loose their predictive power. Then another model without this variable my null deviance and AIC improves. What could be the reason. Is this variable collinear with some other predictor. Please see the syntax: m1.logit Also ran an anova test to analyze the table of deviance anova(m1.logit, test="Chisq") Analysis of Deviance Table Model: binomial, link: logit Response: survey Terms added sequentially (first to last) Df Deviance Resid. Df Resid. Dev Pr(>Chi) NULL 2540 2554 region 5 13 2535 2540 0.022 * know 1 507 2534 2033 Please suggest as to how to deal with this predictor variable with 50+ categories
