Alright, it's working now. Here's what's going on: I removed the extra comma as per Matthew Crumley's suggestion (+1). Per Anurag, I checked Chrome's developer tool (I completely forgot about that - working late = bad.) It didn't show any errors. Then I redownloaded the SlimBox files and tried the demo, which didn't work. Then I noticed that SlimBox had two folders with its SlimBox JS files: js and src. js is the correct folder with the correct library, src doesn't work for whatever reason. I changed the website to use the file from the js folder and it's now working. Bottom line: No script conflict after all, SlimBox was just distributed in a weird way. Thank you everybody for your help!
