System.TimeSpan creating debugging problems? (Cannot evaluate expression because a thread is stopped at a point...)

Using System.TimeSpan in a C# application, with WPF. TimeSpan is an argument in a method call. SixDOFPosition GetPositionForTimeCount(TimeSpan timeCount) Using VS 2009, this error is displayed in the debugger when trying to look at the value of timeCount: Cannot evaluate expression because a thread is stopped at a point where garbage collection is impossible The problem is that as soon as this error appears, objects' properties values cannot be debugged (not limited to TimeSpan instances), the same message is displayed. MS reports large structures cannot be debugged safely and the debugger display this msg. Any workaround more elegant than wrapping the structure in a class? I'm using VS Express 2008, the Debug settings are selected automatically when F5 is pressed, I don't have many options to select.
