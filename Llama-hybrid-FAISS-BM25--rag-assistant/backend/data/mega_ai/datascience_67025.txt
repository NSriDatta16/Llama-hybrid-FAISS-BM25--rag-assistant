Can sampling like SMOTE/UP/DOWN applied on Validation set?

I am trying to predict classification problem. For that I have used Ranger, Xgboost and naive bayes. My Response class is imbalance . 92:8 ratio. My positive Response is only 8% of whole data. Because of class imbalance I am getting more FP / FN. I tried different sampling on training set and predicted with original set gives me more FP. Can I do something like ?: - split data into train and test - apply sampling method individually on train and test - and use sampled test to predict. Thanks.
