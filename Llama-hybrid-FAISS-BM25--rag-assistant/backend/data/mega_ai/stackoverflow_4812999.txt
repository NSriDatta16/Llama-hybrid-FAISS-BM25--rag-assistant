You can use one view controller to present another view controller modally on top of it. [currentViewController presentModalViewController:viewControllerToPresentInModalWindow animated:YES]; By default, the modal view controller will be full-screen, but you can change the size to one of two other presets. [viewControllerToPresentInModalWindow setModalPresentationStyle:UIModalPresentationPageSheet]; [viewControllerToPresentInModalWindow setModalPresentationStyle:UIModalPresentationFormSheet]; Additionally, you can set the transition used to display the modal window on screen by using setModalTransitionStyle: . The screenshot posted above is not using any of these presets; as the other commenters mentioned, it is a custom modal window that doesn't leverage UIKit's built-in modal functionality.
