I have some experience with finding correlations between EMG signals and human kinematics. When doing that it is crucial to full wave rectify the signal, which means nothing more than to take the absolute value. The reason for this is that EMG signals are potentials, so the integral will be zero. If you then sum them up, they will be roughly zero. This might result in some models to not be able to learn anything if they cannot mimic taking the absolute value. (I am rather handwavy in the last paragraph, but I know for sure that rectifying improved performance from basically failing to something usable in my case.)
