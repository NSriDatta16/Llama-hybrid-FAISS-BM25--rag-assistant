Architecture to develop an application in java that could be used with desktop and web interface too

I'm developing a java application or service for execute remote commands or another applications and receive the results of these commands. And I think about to project this application to be possible his use with a swing interface or a web interface. I have to take care with the parameters to pass for my businnes classes and how I will deal with the results. I need to use a architecture and project that let me able to use my classes with a desktop application or web application too. I believe this is related with API and service design. Some popular applications have a web interface or dashboard for control services, and the services are manageable by agents installed for execute some demons, services or applications. To do start or stop commands for database systems, directory services an other tasks There are some guides to how develop applications and services in java that can I use with web and desktop environments? I felling a bite confusing about this, because in my mind if I choose to develop this with a swing approach all the thinks turn clear for me. But when I imagining the same project using the web perspective I lose my directives. Sorry and Ihope that someone could undertand me. :-P
