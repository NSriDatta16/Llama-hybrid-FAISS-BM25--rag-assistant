GLMM mixed models. Binary data with only one positive outcome possible

I am studying letality in cardio-vascular events. My outcome is binary (death at 1 month) for each event. My patients can have multiple cardiovascular events but obvioulsy only one of them can lead to death. So for exemple a patient can have ten cardiovascular event the last one leading to death. I have explaining variables at event, patient and county levels. Therefore I used a mixed model logistic regression. However I wonder if the fact that among my repeated events only one can lead to death (you obviously can only die once) is an issue.
