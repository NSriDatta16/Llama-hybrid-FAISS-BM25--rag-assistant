scala ArrayBuffer remove all elements with a predicat

Scala is very elegant in filtering immutable sequences: var l = List(1,2,3,4,5,6) l = l.filter(_%2==1) But how do I do this with a mutable collections like ArrayBuffer? All I found is the removal of single elements or slices, or remove elements from another sequence, but nothing that removes elements given by a predicate. Edit: I was hoping to find something similar tho this: trait Removable[A] extends Buffer[A]{ def removeIf(p: A => Boolean){ var it1 = 0 var it2 = 0 while(it2 this filters in linear time and can be mixed into any Buffer, but only ArrayBuffer makes sense, on ListBuffers it would be slow, because indexing does take linear time.
