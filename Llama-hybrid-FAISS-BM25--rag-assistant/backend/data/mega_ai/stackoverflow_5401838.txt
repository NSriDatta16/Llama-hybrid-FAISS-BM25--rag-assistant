This is how I would approach the problem.... If this fails, you may want to just organize your file with a return after each piece of data. Your life will be infinitely easier and your data will be in the array anyway. If you really have your heart set on using char arrays you could just change the string to a char array. void parseModel(void) { //will read in heading data first, then parse model data //you could alternatively store your header data in a struct //or class for better organization //work with strings, not raw char arrays string data; int num_vertices; int num_faces; //open the stream ifstream ifs("rect-skinny.d"); if(!ifs.is_open()) { cout > data; ifs >> num_vertices; ifs >> num_faces; //array of vertex data float vertices[num_vertices]; //array of faces data int faces[num_faces]; //loop through all the vertices, reading each into the array for(int i = 0; i > vertices[i]; } //do the same for the faces for(int n = 0; n > faces[n]; } //closing the stream ifs.close(); }
