While you may get reasonable performance on dataset like MNIST which consists of small greyscale image, treating image as a vector will not lead to good performance: -reasonably sized image may be of size 224x224x3 pixels = 150.528 features. Most methods (logistic regression, SVM, fully connected neural network) will probably overfit / fails to learn a good generalization. -the main problem is that by treading the image as a vector, you are throving out the information of spatial distance between pixels. Useful features in image are usually local, depending on pixels in small area. The CNNs perform so well because they exploit this prior information.
