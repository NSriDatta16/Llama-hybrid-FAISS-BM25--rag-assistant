RBF versus standard classical analysis for empirical power functions

Sorry if the previous post caused any inconvenience to you. I am a newbie in Radial Basis Functions (RBF) and this is the first time I post a question. I have 80 pairs of Y=body weight and X= body length of a species. Usually, the relationship between these variables is modeled as Y=a*X^b and classical or Bayesian statistics are applied to derive empirical values for a and b (and their associated errors). My question is: Can I use an RBF approach to derive a and b values for Y=aX^b ? To my understanding only predicted Y values may be derived from RBF. Please bear with me if this is a na√Øve question.
