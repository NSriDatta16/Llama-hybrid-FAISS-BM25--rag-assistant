If you go with camera you may have to do some simple image processing. Easiest way would probably be adaptive thresholding - take all pixels from camera frame, convert to grayscale (if it's in color), calculate average and use it as threshold - you will have white line on black background. If you still getting small white spots (due to uneven lighting) you can filter them out by separating picture into connected components (with floodfill) and removing small blobs. After that you hopefully would get single white stripe on the black background.
