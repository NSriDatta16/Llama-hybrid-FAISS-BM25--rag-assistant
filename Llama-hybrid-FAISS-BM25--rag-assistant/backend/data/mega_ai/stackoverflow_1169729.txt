Yes you could make the copy recursive, but that still leaves you with problems, how to copy internal private fields. You would have to expose all fields as properties and in my opinion that is not clean and is cumbersome. I would definitely serialize the object. SOAP has so much overhead on its own that serialization is super fast in comparison. I would even argue that a simple HTTP approach using REST would be better. You can look at my SimpleStorage framework that was made with such tasks (serialization) in mind. Especially look at adapters feature. You can get it at: http://www.cromis.net/blog/downloads/ There are also articles there that show how to use it. If you are already using other XML library and don't want to switch I would still prefer the serialization approach if I were you. I doubt that you can make a http request last under 30ms. Serialization would take way less than that. Now add the SOAP overhead and you are super fast compared to it :)
