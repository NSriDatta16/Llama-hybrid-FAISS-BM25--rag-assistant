Comparing before and after survey using Likert Scale

We are trying to measure if there is a difference on the level of interests of participants before and after I let them play a game. The survey is in the form of Likert Scale where 1 - Not at all Interested, 2 - Not Very Interested, 3- Neutral, 4 - Somewhat Interested, 5 - Very Interested . There are 50 participants of this study. We are looking to use a parametric test in this group called paired t-test. Where we get the mean of each participant from (before the game) then we get again the average weighted mean (after the game) in order to find if there is a difference on their level of interest using paired t-test. Is it appropriate to use this parametric test in our study?
