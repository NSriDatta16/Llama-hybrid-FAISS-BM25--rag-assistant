On Windows, the drag and drop operation are still handled by this good old OLE. OLE Always sees the source and the target of the operation as two different applications even when the two are the same application (your case). OLE always swallows every exception and no not forward them to any of the two application. For him, it does not make sens to alert the source application that the target application failed during the drop. go figure ;-) You absolutly have to handle exception yourself in the handlers involved in any OLE operation (i.e. Drag & Drop)
