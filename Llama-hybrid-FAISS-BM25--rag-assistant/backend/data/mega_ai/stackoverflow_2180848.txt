You should be OK with default isolation level for inserts. Do you have clustered index? If so, ensure that it doesn't fragment as you insert new rows. Typically guid would be a bad candidate for clustered index. Also if you have Enterprise edition and you are able to identify partitions in your table you might to partition the table using this column (for example region or city) and store partitions of the table on different filegroups. This way you might avoid IO contention. If you select all data once a day and you would like to maintain inserts speed during the select without too much locking, you might consider creating database snapshot (again Enterprise Edition) and select from it. If you can live with dirty reads you might add with(nolock) hint to your select.
