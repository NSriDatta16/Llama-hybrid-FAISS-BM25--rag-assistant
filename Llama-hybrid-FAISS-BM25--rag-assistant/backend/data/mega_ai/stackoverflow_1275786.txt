I'm not sure why line breaks would be a problem, unless by that you mean not literal line breaks (i.e. &#10; characters), but some kind of paragraph element similar to in HTML. If it's the latter, than that might explain things, since your XPath expression does not return the text content of the element. It returns all text nodes that are immediate children of the element. If you just need the plain text content (i.e. all descendant text nodes, no matter how deep), remove /text() at the end of your XPath. I do not understand what is the point of disable-output-escaping in your example at all. Please clarify why you think it's needed there.
