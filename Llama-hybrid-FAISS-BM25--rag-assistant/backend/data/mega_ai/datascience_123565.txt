Data Cleanup for Regression

I have a simple dataset of 1 output and 1 input and want to fit a linear regression to the dataset. The data has a certain level of noise to it (potentially driven by another input, which I will analyse at a later point). For a given input I have multiple output values associated to it: say the input is 20%, there will be associated outputs of 200, 199, 203, 202, 198 and so on. Obviously, I will deduplicate my data, but how do I treat this (what I think is) noise. Do I average for every output, before fitting the regression, do I just leave the noise as is or do I do something entirely else? The screenshot below illustrates what I am talking about: how do I treat the vertical lines? The scatter around it are most likely outliers, due to the nature of the process that is measured.
