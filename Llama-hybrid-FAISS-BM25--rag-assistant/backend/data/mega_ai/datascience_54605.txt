You can use a anomaly detection autoencoder architecture. Basically, what you will do is, Create an autoencoder architecture wih convolutional layers. We train the model on images of dogs. So when we feed a image of a dog on the trained autoencoder, it will produce a relatively small loss. When a image other than a dog is fed to the model, the loss value will be high. Thus, we can detect a presence of the dog in the image using the loss value.
