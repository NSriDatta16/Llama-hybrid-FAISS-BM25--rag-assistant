CART and ID3 are classical decision tree algorithms. You can also investigate using which measure they are doing splits - there can be Gini index or cross-entropy measuring information gain. But for practical tasks I think pure trees are rarely used as there are Random Forest or (Gradient) Tree Boosting algorithms showing greater performance, latter uses "dumb" decision stumps which are short trees with a very small number of splits (only 1 or 2 for example).
