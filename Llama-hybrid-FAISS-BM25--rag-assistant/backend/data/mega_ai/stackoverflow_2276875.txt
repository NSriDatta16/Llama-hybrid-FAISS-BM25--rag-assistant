If your string only contains paragraphs, you may be able to get away with a nicely crafted regex and re.split() . However, if your string is more complex HTML, or not always valid HTML, you might want to look at the BeautifulSoup package. Usage goes like: from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulSoup soup = BeautifulSoup(some_html) paragraphs = list(unicode(x) for x in soup.findAll('p'))
