No free distributed version control system supports this. If you want this feature, you will have to implement it. You can write off git: they are interested in raw performance for the Linux kernel development use case. It is improbable they would ever accept the performance trade-off in scaling to huge binary files. I do not know about Mercurial, but they seem to have made similar choices as git in coupling their operating model to their storage model for performance. In principle, Bazaar should be able to support your use case with a plugin that implements tree/branch/repository formats whose on-disk storage and implementation strategy is optimized for your use case. In case the internal architecture blocks you, and you release useful code, I expect the core developers will help fix the internal architecture. Also, you could set up a feature development contract with Canonical. Probably the most pragmatic approach, irrespective of the specific DVCS would be to build a hybrid system: implement a huge-file store, and store references to blobs in this store into the DVCS of your choice. Full disclosure: I am a former employee of Canonical and worked closely with the Bazaar developers.
