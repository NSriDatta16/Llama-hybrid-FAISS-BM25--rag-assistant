test if sample is meaningfully positive or negative

For a sample, say -11, 19, -6, 4, -7, 26, 2, what is the appropriate statistical test to see if this sequence is meaningfully positive or negative? So far, I come up with the idea of comparing its average with its standard deviation, but then it begs the question how to make sense of the result. I recall t test may be for a similar purpose, but isn't it is for comparing two groups of numbers? Studied statistics in school but never developed an interest until recently; glad I have found this community and look forward to reading all the interesting posts
