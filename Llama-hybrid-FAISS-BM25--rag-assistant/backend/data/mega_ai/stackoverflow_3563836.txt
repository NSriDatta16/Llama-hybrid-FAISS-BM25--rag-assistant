Based on Brett Porter's answer, I think I'll do the following: Reorganise branching: The cause of the conflicts seems that the release plugin changes the trunk and branch versions after creating the Subversion branch. To work around this, I'll bump the trunk version with versions:set . use release:branch to create the branch, but set -DupdateWorkingCopyVersions=false because I've already set the version. This will avoid the merge conflicts. What remains is that whenever I merge the branch back to the trunk, I'll now merge in the branch version too. Again, versions:set to the rescue.
