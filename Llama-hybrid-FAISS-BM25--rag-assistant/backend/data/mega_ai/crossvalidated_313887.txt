Why isn't Akaike information criterion used more in machine learning?

I just ran into "Akaike information criterion", and I noticed this large amount of literature on model selection (also things like BIC seem to exist). Why don't contemporary machine learning methods take advantage of these BIC and AIC model selection criteria?
