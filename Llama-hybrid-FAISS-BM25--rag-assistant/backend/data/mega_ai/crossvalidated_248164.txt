About question 1.: if you want to analyse the daily time series, then you should consider a functional principal component analysis (fPCA). fPCA generalises the usual PCA for handling functional data, i.e. datasets in which the statistical unit is not a single observation but a curve or a function. I believe there are several possible variants fPCA. The book by Ramsay et al. (2009) Functional Data Analysis with R and MATLAB edited by Springer, is a great reference. The book comes with a handy $\texttt{R}$ package called $\texttt{fda}$. About question 2.: In case of the functional data approach I'm not sure how do you perform the standardisation, you need to check the literature. But in the yearly averaged data, yes, standardisation is always a must in PCA.
