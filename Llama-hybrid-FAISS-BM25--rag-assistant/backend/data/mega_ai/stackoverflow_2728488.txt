The documentation of .load() states this about loading page fragments: Note that the document retrieved cannot be a full HTML document; that is, it cannot include (for example) , , or elements. jQuery uses the browser's innerHTML property on a element to parse the document, and most browsers will not allow non-body elements to be parsed in this way. This is probably the problem here - since you're loading location.href , I assume you're getting back a full HTML document. Creating a PHP page that retrieves only the relevant part of the HTML should fix this.
