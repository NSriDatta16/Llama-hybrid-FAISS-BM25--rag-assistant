I'm very unsure about this, but my project uses 'convention singletons' (not enforced singletons), that is, if I have a class called DataController , I define this in the same module: _data_controller = None def GetDataController(): global _data_controller if _data_controller is None: _data_controller = DataController() return _data_controller It is not elegant, since it's a full six lines. But all my singletons use this pattern, and it's at least very explicit (which is pythonic).
