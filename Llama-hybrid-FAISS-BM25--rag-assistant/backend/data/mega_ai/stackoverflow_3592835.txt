What is the best way to deploy a Pylons app?

There are many ways to deploy Pylons apps. - Proxying through apache or nginx to paste - Embedding the app with mod_wsgi - using some edgy nginx+uwsgi combo - and probably more... I've read a lot about the various approaches but failed to really decide which one to choose. Proxying to paste through nginx seems to be the easiest method to setup, but is it efficient? Wouldn't paste be slower than mod_wsgi or uswgi? If so, is the performance increase worth the hassle? Need some experts to help me choose the best compromise... I want simplicity, but I need decent (if not cutting edge) performance, and you, Obiwan Kenobi, are my only hope ;)
