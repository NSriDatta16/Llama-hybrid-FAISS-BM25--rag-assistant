It doesn't include form helpers or anything, but here's a Ruby implementation that uses the KBB database to retrieve make/model info: http://tektastic.com/2008/03/car-or-auto-make-model-year-database.html I'd probably cron this outside of the app and update the db from time to time, then use collection_select in the app to construct the dropdowns as normal. You could also adapt it to use ActiveResource for live retrieval, but that seems excessive and perhaps bannable by KBB.
