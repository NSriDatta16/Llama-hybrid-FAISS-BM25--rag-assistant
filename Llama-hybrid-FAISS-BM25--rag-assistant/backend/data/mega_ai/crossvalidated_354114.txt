Appropriateness of time series regression for intensive longitudinal data

I am analyzing time series data in which participants rated their thoughts in real time. I am trying to model the shape of the data. Details on the time series: Sampling rate was 1/4 second Length of time series is 30 seconds (for a total of 120 data points) In some (but not all) of the time series, we see what resembles a loosely periodic pattern of responding. However, we would not expect these patterns to be strictly dependent on the time (I have no reason to expect a participant's data would show a peak exactly every 7 seconds, for example). For example, in this time series there are semi-regular peaks and valleys, but they don't follow a strict periodic pattern (x-axis is quarter of a second and y is rating of thoughts, from negative to positive): Here is the data corresponding to the above time series: c(0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 3, 2, 0, 0, -2, -3, -4, -5, -5, -6, -6, -7, -7, -6, -5, -5, -4, -3, -4, -4, -2, 0, 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 5, 5, 4, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -3, -3, -3, -3, -2, -2, -1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 4, 4, 3, 3, 3, 2, 1, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -2, -2, -2, -2, -2, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1, -1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -2, -2, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1) It was suggested to me that time series regression may be an appropriate method to analyze this data. At first, I thought that being able to decompose the series into the seasonal (as well as trend and error) components would be useful. However, the research I have done on this (for example, from the top slide on page 4 of this slide deck ) leads me to believe that in time series regression, seasonal patterns must follow strict periodicity with no room for deviation. My impression is that even though there may be some cyclicity in my data, this would not be considered a "seasonal" pattern, and thus time series regression would not be appropriate here. I am hoping that someone can confirm or deny this suspicion. My questions are: based on what I've described, would time series regression be appropriate for this data set? In time series regression, how strict is the requirement for something to be considered "seasonal"? If a time series shows a peak about every 7 seconds (but sometimes 6 and sometimes 8), could that ever be considered a seasonal pattern?
