Would the group means of PC scores differ from the PC scores of group means?

I have $2$ $n\times p$ matrices, where $n$ are the rows (samples), and $p$ the columns (measurements). Each matrix has samples and measurements from different groups. I call these the "raw" data. I've conducted a principal components analyses of the complete raw data, and computed the mean of each PC score by group. The latter I call the mean of the PC scores by group. My question is whether the means of the PC scores by group (raw-data $\rightarrow$ PCA $\rightarrow$ mean PCs by group) would differ from the PC scores derived from a PCA conducted on the "raw" group means (raw data $\rightarrow$ mean by group $\rightarrow$ PCA)?
