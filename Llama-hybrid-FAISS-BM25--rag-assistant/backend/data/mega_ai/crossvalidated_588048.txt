Using AI for human like mouse movement between two points

I am trying to use Neural Networks or ML to make my mouse cursor move as humanly as possible, I want to be able to generate a set of points which are needed for the mouse to move from point A (Starting Point) to point B (Target Point). I have a dataset where I recorded the mouse movement from one point to another in the format of x,y,time. I have attached an image to show the data. (The number of points that it takes from Point A to Point B varies for different cases, some cases it takes 100 points to get to target while in other cases it could take less or more). Now I have a dataset that has multiple points recorded from A to B and in the final solution I aim to have a model file which takes input of the Starting Point and Ending Point (x,y) coordinates on the screen and have the model generate output of the points that are needed to get to the target point. The dataset is something like this : I need suggestions in order to do this using Neural Networks or Machine Learning. How should I set my data for input and output in order to get the result I want?
