The key difference between CIs and PIs is not that the first are narrower, but that they encode the uncertainty in two different things . CIs give the uncertainty in unobservable parameter estimates. (And they indeed are often derived from non-Gaussian distributions, e.g., the CI for a Bernoulli parameter which is close to 0 or 1 . And indeed, the Gaussianity of the observed data has almost nothing to do with whether your parameter estimates are normally distributed.) PIs give the uncertainty in future observable actuals . Two very different things. So the question really is what you are more interested in: the uncertainty in some underlying parameter (which one?)? Then use CIs. This could actually also be the uncertainty in the future conditional expected value of your time series. But remember that you will never observe this expectation . All you will observe is future actuals, which are the unknown expectation plus some residual variance. Or are you more interested in quantifying the uncertainty in future observables? Then use PIs. I have to say that in 15 years of work in time series and forecasting, I have extremely rarely (if ever) encountered any interest in CIs, whereas PIs are all over the place (as they should be). As such, I would recommend you talk to whoever asked you to report CIs and figure out whether what they are really interested in is PIs, which seems very likely to me.
