You can make your app backward compatible. You will have to specify the target SDK as 2.2 and the min SDK as 1.5 There are a few strategies to use when you are making a backward compatible application. The thing you need to avoid is using functionality from a higher SDK (APIs etc) when your application is running on a phone that supports a lower SDK. Read http://developer.android.com/resources/articles/backward-compatibility.html for more information. Another good read on how lazy loading of classes can be used for backward compatibility - http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/07/how-to-have-your-cupcake-and-eat-it-too.html
