EM and MCMC are algorithms/procedures to find solutions, they're not expressions. But, yes, the solutions they lead are not in closed-form. See the definition of a closed-form expression from wikipedia: ...a closed-form expression is a mathematical expression expressed using a finite number of standard operations. It may contain constants, variables, certain "well-known" operations (e.g., + − × ÷), and functions (e.g., nth root, exponent, logarithm, trigonometric functions, and inverse hyperbolic functions), but usually no limit, differentiation, or integration..."
