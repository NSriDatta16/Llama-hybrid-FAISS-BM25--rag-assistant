PCA itself is not a procedure for choosing the number of principal components. It is a procedure for calculating the values of the principal components. Choosing how many of these principal components to keep is up to you. Your example code produces 3 of them because you asked for n_components=3 in the call to PCA . There are a variety of philosophies on how to choose the number of principal components to keep. This topic should be covered in any introductory text that also discusses PCA, such as: Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., & Friedman, J. H. (2009).
