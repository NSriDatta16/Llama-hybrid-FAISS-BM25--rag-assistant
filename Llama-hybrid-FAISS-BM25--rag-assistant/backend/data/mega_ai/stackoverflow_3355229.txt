How to take a redirection URL

I have a problem with redirection, in my work I have to make a connection to a URL that automatically go to another URL at this point it takes the credential (username and password) and redirect to a URL that contains a parameter which need me. How can I take this parameter? To be precise, I have to do this: Embed a Web browser with the URL https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize with your client_id and the type set to user_agent. Since your application is embedding a small window, you can trigger a compact "popup" version of the authorization dialog with the display parameter: graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize? client_id=...& redirect_uri=www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html& type=user_agent& display=popup After the user authorizes your application, we redirect the user back to www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html with the access token in the URL fragment: www.facebook.com/connect/login_success.html#access_token=...&expires_in=... Intercept the redirect above and read the access token out of the URL. Use the access token to fetch data from the Graph API on behalf of the user: graph.facebook.com/me?access_token=... . I need access_token .
