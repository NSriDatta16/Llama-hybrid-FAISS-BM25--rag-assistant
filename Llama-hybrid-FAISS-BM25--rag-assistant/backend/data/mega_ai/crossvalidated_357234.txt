In Bayesian, what is the effect of prior on the curvature of posterior?

Just wonder about the simplest example, I have a simple Normal prior on my scalar parameter $w$. $$P(w|D) \sim P(D|w) P(w)$$ $$P(w) = \mathcal{N}(0,\alpha^2)$$ When I increase $\alpha$ from 0 to $\infty$, how would the curvature of $P(w|D)$ changes?
