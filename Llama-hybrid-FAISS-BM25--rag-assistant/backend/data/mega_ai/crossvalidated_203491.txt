Can a Markov chain be approximated with an AR process?

In some MCMC literature/source code, a Markov chain is often approximated with an AR(1) process. There is some theory to suggest that such an approximation is somewhat valid for a finite state space, but I am not aware of any literature for general state space. See http://www.pnas.org/content/89/10/4432.full.pdf . There is a lot of literature out there for approximating an AR process with a Markov chain, but I am interested in the opposite. Most significantly where I have seen this approximation being used is the coda package in R, where it is used to estimate the spectral density at 0 for a process. Look at the help page for function spectrum0.ar here . This function is then used in the calculation of effective same size, amongst other things. Seeing the popularity of this package, I am wondering how such an approximation is theoretically valid? Is there literature out there that justifies this approximation?
