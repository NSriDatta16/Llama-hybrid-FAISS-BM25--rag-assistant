Hierarchical models for multiple comparisons - multiple outcomes context

I've just been (re-)reading Gelman's Why we (usually) don't have to worry about multiple comparisons . In particular the section "Multiple outcomes and other challenges" mentions using a hierarchical model for situations when there are multiple related measures from the same person/unit at different times/conditions. It appears to have a number of desirable properties. I understand that this is not necessarily a Bayesian thing. Could somebody show me how to properly construct a multivariate multilevel model using rjags and/or lmer (regular JAGS and BUGS should be fine too, as well as other mixed model libraries e.g., MCMCglmm) so that I can play around with it to compare and contrast results? The type of situation I would like a model for is reflected in the toy data below (multivariate, repeated measures): set.seed(69) id
