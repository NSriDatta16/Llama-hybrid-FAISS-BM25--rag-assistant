It means that library references that symbol ( std::basic_string , std::allocator >::_Rep::_S_empty_rep_storage in this case?) but that it doesn't define it; some part of the program you link it with, or some other library is supposed to do that. If you did mean to define it in your library, it means you didn't link the object file with that symbol's definition with the rest of the library code.
