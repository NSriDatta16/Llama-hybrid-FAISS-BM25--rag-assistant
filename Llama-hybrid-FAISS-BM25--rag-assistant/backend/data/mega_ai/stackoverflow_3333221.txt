Here in the office we use ZenCart for commerce and CakePHP for everything else. I haven't had much to do with Zen and it seems to have organically developed into a nightmarish beast. I'd love to develop a solution with Cake and I think Cake would be well suited to it. The biggest headache - as I see it - would be solid secure payment handling (which is why we stick with Zen).
