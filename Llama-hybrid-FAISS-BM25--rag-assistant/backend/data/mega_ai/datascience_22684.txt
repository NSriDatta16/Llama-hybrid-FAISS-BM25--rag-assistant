Is it possible to use grayscale images to existing model?

From tensorflow's object recognition (R-CNN) I'm re-training the existing model with new categories: the types of clothes (jeans, pants, blouse, and so on). Since we don't need colors to determine the type of clothes that user is wearing, I want to re-train it with gray-scale images. Is it possible to use gray-scale images to train existing model (which are trained with color images)? I'm concerned because they trained their model with color images . Does the model just consider the grayscale image as color image? And does it still work? :) p.s I'm generating XML and csv files to put data for training and testing.
