For accessing relational databases such as SQL Server an Object Relational Mapper (ORM) is very useful. In the .NET space Entity Framework from Microsoft and the open source NHibernate are popular choices. I highly recommend trying one of these. Entity Framework has drag-n-drop style designer support in Visual Studio and NHibernate has better code based configuration. I would recommend trying which ever of those options sounds best to you. Coming from Enterprise Library and stored procedures you will quickly find how easy these tools make CRUD tasks, however like anything for more complex updating and querying there is a bit to learn.
