imports and package structure in as3/flex

I've got a problem how to organise files and packages in AS3/Flex project. A short intro to the problem: The files structure in the project is (and should stay) like this: libs/Class1/src/ libs/Class2/src/ libs/Class3/src/ The amxmlc compiler source-path variable points to: libs/ I need it because I have to subclass Class1 in Class3. That pushes me to put all the classes into packages that look as weird as this: package ClassX.src { /* ... */ } So in practice it looks like that: package Class3.src { import Class1.src.Class1; // I prefer direct imports public class Class3 extends Class1 { /* ... */ } } Is there a way to keep the files/folders structure and get rid of src in the package name. Changing the files structure or direct pointing compiler into base-class directory in not an option. It's really confusing for new programmers who join the project and we really want to avoid that. Great thanks for ANY help!!!
