From a standpoint of interpretation, can I use NMF on one-hot encoded categorical data for dimension reduction? Unfortunately NMF doesn't have a nice probabilistic interpretation as PCA. Because of this it's like asking if requirements are satisfied when there are no requirements. We can tackle this problem from another angle though. I'd argue you should give it a try, since NMF is routinely used for similar problem: topic modeling. Your data will be binary after one-hot encoding so it is like count data (although a bit different). NMF is good for topic modeling because when you factorize sparse matrices the factors also tend to be sparse. This may suggest that it could be useful in your case.
