What is wrong with taking the set of angles as real values and just computing the arithmetic average of those numbers? Then you would get the intuitive (0+0+90)/3 = 30 deg. Edit : Thanks for useful comments and pointing out that angles may exceed 360. I believe the answer could be the normal arithmetic average reduced "modulo" 360: we sum all the values, divide by the number of angles and then subtract/add a multiple of 360 so that the result lies in the interval [0..360).
