PhD program in statistics

I am a first year PhD student in statistics. During this year I have analyzed the scopes of interest of my scientific advisor and found them unpromising. He is majored in mixtures with varying concentrations models for which I have not found any references to authoritative sources. Now I want to change my PhD theme, however, there are no other scientific advisors in my university which majored in statistics. Therefore, I have 2 questions: Is it possible to write at least 5 articles together with a PhD thesis without scientific adviser? If yes, what is a proper way to do this? Here I mean how to choose a theme, where ask for a help and so on. Is it possible to find a remote adviser to consult with? If yes, how and where can I find him? Also I have no much time for the search. I am interested in statistics, especially in machine learning. I would like my PhD thesis to be of practical value, not pure research one which is popular in my department. Also I have commercial experience in programming (C/C++, R, Python) if that can help. Thanks in advance for any help!
