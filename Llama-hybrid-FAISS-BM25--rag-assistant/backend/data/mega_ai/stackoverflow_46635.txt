There is no such things as GOTO considered harmful . GOTO is a tool, and as all tools, it can be used and abused . There are, however, many tools in the programming world that have a tendency to be abused more than being used , and GOTO is one of them. the WITH statement of Delphi is another. Personally I don't use either in typical code , but I've had the odd usage of both GOTO and WITH that were warranted, and an alternative solution would've contained more code. The best solution would be for the compiler to just warn you that the keyword was tainted , and you'd have to stuff a couple of pragma directives around the statement to get rid of the warnings. It's like telling your kids to not run with scissors . Scissors are not bad, but some usage of them are perhaps not the best way to keep your health.
