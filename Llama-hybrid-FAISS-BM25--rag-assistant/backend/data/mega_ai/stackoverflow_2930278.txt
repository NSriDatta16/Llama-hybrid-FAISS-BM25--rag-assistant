For something non interactive: Export the animation to an AVI and embed that in your form: Embedding Video in a WinForms app It's not really what I'd recommend, but it's an alternative to creating an animated gif. For something partially interactive (i.e. allowing limited movement): I've seen QuickTime movies that you can control with the mouse. There's an example on this page . It's not 3D though. For something fully interactive: You need a 3D rendering engine of some sort and that does (usually) require DirectX or OpenGL. However, if you're only dealing with simple objects you might (repeat might ) get away with a software renderer.
