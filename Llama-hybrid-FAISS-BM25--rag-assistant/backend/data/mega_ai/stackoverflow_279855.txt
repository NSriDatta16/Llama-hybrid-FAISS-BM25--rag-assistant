this code is garbage, see comments static unsigned char buffer[256]; int main(void) { unsigned char *p, *q; q = (p = buffer) + sizeof(buffer); //p=buffer, q=buffer+256 while (q - p) //q-p = 256 on first iteration { p = buffer; //p=buffer again while (!++*p++); //increment the value pointed at by p+1 and check for !0 } return p - q; //will return zero if loop ever terminates } it might terminate, it might not; the while loop is essentially scanning an uninitialized buffer so it might throw an access violation instead; i don't remember the binding precedence of ++*p++, nor do i care enough to look it up if this is really an interview question, my answer is "if this is the kind of code you expect me to work with, i don't want the job" EDIT: thanks to Robert Gamble for reminding me that static arrays are automatically initialized to zero, so the code is not complete garbage - but I still would not want to maintain it or work with the nutjob that wrote it ;-)
