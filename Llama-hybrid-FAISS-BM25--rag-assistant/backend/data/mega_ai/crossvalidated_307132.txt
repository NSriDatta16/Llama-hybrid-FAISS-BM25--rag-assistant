Double counting data in a Bayesian Model? Output is a derived random variable being the product of other observed random variables

I've found a few studies that seem to touch on the possibility of double counting, but have yet to find any examples that fit this exact trope. That said, is loading observed values in multiple distributions (sites) within a hierarchical Bayesian model allowable (insofar as no significance or signal strengthening is conjured from thin air, i.e. double counting), when the primary “observations” for the estimation of the posterior mean (here =mu[i]) are not derived explicitly from nature etc., but as the arithmetic equation involving the values of other random variables, whose values have actually been observed and whose probability distributions define a lower, or prior tier of distributions within the Bayesian model? (see example shown, however it could be most anything) Given a toy example, if: Y[i] ~ Norm(mu[i], tau) mu[i] = v[i] * w[i] * z[i] and the priors (variables) are normally distributed and have hyperpriors: v[i]~ Norm [mu_v, sd]; Normal, Gamma w[i] ~Norm [mu_w, sd]; Normal, Gamma z[I] ~ Norm [mu_z, sd]; Normal, Gamma Observations in nature have been made for random variable v[i], w[i] and z[i], for example v[n=5]= {1,2,3,4,5} w[n=5]= {1,2,3,4,5} z[n=5]= {1,2,3,4,5} Ergo, giving the aforementioned equation for u[i] (such types of equations are quite common in the life sciences, growth rate, population stuff etc.), the “observations” of the “derived random variable” given the values of v[5], w[5] and z[5] (above) and the following equation If: mu[i] = v[i] w[i] * z[i] Then: the corresponding values of Y which (n=5) sample the mean are determined expressly as {1, 8, 27, 64, 125} That being the case, what is the nature of the following scenarios: 1) Is it “legal”, not double counting etc., to load data for both the observed and "derived random variable"? If so or if not, in terms of broad strokes theory how could you conclude that answer? 2) Is loading data is more “truthful” in one arrangement? 3) Is there some broader theoretical trope that I’m plainly missing that would even cause me to raise this question? 4) Thnx for the feedback!
