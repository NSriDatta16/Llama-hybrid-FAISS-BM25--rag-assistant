Error 504 is an internal timeout. From the docs : The search appliance can also return a 500 or 504 error response if a processing thread is unable to respond with results within a time period. The internal timeout period on the search appliance before a 500/504 error is thrown can vary depending on the state of the response. The next paragraph in the docs suggests that you limit the requests you send to the search appliance, to avoid getting a 504 error.
