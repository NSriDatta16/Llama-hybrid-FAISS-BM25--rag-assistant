ARIMA vs ARMA on the differenced series

In R (2.15.2) I fitted once an ARIMA(3,1,3) on a time series and once an ARMA(3,3) on the once differenced timeseries. The fitted parameters differ, which I attributed to the fitting method in ARIMA. Also, fitting an ARIMA(3,0,3) on the same data as ARMA(3,3) will not result in identical parameters, no matter the fitting method I use. I am interested in identifying where the difference comes from and with what parameters i can (if at all) fit the ARIMA to get the same coefficients of the fit as from the ARMA. Sample code to demonstrate: library(tseries) set.seed(2) #getting a time series manually x Edit: Using the conditional sum of squares comes pretty close, but is not quite there. Thanks for the hint for the fit1! Edit2: I do not think this is a duplicate. Points 2 and 3 address different problems than mine, and even if I override the initialisation mentioned in point 1 by fit4 I still get different coefficients
