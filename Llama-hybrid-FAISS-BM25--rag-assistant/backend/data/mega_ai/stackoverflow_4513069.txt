This will happen if you are using the cookie session store, rather than the database session store. See config/initializers/session_store.rb. Yesterday, I began porting a project under development from 2.3.5 to 2.3.8. Under 2.3.5, all specs and features were green. After changing the Rails version to 2.3.8, several Cucumber steps started failing. The steps were related to an inability to sign out (exactly what you describe here) and to the flash[:notice] being lost. This project was created by copying files from another project into a clean-slate Rails project. In the process, the session migrations were copied, but session_store.rb was not updated to actually use the database. Once I uncommented "ActionController::Base.session_store = :active_record_store" in session_store.rb, the Cucumber steps started passing.
