I have faced this problem many times while using SVM with Rbf kernel. Using Linear kernel instead of Rbf kernel solved my problem, but I dealt with lesser number of classes. The results were less skewed and more accurate with the linear kernel. Hope this solves your problem. Edit: While I wrote original answer I was naive enough to not consider weighting the classes as one of them correctly answered. Also, while using rbf kernel its important to make sure that the penalty parameter or the 'C' value as per sklearn's svm module is too generic. I find that the default value of C=1 is too generic most of the time and I typically end up with a value of C=10000. Hope this helps others who get skewed results with svm(rbf) despite of having good distribution of classes in data.
