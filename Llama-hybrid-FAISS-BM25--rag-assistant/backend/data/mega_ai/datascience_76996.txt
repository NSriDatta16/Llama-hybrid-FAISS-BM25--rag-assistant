I eventually do plan on moving more towards ML One aspect that I would like to add based on what I observed . Things are moving with more focus towards Deep Learning e.g. Neural Networks and in this space, most of the dominating Libraries supports Python as first choice. Companies manage a separate Python version to open-source, just to maintain the user base even though they themselves use either a C++ compiled version or something different. It's because of the two-way-additive process i.e. since Python has gained fame, companies are creating an open-sourced framework/library in Python and easily available Frameworks/Libraries are attracting more users. Stackoverflow 2019 Survey Most Popular Technologies - Python - 41.7% $\hspace{1cm}$ R - 5.8% Other Frameworks, Libraries, and Tools - Pandas and Tensorflow are in top 5-6 Most Wanted Languages - Python is at the top with 25.7% Most Wanted Framework - Tensorflow at 2nd after NodeJs Same logic goes with Books/Blogs and Tutorials. I will agree that concepts don't change with a programming language but the examples/code provided in the books/blogs definitely accelerate the learning. Almost everyone in the Industry will recommend this book to a beginner and I also found it the best.
