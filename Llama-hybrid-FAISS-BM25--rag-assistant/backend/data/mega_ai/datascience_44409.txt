Comparative Analysis of two sets of data

I have 2 sets of data which consist of marks of 60 students in a particular subject in year 1 and year 2 respectively. Year 1 : 86, 76, 87, 67, 89, 95.... so on (60 students) Year 2 : 82, 67, 99, 77, 65, 78.... so on (60 students) I want to compare these two sets of marks and find if year 2 students performed better than year 1 students. What kind of techniques are appropriate for this problem? I was told that the statistical techniques like ANOVA, hypothesis testing techniques are too common for this problem and I was asked to try something with Machine learning. Does machine learning fit in the picture? If yes, what kind of algorithms could be used?
