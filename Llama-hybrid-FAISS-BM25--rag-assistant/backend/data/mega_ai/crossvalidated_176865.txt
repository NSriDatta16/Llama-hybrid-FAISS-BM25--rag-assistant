So there is a confusion if one is coming from the domain of machine learning. In the beginning of the book it said that: features = inputs = a set of variables (X1,.... Xp). "inputs" is not related to the number of input samples. Input samples (training samples) are called "observations" (1 .. i .. N). xi - the ith observation as a column vector of X1,X2 ... Xp X is N x p matrix where each row is an observation and contains one input vector, so each row is xti xti = (X1,X2 .... j ... Xp)
