Presuming the table in question is indexed, then one of two options is certainly warranted when any of the indexes outgrow the available RAM. Not surprisingly, one of them is, increase RAM. The other of course is vertical partitioning. gbn's answer provides some good things to consider which you have not mentioned, such as how many records per month (or week, or day) are being added. Richard's comment as to how big the (average) record is is also significant, particularly in terms of how big the average records for the indexes are, presuming the indexes do not include all the fields from the table. gbn's answer however also seems a bit reckless to me. Growing at 20 million rows per month and not even "thinking of anything like partitioning". Without sufficient metrics as alluded to above, this is a possible recipe for disaster. You should at least be thinking about it, even it just to determine how long you can sustain your current and/or expected rate of growth, before needing to consider more RAM or partitioning.
