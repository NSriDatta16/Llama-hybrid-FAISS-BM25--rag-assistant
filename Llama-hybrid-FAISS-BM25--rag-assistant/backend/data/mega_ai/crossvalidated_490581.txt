Forecasting the spikes in time series river gage data

I have an idea for a personal project knitting together river level gage data with weather data sets to look at how upstream and surrounding area rainfall events affect river levels. I would probably also use this for my capstone project in my MS Analytics program. Ultimately I would like to make a tool that looks at weather predictions in a watershed and predicts what a specific river gage will be at over the next 7 days, as this would be of tremendous value to the kayaking community. The important thing is the spikes though, a river may only be high enough to kayak for a few hours before the level drops again. Most forecasting algorithms I've looked at seem more focused on tempering spikes than predicting them. I feel like rivers and junctions are inherently a network graph and that could be a good way to organize this, but complicated. Initially I want to just try and make it work without modeling the river network or collecting/using complicated meteorological/geographical/hydrological variables. I have 10-20 years of river data for each site and matching weather history. I think calibrating the model separately for each month will minimize seasonality issues and I am sure I need to focus on predicting the change in gage height rather than the actual gage height. Some of the things that are tripping me up include whether I need to move away from time series data and how to deal with the variable time delay between a rain event 100 miles away and the gage height change that occurs from it. Basically, I think my approach is to build a micro model through simple regression at each site that says "given no rain in the watershed in 24 hours, in january, that gauge will drop by 2% per hour." or "given 1 inch of rain in 24 hours in the direct vicinity, that gauge will rise by 30% per hour." Then it seems to be not too tricky to combine these predictions with the current gage level and current rainfall estimates and arrive back at a chart of the next few days. Here is an example of the gage data I'm using: https://waterdata.usgs.gov/usa/nwis/uv?03518500 Any thoughts or guidance?
