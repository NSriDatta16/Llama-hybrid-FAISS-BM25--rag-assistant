The open source VRToolkit application by Benjamin Loulier does just this. It overlays a 3-D model onscreen in response to coded tags, rotating and scaling them in response to movement of this tag in the area viewed by the iPhone camera. It leverages the ARToolkitPlus library to do the marker identification and processing. However, be aware that this library is GPL-licensed, so you will need to release the source code of any application you build on this under the GPL.
