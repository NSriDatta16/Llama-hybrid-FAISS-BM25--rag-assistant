.Net Culture Insensitive Comparisons - Example of when this is needed

I am revising for the MCTS example and am on a small section regarding Culture-Insensitive comparisons. I get the principle, you don't two items which are the same (i.e dates) but are displayed differently and hence are pragmatically marked as different. However call me stupid but I am finding it hard to see where I can use it is practice, for example why would you have two different date times, in the same code, in which they are different cultures? The only way to do so would be if you manually override the one of the datatypes cultures and why would you do that? Any example of a real-world application of culturally insensitive comparisons? Cheers
