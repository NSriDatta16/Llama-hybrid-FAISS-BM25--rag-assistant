The session data stored is signed using the below information you setup in your config.rb file. Rails::Initializer.run do |config| config.action_controller.session = { :session_key => '_store_session', :secret => '851939c37d94574e284ded8437d4ea3447dae24cc5bda61d8eaf2731d49273bc4c620' } end So while it is not easy to read, it is not impossible with enough time and effort. Here is a bunch of link that discuss this issue at length but the general consensus is that this is not a flawed implementation and that you should not store anything in the session that is too critical. http://blog.thinkrelevance.com/2008/1/27/rails-the-cookie-store-and-security http://railscasts.com/episodes/84-cookie-based-session-store http://www.caboo.se/articles/2007/2/21/new-controversial-default-rails-session-storage-cookies http://www.technicalinfo.net/papers/WebBasedSessionManagement.html http://www.quarkruby.com/2007/9/20/ruby-on-rails-security-guide#sessions
