Likelihood for time-series classification model

Let's say I have some time series $x_{1..T}$ , and my task is to predict the corresponding $y$ . But, I want the model to have the ability to use any prefix of $x$ for prediction, not just the full time series. The likelihood model I have in mind is $L(\theta) = \Pi_t \space p_{\theta}(y | x_{1..t})$ , but it seems illegitimate to count $y$ multiple times like this. Is this idea OK and, if not, how might I fix it?
