According to CARGO-804 , Cargo's Jetty deployer now supports embedding a jetty-env.xml inside your war (as of version 1.0.3). And in order to keep the jetty-env.xml outside your "real" war, my suggestion would be to create an additional war module to host the jetty-env.xml file and configure Cargo to merge WAR files (pay a special attention to the true element which is important, as mentioned in CARGO-524 ).
