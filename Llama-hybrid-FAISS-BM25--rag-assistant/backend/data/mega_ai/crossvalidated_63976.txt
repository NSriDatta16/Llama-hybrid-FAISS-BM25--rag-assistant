You can stop early, but if you do, your p-values aren't easily interpreted. If you don't care about the interpretation of your p-value, then the way in which the answer to your first two questions are 'no' doesn't matter (too much). Your client seems pragmatic, so the true interpretation of a p-value is probably not a fine point you care about. I can't speak to the second approach you propose. However, the first approach is not on solid ground. Normal approximations of binomial distributions aren't valid for proportions that low (which is the method power.prop.test uses, also the method used by Cohen in his classical book on power). Moreover, as far as I am aware, there is no closed form power analysis solution for two-sample proportion tests (cf. How can one perform a two-group binomial power analysis without using normal approximations? ). There are however better methods of approximating the confidence intervals of proportions (cf. the package binom ). You can use non-overlapping confidence intervals as a partial solution... but this is not the same as estimating a p-value and thus doesn't provide a route to power directly. I hope somebody has a nice closed form solution they will share with the rest of us. If I stumble on one, I'll update the above referenced question. Good luck. Edit: While I am thinking about it, let me totally pragmatic here for a moment. Your client wants this experiment to end when they are certain that the experimental site is working better than the control site. After you get a decent sample, if you aren't ready to make a decision, just start adjusting the ratio of your random assignment to whatever side is 'winning'. If it was just a blip, regression towards the mean will slip in, you'll become less certain and ease off the ratio. When you are reasonably certain, call it quits and declare a winner. The optimal approach probably would involve Bayesian updating, but I don't know enough about that topic off the top of my head to direct you. However I can assure you that while it may seem counter intuitive at times, the math itself isn't all that hard.
