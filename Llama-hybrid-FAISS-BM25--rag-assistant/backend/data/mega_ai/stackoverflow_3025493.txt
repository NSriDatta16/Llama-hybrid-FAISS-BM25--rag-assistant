1) Readability & Support A database developer could look at a field called StateCode with a length of varchar(2) and get a good idea of what kind of data that field holds, without even looking at the contents. 2) Reporting When you data is without a length constraint, you are expecting the developer to enforce that the column data is all similar in length. When reporting on that data, if the developer has failed to make the column data consistent, that will make the reporting that data inconsistent & look funny. 3) SQL Server Data Storage SQL Server stores data on 8k "pages" and from a performance standpoint it is ideal to be as efficient as possible and store as much data as possible on a page. If your database is designed to store every string column as varchar(255), "bad" data could slip into one of those fields (for example a state name might slip into a StateCode field that is meant to be 2 characters long), and cause unecessary & inefficient page and index splits.
