Infragistics Ultralistview MouseHover Retrieve User Information

I am using Infragistics Ultralistview to display data in List which contains 3 columns and 4-5 rows(that could be upto 'n' rows depending upon data added). When i hover over the row for 2 seconds, i want that other information about that row should be displayed in a panel like control. How to do that? Let me know if anything else is required from my side.
