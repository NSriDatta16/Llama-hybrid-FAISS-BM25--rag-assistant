For time series analysis. Yes But, turning data into a computable object for using in the ML computation? No Using the data as a feature. Then, Yes I would give you a general time series example: Consider the number of days in months. The irregularity causes friction while analyzing the model. Consider this: So, such type of transformations would be helpful which analyzing time series', which can help reduce friction in the models sensibly. Link of the explanation
