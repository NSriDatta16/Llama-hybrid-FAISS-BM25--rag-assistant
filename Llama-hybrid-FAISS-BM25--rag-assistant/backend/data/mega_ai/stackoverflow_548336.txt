I think it is likely to be due to one of the following: BDB 4.4 incompatibility with your svn clients. Check out this link for more information (it is not for Windows but is hopefully still useful) - i.e. upgrade BDB to > 4.4 or migrate to fsfs. File permission problem. The "Practical Subversion" book has a section on repository permissions that specifically mentions the error you are getting. See link for a preview - generally you will need to double check all permissions. Also: as someone else suggested it may be worthwhile double checking windows temp folder permission as svn may be using this behind the scenes. It may also be a good idea to migrate to fsfs repository storage. If this does not help: do you get any further error lines after the Unable to open repository 'file:///C:/wamp/www/svns/[myproject]/[dir]/[subdir]'
