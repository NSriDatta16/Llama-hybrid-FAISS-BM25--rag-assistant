Understanding Random effects model - Binary Logistic regression

For the mixed effects (random slope) binary logistic regression model the logit can be expressed as (Applied Logistic Regression (2010) - David W,HOSMER, JR.): $$g(\boldsymbol{x}_{i,j},\alpha_i,\boldsymbol{\beta}_s) = \beta_0 + \alpha_i + \boldsymbol{x}_{i,j} \boldsymbol{\beta}_s $$ Where $\alpha_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2_\alpha)$ . and (i,j) refers to the jth observation in the i:th cluster. the subscript s in $\beta_s$ refers to the fact that coefficients refer to a model that is specific to subjects with random effect $\alpha_i$ This model is said to account for correlated observations by adding a random effect term ,specific to the cluster, to the logit. I dont understand what is the effect of adding this "random term" to the model? Why is this model formultion better when having correlated observations? 'The hetrogenity in the $\alpha_i$ 's is controlled by the varaince $\sigma^2_\alpha$ .Thus, as $\sigma^2_\alpha$ increases the within cluster correlation increases' I dont see the relation with the variance $\alpha_i$ and the correlation within each cluster. Why does greater variance imply greater within cluster correlation?
