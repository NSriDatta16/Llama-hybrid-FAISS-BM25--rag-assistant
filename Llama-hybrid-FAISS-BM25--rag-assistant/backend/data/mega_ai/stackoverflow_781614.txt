Infragisitcs Grid with a WebDialogWindow as an editable popup

I'm looking for some sample code or a link to a good site. Does anyone have a sample of using an infragistics WebDialogWindow as an editable popup with an infra grid. I'm targeting CLR 2.0 using c# preferably. I would be updating a standard ADO.Net Datatable in a Dataset I'm not a fan of the edit row template technique. Thanks in advance! Chris
