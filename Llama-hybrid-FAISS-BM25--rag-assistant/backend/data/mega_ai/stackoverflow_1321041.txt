I've started learning Python as well and one of the bigest mistakes I made is constantly using C++/C# indexed "for" loop. Python have for(i ; i Example: I had a method that iterated over a list and returned the indexes of selected items: for i in range(len(myList)): if myList[i].selected: retVal.append(i) Instead Python has list comprehension that solves the same problem in a more elegant and easy to read way: retVal = [index for index, item in enumerate(myList) if item.selected]
