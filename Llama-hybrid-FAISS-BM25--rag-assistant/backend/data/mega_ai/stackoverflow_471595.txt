Casting an Item Collection from a listbox to a generic list

I want to find a better way of populating a generic list from a checkedlistbox in c#. I can do the following easily enough: List selectedFields = new List (); foreach (object a in chkDFMFieldList.CheckedItems) { selectedFields.Add(a.ToString()); } There must be a more elagent method to cast the CheckedItems collection to my list.
