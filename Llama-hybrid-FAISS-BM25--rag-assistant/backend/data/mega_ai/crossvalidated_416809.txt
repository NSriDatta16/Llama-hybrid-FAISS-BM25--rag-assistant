Calculations in a Bayes Network

I am working through a text book (Probabilistic Graphical Models, Principles and Techniques) to learn BNs, but I am confused as to the accuracy of the example. The text references the figure above. We are told that; P(l^1) ~ 0.502 Using the tilde instead of equals sign when numbers are given is the source of confusion. If I average the l^1 column, I get 0.5033, which should not by any means round down to 0.502. So, is the answer really 0.503 or am I over simplifying the solution? Next, the text explains that P(l^1 | i^0) ~ 0.389. Though, I am far from getting anything close to that value given the numbers inthe image. Could someone show me the correct calculations to get 0.389? I am trying to realize whether I am especially challenged in statistics, or if the text is not explained in the best manner for me to learn. Just to be complete, here is the example copied from the text;
