I would recommend jQuery UI Drag n Drop since it is becoming a standard in web development. It also is a really extendable model and very easy to add custom event handlers, and proxy elements during the drag. I would also keep in mind how much more jQuery UI has to offer that you might soon want to take advantage of like: Animation Easing UI widgets Themes Another critical point to make in the decision is how many libraries do you want to link-in. Using two libraries is common, but it also comes with alot of redundant code. I would recommend fully going to one library so that you can have minimal download of client-script. In my optinion, jQuery has more to offer so I would recommend moving to it, not to mention all the free plugins. Of course this is just my opinion and I think Scriptculous is a viable option too.
