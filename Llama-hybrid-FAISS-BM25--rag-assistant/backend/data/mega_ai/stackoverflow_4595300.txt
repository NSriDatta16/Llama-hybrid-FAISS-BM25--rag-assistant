If you add a clustered index on the columns that define ordering, SQL Server will use that to physically organize rows in the table. However, you should always use an ORDER BY clause in your queries, as the database is not required to return rows in any particular order. The benefit of using a clustered index, however, is that can can reduce the overall cost of sorting rows when they are retrieved and it improves the performing range queries on the indexed columns.
