I highly recommend www.mozy.com. Their software is easy and works great, and since it's stored on their servers you implicitly get offsite backups. No worrying about running a backup server and making sure it's working. Also, the company is backed by EMC (a leading data storage product company), so gives me enough confidence to trust them.
