What are the differences between Knowledge Graph Embeddings (KGE) and Graph Neural Network (GNN)

From page 3 of this paper Knowledge Graph Embeddings and Explainable AI , they mentioned as below: Note that knowledge graph embeddings are different from Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). KG embedding models are in general shallow and linear models and should be distinguished from GNNs [78], which are neural networks that take relational structures as inputs However, it's still vague to me. It seems that we can get embeddings from both of them. What are the difference? How should we choose which approach if we want to get embeddings?
