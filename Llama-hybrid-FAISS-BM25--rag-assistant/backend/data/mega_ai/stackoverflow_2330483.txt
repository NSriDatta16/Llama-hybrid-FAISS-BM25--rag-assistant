A change in the plist file is not always picked up by Xcode. Does cleaning your target and rebuilding it change something? Edit Shooting in the dark, but check the permission of the icon (once inside the builded application). If it's unreadable, it might be the cause of your problem. Also, if you have recently installed the sdk, did you reboot since? Edit 2 Check the name of your icon file and the value for the key CFBundleIconFile in the plist file by paying attention to the case (icon != Icon) Can you post your plist file? With a test project, I have seen that the icon file, named Icon.png is picked up automatically, even if the value for the key CFBundleIconFile is empty. Keep in mind this SKD is: Still in beta Under NDA
