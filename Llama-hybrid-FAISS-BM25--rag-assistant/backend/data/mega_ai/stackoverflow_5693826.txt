If you send entities over WCF, nice features like lazy loading go out the window, of course. You basically need to decide which of the two options you'd like to use: if you ask for the entity OrderableCategory , you can return just its basic "atomic" properties, e.g. ID, Name and so on. The benefit is smaller size - you're sending back less data or alternatively: if you ask for the entity OrderableCategory , you can return its basic properties plus you could load a whole list of Orderables that this category contains, and return both at the same time; benefit: you have that data available right away, but on the downside, you'll have to send a lot more data. Obviously, you cannot really do an infinite eager pre-loading - at some point, you have to stop and leave retrieval of more data to a later WCF service call. Your client would have to ask specifically and explicitly for yet another OrderableCategory if you're interested in that.
