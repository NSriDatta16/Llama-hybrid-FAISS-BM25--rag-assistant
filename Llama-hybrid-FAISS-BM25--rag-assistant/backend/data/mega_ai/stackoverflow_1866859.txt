Drag & Drop Javascript sortable with moving marker?

I am searching through "drag & drop sortable" Javascript libraries such as Prototype's sortable, JQuery's sortable, and a number of standalone ones. I feature that I can't find (but know it's out there) is, I can't think of a better word, "delayed" sorting so that when I move an item around on the list, it will not be moved immediately, but a line or other kind of marker will appear showing where the item would end up if I dropped it right now . This functionality can for example be found in Windows when moving items around in the start menu. Could anybody point me towards a Javascript solution that can do this? Prototype or standalone would be preferred for the current project, but JQuery is fine as well.
