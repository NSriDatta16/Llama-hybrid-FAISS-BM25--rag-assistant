You can use taglibs/EL in JSP to print a string as if it's JavaScript code. You know, JSP runs at webserver machine, produces HTML/CSS/JS and sends it to the webbrowser which in turn starts to run JS code. You should write server side code accordingly that its HTML/CSS/JS output looks right when you're doing View Source in webbrowser. Your pseudocode is a bit ambiguous, but I bet that you're looking for something like this: jQuery(function($){ $("#product").mask('${test ? 'someotherString' : mask}',{placeholder:" "}); }); (don't pay attention to syntax highlighting, the code is correct, the highlighter doesn't recognize EL) The ${} thing is EL (Expression Language) . It will be processed when JSP runs. It should work in template text as per Servlet 2.4/JSP 2.0 (which is already over 5 years old). The ?: is the well known conditional operator. If the expression evaluates true, then the part after ? will be assigned/printed (in this case the literal string "someotherString" ), otherwise the part after the : (in this case the scoped variable mask ). This will end up in the webbrowser as jQuery(function($){ $("#product").mask('someotherString',{placeholder:" "}); }); or jQuery(function($){ $("#product").mask('someString',{placeholder:" "}); }); depending on the boolean outcome of test .
