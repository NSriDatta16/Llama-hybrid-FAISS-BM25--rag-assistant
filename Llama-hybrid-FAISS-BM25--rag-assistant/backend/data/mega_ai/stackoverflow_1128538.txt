Federated security also enables collaboration across multiple systems, networks, and organizations in different trust realms. WCF provides support for building and deploying distributed systems that employ federated security. For WCF information on that, see Federation and Issued Tokens . You may also be interested in the MSDN Magazine article, " Geneva Framework, A Better Approach For Building Claims-Based WCF Services .
