How python LogisticRegression() binary classification works for more than 2 independent variables

I created bag of words (in which number of columns were around 15000 i.e greater than 1) and corresponding output data (0 or 1). After that I used LogisticRegression() (I didn't passed any parameters) from sklearn and used it for training and testing. It didn't gave any error or warning and worked completely fine. However isn't logistic regression only for those dataset which have maximum 1 independent variables? How sigmoid function would work when number of independent variables are greater than 1? Sigmoid function is used in LogisticRegression and wherever I read it is described in 2 dimension space i.e with only one independent variable.
