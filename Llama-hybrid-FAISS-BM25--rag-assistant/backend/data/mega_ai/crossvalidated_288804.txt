What about cases where level-2 (organization) exerts considerable somewhat more coercive influence on level-1 outcomes (individual) I don't see why what you've already heard about mixed models would apply any less to this situation than to students nested within schools. You seem to be concerned about the effect size, but a mixed model places no restrictions on the sizes of the random effects. What is the statistical relevance of an "ownership" or "coercive" relationship?
