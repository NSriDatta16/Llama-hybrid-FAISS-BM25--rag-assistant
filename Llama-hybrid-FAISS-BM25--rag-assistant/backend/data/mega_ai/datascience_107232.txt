Your model is overfitting . There are a couple ways to deal with this: 1.) The data you have is just 5k entries large. This is not suitable for Deep Learning algos which require a lot more data than this. You would be wise to use a ML algorithm for this data. Overfitting happens when the model you use is quite complicated for the data you have. Either use a ML algo or gather some more data if you want to use DL algos. 2.) You are using accuracy as a metric for a multiclass classification problem which is not advised. Try using a proper metric and see if it solves the problem. 3.) Another way to tackle this is as @niv dudovitch suggests. Reduce the complexity of the LSTM by reducing the no of parameters. 4.) You can try using Keras Tuner to tune the HP and see if it solves the problem. 5.) Try suing Batch Normalization instead of Dropout . If you really want to use Dropout then using a value of 0.5 is too large a value for such a small data. Do lemme know if it works! Cheers!
