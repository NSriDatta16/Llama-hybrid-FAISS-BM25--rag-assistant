What statistical test can I use for survival data?

My goal is to know if significant differences exist between the different treatment concentrations as well as the two treatment timings (E5 and E6) in terms of survival rate. The survival probabilities of each embryo are entirely independent from that of other embryos. What statistical test can I use to analyze the data? My data looks something like this. trial treatment_day treatment replicate survived 1 E5 0 1 1 1 E5 0 2 1 1 E5 0 3 1 1 E5 10 1 1 1 E5 10 2 1 1 E5 10 3 1 1 E5 20 1 1 1 E5 20 2 1 1 E5 20 3 1 1 E5 50 1 1 1 E5 50 2 1 1 E5 50 3 1 1 E5 100 1 1 1 E5 100 2 1 1 E5 100 3 1 1 E6 0 1 1 1 E6 0 2 0 1 E6 10 1 1 1 E6 10 2 0 1 E6 20 1 0 1 E6 20 2 1 1 E6 50 1 0 1 E6 50 2 1 1 E6 100 1 1 1 E6 100 2 1 Treatment is in terms of mM of ethanol, with 0 as the control. There are 4 trials and 5 replicates (eggs) for each treatment (except for the initial trial, where there were only 3 for E5 and 2 for E6). Sample size is 105 eggs for E5 and 100 eggs for E6. I tried running logistic regression using JASP and I'm getting these results, which don't seem right to me. Does this just mean that treatment timing and concentration are not significant predictors of embryo survival? Can anyone help me out? My knowledge of statistics is not that good and we weren't taught logistic regression in our classes. Thanks in advance.
