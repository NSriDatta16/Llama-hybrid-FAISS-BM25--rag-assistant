Q1: My interpretation of the guideline you quote is that the measurement process must have an uncertainty of $\pm$ 10%. Typically this is estimated by taking multiple measurements on the same unit. I don't think you can use your data set to show that you meet the guideline for continued spot checking. Q2: I don't see what you would gain from a smaller sample size. However, right now your biggest problem isn't the amount of data that you have, but the type of data. Q3: The interval computed by CONFIDENCE.NORM assumes you know the population standard deviation precisely. In this case, you only have an estimate of the population standard deviation, which means you'll be underestimating the uncertainty of your measurement process. You should use the CONFIDENCE.T function instead. Edit to respond to additional questions Q4. Please correct me if the following is incorrect: (Assuming the measurements listed above are from one sample unit (hypothetically, since I need to redo the measurements) ) a. I can use the STDEV.S as an input variable for the CONFIDENCE.T (calculated over all measurements) =STDEV.S(J5:J43) --> 0.249818828 Yes. The documentation for this function isn't particularly helpful, but as far as I can tell, CONFIDENCE.T computes the value $t_{1 - \alpha / 2, n-1} s / \sqrt{n}$ which would be half the width of the 95% (two-sided) confidence interval for the mean of your 39 measurements. b. Calculating the =CONFIDENCE.T(0.05,0.249818828,39) results in the confidence interval of 0.080981896. Meaning, I can say that with 95% confidence that the range is from (Average of samples - 0.080981896) AND (Average of samples + 0.080981896) I'd be careful with the word 'range'. The confidence interval you just calculated describes where we think the mean would lie if we kept taking additional measurements. It's quite possible that additional measurements would result in a mean outside of the confidence interval. c. the uncertainty of the measurement (assuming measurements are done on the same sample unit and same method) Will be u = =STDEV.S(J5:J43) / SQRT(39) --> 0.040003028 meaning 4% uncertainty of the measurement. This is the standard error of the mean of the measurements, which is one way to express the uncertainty. However, based on its wording, the guideline seems to imply that uncertainty should be expressed as the width of the 95% confidence interval of the mean (i.e. the result of Q4b).
