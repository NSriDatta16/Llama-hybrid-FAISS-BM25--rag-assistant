There are lots of open source applications that use Berkeley DB, Berkeley DB Java Edition and Berkeley DB XML. Remember, BDB and BDB JE are different products. BDB and BDB JE share the same Java API for the most part, but the storage mechanisms are different. BDB also has C, C++, C#, SQL, Perl, Python, PHP, Ruby and other APIs. The Wikipedia article has a good list. I've listed a few more. It's hard to know which open source projects use BDB since that's part of the nature of open source. You download it and you use it. Period. A short list of projects that use Berkeley DB include: Sendmail, Postfix, OpenLDAP, Redhat LDAP Directory, Apache Directory Services, Kerberos Network Authentication, OpenOffice, XEmacs, Hypergraphdb, JasperReports, A short list of projects that use Berkeley DB Java Edition include: Voldemort, The Internet Archive Wayback machine, Hajo ( http://sourceforge.net/projects/berkeleydbtools/ ). A short list of projects that use Berkeley DB XML include: XQilla, MapGuide ( http://mapguide.osgeo.org/ ), Eclipse.
