How to calculate 28 day mortality?

I have a retrospective EHR database from a hospital and I would like to build an ML model to predict whether a patient will die within 28 days or not (from discharge/some time point T) Can I check with you on the below steps? a) Let's say I have a sample of 5000 patients b) I choose training data as 3500 patients c) For these 3500 patients, I extract the required variables and their values till time "T" d) And now for training data, we need labels, So I calculate using a python script whether this person has died within 28 days from time "t" (because I have all their data. I can find the difference between his discharge date and death date) e) If yes, I will label it as "1" else "0" f) I build a supervised learning model using logistic regression Now comes the challenging part (for me atleast) g) I would like to apply this model on the unseen set of 1500 patients h) I extract the same variables as training data i) Now I apply the model to this unseen data of 1500 patients k) But the problem is this will only give whether the patient will die or not. How can I know whether he will die or not in the 28 days? How can I incorporate this time component here. Can somebody help me with this by providing easy to understand steps and which algorithm to use please?
