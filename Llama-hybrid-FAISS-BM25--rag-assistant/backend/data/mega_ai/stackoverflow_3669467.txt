You're both right. You can use VBA inside Excel and some form functionality to create a fully functional CRUD process with a UI inside of Excel, and you could persist that data to your workbook or to some other storage area (text, XML, Access, another DBMS). It would not be a full application , per se, as it is limited to running inside of the Excel app, but it would be something more than a simple macro of "do these pre-defined steps in order."
