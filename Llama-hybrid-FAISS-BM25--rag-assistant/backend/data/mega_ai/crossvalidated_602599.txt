How to report performance of a Deep Learning Model (RMSE, R2) when lots of variation

please bear with me because I'm a beginner. I have created an LSTM Model to solve a regression problem. The metrics that I am reporting are RMSE, MAE and R2. Unfortunately, my model might not be robust enough (also, not enough data), so everytime I run it after fine-tuning the hyperparameters, I get a different result. Sometimes the performance is good, sometimes it's really bad. My question is, how should I report this? Is it a good practice, to run it for example 10 times and report the average RMSE, MAE and R2? Thanks!
