The simple answer to your question is right in the abstract: These terms are a valid large-sample criterion beyond the Bayesian context, since they do not depend on the a priori distribution. Schwarz wants a result that does not depend on the prior distribution. Notice that he never assumes that the prior probabilities of each model $\alpha_j$ are equal, only that the conditional priors given that the $j^{\text{th}}$ model is true are locally bounded away from zero. Other people might routinely assume a uniform prior over models ( $\alpha_i = \alpha_j$ for all $i, j$ ) when using the BIC, but he does not. This means that Schwarz is dealing with with terms $\alpha_j$ in a different way entirely than those who assume a uniform prior over models, and he deals with those terms by considering only the limit as $n \to \infty$ . This yields the main result, that as $n \to \infty$ , we have: $$ \begin{align*} S(Y, n, j) & = nA - \frac{1}{2} k_j \log\left(\frac{\lambda}{\pi} n\right) + \log(\alpha_j) + R_0 \\ & = nA - \frac{1}{2} k_j \log(n) - \frac{1}{2} k_j \log\left(\frac{\lambda}{\pi}\right) + \log(\alpha_j) + R_0 \\ & = nA - \frac{1}{2} k_j \log(n) + R \end{align*} $$ where $R_0$ and $R$ are bounded with respect to $n$ . Essentially, because Schwarz wants a result that is true even if the prior is not assumed to be uniform over models, he has to derive an asymptotic result to eliminate the $\log(\alpha_j)$ term. But if you are only deriving an asymptotic result, you can throw away the $- \frac{1}{2} k_j \log\left(\frac{\lambda}{\pi}\right)$ term as well. He is not considering the case of finite $n$ at all. Schwarz does, however, make assumptions that imply $A$ is constant. Because $Y$ and $b$ are constant (main proposition states that $Y$ is fixed, and $b$ does not appear in the arguments of $S$ ), the supremum can be inferred to be over $\theta$ . Then $A = \sup_{\theta} Y \circ \theta - b(\theta)$ is constant. Thus Schwarz is not considering the case when $A$ would differ between models. Since the ultimate goal is model comparison, and the term $nA$ is the same for both models, it can be ignored. If you make different assumptions than Schwarz, such as assuming a finite $n$ , a uniform prior over models, and perhaps even that the $A$ 's could differ, then of course you would derive a different result. If your real question is why people use (or perhaps "abuse") the BIC for finite $n$ without the $\lambda/\pi$ term, I cannot answer, but I hope that Schwarz's original argument is clear.
