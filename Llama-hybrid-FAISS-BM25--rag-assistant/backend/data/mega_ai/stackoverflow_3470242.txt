As mentioned by others, the shell script raises problems. What does it do specifically to 'run the program'? For the configuration files - 'Folder 2', webstart provides the PersistenceService. I have a small demo. (1) As far as the Jars in 'Folder 3' go. Move them, as well as the Jar's in folders 2 & 1 to a single directory named 'lib'. The main Jar and the configuration files will be required eagerly, which is the default for JWS. If any of the other Jars (ex. '3') might not be needed immediately or at all, they should be deployed as download='lazy'. To access the local file system - for reading input supplied by the user or writing a new file they created - a JWS app. normally needs to be digitally signed and trusted. But JWS also provides the much more limited form of access through the FileContents object . For more details, see the demo. of the File Service in the page linked below. (1) 1) Demos of the JNLP API , including the PersistenceService & FileContents object.
