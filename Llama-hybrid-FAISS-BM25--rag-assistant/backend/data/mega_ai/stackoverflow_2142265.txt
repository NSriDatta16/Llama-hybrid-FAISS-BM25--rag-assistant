What is a good way to show a floating point number via SNMP?

I am coding an SNMP Agent. I need to send values that have a decimal point to an SNMP Manager. I have a couple options: Truncate the number. Multiply by a constant. Ask Stackoverflow. If I truncate the number I lose a lot of information that I need. If I multiply by a constant, then the manager will display strange units that the end-user would rather not see. (grams instead of kilograms). So, I'm doing option 3. What do I do?
