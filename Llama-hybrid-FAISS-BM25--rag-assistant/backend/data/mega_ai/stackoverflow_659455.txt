What are some good distributed queue managers in php?

I'm working an image processing website, instead of having lengthy jobs hold up the users browser I want all commands to return fast with a job id and have a background task do the actual work. The id could then be used to check for status and results (ie a url of the processed image). I've found a lot of distributed queue managers for ruby, java and python but I don't know nearly enough of any of those languages to be able to use them. My own tests have been with shared mysql database to queue jobs, lock them to a worker, and mark them as completed (saving the return data in the db). It was just a messy prototype, and the entire time I felt as if I was reinventing the wheel (and not very elegantly). Does something exist in php (or that I can talk to RESTfully?) that I could use? Reading around a bit more, I've found that what I'm looking for is a queuing system that has a php api, it doesn't have to be written in php. I've only found classes for use with Amazon's SQS, but not only is that not free, it's also quite latent sometimes (over a minute for a message to show up).
