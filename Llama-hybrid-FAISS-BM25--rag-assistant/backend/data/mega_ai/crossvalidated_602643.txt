Probability of two variables doing the same thing a certain percentage of times, when we know how often they each do something individually

EDIT: I've edited this question to include the probability stage of calculations. Thanks to Henry for getting me started. I'm exploring some simple time series correlation data. And I want to show that two variables are not entirely uncorrelated from each other. Stock A went up 1052 out of 1984 weeks (53.02% of the weeks) Stock B went up 1069 out of 1984 weeks (53.88% of the weeks) There are no weeks where either stock remains level, they always rise or fall The individual data points are all available, if this helps determine a best method. My question is: What is the probability that both stocks will move in the same direction (up or down) on at least 60.13% of the weeks (≈1193 weeks of the 1984)? The probabilities of each event (if I have calculated correctly) are: Probability of both up (0.5302 x 0.5388) = 0.2857 Probability of A up and B down (0.5302 x 0.4612) = 0.2445 Probability of both down (0.4698 x 0.4612) = 0.2167 Probability of B up and A down (0.4698 x 0.5388) = 0.2531 Total = 1 ✓ So, the probability they both go in the same direction (0.2857 + 0.2167) = 0.5024 I have looked at binomial calculations and normal approximations, and I understand that I can use these to find the likelihood of a single data point being a certain distance from the mean. But I can't figure out how I would use these to calculate The probability that both stocks will move in the same direction (up or down) on at least 60.13% of the weeks 2nd Edit: I've run a weighted random simulator in Excel with the probabilities calculated above and this shows there is almost no change of that 60.13% being random. But I would still like a tiny number to further support this. Thanks in advance.
