Deep Learning with Keras. Classification problem with large data

I have looked on the internet and found a lot of discussion about image classification problems, but almost none of just classification problems without images. I am trying to build a model with Keras using Python, I have a dataset of 827 features (43 are integers, and the rest is one-hot encoded) and 24,800 samples. My target is 3 classes one-hot encoded as well ( [1 0 0] [0 1 0] [0 0 1] ). I have found a lot of complex image recognition networks but only simple deep networks for non-image problems. I need help on how I can make the deep neural network architecture for my problem.
