Efficient method to check object for null member variables?

I have a data processor class which can only perform its primary function once all its member variables have been assigned a value: class { public $firstName; public $lastName; public $ssn; public $accessKey; public function __construct($data = null) { if (is_array($data)) { // Assign the value of any fields in $data to // the corresponding member var } } public processData() { // *** CHECK IF ALL PROPERTIES HAVE VALUES *** foreach ($this as $p=>$val) { if ($val === null) { return false; } } doStuff(); } } Is there a more efficient or elegant way to verify that all properties have a value? It feels kind of PHugly to do it this way.
