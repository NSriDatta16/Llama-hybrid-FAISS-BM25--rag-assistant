You could, possibly, merge & diff DXF files since they are text files but definitely not the DWG format - it is an encrypted binary. If you're looking simply for a time-capsule type of storage then @bluebrother's answer is correct. If you want diff reports then you will have to write a custom app or use a DWG comparison program. There are a few out there like DWG compare , http://www.wirecad.com/50/diff.htm . Google and browse. If you know much about AutoCAD's object model then you will know how complex such an app will be. Shopping is a much easier option. If you're thinking 3-way merge then I'm thinking forget it. Locking a file on checkout to 1 Cadder will make your life a lot less difficult.
