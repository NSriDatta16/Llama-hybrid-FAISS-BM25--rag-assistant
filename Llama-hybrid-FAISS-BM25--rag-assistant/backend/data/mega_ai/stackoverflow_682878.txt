Call StackInit(). That function reinitializes all the sub-modules (TCP, UDP, SMTP, etc.). It will also clobber all of the TCP and UDP socket you have open, so you will have to re-open the sockets you want to use. As a side note: I followed the thread on the Microchip forum. I was also getting strange resets in my TCP stack. It ended up being a stack overflow. Put some variables at the top of your stack. #pragma udata stackoverflow = 0xE00 UInt32 StackUpperBound[8]; #pragma udata Initialize these variables at the beginning of main() and put a breakpoint at the beginning. See if these variables are being overwritten.
