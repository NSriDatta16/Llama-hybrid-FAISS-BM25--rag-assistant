#pragma are instructions to the compiler. you can set something before the #include and disable it after. You can also do it at the command line . Another GCC page specifically on disabling warnings . I would go for the option of using #pragma's within the source code, and then providing a sound reason (as a comment) of why you are disabling the warnings. This would mean reasoning about the headers files. GCC approaches this by classifying the warning types. You can classify them to be warnings or to be ignored. The previously linked articles will show you which warnings are may be disabled. Note: you can also massage the source code to prevent certain warnings by using attributes ; however, this bind you quite closely to GCC. Note2: GCC also uses the pop/push interface as used in microsoft's compiler -- Microsoft disables warnings through this interface. I suggest you investigate this further , as I do not know if it is even possible.
