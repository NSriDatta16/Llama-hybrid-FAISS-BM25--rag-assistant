If you have bi-directional arrows it's not a DAG (i.e. not a Directed Acyclic Graph), full stop. The 'acyclic' means there are no loops in the causal model. This is because in a DAG (see, e.g., Hernán and Robins, 2020; Pearl, 2000, etc.): A uni-directed arrow means "the variable at the arrow's tail directly causes the variable at the arrow's head." A lack of an arrow between two variables means "no direct cause". Unidirected arrows also define temporal ordering , as in "the variable at the arrow's tail occurred before the variable at the arrow's head occurred." That said, there are other causal graph formalisms, including ones involving digraphs (i.e. arrows which go both directions). One such formalism is Levins' "loop analysis" (Levins, 1974, Puccia & Levins, 1986, etc.) which uses signed digraphs (i.e. two variables may be connected by no arrow, a uni-directional arrow, or a bi-directional arrow, and arrowheads have signs) to model causal systems defined by every variable being a direct or indirect cause of every variable in the system at future times, and where the sign indicates "direct causal increase" (positively signed arrowheads) or "direct causal decrease" (negatively signed arrowheads). Also temporal ordering does not exist between variables, unlike in a DAG. Rather, this signed digraph formalism "looks head-on at the arrow of time" so that all times during which the causal system exists with the specified relationships are represented.
