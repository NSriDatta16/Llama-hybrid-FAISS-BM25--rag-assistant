I am afraid the body of your question is unrelated to title question. If to answer the title: In SQL, is UPDATE always faster than DELETE+INSERT? then answer is NO! Just google for "Expensive direct update"* "sql server" "deferred update"* "sql server" Such update(s) result in more costly (more processing) realization of update through insert+update than direct insert+update. These are the cases when one updates the field with unique (or primary) key or when the new data does not fit (is bigger) in the pre-update row space allocated (or even maximum row size),resulting in fragmentation, etc. My fast (non-exhaustive) search, not pretending to be covering one, gave me [1], [2] [1] Update Operations (SybaseÂ® SQL Server Performance and Tuning Guide Chapter 7: The SQL Server Query Optimizer) http://www.lcard.ru/~nail/sybase/perf/11500.htm [2] UPDATE Statements May be Replicated as DELETE/INSERT Pairs http://support.microsoft.com/kb/238254
