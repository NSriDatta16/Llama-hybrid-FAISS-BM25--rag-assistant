rey Dean Morgan appeared in supporting roles. Currey and Gardner were offered the option of using stunt doubles but chose to perform their own stunts throughout filming. Filming Principal photography took place in the Shadow Mountains of the Mojave Desert in California. The fictional B67 TV tower in the film was modeled after the real-life KXTV/KOVR tower in Walnut Grove, California, one of the tallest structures in the world at 2,049 feet (625 m). The film was shot in IMAX format to emphasize its vertical scale and enhance the tension of high-altitude scenes. To create the illusion of extreme height, the upper sections of the tower were constructed atop a mountain, allowing the actors to be filmed at real elevations of up to 100 feet above ground level. The filmmakers deliberately avoided the use of green screens or digital sets to preserve visual authenticity. Filming was frequently delayed due to weather challenges such as lightning and strong winds. The film was produced on a budget of approximately $3 million. Post-production After production concluded, Fall was acquired by Lionsgate Films for distribution, without a minimum guarantee. Following positive test screenings, the studio opted for a wide theatrical release. In order to obtain a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association, Lionsgate requested that over 30 instances of the word "fuck" be replaced or removed to avoid an R rating. Rather than reshoot scenes, the filmmakers used deepfake technology provided by Flawless, a company co-founded by Mann and Nick Lynes. This "neural reshoot" process digitally altered the actors' lip movements and dubbed milder language, such as "freaking," into the original footage. The changes were completed in two weeks. Flawless's technology was also used to facilitate foreign-language dubbing for international releases, including Spanish and Japanese markets. Release Fall was released theatrically in the United States on August 12, 2022, by Lionsgate, which reportedly spent $4 million on its release and promotion. The film became available digitally on September 27, 2022, and was subsequently released on Blu-ray and DVD on October 18, 2022. Reception Box office Fall grossed $7.2 million in the United States and Canada, and $14.6 million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $21.8 million, against a production budget of $3 million. In the United States and Canada, the film was released alongside Mack & Rita and the wide expansion of Bodies Bodies Bodies, and was projected to earn $1â€“2 million from 1,548 theaters during its opening weekend. It earned $923,000 on its first day and went on to debut with $2.5 million, finishing tenth at the box office but ranking as the highest-grossing new release of the week.
