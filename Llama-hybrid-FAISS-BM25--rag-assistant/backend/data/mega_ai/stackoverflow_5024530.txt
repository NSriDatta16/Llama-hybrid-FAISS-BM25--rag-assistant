As per @Anton's answer, the database upgrades are applied by the PHP code in the Magento modules themselves. If you look in any of the code modules (say DOCROOT\app\code\core\Mage\Catalog\ for example), you will see a folder called sql\modulename_setup which contains numerous files that perform the database upgrades relevant to their module version. Note that the module version (specified in the etc/config.xml for that module) will not always match the overall Magento version, though for some of the major modules such as Mage_Catalog, they are fairly close. When you upload the new code onto your webserver's filesystem, the next time that you load any Magento page, the system will check the current database version number using the core_resource table in mysql. If it is less than the version listed in that module's config.xml , then Magento will apply the files in the sql\modulename_setup folder in sequence to bring the data_version up to match the module's version . The files under the sql folder often contain both DDL and DML statements, and may be responsible for changing table structure, keys, relationships and inserting fixture data. So, the short answer to your question "How do you update" is to let Magento do the update for you. Trying to manually recreate all those queries would be a recipe for disaster, particularly given the interdependencies between modules. One important note - make sure you backup your database before upgrading!!!
