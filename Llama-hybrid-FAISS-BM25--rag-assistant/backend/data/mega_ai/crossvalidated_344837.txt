$R^2$ of a regression predicting noise

If you estimate a multiple regression with p predictors $$y = c_0 + c_1\cdot x_1 + c_2\cdot x_2 + \ldots + c_p\cdot x_p + e$$ from $n$ observations, and if the predictors and response have a multivariate normal distribution with zero correlation, what will the $R^2$ of the regression be on average, as a function of $n$ and $p$ ? For $n >> p$ I think the $R^2$ should approach zero, but I want to know how quickly this occurs.
