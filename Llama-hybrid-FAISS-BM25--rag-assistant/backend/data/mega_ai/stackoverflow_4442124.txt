The pat answer is that embedding the onClick call in the input element goes against the unobtrusive javascript concept. However, I'm the kind of developer that'll go ahead and use it anyway if it gets the jorb done and the audience is not likely to have javascript disabled. If I'm understanding the problem correctly, you need a way to do things jQuery-style without relying on html structure and such. Give your radio buttons a class name, for example, the "Male" radio button can have class="Male", and you can select it via jQuery easier. Bonus: There are some instances where you may need to assign some element more than one class, for example, you are filtering by language and by country. So you can assign some element multiple classes like this: $('#someElement').addClass('French').addClass('fr-FR'); And select it using either class later.
