Following additional information, I would suggest looking at avg. rank of a variable across datasets. For ex: Lets say we have a binary target variable, Like_or_not_like which is : 1 if the user liked the drink and 0 if the user didn't like the drink Now, we have captured the following variables for a set of wines, beer & whiskies in three datasets respectively and would like to understand how variable importance changes by the type of drink: pH_level Sugar_Content Alcohol_Percentage Average_Density You can get relative ranking for each variable in each dataset as output by each algorithm applied. Then, you can simply avg. out the ranks to get a finally tally like the following: NOTE: Lower the rank number, higher the importance.
