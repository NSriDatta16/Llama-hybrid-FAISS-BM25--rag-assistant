How to delegate a method call to another thread?

I have the following problem: Multithreaded WPF application, Model View Presenter Implementation. Presenters and Views that belong together are created on a separate thread and get a separate Dispatcher. Now someone calls from another thread a method on the Presenter. I am intercepting the call, and now begins the problem: if the call comes from the same thread as the presenter, i want to proceed with the call, else invoke the call on the Dispatcherthread, so that i don't need to care about UI calls. I have already read about the use of SynchronizationContext, but that doesnt seem to work for me because if the calling thread is no UI thread i can't compare the 2 contexts. Whats a possible, working and elegant solution ?
