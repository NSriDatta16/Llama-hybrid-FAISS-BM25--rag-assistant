Why does Module::Build's testcover gives me "use of uninitialized value" warnings?

I'm kinda new to Module::Build, so maybe I did something wrong. Am I the only one who gets warnings when I change my dispatch from "test" to "testcover"? Is there a bug in Devel::Cover? Is there a bug in Module::Build? I probably just did something wrong. I'm using ActiveState Perl v5.10.0 with Module::Build version 0.31012 and Devel::Cover 0.64 and Eclipse 3.4.1 with EPIC 0.6.34 for my IDE. UPDATE: I upgraded to Module::Build 0.34 and the warnings are still output. UPDATE: Looks like a bug in B::Deparse. Hope it gets fixed someday. Here's my unit test build file: use strict; use warnings; use Module::Build; my $build = Module::Build->resume ( properties => { config_dir => '_build', }, ); $build->dispatch('test'); When I run this unit test build file, I get the following output: t\MyLib1.......ok t\MyLib2.......ok t\MyLib3.......ok All tests successful. Files=3, Tests=24, 0 wallclock secs ( 0.00 cusr + 0.00 csys = 0.00 CPU) But when I change the dispatch line to 'testcover' I get the following output which always includes a bunch of "use of uninitialized value in bitwise and" warning messages: Deleting database D:/Documents and Settings/ /My Documents/ /cover_db t\MyLib1.......ok Use of uninitialized value in bitwise and (&) at D:/Perl/lib/B/Deparse.pm line 4252.
