Parameter passing to a call template in xsl

Greetings, I'm a bit new to XSL and had a question regarding call-templates and parameters. Assume I have the following xml: 1 2 3 (etc.) 4 9 2 (etc.) etc... I am writing a call-template that will display a row () in a multirow html table. Each row needs to record the name, average, min, max, etc. of each field of the entire record set. so I would like to call The call template will need to iterate through all the records to find avg, min, max, etc so I'm not sure what to pass in as the call parameter. I was hoping to be able to pass in the field name (a, b, c, etc) and have it work that way but am unable to get my code to compile when I do. For instance, to find the max value of field 'a' I would do something like: etc. For Avg I would do (skipping NaN): etc. I also need to print out the literal name (e.g. 'a') in the row. TIA
