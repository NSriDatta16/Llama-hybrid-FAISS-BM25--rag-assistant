How can unsupervised learning be performed by connectionist (neural network) algorithms?

Connectionist models of the mind (a subclass of which are neural networks) can be used to model a number of different behaviors, including language acquisition. They consist of a number of different nodes that interact via weighted connections that can be adjusted through by the system through different ways, the most common being backpropagation of error. (Definition from https://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Psycholinguistics/Connectionist_Models ) How can unsupervised learning be performed by connectionist algorithms? Can we possibly implement clustering by connectionist models?
