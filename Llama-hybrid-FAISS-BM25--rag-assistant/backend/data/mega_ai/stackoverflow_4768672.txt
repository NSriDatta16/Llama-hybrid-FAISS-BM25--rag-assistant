one word recaptcha?

hello i see facebook is using recaptcha, but somehow in their register page, they can show one word of captcha instead of two, and then i notice that repcatcha validate only the first word, and the second word acts as a dummy, the question is can we somehow tell the recaptcha to just show one word ? rather then two ?
