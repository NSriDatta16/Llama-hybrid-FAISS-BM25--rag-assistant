I have not worked with multimodal ML, but from my experience I would try two different approaches to your problem: Feed a machine learning algorithm with all the data, prior to data normalize the inputs , your algorithm, e.g. a SVM, should be able to learn the relations between different sources. Make one ML algorithm for each signal source, and combine the outputs of these algorithms in a new one, however this a bit more tedious a error prone.
