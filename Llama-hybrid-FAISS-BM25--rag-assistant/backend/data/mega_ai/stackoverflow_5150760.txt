How to get proper permission on facebook to request user email?

here is an example with proper permissions. if I open it in browser I can get access to images and email. https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize? type=user_agent& client_id=116122545078207& redirect_uri=http%3A%2F%2Fbenbiddington.wordpress.com& scope=user_photos,email,user_birthday,user_online_presence But when I execute the same url but with my client_id I don't get image, email just birthday information What is the difference between? How can I get proper permissions to prompt user to provide image and email?
