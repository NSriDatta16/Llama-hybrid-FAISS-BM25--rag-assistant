Why I get Access denied when try to read file from ProgramFiles/MyApp?

I am trying to read from a config file in ProgramFiles/MyApp but in Windows 7 it throws an exception for Access denied, it is the same and for a file in ProgrammData/MyApp: fileStream = new FileStream(this.StorageName, FileMode.Open, FileAccess.Read); Is not it allowed to read only from these folders?
