If you know in advance that all your numbers are going to be 'big' (in the sense of 'much nearer long.MaxValue than zero), you can calculate the average of their distance from long.MaxValue , then the average of the numbers is long.MaxValue less that. However, this approach will fail if (m)any of the numbers are far from long.MaxValue , so it's horses for courses...
