OneClassSVM performs better when trained on pure data (inliers only)

I have a dataset which has some outliers and majority of the class is inliers (not anomalous). I am trying to train a OneClassSVM / IsolationForest model to identify the outliers. If I train using all data and then generate the predictions on the same data, my performance is not as good as compared to the case when I train on only the inliers and then predict on all data. What is the right approach to train the model in this case? I have labels on whether an observation is outlier or not. But the labels are noisy (not perfect). I am evaluating the performance using roc auc score.
