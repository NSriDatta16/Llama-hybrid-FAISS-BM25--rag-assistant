The following temporary storage locations are available: Session. This follows a user around and uses a cookie. It can be configured to use a URL param to retrieve. Session can also be configured to be stored in process(inproc) on the web server, in SQL Server, or in a state server. InProc can store any data type, but the others require the type to be serializable. Cache. Data stored in Cache is available to be used by any user in an session. It works similar to session, as the objects are retrievable via a key. One of the nicer features of cache is that you can control how long things are stored, and you can consume event when they expire. You can store anything here, but you may run into issues with using it in a webfarm. HttpContext. This is scoped to the current request. Remember, requests can be webservice calls, calls to get webpages to get HTML, or calls to a service that returns images. Anything can be stored here. ViewState. View state is scoped to a page. Must be serializable. You may want to examine cache. If you're using a webfarm, it won't work, but you could use a GUID of some sort as the key that you map back to a session.
