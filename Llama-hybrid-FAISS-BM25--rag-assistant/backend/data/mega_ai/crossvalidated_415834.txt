Multilevel Negative Binomial fails with MLE

I have a pretty complex multilevel neg. binomial regression that does not converge when using a regular MLE (but from what I understand, when dealing with multilevel models, MLE is not regular , per se). The model nevertheless converges just fine when using Bayesian estimation, specifically Stan no u-turn sampling. I am curious as to why that's the case? Is it some function of the data (extreme difficulty in finding the global maximum)? Any explanation or literature suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks.
