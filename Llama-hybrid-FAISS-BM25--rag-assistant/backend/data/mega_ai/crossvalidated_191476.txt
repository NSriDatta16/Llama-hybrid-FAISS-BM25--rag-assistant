I am still sketchy on what you want but guess that you are over-thinking this, as the similarity of skewness calculation to your problem is less than it seems. Kurtosis seems even less relevant. Given brightness along a line -- in practice measured as positive integers, but my argument applies to any non-negative measure -- you (seem to) want to quantify how far values are high on the left compared with the right, and vice versa. Keeping for simplicity to your positions 1 to 6, and using your toy examples (small detail: one is for 7 values, not 6) it seems to me that weighted mean position will do what you want. The weights are brightness measures; what is being averaged is the position. For example, (20, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0) at positions 1 to 6 will return a mean of 1 and flipping it round will return a mean of 6. A constant brightness will return a mean of 3.5. Rather than working through trivial calculations, let's just show how the weighted mean positions work out. Here the bars show brightness; the small gap between bars is just cosmetic and could just be removed if anyone insists fairly that pixels are to be considered as touching. The spikes show the means. For a more general situation, scaling by 2 $\times$ (weighted mean position $-$ mean position) / (length of line $-$ 1) will produce a measure from $-$1 (high values at extreme left) through 0 to 1 (high values at extreme right). Simple variations on such a theme are naturally possible. In particular, its absolute value quantifies departure from the centre regardless of left or right. Similarly, other weighted moment measures may be useful. EDIT: Factor of 2 introduced into displayed equation.
