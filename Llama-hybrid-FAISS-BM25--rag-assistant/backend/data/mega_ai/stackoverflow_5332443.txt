Setting background for basic android app

I am currently working on a basic app using eclipse as my IDE. I am currently having trouble setting an image as my background. I was following a tutoral which told me to place my image in the drawable-mdpi folder and name it as icon. I have tried this but it keeps on placing in the andriod icon instead even when i delete the andriod icon image. Is there a better way of doing this? Thanks
