Converting XML format

We have an issue where we have an XML feed leaving our system and a client needs to be able to import this feed into their system but they require the XML file to be in a different format. For a number of reasons its not possible for either of us to alter our format. I was thinking then that it would make sense for us to build some kind of bridge, that imports our format and exports it in theirs. Obviously this is pretty simple when we know the formats in each position. What I would like to do though is build something more generic and less specific to that client so this bridge could be used by a number of people should they need it. What should I be looking at to achieve this? There are a number of methods I can think of such as template documents containing placeholder elements and some form of mapping data (in XML or in a DB) but it seems to me there should be a more elegant solution - maybe like the PHP XSL extension . We work predominantly in PHP so a PHP-based solution would be ideal but i'd be happy to consider anything that would work on a Linux box.
