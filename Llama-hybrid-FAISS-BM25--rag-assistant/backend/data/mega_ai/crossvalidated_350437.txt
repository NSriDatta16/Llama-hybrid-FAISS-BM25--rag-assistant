You probably want to use the log of the ratios of the variances. See Nakagawa, S., Poulin, R., Mengersen, K., Reinhold, K., Engqvist, L., Lagisz, M., & Senior, A. M. (2015). Meta-analysis of variation: Ecological and evolutionary applications and beyond. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 6, 143â€“152.
