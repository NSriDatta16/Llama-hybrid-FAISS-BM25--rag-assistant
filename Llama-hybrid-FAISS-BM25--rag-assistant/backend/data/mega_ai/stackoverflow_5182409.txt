SQL Query refusing to pay attention to order clause

I am building a site that lists millions of directories and trying to build a proper search engine for the front end users. I am using the following code currently: (SELECT * FROM directories WHERE title LIKE '%directory%' AND title LIKE '%submit%' AND nofollow='0' AND pr_page >= '2' ORDER BY pr_page DESC) UNION (SELECT * FROM directories WHERE title LIKE '%directory%' OR title LIKE '%submit%' AND nofollow='0' AND pr_page >= '2' ORDER BY pr_page DESC) The main problem is the ordering, it does not seem to even pay any attention to the order clauses at all.
