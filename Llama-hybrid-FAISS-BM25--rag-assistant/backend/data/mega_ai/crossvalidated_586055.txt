Can you use power analysis to find if the null hypothesis is true rather than not?

So in power analysis I have only ever seen it explained like in this statquest video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VX_M3tIyiYk Where you have two distributions and you're trying to see if they are really unique or if they come from the same underlying distribution. Can power analysis be used to change this situation round a little - say all you have is one distribution, can you find the probability that it is not actually a different distribution, just with samples that happen to be concentrated to (for example) the right of the actual distribution? I.e. imagine you make a drug to get rid of flu faster. You have a drug but no, you give group A the drug but don't do a placebo group. You plot the distribution for how quickly group A got better. Now you get a second group (group B) and give them all the same pill, but you don't know if that pill was the drug or a placebo (but everyone got the same pill!). You then plot a distribution of how long it took them to get better and the distribution looks like the distribution of group A but very slightly different, that pill could have been the placebo one right, just everyone in group C happened to get better a bit faster than average and thus the distribution looks like the one which took the drug. Is there anyway to quantify how different the distribution of group B would need to be for us to confidently say that the group did not take the drug but instead were given a placebo? And also to quantify how confident we are. To be more clear, imagine the distribution of group B came out as very similar to group A, it's highly likely they took the drug but they could still have taken the placebo and all happened to get better fast. On the other hand the distribution comes out totally different to group A, it's highly unlikely the group took the drug but they still could have and all just taken ages to get better despite the drug being effective. Assume group A was huge thus the distribution is very well known, however the size of group B will likely be a parameter of how confidently we will be able to say if the distribution is the same or not. Please leave a comment if any of this isn't clear and I'll try clarify!
