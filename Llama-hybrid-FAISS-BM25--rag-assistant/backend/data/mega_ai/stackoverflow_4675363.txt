It's a bit of overkill, but you could use table paritioning to do this, as each partition can be mapped to a distinct file group. Some caveats: Table partitioning is only available in Enterprise (and developer) edition Like clustered indexes, you only get one, so be sure that this is how you'd want to partition your tables I'm not sure how well this would play out against "selective backups" or, much more importantly, partial restores. You'd want to test a lot of oddball recovery scenarios before going to Production with this An older-fashioned way to do it would be to set up partitioned views. This gives you two tables, true, but the partitioned view "structure" is pretty solid and fairly elegant, and you wouldn't have to worry about having your data split across multiple backup files.
