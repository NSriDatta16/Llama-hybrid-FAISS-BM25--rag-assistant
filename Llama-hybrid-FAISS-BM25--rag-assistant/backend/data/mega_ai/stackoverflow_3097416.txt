Mac Vim: How can I change the default text color to be green? Default font? Macvim manual?

I have installed MacVim but I cannot figure out how to do some formatting things. The screen shot below shows: the file class1.jak (custom file type I have defined) open in both macvim and vim the left one is macvim the right one is the terminal Here is what I would like to do: The default color of my terminal is green. I would like the default text color to be green for mac vim as well. The font is strange in macvim. How can I change that. I think that both of these are very basic macvim questions but I could not find a really good mac vim reference. I read the :help macvim but I didn't find it that helpful. What should I read to understand macvim formatting and features better? Is there a tutorial somewhere? I feel pretty happy with my vim skills in general but this is the first gvim I have used. http://torch.cs.dal.ca/~summers/Picture%205.png This is my .gvimrc : set background=dark set go-=T This is the color scheme for .jak files located in ( ~/.vim/syntax/jak.vim ): 16 "=============== 17 " Titles 18 "=============== 19 20 syn region JakeSubSubtitle start=+= + end=+ =\n+ oneline 21 highlight JakeSubSubtitle ctermfg=cyan guifg=cyan 22 23 syn region JakeSubtitle start=+== + end=+==+ oneline 24 highlight JakeSubtitle ctermbg=black ctermfg=DarkMagenta guifg=DarkMagenta 25 26 syn region JakeTitle start=+=== + end=+===+ oneline 27 highlight JakeTitle ctermbg=black ctermfg=Yellow guifg=yellow 28 29 syn region JakeMasterTitle start=+==== + end=+====+ oneline 30 highlight JakeMasterTitle cterm=bold term=bold ctermbg=black ctermfg=LightBlue guifg=LightBlue 31 32 "=============== 33 " Keywords 34 "=============== 35 36 syn keyword JakeKeywords AssQuestion Question TODO Answer JAKEHTTPS PossibleProblem Note done LowPrio 37 highlight JakeKeywords cterm=bold term=bold ctermbg=black ctermfg=blue guifg=blue 38 39 syn keyword JakeRedKeywords Priority HighPriority containedin=ALL 40 highlight JakeRedKeywords cterm=bold term=bold ctermbg=black ctermfg=Red 41 42 syn keyword JakeLongTermKeywords ReturnTo Ask containedin=all 43 highlight JakeLongTermKeywords ctermfg=lightGreen
