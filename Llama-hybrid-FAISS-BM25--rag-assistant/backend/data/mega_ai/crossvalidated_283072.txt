TBATS Analysis done- how can I use the results to forecast?

This is a follow up to my question here . I've spent some time refining my data at work, and after deciding to go with the TBATS model, I'd like to generate a forecast value. Here's my code so far: > library(forecast) > tbats_model = tbats(=v01$Units, seasonal.periods = 12) > tbats_model TBATS(1, {0,0}, 0.876, { }) Call: tbats(y = v01$Units, seasonal.periods = 12) Parameters Alpha: 0.2368047 Beta: -0.03752523 Damping Parameter: 0.87555 Gamma-1 Values: -2.291151e-05 Gamma-2 Values: 0.0001845991 Seed States: [,1] [1,] 7.62233435 [2,] 0.13206172 [3,] -0.25982157 [4,] -0.09500239 [5,] -0.11444555 [6,] -0.10093089 [7,] 0.01024328 [8,] -0.04703836 [9,] -0.03714637 [10,] -0.08204049 Sigma: 0.2195671 AIC: 57.93646 Now that I have this output, I'd like to actually forecast the next month (each point in my time series corresponds to a month, so I assume that each subsequent point also corresponds to a month). Here's where my question arises: when I execute the following, > forecast(tbats_model, h = 1) Point Forecast Lo 80 Hi 80 Lo 95 Hi 95 Jun 4 8.855421 8.574035 9.136808 8.425078 9.285765 I become a little puzzled- why is the forecast for June 4th? Shouldn't it be for June 2017? Did I ask for the prediction correctly? If anyone needs example data, you can click here.
