Magento has built-in support for sending data about Google Checkout process to Google Analytics. Implementation of this functionality is done according to http://code.google.com/intl/ru/apis/checkout/developer/checkout_analytics_integration.html You should see all the data (e.g. pages visited) and conversions from GC normally. The customer is not required to return to your shop. Step1: no GC conversions in GA Allow up to 24h delay before the conversion data will appear in GA. Step 2: After 24h you still don't see GC conversions in GA Make sure you've enabled Google Analytics in Magento and setup it properly, because GC module in Magento sends data to GA only if it's activated and working fine. Step 3: If steps 1-2 are done, everything works and GA is activated, but GC conversions still not visible in GA Make sure that your design theme includes all necessary GC & GA code as made in base/default scheme. You can temporarily enable default/modern theme to check that original core Magento code works fine and then check the differences between your design theme and Magento core theme Step 4: you've done steps 1-2-3, but no conversions are present in GA Hire a Magento professional to find the source of a problem. In such a case this problem cannot be solved remotely.
