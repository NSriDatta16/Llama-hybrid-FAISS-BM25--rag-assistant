IE 8 doesn't scroll to fragment on initial page load

I'm having a problem with IE where it doesn't scroll to a fragment ( #foo on the URL) when the page loads. The anchor for the fragment is part of the base HTML, it isn't dynamic or anything. The page is pretty heavy. If I go into the location bar and hit enter, it scrolls to the anchor as expected (and as observed in other browsers). Behavior is observed on IE 7 and IE 8. Anybody run into this and have a workaround?
