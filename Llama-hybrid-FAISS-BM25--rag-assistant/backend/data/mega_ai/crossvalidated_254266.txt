There are good answers here from @sean501 and @kjetilbhalvorsen. You asked for an example. Consider the figure below. You might come across some situation in which the data generating process is like that depicted in panel A . If so, it is quite possible that the data you actually gather look like those in panel B . Now, when you use data to build a statistical model, the idea is to recover the true data generating process or at least come up with an approximation that is reasonably close. Thus, the question is, will fitting a logistic regression to the data in B yield a model that approximates the blue line in A ? If you look at panel C , you can see that the gray line better approximates the data than the true function does, so in seeking the best fit, the logistic regression will 'prefer' to return the gray line rather than the blue one. It doesn't stop there, however. Looking at panel D , the black line approximates the data better than the gray oneâ€”in fact, it is the best fit that could possibly occur. So that is the line the logistic regression model is pursuing. It corresponds to an intercept of negative infinity and a slope of infinity. That is, of course, very far from the truth that you are hoping to recover. Complete separation can also cause problems with the calculation of the p-values for your variables that come standard with logistic regression output (the explanation there is slightly different and more complicated). Moreover, trying to combine the fit here with other attempts, for example with a meta-analysis, will just make the other findings less accurate.
