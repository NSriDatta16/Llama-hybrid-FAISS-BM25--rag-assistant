Ordinal logistic regression to find support for inverse proportionality of a continuous predictor on an ordinal dependent variable

I want find statistical support that dependence is inversely proportional to power. To do so, I have ~260 cases, with four questions about dependence, and one question about power The questions about dependence are on a continuous scale, whereas the question about power only allows three ordered answers (I am powerful, equilibrium, the other one is powerful). To support the inverse proportionality of power and dependence (in this application), is the right way to do a ordinal logistic regression? I have plotted grouped error bars for the data ( error.bars.by() ) and they show the case I want to prove quite clearly; however I suppose I need the right figures on top of that as well. Thanks for any suggestions and advice. I had a look at some threads on Cross validated ( 1 , 2 , 3 ) about similar questions, and as far as I understand there is not a clear answer to how the above described mutual inverse correlation/proportionality could be tested. Correct me if I'm wrong. Thanks for answers and comments so far. As far as I understand ordinal logistic regression helps me to find support for a relation of power with dependence, if I use dependence as predictor and power as dependent variable.
