http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javascript Blatantly ripping them off... JavaScript is an implementation of the ECMAScript language standard and is typically used to enable programmatic access to computational objects within a host environment. It can be characterized as a prototype-based object-oriented scripting language that is dynamic, weakly typed and has first-class functions. It is also considered a functional programming language like Scheme and OCaml because it has closures and supports higher-order functions. JavaScript is primarily used in the form of client-side JavaScript, implemented as part of a web browser in order to provide enhanced user interfaces and dynamic websites. However, its use in applications outside web pages is also significant. It should also be noted: there is no "main motto in JavaScript" as it's a standard, not a project. For projects, check out jQuery as being the one most frequently adopted by developers on this site. There are a great many toolkits for working with JavaScript. The main consideration when working with JavaScript is to understand that it is usually used hand-in-hand with the Document Object Model and so therefore this is where you will find most people offering ways to use JavaScript. However, it is a fully functional language, and there are ways to compile it to native machine code. An example of how this is possible is by noting that most browsers implement a just-in-time compiler for JavaScript. These JIT compilers convert the JavaScript to native bytecode for execution on the host system. Why would you use JavaScript? You could use it for such purposes as client-side validation of form elements (one of the most common), user interaction (drag and drop in a browser window, insert new form elements like textboxes for adding new records to a table), user notification (Facebook notifications), asynchronously retrieving data from a server and loading it into the page (AJAX), or a long list of other possible operations. To list every feature of what JavaScript could be used for here would be a heroic effort. Since it is a prototype language, one can write C style programs in JavaScript. Since it is a functional language, one can write Lisp style programs in JavaScript. If you've had any formal training in Computer Science then those two languages may be familiar to you. The majority of computer programs are written in either of those two styles. Since JavaScript allows a developer to write in the style with which he is the most fluent, this can be shown to be a boon as the developer is able to start writing code faster on introduction to the language. I have seen full fledged games replete with complicated graphics written in JavaScript. I have also seen rudimentary video players (relying on HTML5) with some basic manipulation functionality written in JavaScript. However, JavaScript being most often used in web applications, it's important to remember that JavaScript is used as a client-side language. It does not affect operations on the server. It can be bypassed . Do not rely on JavaScript to do EVERYTHING for your application. Hopefully this helps and gives you some guidance and answers your question?
