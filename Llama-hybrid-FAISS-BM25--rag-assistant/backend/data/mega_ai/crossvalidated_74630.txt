Inclusion/exclusion of variates (step 3): I understand that you ask which of the original measurement channels to include into the modeling. Is such a decision sensible for your data? E.g. I work mainly with spectroscopic data, for which PLS is frequently and successfully used. Well measured spectra have a high correlation betweeen neighbour variates and the relevant information in spectroscopic data sets tends to be spread out over many variates. PLS is well suited for such data, but deciding on a variate-to-variate basis which variates to use for the model IMHO is usually not appropriate (decisions about inclusion/exclusion of spectral ranges based on spectroscopic knowledge about the application is IMHO a far better approach). If for your data and application variable selection is a natural choice, is PLS the regularization technique you want? You may want to read the sections about regularization (3.4 - 3.6) in the Elements of Statistical Learning where PLS as a regularization is compared to other regularization approaches. My point here is that in contrast to e.g. the Lasso, PLS is a regularization technique that does not tend to completely exclude variables from the model. I'd thus say that PLS is probably more suitable for data where this behaviour is sensible, but in that case variable selection is not a natural choice (e.g. spectroscopic data). Does your data contain enough information for such a data-driven model optimization? Doing a t-test for each input variable is a massive multiple testing situation. IMHO the main point of PLS (or other regularization techniques) is to avoid the need for such a variable selection. Remark to Step 2: If you build a linear regression model in PCA score space, that is usually called principal component regression (PCR) in chemometrics. It is not the same as a PLS model. How to find out which variates are used by the PCA/PLS model? There are several ways to approach this question. Obviously, variates where the PCA loadings or PLS weights are 0 do not enter the model. Whether it is sufficient to look at the loadings or whether you need to go a step further depends on your data: if the data set is not standardized you may want to calculate how much each variate "contributes" to the respective PCA/PLS score. Literature where we did that with LDA (works just the same way): C. Beleites, K. Geiger, M. Kirsch, S. B. Sobottka, G. Schackert and R. Salzer: Raman spectroscopic grading of astrocytoma tissues: using soft reference information, Anal. Bioanal. Chem., 400 (2011), 2801 - 2816. The linked page has both links to the official web page and my manuscript. You can also derive e.g. bootstrap distributions of the loadings (or the contributions) and have a look at them. For PCR and PLS coefficients that is straightforward, as the Y variable automatically "aligns" the coefficients. PCA and PLS scores need some more care, as e.g. flipping of the directions needs to be taken into account, and you may decide to treat models as equivalent where the scores which are then used for further modeling are just rotated or scaled versions of each other. Thus, you may want to align the scores first e.g. by Procrustes analysis. The paper linked above also discusses this (for LDA, but again, the ideas apply to the other bilinear models as well). Last but not least, you need to be careful not to overinterprete the models, and you can have situations where important variates have coefficients frequently touching the zero mark in the bootstrap experiments if you have correlation between variates. However, ehat you can or cannot conclude will depend on your type of data, though.
