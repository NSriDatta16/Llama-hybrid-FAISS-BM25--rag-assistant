As far as I know there aren't many options. Libraries for time series analysis free or otherwise are hard to come by. If you are doing this for work you can have a look at NAG . It's commercial and not Java native. But you can use JNI with their C library. They have a time series chapter which does quite a bit. On the free side there is gretl looks good, but I have no direct experience with it. If anyone does, I'd like to hear their opinions. Have a look at this question on stackoverflow as well.
