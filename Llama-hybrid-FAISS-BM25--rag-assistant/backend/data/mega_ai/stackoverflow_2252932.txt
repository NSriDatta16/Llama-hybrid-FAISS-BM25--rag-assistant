I just need to make sure the WebMethod is called. If the above is really important, you can do the following: function onLinkClicked() { $.ajax({ url: 'WebMethod.aspx', success: function(data) { window.location = "newUrl"; } }); } There will be some latency from when the page will redirect. This may or may not be acceptable, depending on your application and on the average latency from your users to your host. EDIT: Further to the new comment below, unfortunately the window.location change will interrupt your AJAX request. For internal links: You may want to track your links as soon as the users land on the new page, instead of when they click on the hyperlink. For external links: I would use a server side redirect method, as Andy E suggested in another answer .
