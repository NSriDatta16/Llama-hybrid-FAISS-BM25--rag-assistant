Multiple forecasts to add up to 100%

I am trying to model and forecast an industrial process, in which the agent has to choose the percentage to attribute to four products, which I will call y1, y2, y3 and y4. They add up to 100% in the data, and must add to 100% in the forecast. I have the four time series y1 to y4, and two explicative series for each one, so the system goes (in R code): y1 ~ x1a + x1b y2 ~ x2a + x2b with sum (y1...y4) = 1 ...and so on Each xn* is uncorrelated with the others. Regressing each y on his xs, I obtain meaningful relationships, but of course there is a simultaneity problem, as the agent's choice for each y depends on the other y, as increasing one goes at the expense of the other, since all yn must sum up to 100%. I am using a Simultaneous Equations Model, which is fine for descriptive purposes. The problem is, how can I forecast the four ys, based on my model, so that it satisfies the following constraint? sum(y1...y4) = 1 Any help appreciated
