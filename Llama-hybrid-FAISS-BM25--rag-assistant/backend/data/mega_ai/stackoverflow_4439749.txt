I think I would try to write a better set of serialization tests that would use reflection to populate all the properties of an object with unique values, serialize it, deserialize, and compare the initial object with the deserialized one. Of course it might be tricky if you have non-trivial validation checks in your classes. On the other hand you might use known good values for known properties and random stuff for unknown properties - this will fail for nontrivial new properties - which is what you want. This way you test that serialization works after adding new properties (what is really your objective). If the option above is not possible than you might try generating a coverage report (usually these are in xml format) and then write a simple tool to make sure that your classes are fully tested. I think it will be really difficult to get this to work and I am not sure it is worth the effort. As far as I know there is no better way to check if a property was called.
