How can parameters be modeled differently if they share hyperparameters?

In one popular example of multilevel Bayesian models (2007 Gelman et. al paper), radon exposure in a household is modeled as a function of the county and whether the house has a basement. In this explanation of the paper, the author writes: ...we may assume that while $\alpha$ s and $\beta$ s are different for each county as in the unpooled case, the coefficients all share similarity. We can model this by assuming that each individual coefficient comes from a common group distribution: $\alpha_c \sim N( \mu_{\alpha},\sigma_{\alpha}^2)$ $\beta_c \sim N( \mu_{\beta},\sigma_{\beta}^2)$ We thus assume the intercepts $\alpha$ and slopes $\beta$ to come from a normal distribution centered around their respective group mean $\mu$ with a certain standard deviation $\sigma^2$ , the values (or rather posteriors) of which we also estimate. Let's focus on the intercepts ( $\alpha$ ) right now. My question is: If each county's $\alpha_c$ shares exact the same distribution (namely $N( \mu_{\alpha},\sigma_{\alpha}^2)$ ) how can the various $\alpha_c$ 's ever be different from each other? In other words, if $\alpha_{Aitkin} \sim N( \mu_{\alpha},\sigma_{\alpha}^2)$ , $\alpha_{Anoka} \sim N( \mu_{\alpha},\sigma_{\alpha}^2)$ , and $\alpha_{County X} \sim N( \mu_{\alpha},\sigma_{\alpha}^2)$ , etc. etc., why should we ever suspect that the posterior distribution for $\alpha_{Aitkin}$ look any different from $\alpha_{Anoka}$ or any other county's $\alpha$ ? We specified in our model that each distribution was identical!
