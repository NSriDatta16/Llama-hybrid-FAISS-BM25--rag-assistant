Classes are easy: #if DEBUG // Put your class here #endif Not sure about resources though... I suspect it's feasible by editing the project file by hand, but not in Visual Studio. I wouldn't do this for test purposes though - I'd encourage you to use a separate assembly for tests. Aside from anything else, that means you can test what you ship, by testing against the release build. If you need access to internal types/members, you can always use [InternalsVisibleTo] to grant internal access from your production assembly to your test assembly. Indeed, I suspect that's the most common use of the attribute :)
