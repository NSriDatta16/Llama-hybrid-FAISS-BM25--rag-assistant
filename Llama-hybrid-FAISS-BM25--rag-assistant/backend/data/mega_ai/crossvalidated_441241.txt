Hypothesis test of union of dependent hypothesis

I have dependent correlation coefficients $\rho_{AB},\,\rho_{AC}$ , and $\rho_{AD}$ (with equal sample sizes for $\small{A,B,C,D}$ ). I want to test whether $\rho_{AB}$ is neither equal to $\rho_{AC}$ nor to $\rho_{AD}$ . In other words, how can I test the "combined" null hypothesis $H_{0,combined} : \, \big\{ H_0: \rho_{AB} = \rho_{AC} \, \bigcup \, H_0: \rho_{AB} = \rho_{AD} \big\} $ , i.e. where the alternate hypothesis is $H_{1,combined} : \, \big\{ H_1: \rho_{AB} \neq \rho_{AC} \, \bigcap \, H_1: \rho_{AB} \neq \rho_{AD}\big\}$ ? PS I could test the individual hypotheses $H_0: \rho_{AB} = \rho_{AC}$ and $H_0: \rho_{AB} = \rho_{AD}$ using the T-statistic $T_{xy,xz} = (\hat\rho_{xy}-\hat\rho_{xz})/σ[\hat\rho_{xy}-\hat\rho_{xz}]$ on the raw coefficients (or their Fisher-z transform) with $σ[.]$ estimated via randomizing or bootstrapping. PPS Can I use the approach Wolfgang discussed at How to test for a significant difference between several dependent correlation coefficients? (in his example he tests whether $\rho_{AB}$ "is different from the rest" using $y=[\rho_{AB},\rho_{AC},\rho_{AD}]′=Xβ+e$ where $X = \begin{pmatrix}1 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$ )?
