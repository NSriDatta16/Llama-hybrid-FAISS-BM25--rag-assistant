CharlesB makes a good suggestion. Here are a couple others (apologies if they're too simplistic): Make sure you're in the dev environment, not a (non-modifiable) executable. ctrl-A or left-click and drag are alternative selection methods. You should be able to shift everything that way. On the upper right hand icon, right click and select VI Properties. Select Window Appearance, Customize... and make sure the scroll bars are enabled, so you can scroll more of the front panel onto the screen. Front panel corruption isn't unheard of. Holding Ctrl-Shift and clicking the run arrow will force a recompile that may fix it. If that fails, deleting and replacing the offending controls may help. There are some more exotic solutions (using property nodes or scripting, for instance), but hopefully one of the above suggestions is helpful.
