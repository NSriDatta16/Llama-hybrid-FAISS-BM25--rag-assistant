I have always observed that Mocking Can be avoided as much as possible because it can lead to difficult to maintain JUnit tests and defeat the whole purpose. My suggestion would be to create a temporary server on your local machine from a JUnit itself. At the beginning of JUnit you can create a server(not more than 10-15 lines of coding required) using Java sockets and then in your code pass the URL for the local server. This way you are reducing mocking and ensuring maximum code coverage. Something like this - public class SimpleServer extends Thread { public void run() { try { serverSocket = new ServerSocket(port); while (true) { Socket s = serverSocket.accept(); } } catch (IOException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } finally { serverSocket = null; } } }
