Magento checkout data persistence

I am trying to preserve the user input from the onepage checkout. If the user refreshes the page it needs to be redirected to the review step and all the previous provided data should be restored. I managed to skip to the final step using instructions mentioned in this post Magento: Show the Review Step in One Page Checkout but however, there is no data loaded. I tried finding where the checkout data is 'unset' but couldn't get it to work. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
