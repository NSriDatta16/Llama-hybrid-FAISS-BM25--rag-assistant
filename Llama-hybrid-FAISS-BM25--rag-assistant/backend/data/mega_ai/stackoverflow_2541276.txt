Enforce Security Policies for Private Keys Remember: a private key in conjunction with released signed binaries is your company's identity. Policies for handling such keys can't be strict enough. Enforce that YOU are the only persion in your company who will be capable (and responsible) of signing executables. If this is not an option then let all PKI-involved employees sign an explicit non-disclosure agreement with a high fine - a much higher sense of responsibility should be the result. Key Transfers use portable media (like a dedicated USB stick or CD-ROM) - I'd prefer a read-only media let the receipt be witnessed by another employee let the recipient and the witness sign a form about the key-receipt Storage of the Master Copy Store the master copy redundant on at least 3 drives at different geographical locations where you have exclusive access to. Also think about encrypting the copies with strong encryption algorithms like AES-256 (in a 7z file for example).
