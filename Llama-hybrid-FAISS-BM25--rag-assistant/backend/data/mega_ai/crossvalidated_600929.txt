Generate a point cloud distributed according to a Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution with prescribed marginals

Let $p$ be a probability density on $\Omega\in\mathcal B(\mathbb R^d)$ for some $d\in\mathbb N$ (I'm primarily interested in $\Omega=[0,1)^d$ ). We can approximate $p$ by $$A_x(y):=\sum_{i=1}^k\varphi_{x_i}(y):=\sum_{i=1}^kp(x_i)e^{-\frac{\|x_i-y\|^2}{\sigma(x_i)^2}}$$ for $x\in\Omega^k$ for some $k\in\mathbb N$ and $y\in\mathbb R^d$ . $\sigma$ must be suitably defined and $x\in\Omega^k$ be chosen such that $$E(x):=\int_\Omega|A_x(y)-p(y)|\:{\rm d}y$$ is minimized. Now let $\lambda$ denote the Lebesgue measure on $\mathcal B(\mathbb R)$ , $$\varrho(x):=e^{-\frac{E(x)}T}\;\;\;\text{for }x\in\Omega^k$$ for some $T>0$ and $$c:=\int\varrho\:{\rm d}\left.\lambda^{\otimes d}\right|_\Omega^{\otimes k}.$$ Let $\mu$ denote the measure with density $\frac\varrho c$ with respect to $\left.\lambda^{\otimes d}\right|_\Omega^{\otimes k}$ and assume $X$ is a $\Omega^k$ -valued random variable distributed according to $\mu$ . If $T\to0+$ , then $$\operatorname P\left[X\in B\right]\xrightarrow{T\to0+}\left.\lambda^{\otimes d}\right|_\Omega^{\otimes k}(B\cap\{E=0\})\tag1$$ for all $B\in\mathcal B(\Omega)^{\otimes k}$ . This should show that $E(X)=0$ (in the limit $T\to0+$ ) almost surely and hence $$A_X=p\;\;\;\text{almost everywhere}.$$ However, are (in some sense) the components $X_i$ distributed according to $p$ ? Remark / Context : I'm trying to understand the assertions which are made in this paper . EDIT Sextus Empiricus mentioned in a comment below his answer that "On average, the density of points will equal $p$ ". But what does that mean exactly? Does it mean that the $X_i$ have point density $\pi:=p\left.\lambda^{\otimes d}\right|_\Omega$ (measure with density $p$ with respect to $\left.\lambda^{\otimes d}\right|_\Omega$ ? The "intensity" of the point process $(X_1,\ldots,X_k)$ is defined as $$\alpha(B):=\operatorname E\left[\kappa(B)\right]=\sum_{i=1}^k\operatorname P\left[X_i\in B\right]\;\;\;\text{for }B\in\mathcal B(\Omega),$$ where $\kappa$ denotes the random measure $$\kappa(B):=\sum_{i=1}^k\delta_{X_i}.$$ So, the "average number of points in $B\in\mathcal B(\Omega)$ " should be $\mu(B)$ . Maybe the claim is that $\mu$ has density $p$ with respect to $\left.\lambda^{\otimes d}\right|_\Omega$ . But how can we show this?
