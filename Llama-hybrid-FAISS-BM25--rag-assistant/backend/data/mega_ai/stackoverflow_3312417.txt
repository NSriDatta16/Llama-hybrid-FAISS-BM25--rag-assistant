I would suggest not having copies of pointers around. It just increases the chance of having a dangling free pointer that you may accidentally use later, or an extra copy you may not mean to free, or an extra copy you may not mean to double-free. I don't personally see a need for storage_p here. Gool 'ol: int *storage = malloc(size_of_whatever); storage[0] = do_something(); free(storage); storage = NULL; would be fine.
