Calculate the price for each product in an order in Magento

I want to calculate the base price of all products in an order. The price for each (1 quantity) should include any discount/bonuses but NOT tax. The total of all product prices times their quantity + tax should be exactly the same as $order->getGrandTotal(). I’ve managed to get the individual prices including shipping fee with only a small precision error. Of course, this is not acceptable when dealing with currency. Also I’ve not taken into account bundled products and such. So I ask you to help me, I need to make the exact same calculation as Magento do, and still get out the values that I need (each product/shipping with discounts but without tax). Thanks in advance
