Calculating log odds with multiple predictor variables in Logistic Regression

I'm trying to calculate the log odds of unemployment (1 = employed, 0 = unemployed) based on the age and education (1 = university-educated, 0 = not university-educated) of a sample based on these coefficients: (Intercept) -3.20 age 0.08 uni_educated 0.33 I understand how this works using just age as a predictor, i.e. for a 25 year olds, 3.20 + 0.08 * 25 but I'm not sure how to incorporate the second predictor. I realize this is a very basic question but I haven't been able to come up with a solution. Grateful for any pointers. (I've only included the coefficients because I suspect that's the only needed information, but feel free to let me know if I'm wrong)
