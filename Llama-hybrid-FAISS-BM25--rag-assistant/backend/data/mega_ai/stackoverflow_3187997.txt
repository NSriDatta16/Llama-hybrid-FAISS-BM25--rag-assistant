UI Automation FrameWork for iPhone

I am exploring the newly exposed framework UI Automation in iphoneOS 4.0. Has anybody tested their application using this framework. I will appreciate any help. I am trying to test a sample application that just contains a textfield and a button. I have written a script as UIALogger.logStart("Starting Test"); var view = UIATarget.localTarget().frontMostApp().mainWindow().elements()[0]; var textfields = view.textFields(); if (textfields.length != 1) { UIALogger.logFail("Wrong number of text fields"); } else { UIALogger.logPass("Right number of text fields"); } textfields[0].setValue("anurag"); view.buttons()[0].tap(); The problem is that the value of textfield is not getting set and no button is tapped. When I run the instruments only the view(with textfield and button) appears and then notting is happening. There is a message in instruments "Something else has happened".
