Table 3 has all the values of the hyper-parameters of the models. See the image below, green are for the base and blue for the big model. You can use these to get the matrices sizes. For example for the multi-headed attention in section 3.2.2 the matrix $W^{Q}_{i}\in\mathbb{R}^{d_{model}\times d_{k}}$ , will have a dimension of $d_{model}\times d_{k} = 512\times 64$ for the base model, which is $32,768$ parameters. For a single $head_{i}$ , that value will be $\times 3 = 98,304$ . For the multi-head, that value will be $\times h = \times 8 = 786,432$ parameters for the base model. You can use the other values from Table 3 to figure out the rest of the model matrices. For examples, $d_{ff}$ is used in section 3.3. Table 3 says that the total of all parts of the model should be $65\times 10^6$ for the base model and $213\times 10^6$ for the big model.
