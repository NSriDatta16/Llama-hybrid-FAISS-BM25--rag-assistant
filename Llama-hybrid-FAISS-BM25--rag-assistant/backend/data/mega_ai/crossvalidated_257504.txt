My father went to university shortly after World War II and he used to tell me about how he once did a long Fourier transformation and how they used those very long paper rolls, as they did it in a paper pencil approach. When I went to school in the 80s, people used to think, that in some time in the future everybody would have to deal with computers. And we supposed to be the generation who could not avoid computers. Not everybody did believe it, but school tried to prepare us by teaching us BASIC and PASCAL! Now it turns out, we still need a lot of people who know about Fourier transformations and yes, next to everybody uses computers today. But how wrong were they, teaching programming to everyone, because they believed, that "working with computers" meant "programming computers"? I met a young automobile engineer last year and he told me, how all those engineering students went into "automobile" because they somehow love fuel burning engines and now see, that electric mobility is what they will earn their money with, in the future. Obviously, doing computer analyses in 10, 20, 30 years will be totally different from what it is today. And nobody can tell you now, what it will be like. There is good reason to conject, that data analysis is going to be of huge importance and that some of the jobs done today by specialists will be done in 20 years by anyone with his watch or mobile or... But new questions will come up, new things to learn and to master, things that will need specialists (at least for a time). Don't start a career in information technology assuming, that you won't have to learn and to adapt to new technologies your whole life through. Try to learn a lot, try to be fit for change. Learn those things, that will never change (mostly mathematics) and don't overdo that fancy new method, that everyone praises now just to reject it, when the next hot thing comes around. SQL has been used 40 yrs ago and is used today. For someone who knows their linear algebra, their basics in databases, knows about object oriented programming as well as functional programming, classical statistics as well as Baysian and Machine Learning, can communicate with ordinary people, with business people and lawyers and is constantly open to new challenges, there will be lots of interesting work opportunities in the future. We just don't know, what they will be. So if you love all the consituents of what makes machine learning, go for it. If just think, that support vector machines are cool - well, think twice.
