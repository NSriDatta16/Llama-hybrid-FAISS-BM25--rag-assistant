Forecasting time series regression in R using lm and lag

I would like to predict using a linear model in R. The model that I have is of the form lm(y~ lag(x)) . It seems like I should be able to predict using the predict function, but this does not look ahead into the future. Here is the lag function that I have been using from within R. lag1 = function (x) c(NA, x[1:(length(x)-1)]) This lag function adds an NA at the beginning of the data, shifts everything down, and cuts off the last observation. I am mostly interested in the predictions made on the last line of the data. This line of data seems to be ignored by the fitted and predict functions. The best workaround I have found was to multiply each of the model coefficients by each of my dependent variables, and add them up for each prediction. None of the dependent variables are lagged at this point, when I set up this equation. The problem with this is that each time I change the model formula, the names of the variables have to be changed to match the new formula. It seems like there should be a more intuitive solution to this.
