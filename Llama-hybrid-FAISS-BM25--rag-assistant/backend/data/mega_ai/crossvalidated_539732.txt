When does complexity in machine learning algorithms actually become an issue?

I keep seeing complexities for machine learning algorithms e.g. Gaussian process implementation requires inversion of an nxn matrix so complexity is $O(n^3)$ . When does complexity actually become an issue? Is there a way to work out when it becomes prohibitive?
