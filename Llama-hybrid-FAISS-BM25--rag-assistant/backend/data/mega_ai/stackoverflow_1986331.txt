As has been said you will need a Java VM installed on the PDA. Most HTC devices come with one pre-installed. Java capability for mobile devices is integrated by the device manufacturers. You need to check with your device manufacturer about availability of this in your device. KVM, the virtual machine for mobile devices, is the counterpart of JVM (Java virtual machine). It is used to run applets and applications written with Java technology on mobile devices. KVM must be installed by the manufacturer. It is NOT available for download or installation by consumers. To install .jars on my HTC Touch Diamond I simply copy the .jar file onto the storage card and open it up with File Explorer. The JVM will take you through the install process. Without knowing what your device is I cant help much more!
