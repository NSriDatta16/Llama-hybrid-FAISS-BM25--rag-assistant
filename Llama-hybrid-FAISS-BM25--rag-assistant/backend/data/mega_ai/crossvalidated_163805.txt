There are some papers but not as much as autoencoders or RBMs. I think the reason is the time line of NN. Stacked RBM and autoencoder are introduced at 2006 and 2007 , respectively. After employment of ReLU at 2009 unsupervised learning is partially abandoned (when there is enough data to learn in direct supervised learning). Even though Convolution net (or LeNet) is invented at 1989 , it couldn't trained as deep structure till 2012 which is after popularization of direct supervised learning with ReLU. So researchers, I guess, have trained it mostly by using direct supervised learning.
