Does Standard Deviation Increase/Decrease when Average Increases?

I have a mean(88) and standard deviation(6) of sample data from period 1, I have the mean(91) for period 2 data; the mean increases from period 1 to period 2. Additionally, I have sample data from period 2 where the mean is 93 and standard deviation is 3. The data has a possible minimum value of 0 and maximum value of 100, although the actual range for the period 1 data is 55-100.It is also not normal, and it is right skewed. Does the standard deviation decrease in this scenario, is it possible to estimate standard deviation for the population of period 2?
