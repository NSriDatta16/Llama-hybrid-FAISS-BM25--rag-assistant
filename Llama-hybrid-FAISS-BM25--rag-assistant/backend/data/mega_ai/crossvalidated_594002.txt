You should get the correct value as $\Delta t \rightarrow 0$ , as that's the definition of derivatives. Right now, you are using dt = 1 , which is very large. You should be getting the average derivative over the region [40, 41], but it can change a lot in that interval. I'd suggest using dt=0.0001 . It'll still be an approximation, but it should be much closer.
