Any kind of 'scripting' won't give you the 'raw speed' it seems you might be looking for. I would generally strongly discourage this whole train of thought, though. There are plenty of web frameworks out there where you produce code that runs very efficiently. Even 'scripted' web frameworks often cache the scripts and reduce much of the initial slowdown involved in parsing and executing. And frameworks that use compiled bytecode/IL can be quite fast once loaded/JIT'ed. If you plan to write your own HTTP engine in C, though; I doubt you would be able to get something remotely close to as fast as anything else out there until you were very familiar with what's already out there; how they all work, all the variations in the protocols involved, etc, etc...
