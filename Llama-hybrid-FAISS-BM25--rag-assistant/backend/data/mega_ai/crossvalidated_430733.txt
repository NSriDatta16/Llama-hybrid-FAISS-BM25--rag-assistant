The null hypothesis in the granger causality test is that the second time series does not Granger cause the first time series (column two and column one respectively for the module that you are using). In your case your p-values are larger than 0.05, which is the traditional cutoff for statistical significance. That is to say you fail to reject the null hypothesis. If you were to pick a different cutoff for statistical significance then that might alter your conclusion, but you would probably be met with a lot of skepticism for picking a different value (especially if it is less stringent; i.e., higher than 0.05).

The by far most commonly accepted choice is 0.05
