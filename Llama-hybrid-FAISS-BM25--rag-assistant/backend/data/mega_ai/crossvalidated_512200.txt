How can I model this Bayesian learning process of two types of coins?

(As suggested on the comment, I slightly changed my previous question.) I have $N$ coins and I am testing them one by one if it is fair or not. I know that, if it is unfair, the probability of head will be 2/3. Given that $n=10$ , for instance, how can I express the Bayesian updating process of my continuous prior $p_{0}$ ? Would the posterior converge to the true distribution even if $n$ is left to be a small number? Thank you very much.
