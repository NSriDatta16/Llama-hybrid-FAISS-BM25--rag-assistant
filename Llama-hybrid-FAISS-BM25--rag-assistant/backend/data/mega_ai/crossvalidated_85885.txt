Exploratory factor analysis can provide a tool appropriate for your task. It can indicate a) how variables group (co-vary) together, and 2) how individuals compare given their answers. If the time dimension is not of substantive importance, you can just get the average for each individual on each item from the multiple survey waves. If the time dimension is actually important, you can redefine your variables as the difference in the individual scores on each item between T and t1 . That would give you which variables tend to change together over time. But in any case do not just merge all data before running the model since the observations on each individual over time are obviously non-independent. An alternative which is considered more appropriate for binary variables is item-response models.
