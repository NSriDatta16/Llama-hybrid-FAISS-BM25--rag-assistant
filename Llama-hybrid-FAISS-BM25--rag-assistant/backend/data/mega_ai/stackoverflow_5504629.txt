jQuery pager with static height and dynamic content

I have page that needs to take user content from a CMS and display on a page that has a static height with the overflow broken into pages on the front end. I've looked into a variety of jQuery Pager plugins and they all require a specific tag to target (p, div, li) where in my case I will not know what tag the user enters into the CMS. var content = $("#weekly-features").children(); var pageHeight = 0; var nextHeight = 0; var pageCount = 0; var start = 0; // loop through and wrap p's with page divs for (var i = 0; i = 400) { pageCount++; $(content.slice(start, i)).wrapAll(' '); pageHeight = 0; start = i; } } // wrap remaining page if (start '); } // show first page $("#weekly-features div").each(function() { if ($(this).attr('class') == "page1") { return; } else { $(this).hide(); } }); buildPagerNav(pageCount); } Any ideas? Edit to be more specific- the problem is with the static height requirement: my html looks something like this: paragraph 1 (short) paragraph 2 (short) paragraph 3 (long) list 1 list 2 list 3 list 4 list 5 paragraph 4 (short) list 1 list 2 list 3 list 4 list 5 where the short paragraphs will be on the same page and long list will need to be broken into separate pages... Kind of like inserting a dynamic page break in Word I guess..
