In my opinion ,,, There is no violation in using time as an independent variable thus Yes "one can include time as an independent/predictor". Auto-regression versus linear regression of x(t)-with-t for modelling time series includes a discussion and a worked example. The problem comes when one tries to use powers of time like time squared , time cubed etc as predictor variables for purposes of extrapolation (and even interpolation) . See How to extrapolate this simple trend line into the future for the purpose of forecasting in Matlab? @Ben's comments about the dangers of polynomial fitting. Note that many "EARLIER" textbooks in the BC (BEFORE CORRELATION) era , used examples of fitting time polynomials to data .... seriously flawed in my opinion. WARNING : BAD APPROACH FOLLOWS ! As an example of what not to do ( always dangerous ! )... Here is quarterly data from an "easy to read popular forecasting text" . Yielding the following not-so-useful equation (user-specified) with an incredibly deficient residual plot here and Actual/Fit/Forecast here .
