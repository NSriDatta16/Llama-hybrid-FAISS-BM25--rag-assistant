BBOMs I have encountered were usually created organically, in a Darwinian process. It goes something like this: Initally, a system is created (not designed) and poorly documented. Original resources go on to create more havok elsewhere, so there isn't even an oral history for this "legacy" system. Fresh blood is brought in. These developers try to uncover workings of various system parts, but it's like several blind men trying to understand the elephant when one has grabbed the tail, one a leg, and one the trunk. They make changes but never really feel confident about them. In this way, a system "evolves" by blind natural selection, but parallel to this is an evolution of the most intractable, unreproducible bugs that persist precisely because they remain under the radar screen, until of course they surface at a customer installation.
