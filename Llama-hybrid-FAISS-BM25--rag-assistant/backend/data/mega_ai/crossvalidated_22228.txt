Dynamic time warping makes a particular assumption on your data set: one vector is a non-linear time-streteched series of the other. But it also assumes that the actual values are on the same scale. Lets say you have: $x=1..10000$, $a(x)=1\cdot\sin(0.01*x)$, $b(x)=1\cdot\sin(0.01234*x)$,$c(x)=1000\cdot\sin(0.01*x)$. Then for DTW, $a$ and $b$ will be extremely similar, while $a$ and $c$ differ almost as much as with Manhattan distance. If you however do a frequency analysis, $a$ and $c$ will be identical with respect to their frequencies, and only differ in magnitude, while $a$ and $b$ have a clearly different frequency. DTW is not your magic weapon to solve all your time series matching needs. It makes particular assumptions on the kind of similarity you are interested in . If that doesn't match your data, it will not work well. Judging from the data series you shared, you do not need temporal alignment (which DTW does), but actually some appropriate normalization and maybe fourier transformations instead. Treshhold crossing distances might also work well for you, see for example: Similarity Search on Time Series Based on Threshold Queries Johannes Aßfalg, Hans-Peter Kriegel, Peer Kröger, Peter Kunath, Alexey Pryakhin and Matthias Renz, EDBT 2006
