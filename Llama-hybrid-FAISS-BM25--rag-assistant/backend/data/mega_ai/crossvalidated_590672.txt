We use the mean more than the median because it is additive , in two senses. (I am surprised that in 11 years, no one has really said this!) If data on a population is broken down into data about men and data about women, then for example: \begin{align} \text{average overall height =} &\text{average height for men} * \text{fraction of men}\\ & + \text{average height of women} * \text{fraction of women} \end{align} So means are additive over merged populations: the mean of a large population is the average of means over subpopulations, weighted by their sizes. No analog holds for medians. If we have data on paired variables for a single population, then for example: \begin{align} \text{average income after tax =} &\text{ average income before tax}\\ & - \text{average taxes paid} \end{align} So means are additive over paired variables; the mean of a sum or difference is the sum or difference of the means. No analog holds for medians. If we have data broken down by day of the week, then for example: \begin{align} \text{average sales for a week = } &\text{average sales for a Sunday} + \\ &\cdots + \text{average sales for a Saturday} \end{align} This could be considered an example of either of the above situations. Again, no analog holds for medians. Because means are additive, you can calculate a mean from smaller pieces of data. But to calculate a median usually requires having one comprehensive data source for everything. This is a much bigger practical issue than a little loss of efficiency in a summary statistic. The geometric mean also has these same properties, with addition replaced by multiplication, additive replaced by multiplicative, etc. In general, the only statistics with both of these aggregative properties are transformed versions of the mean, of the form $f^{-1}(E[f(X)])$ , for some increasing function $f$ . E.g., the geometric mean is the case with $f(x)=\ln(x)$ , $f^{-1}(x)=e^x$ . The general result can be seen as a corollary of the Morgenstern-von Neumann theorem on expected utility.
