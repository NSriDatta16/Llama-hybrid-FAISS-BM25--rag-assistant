lassify and count (ACC), probabilistic adjusted classify and count (PACC), and the Saerens-Latinne-Decaestecker EM-based method (SLD). Methods for multi-label quantification include regression-based quantification (RQ) and label powerset-based quantification (LPQ). Methods for the ordinal case include Ordinal Quantification Tree (OQT), and ordinal versions of the above-mentioned ACC, PACC, and SLD methods. Methods for the regression case include Regress and splice and Adjusted regress and sum. Evaluation measures for quantification Several evaluation measures can be used for evaluating the error of a quantification method. Since quantification consists of generating a predicted probability distribution that estimates a true probability distribution, these evaluation measures are ones that compare two probability distributions. Most evaluation measures for quantification belong to the class of divergences. Evaluation measures for binary quantification and single-label multiclass quantification are Absolute Error Squared Error Relative Absolute Error Kullbackâ€“Leibler divergence Pearson Divergence Evaluation measures for ordinal quantification are Normalized Match Distance (a particular case of the Earth Mover's Distance) Root Normalized Order-Aware Distance Applications Quantification is of special interest in fields such as the social sciences, epidemiology, market research, and ecological modelling, since these fields are inherently concerned with aggregate data. However, quantification is also useful as a building block for solving other downstream tasks, such as improving the accuracy of classifiers on out-of-distribution data, allocating resources, measuring classifier bias, and estimating the accuracy of classifiers on out-of-distribution data.
