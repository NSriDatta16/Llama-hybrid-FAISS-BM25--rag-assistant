Deploying a PHP webapp to multiple EC2 instances behind a Elastic Load Balancer

my question is basically two questions, but since they are closely related I thought that it makes sense to ask them en-bloque. Case: I am running a webapplication, which is distributed over multiple AWS EC2 instances behind a AWS Elastic Load Balancer Intended goals: a) When deploying new app code (php) it should be automatically distributed to all EC2 instances. b) When new EC2 instances are added, they should automatically "bootstrap" with the latest appcode My thoughts so far: ad a) phing (http://phing.info) is probably the answer for this part. i would probably add multiple targets for each EC2 instance and when running a deploy it would deploy to all machines. probably unfortunately not in parallel. but that might be even beneficial when scripting it in a way where the EC2 instance is "paused" in the load balancer, upgraded, "unpaused" again and on to the next instance. ad b) not sure how i would achieve that. in a conventional "hardware based setup" i probably had a "app code" volume on a network storage device and when adding a new server i'd simply attach that volume. when deploying new appcode i had just one deploy operation to this volume. so i need some "central storage" from where the newly bootstrapped machine/instance downloads it's appcode. i thought about git, but after all git is not a deploy tool and probably shouldn't be forced to be used as one. I'd be happy to see your setups for such tasks and hear your hints and ideas for such a situation. Thanks, Joshua
