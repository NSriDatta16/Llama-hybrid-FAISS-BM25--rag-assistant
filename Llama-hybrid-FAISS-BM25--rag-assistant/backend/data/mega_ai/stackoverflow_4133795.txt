I solved this with a combination of a couple of things here at SO. Ultimately, a move would not have worked for our organization's build process. This would have kept the branch history on trunk, but left the branch empty. Our builds would not have liked that. I instead copied the files to the trunk directory, sans .svn directories of course, via svn export and committed them. Now, some might say, you just lost history. I'm not so sure about that. The history of the branch is still there, and a new branch was created from trunk. The previous branch remains active and can be retired is process allows, tagged EOL, etc. Feedback welcome.
