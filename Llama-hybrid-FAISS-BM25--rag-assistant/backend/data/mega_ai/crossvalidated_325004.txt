The most important takeaway is that machine learning is applied to problems where there is no optimal solution available. The best you can do is find a good approximation. In contrast, when you have an optimisation problem, there is an optimal solution, but it usually cannot be found in reasonable time or with reasonable processing power. The tools and algorithms you use are fundamentally different. So while I would say that there is no immediate benefit of taking an optimisation class, it is always good to know a bit about related fields. If you can recognise an optimisation problem you'll know that you should not tackle it with machine learning algorithms but with optimisation algorithms instead. That alone is worth a lot I'd say.
