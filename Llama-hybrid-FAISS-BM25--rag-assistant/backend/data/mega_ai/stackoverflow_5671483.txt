but short of comparing all nodes to the new node I haven't been able to come up with an efficient solution Without any other information about the relationships between nodes, this is the only way you can do it since you have to figure out the closeness factor between the new node and each existing node. A O(n) algorithm can be a perfectly decent solution. One addition you might consider - keep in mind we have no idea what data structure you are using for your objects - is to organize all present nodes into a graph, where nodes with factors below a certain threshold can be considered connected, so you can first check nodes that are more likely to be similar/related.
