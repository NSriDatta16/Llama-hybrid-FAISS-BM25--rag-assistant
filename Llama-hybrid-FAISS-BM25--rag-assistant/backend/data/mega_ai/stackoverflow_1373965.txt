Store a xml inside a compiled DLL

I want to store configuration information about my DLL in an XML file inside my DLL i.e. if changes need to be made the DLL must be re-compiled. The reason is because its a elegant format and I may not use config files for this DLL. Any ideas? I literally want to be able to edit an xml in Visual Studio then compile it and only see a DLL in the output.
