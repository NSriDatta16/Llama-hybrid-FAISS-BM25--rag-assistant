Use DOMDocument::loadHTML ? It uses libxml under the hood which is fast and robust. Don't try to parse HTML with regex's. I made that bold because I see it a lot on here and the solutions are always fragile at best and buggy at worst. Once you use a true HTML parser to get the attributes you want then using a regex is more reasonable. [update] - Even if this is coming from Wordpress you should be fine since it takes a string as an argument. The function parses the HTML contained in the string source. Unlike loading XML, HTML does not have to be well-formed to load. Something like the following should get you going... $doc = new DOMDocument(); $doc->loadHTML($var); $images = $doc->getElementsByTagName('img');
