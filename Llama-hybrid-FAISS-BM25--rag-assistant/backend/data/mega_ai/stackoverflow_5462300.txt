Chef Infra (formerly just called Chef) is a systems integration framework from Chef Software (formerly Opscode ) that allows you to describe the configuration of systems and infrastructure in code. It brings the benefits of configuration management to your entire infrastructure. Chef is available as Open source and also contains solutions for both small and large scale systems, with features and pricing for the respective ranges. Chef configuration management software written in Ruby and Erlang. It uses a pure-Ruby, domain-specific language (DSL) for writing system configuration recipes . Chef is used to streamline the task of configuring and maintaining servers, and can integrate with cloud-based platforms such as Internap, Amazon EC2, Google Cloud Platform, Oracle Cloud, OpenStack, SoftLayer, Microsoft Azure, and Rackspace to automatically provision and configure virtual machines. Using Chef, you write cookbooks which describe the desired state of your systems and infrastructure. You then define roles , which are collections of cookbooks and attributes to be applied, and apply them to your systems. The end result is the ability to build a system or your complete infrastructure in a fully automated fashion. To bring up a new system, you simply tell it what roles you want it to have and Chef does the rest. Chef has 4 products that satisfies various needs of an Organisation, Chef Infra - Infrastructure automation to provision, harden and maintain configuration state. Chef InSpec - Security and Compliance automation in any environment, on any platform. Chef Habitat - Automate application dependency management to run apps at scale anywhere. Chef Automate - Provides operational visibility and organizational collaboration for everything you automate. If you are reporting an issue, please use Chef's ticket tracker instead of StackOverflow!
