Is Poisson regression possible with row level mixed numeric / factor data?

I checked different sources here and here but was still unclear of the response so I am asking. I am thinking of using a Poisson regression for several reasons. One: response is a count, two: data not all numeric three: distribution is not normal. The problem is my data is not aggregated, it is row level and I'm no sure if it's possible to use Poisson (Note: management does not want a logistic regression). If my data must be rearranged to use Poisson, I am unsure which rearrangement to use. I am using R so here is my data frame ## patient hospital data id response: count of number patients by year and ethnicity a = year b = ethnicity therefore: response: countPatients with subscripts ab explanatory variables: year, state, stage, age, wagesWk, ethnicity, underPhysCare The problem is this is row level data. If I aggregate like this: num_patients_2015_group1 num_patients_2015_group2 num_patients_2015_group3... num_patients_2016_group1 num_patients_2016_group2 num_patients_2016_group3... Wouldn't this require multiple Poisson regressions? If so, how do I incorporate my explanatory variables? If Poisson is not a good choice, what other choice can I use? For sure I cant OLS because the normality assumption is violated and I am not allowed to use logistic. Note: I am not asking for code. I am asking for advice as to how to tackle this problem. Thanx in advance for your help
