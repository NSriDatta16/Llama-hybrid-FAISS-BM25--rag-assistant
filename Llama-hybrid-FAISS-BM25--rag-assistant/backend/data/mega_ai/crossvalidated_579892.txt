Vector Autoregression model without using past values of predicted value

I have 16 time series: A, B, C ... P. And I am trying to use Vector Autoregression model to capture the relationship between A and other series. But when I use VAR, I found that the model relies too much on the past values of A. So I want to remove past values of A from the model. I want to describe A only using series B, C ... P. Is there any way to implement this or enforce such constraint in VAR? I am using statsmodels.tsa.api in Python. Thank you for the help.
