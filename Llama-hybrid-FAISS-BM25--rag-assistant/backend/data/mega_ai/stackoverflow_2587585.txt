The following is from a discussion about this topic on http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/sqlintegrationservices/thread/134585b4-7960-4b1c-938b-d5421a4d0fdb SSIS is a server component. To run a SSIS package you need to license and install the full SSIS server, there is no client only. A machine that hosts SSIS packages must be licensed as a full SQL Server, a CAL is not sufficient. There is no remote execution functionality built in. The common workarounds are to use a SQL Agent job or a development technology such as a web service or web page to bridge the gap between the server and client. The Quote is from Darren Green (about 4 answers down on the discussion). Jamie Thomson gives a similar answer.
