In general? No. Take into account that the amount of data need for an ML model to achieve a certain level of performance in a task is totally dependent on the task, the specific dataset, and the model itself. Of course, you may find studies to understand how different machine learning models behave under low-resource settings. For instance, in text classification tasks, there are studies of how a specific neural network model called BERT behaves with datasets of different sizes. This gives practitioners an idea of how much data was needed by a specific model to achieve X performance on task T, but does not set a rule or method to compute the minimum amount of data needed in general.
