This sounds like a classic clustering problem. Neither SVMs or neural networks are going to be able to directly solve this problem. You can use either approach for dimensionality reduction , for example to embed your 10-dimensional data in two-dimensional space, but they will not put the data into clusters for you. There are a huge number of clustering algorithms besides k-means. If you wanted a contrasting approach, you might want to try an agglomerative clustering algorithm. I don't know what kind of computing environment you are using, but I quite like R and this (very) short guide on clustering .
