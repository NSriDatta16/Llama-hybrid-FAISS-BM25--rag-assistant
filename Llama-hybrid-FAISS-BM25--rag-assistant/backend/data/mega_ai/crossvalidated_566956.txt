Q1: with factors that have a smallish number of levels, I believe that there will inevitably be concurvity in the parametric part of the model. I don't think this is a problem however. Assuming the code you showed isn't pseudocode, you can't write s(covariate1, factor1, bs = c("cr", "re")) as s() doesn't allow for smooth interactions of this sort where you have separate marginal bases. Q2: the uncertainty band given the usual definitions has to go to 0 at the point where the linear function crosses the y = 0 point as that point. That linear functions do this is well known and leads to lower coverage than is implied by the $1 - \alpha$ coverage requested. A correction has been proposed by Marra and Wood, and which is implemented in {mgcv}, which in essence applies the uncertainty in the constant term (the intercept; or overall mean) to the estimated smooths, in turn. This has the effect of creating intervals with the correct nominal coverage, but in doing so fixes the "bow-tie" interval problem associated with smooth functions that are estimated to be linear. k = -1 just means "use the entirely arbitrary default for this type of smooth". It is set to -1 because for s() you want the number of basis functions used by default to scale with the dimension of the smooth. I believe the default for 2d or grater thin plate splines is 5^d, hence 25 for a 2d thin plate spline, etc. I'm not sure I follow what you mean by a "mixed effect"? You might have a model that contains both random and fixed effects, in which case some might call the model a "mixed effects model" but I'm struggling to think of situations where a single covariate would enter a model as a "mixed effect".
