More elegant solution for pulling value from DB using recordset

Is there a better solution (using less code) for the following code snippet. It is something that I find myself doing a lot of in VB6 and was hoping to trim it down. As I understand it Connection.Execute will not work SQL = "SELECT SomeID FROM TableA" RecordSet.Open SQL, Connection, adOpenStatic, adLockOptimistic, adCmdText SomeID = RecordSet.Fields(0).Value RecordSet.Close SQL = "SELECT AnotherID FROM TableB" RecordSet.Open SQL, Connection, adOpenStatic, adLockOptimistic, adCmdText AnotherID = RecordSet.Fields(0).Value RecordSet.Close This isn't a functional issue just looking to see if there is a tidier way.
