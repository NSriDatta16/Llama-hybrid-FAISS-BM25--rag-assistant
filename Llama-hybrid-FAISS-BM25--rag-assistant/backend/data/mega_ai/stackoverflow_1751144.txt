Very good question indeed. I have seen this statement "all members must be full-time" in almost every paper, article, book etc. I have red on Scrum but yet I haven't seen any argument to why this has to be the case. In large organizations I would expect that you will have developers that do nothing else, but in small organizations it must be very common to have developers that can't commit 100% to the sprint and Scrum is designed for small teams! The focus factor should be able to handle this just as anything else.
