I would try the following: Vacuum your database by running the " vacuum " command SQLite starts with a default cache size of 2000 pages. (Run the command " pragma cache_size " to be sure. Each page is 512 bytes, so it looks like you have about 1 MByte of cache, which is not quite enough to contain your database. Increase your cache size by running " pragma default_cache_size=4000 ". That should get you 2 Mbytes cache, which is enough to get your entire database into the cache. You can run these pragma commands from the sqlite3 command line, or through your program as if it were another query. Add an index to your table on the field you are ordering with.
