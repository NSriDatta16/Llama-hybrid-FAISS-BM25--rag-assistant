To my eyes, it's more misleading without indenting. I look at the unindented version and think "what's wrong here"? Is it really necessary to have the redundant braces? Update I want to answer ojblass's comment and it'll take more space than a comment I think. I thought you cannot declare variables in c without the braces... at least on some miserable compilers. You're not as free in C as in C++; what you have to do is put any new declarations in before any executable code. So, in this fragment for (a = 0; a you could write it for (a = 0; a and it would work perfectly well. On the other hand, the declaration in the for loop isn't straight C either. Now, what is possible, and wouldn't show in the example, is if questioner is using the braces to limit scopes so he has a simpler namespace management; that is, so you could have { int a2 = some_good_thing(); // do stuff } { int a2 = something_else(); // Now a different a2, // and it's the compiler's problem // do other stuff } (NB: Sorry, OJ, didn't realize you were the questioner. My eyes hurt, please take the necessary corrections to grammar as read.)
