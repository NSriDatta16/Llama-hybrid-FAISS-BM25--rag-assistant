What techniques are used for empirical, stochastic simulation of a time series?

Suppose you have recorded a set of paths in the $y,t$ plane, with $y = f(t)$, $f$ is a stochastic function (i.e. there is a noise term), and $t$ might be time or some other monotonic increasing independent variable. Suppose further that you know the underlying process is random, meaning the same set of initial conditions (even, "hidden variables") do not produce the same path. Do not assume that changes in $y$ are independent, or even stationary (though, stationary but dependent changes are an important special case). What techniques are available to simulate an incomplete curve into the future? What I mean by "incomplete" curve is: your set of historical curves are each over some range of interest, $T=[0,t_{max}]$. You are given a curve that represents data $y_1(t)$ recorded up until some intermediate value of $t' \in T$.
