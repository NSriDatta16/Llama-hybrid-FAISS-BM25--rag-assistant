What is the feature matrix in word2vec?

I'm a beginner in neural networks and currently I'm exploring the word2vec model. However I'm having a tough time to understand what the feature matrix exactly is. I can understand that the first matrix is a one-hot encoding vector for a given word, but what does the second matrix signify? More specifically, what does each of those values (ie. 17, 24, 1 etc) mean?
