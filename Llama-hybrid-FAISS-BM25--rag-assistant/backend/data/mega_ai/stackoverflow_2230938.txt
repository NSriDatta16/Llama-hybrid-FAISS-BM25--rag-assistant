The ToolTip that appears in the object tree looks significant to me. It probably wires a event handler for the RowSelected event so it can update the tip. Clearly you are using a 3rd party control, it smells like Infragistics. Not a company well known for the quality of its products. I'd further guess that the ToolTip is internal to its control and that you can't access it to forcibly unsubscribe the event handler. Beyond giving up on tool tips, if that's even possible, you can't do much but contact the vendor for support. Or ditch the control.
