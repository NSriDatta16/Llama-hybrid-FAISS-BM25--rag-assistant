When 2 process need to communicate, they need to decide of a common/shared way to express things and a protocol to exchange those things. In your case, since one of the processes is a browser, the protocol of choice is http. So the browser needs to do an http request or regular http request to your python process. This python process Will need in Some way or another to be exposed via http. There are several ways to build a web server in python. You should read this article : http://fragments.turtlemeat.com/pythonwebserver.php as a jumpstart. Once you have this, your browser Will be able to issue HTTP GET requests to your server and your server can reply with a string. This string can be whatever you like. Nevertheless if your answer contains structured data it can be a good start to use the XML notation or the json notation. Json (stands for Javascript object notation) is very easy to use in javascript and this is why many people advised you to choose this notation. I hope this will help you JÃ©rome wagner
