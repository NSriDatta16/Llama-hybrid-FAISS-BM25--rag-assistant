How to enter IV in logistic Regression for testing significance

for my thesis I need to build a logistic regression model and test the significance of several indicators on a certain outcome, that is testing if the independent variables has a significant effect on the dependent variable. For the first try, I entered all the IV simultaneously, resulting in a significant LLR p-Value, but some of the IV dont have a significant p-Value or dont have the effect on the AV that I was expecting. Obviously some Variables are some sort of confounders. Therefore I came up with trying to build seperate models for each IV. Each model had the effect that I was expecting of the IV and were also significant but I'm not sure if this would be the correct proceeding for testing the indicators, as I think any valid Information that is entered to the blank constant regression model is somehow significant. I'm not so much interested in what indicator is the best for predicting the outcome (which would yield in a forced entry of the IV to the model) but as I mentioned I just want to know if the indicators are signifcant concerning the AV. What would your suggestion be in this particular case?
