PyParsing does a great job. The PyParsing wiki was killed so here is another location where there are examples of the use of PyParsing ( example link ). One reason for investing a little time with pyparsing is that he has also written a very brief very well organized O'Reilly Short Cut manual that is also inexpensive. Having said that, I use BeautifulSoup a lot and it is not that hard to deal with the entities issues, you can convert them before you run BeautifulSoup. Goodluck
