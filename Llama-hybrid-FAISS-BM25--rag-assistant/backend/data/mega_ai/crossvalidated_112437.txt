Ignore the forest part for a moment, even a single tree can do regression. Each leaf holds a prediction value, which no longer is a class for regression. Given an input feature vector, you simply walk the tree as you'd do for a classification problem, and the resulting value in the leaf node is the prediction. For a forest, simply averaging the prediction of each tree is valid, although you may want to investigate if that's sufficiently robust for your application.
