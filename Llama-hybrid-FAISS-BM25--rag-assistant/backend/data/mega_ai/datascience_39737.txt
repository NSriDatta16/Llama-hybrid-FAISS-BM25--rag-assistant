Building Recommender for book paragraphs

I have some application which are offering a book to read. Users normally read some paragraphs of it only (it contains +6000 paragraphs). Looking at scatter for users vs paragraphs: Which you can see is semi equal distributed. Using SVD algorithm for matrix factoize gives a semi random predictions. I have total of 18k records of user read paragraphs. Looking for users, it seems that a user is reading semi random set (i.e. it is hard to specify common topics for a single user readings) Can you suggest me how to produce suggestions related to each user ?
