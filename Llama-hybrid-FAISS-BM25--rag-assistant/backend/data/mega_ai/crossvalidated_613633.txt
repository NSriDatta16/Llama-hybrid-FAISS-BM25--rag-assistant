Minimax Lower Bound on Mean Squared Error for average treatment effect in a Bernoulli randomized design?

Does anyone know of any references that show a proof of Minimax Lower Bound on Mean Squared Error for the average treatment effect in a Bernoulli randomized design? Take a population of $n$ units for which we apply a treatment $Z$ drawn from a Bernoulli distribution, independently for each unit ( $Z_i \sim Ber(p)$ ). Then, for the average treatment effect defined as $ATE = \mathbb{E}[Y(1) - Y(0)]$ , I would like to show that $$\inf\limits_{\widehat{ATE}} \sup\limits_{M \in \mathcal{M}} \mathbb{E}_M[(\widehat{ATE} - ATE(M))^2] = \Omega(1/n),$$ where $\mathcal{M}$ denotes the set of viable instances. I'm trying to use LeCam's method (see Chapter 7 in John Duchi's notes ), but am not seeing how to show this, even for a linear potential outcomes model. I'm trying to show a much simpler result than in this paper (Theorem 2), but where there is no interference between subjects. I appreciate any leads or references on this!
