What makes the most sense based on the source of the data? We cannot answer this question for you, the computer cannot answer this question for you. The reason that we still need statisticians instead of just statistical programs is because of questions like this. Statistics is about more than just crunching the numbers, it is about understanding the question and the source of the data and being able to make decisions based on the science and background and other information outside the data that the computer looks at. Your teacher is probably hoping that you will contemplate this as part of the assignment. If I had assigned a problem like this (and I have before) I would be more interested in the justification of your answer than which you actually chose. It is probably beyond your current class, but one approach if there is not a clear scientific reason for prefering one model over the other is model averaging, you fit both models (and maybe several other models as well), then you average together the predictions (often weighted by the goodness of fit of the different models). Another option, when possible, is to collect more data and if possible choosing the x values so that it becomes more clear what the non-linear vs. interaction effects are. There are some tools for comparing the fit of non-nested models (AIC, BIC, etc.), but for this case they probably will not show enough difference to overrule understanding of where the data comes from and what makes the most sense.
