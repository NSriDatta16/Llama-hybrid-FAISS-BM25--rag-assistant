Difference between ~lp() or simply ~ in R's locfit

(Please note the cross-post at https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7626347/difference-between-lp-or-simply-in-rs-locfit ) I am not sure I see the difference between different examples for local logistic regression in the documentation of the gold standard locfit package for R: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/locfit/locfit.pdf I get starkingly different results with fit2 from fit2 . What is the nature of the difference? Maybe that can help me phrase which I wanted. I had in mind an index linear in bl within a logistic link function predicting the probability of closed_rule. The documentation of lp says that it fits a local polynomial -- which is great, but I thought that would happen even if I leave it out. And in any case, the documentation has examples for "local logistic regression" either way...
