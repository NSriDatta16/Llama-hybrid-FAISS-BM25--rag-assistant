How can I merge my files when the folder structure has changed

I want to perform a major codebase reorganization, but I'm unable to proceed unless I can provide a way for trunk fixes to be easily applied to branches that were taken before the reorganization. One approach I was considering was to apply the reorganization to to all of the support branches, but this is potentially destabilising. A preferred approach would be to provide a merge tool that can take into account the updated file locations. Any suggestions on how I could implement this?
