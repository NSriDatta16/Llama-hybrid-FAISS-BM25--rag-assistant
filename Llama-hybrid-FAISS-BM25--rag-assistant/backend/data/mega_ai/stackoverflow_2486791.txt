How do i cast an object to a string when object is not a string?

-Edit- Alternative question/example How do i cast A to object to class A when B can typcast to A? I have class A, B, C. They all can implicitly convert to a string public static implicit operator A(string sz_) { ... return sz; } I have code that does this object AClassWhichImplicitlyConvertsToString { ... ((IKnownType)(String)AClassWhichImplicitlyConvertsToString).KnownFunc() } The problem is, AClassWhichImplicitlyConvertsToString isnt a string even though it can be typecast into one implicitly. I get a bad cast exception. How do i say its ok as long as the class has an operator to convert into a string?
