How can I mix Hibernate and Swing in a good manner

I have some questions about interaction with Hibernate: Do I use openSession or getCurrentSession (without jta, thread instead)? How do I mix session operations with the Swing GUI? Is good have something like the following code in a JavaBean class? public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) { // session code } Can I add methods to my entities that contains HQL queries or is this a bad practice? For example: // This method is in an entity MyOtherEntity.java class public int getDuration(){ Session session = HibernateUtil.getSessionFactory().getCurrentSession(); session.beginTransaction(); int sum = (Integer) session.createQuery("select sum(e.duration) as duration from MyEntity as e where e.myOtherEntity.id=:id group by e.name"). .setLong("id", getId()); .uniqueResult(); return sum; } How can I do this in a better and elegant way? UPDATE A widely used practice is to make a service/dao class to achieve CRUD operation of our entities class. But why is this good? Why do I have to write a class for each my entities to manage it? Where is the real advantage? UPDATE 2 Service class is a DAO pattern? What does this mean? Arthur Ronald F D Garcia's repository example is a DAO pattern, is this what is called a "service layer"?
