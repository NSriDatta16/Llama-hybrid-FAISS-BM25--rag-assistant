If you app. has a GUI and you have access to a web site/server, JWS might be the answer. The JNLP API that is available to JWS apps. provides services such as the PersistenceService. Here is a small demo. of the PersistenceService . The idea would be to check for the XML in the JWS persistence store. If it is not there, write it there, otherwise use the cached version. If it changes, write a new version to the store. The demo. writes to the store at shut-down, and reads at start-up. But there is no reason it could not be called by a menu item, timer etc.
