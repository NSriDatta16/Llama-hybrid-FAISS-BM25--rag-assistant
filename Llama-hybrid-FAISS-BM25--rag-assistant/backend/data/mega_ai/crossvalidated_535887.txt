Averaging class labels doesn't make sense. Usually in tree based methods, each decision tree predicts a probability distribution over the classes based on the number of samples of each class in the leaf. The final prediction is obtained by averaging each tree's probability. The predicted class is the class that has the highest mean probability. Note that this procedure is not dependent on the number of classes.
