I've only dipped the top of my toe into operations research, so I welcome comments on this suggestion. Basically, you have what I think is an optimization problem (trying to get the most accurate estimates for each surface). I think you have a problem that can be solved through solving as a series of simultaneous equations using either linear or nonlinear programming. This falls squarely into operations research, and is outside my area of expertise. I don't think you can use a Markov Chain process for this as you don't have transitional probabilities.
