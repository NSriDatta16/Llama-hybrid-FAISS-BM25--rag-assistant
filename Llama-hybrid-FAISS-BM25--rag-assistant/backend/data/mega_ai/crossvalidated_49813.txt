I think you need some kind of weighted average - eg $w_1 p_1 + w_2 p_2 + w_3 p_+ w_3 p_3+ w_4 p_4+ w_4 p_4+ w_5 p_5$ where the sum of the $w$s is 1; in fact, all the $w_i = \frac{1}{5}$ as a starting point. This basically ignores the interaction of "Player X is particularly good with Player Y" but I think will give you a very good start. If you don't know $p_3$, $p_4$, $p_5$, etc just increase the $w_1$ and $w_2$ accordingly (so they add to 1).
