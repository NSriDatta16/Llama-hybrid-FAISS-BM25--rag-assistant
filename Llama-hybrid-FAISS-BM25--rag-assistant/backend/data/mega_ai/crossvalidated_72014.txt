The points you are making are valid, but there are also arguments that if not counter to yours, they create a dilemma: When trying to estimate and forecast extreme cases, incorporating information from "normal times" may "average" your predictor, which would then be more reliable to estimate long-term trends rather than short-term (and severe) fluctuations. Models that describe well both these aspects are still not available, because we do not yet understand well how "normal times" breed their own crises (in "normal times" I include the concept of a business cycle - a crisis is something much more severe). One could build three models: one based just on "crisis data", one based on only "normal times" data, and one based on both data. Comparing the three in terms of their forecasts would be very valuable. Also one could implement "model-averaging" on the two "pure" models and compare its forecasts with the "both kind of data" model forecasts. Since they are a large corporation and only in it for the money, this multiplication of resources allocation to estimate their sales can be justified -and financed.
