If you are not using linear activation functions then you cannot exactly copy your neural network model to a linear regression model. This would be like asking "I have a quadratic model $y=x^2$, how can I use linear regression to make this $y=ax+b$?" If you want to approximate the neural network outputs with a regression model then you should just create many random inputs, calculate the outputs, and use this set of data to make a linear regression model.
