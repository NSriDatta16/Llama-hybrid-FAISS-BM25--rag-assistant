Based on your description, it appears a multinomial logistic regression is appropriate. Assuming your outcome is a factor with 7 levels (one of the 7 buying options), then you can quickly predict membership using a multinomial logistic regression model (see ?multinom in the nnet package in R). If your outcome cannot be combined into a factor with 7 levels, then a cluster analysis would be needed to group the items together before fitting the multinomial logistic regression.
