MAP vs Bayes Estimator

When it comes to Bayesian Inference, we are interested in estimating the Posterior Distribution of some model parameter(s) based on the data we observe and some Prior Probability Distribution. After defining the form of the Posterior Distribution, we are usually interested in one of two things: MAP Estimator ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_a_posteriori_estimation ): This is the "mode" of the Posterior Distribution (i.e. most common point) Bayes Estimator ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_estimator ): This is the "expected value" of the Posterior Distribution (note: I think this is closer to what is typically done in Frequentist Estimation) My Question: I am trying to understand in what kinds of situations would we be more interested in the MAP Estimator and in what kinds of situations would be more interested in the Bayes Estimator. Informally looking at references, it seems like the MAP Estimator tends to be used more often than the Bayes Estimator - but I can not seem to find a (simpler) reference or understand why this is the case. For example - suppose I flip a coin 100 times and observe "n" heads. I happen to believe that some specific Beta Distribution (e.g. Beta ~ a,b) is well suited to be a prior. Thus, I can now define the Posterior Distribution for "p" (the probability of success). As I understand, I have the option of finding out the determining the MAP of "p" or the Bayes Estimator of "p". What are the advantages and the disadvantages of choosing either of these estimators for "p"? Can someone please help me understand this? Thanks! Note: Suppose I have 10 numbers that represent the number of lakes in countries on some continent : 234, 132, 87, 76, 199, 501, 612, 882, 0,0 . The "mode" of these numbers is 0 and the "mean" is 272. I could say that the average number of lakes for countries in this continent is 272 whereas 20% of countries in this continent have no lakes. At first, I would have argued that in this case, the "mean" (analogous to the concept of the Bayes Estimator) provides us with "more useful information" when compared to the "mode" (analogous to the concept of the MAP) - but after thinking about this some more, I am not so sure. I think the choice of "MAP" vs "Bayes Estimator" might depend on the specific question of interest - but I am not sure how I can conceptualize what types of questions are better answered with "MAP" vs "Bayes Estimator"
