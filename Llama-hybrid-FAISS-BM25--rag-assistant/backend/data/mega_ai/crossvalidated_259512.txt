For a logistic regression of a 2 by 2 table using `glm` in `R`, is using `cbind` or using a full data matrix for the response the correct method?

For a 2 by 2 table that looks like: Response No Response Treatment Given 25 60 Treatment Not Given 55 43 We may fit a logistic regression by introducing the table as a binomial relationthrough cbind : glm(formula = cbind(c(25, 60),c(55, 43)) ~ as.factor(c(1, 0)), family = binomial()) It seems from reading through related posts on this topic that another option exists, by using: DAT with model: glm(DAT[,2]~DAT[,1], family = binomial()) Now, the FIRST MODEL outputs: Call: glm(formula = cbind(c(25, 60), c(55, 43)) ~ as.factor(c(1, 0)), family = binomial()) Coefficients: (Intercept) as.factor(c(1, 0))1 0.3331 -1.1216 Degrees of Freedom: 1 Total (i.e. Null); 0 Residual Null Deviance: 13.42 Residual Deviance: -7.55e-15 AIC: 13.75 while the SECOND MODEL outputs: Call: glm(formula = DAT[, 2] ~ DAT[, 1], family = binomial()) Coefficients: (Intercept) DAT[, 1] 0.3331 -1.1216 Degrees of Freedom: 182 Total (i.e. Null); 181 Residual Null Deviance: 252.8 Residual Deviance: 239.3 AIC: 243.3 The coefficient estimates and p-values are the SAME, but they differ on the degree of freedom and Null/Residual deviance. The question is: are these two models the same or are they actually different? Which one is the correct one? Thanks!
