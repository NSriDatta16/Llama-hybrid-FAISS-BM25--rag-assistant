JSPs are a shortcut to write a servlet. In fact they are translated to servlet java code before compilation. (You can check it under some tomcat subdir wich I don't remember the name). To choose between servlet an JSP I use a simple rule: if the page contains more html code than java code, go for JSP, otherwise just write a servlet. In general that translates roughly to: use JSPs for content presentation and servlets for control, validation, etc. Also, Its easier to organize and structure your code inside a servlet, since it uses the plain java class syntax. JSPs tend to be more monolithic, although its possible to create methods inside then.
