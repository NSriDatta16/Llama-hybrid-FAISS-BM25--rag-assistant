Obviously it all depends on the complexity of the application you're building. In average, the pages of our application take up to 20 MB (min) of memory. That's because there's a lot of objects in the session, and a lot of initialisation process that occur before the script can even say hello world (authentification, rights management, notifications, ...) There's a lot of things that go in the memory space, including classes definitions, globals, function definitions, etc. Reducing the amount of loaded classes (by using auto-includes) is a good way to keep your scripts with only the necessary amount of classes definitions. I don't know if loading up extensions changes the memory usage - that should be something to test, because by default we may not need all the default loaded extensions ?
