How do I change the colors of an arbitrary widget in GTK+?

If I'm writing an application that wants to communicate some information through the use of color, how can I change the background and foreground colors of a given widget? I would like to know how to do this in glade if it's possible, as well as programmatically (to a computed color). I want to know how to do this to a complex widget as well, for example, an HBox that contains a VBox that contains some Labels . Ideally this would also include a solution solution that allows me to tint the widget's existing colors, and identify the average colors of any images in use by the theme, so that I can programmatically compensate for any color choices which might make text unreadable or otherwise clashing - but I would be happy if I could just turn a button red.
