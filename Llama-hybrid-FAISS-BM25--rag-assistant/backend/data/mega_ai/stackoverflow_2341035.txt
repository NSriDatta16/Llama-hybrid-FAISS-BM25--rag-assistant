Well, there are various different things to consider here: The types exposed by .NET What's available What each type is called What ends up being aliased by other languages, e.g. C# using int to mean System.Int32 Personally I would have preferred Float32 and Float64 as the CLR types. I can certainly see some confusion in F# naming the types "float" (for System.Double ) and "float32" (for System.Single ). I wouldn't want Decimal to be called Float128 ; possibly Decimal128 to allow for other similar types though. Note that Byte isn't UInt8 by the way - presumably because bytes are usually used for arbitrary binary storage rather than for genuinely numberic quantities. I don't think there's very much reason to have arbitrary values for Int though. At least, I suspect the usage is sufficiently specialised to relegate it to a custom class library rather than making it part of the framework. (Note, however, that BigInteger is part of .NET 4.0.)
