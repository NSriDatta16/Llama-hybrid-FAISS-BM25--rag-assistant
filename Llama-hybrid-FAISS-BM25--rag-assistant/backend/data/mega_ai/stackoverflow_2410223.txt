Programmatically adding jQuery UI Sliders causing problems

I'm currently adding a div to use as a slider programmatically, but when I apply the slider to it, everything appears but I can't drag the handle nor do any of the hover states work correctly. var container = $(' '); var slider_div = $(' '); $(slider_div).slider(); container.append(slider_div); $placeholder = $("#"+player_id); $placeholder.append(container); I've tried all number of combinations of adding the slider div to no avail, and I'm just wondering if there's something I don't know about that I've missed. Physically adding a to the page gets the slider working, but that's not an option.
