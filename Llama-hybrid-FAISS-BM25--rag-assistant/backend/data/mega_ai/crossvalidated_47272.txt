Random forest like procedure for regression or other statistical models

I'm wondering if there exist methods similar to one used in random forest algorithm - I mean taking simultaneously bootstrap sample and random subset of features, then building statistisal model. Have anyone took this approach for building set of regression models ? Is this approach ( random subsample plus random subset of features ) somehow universal ? Edition : the question is all about the possibility of putting some other model in the place of classification tree in random forest, what is left is some kind of meta-algorithm (as bagging can be view as meta-algorithm) = bagging + random subsets of variables
