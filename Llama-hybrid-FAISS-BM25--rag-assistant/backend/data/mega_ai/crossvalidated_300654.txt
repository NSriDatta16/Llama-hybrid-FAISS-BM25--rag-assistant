Confusing notation for the Probability of Continuous Random Variables

I am reading Kevin Murphy's book Machine Learning a Probabilistic Perspective , and I came across some notation in chapter 2 that is a bit confusing. Here is a screenshot Basically, for equation 2.20, the the P for probability becomes upper case, compared to the p in equation 2.19 (and everywhere before it). Is this a typo or am I missing something. Thanks in advance.
