How can I bind against two DynamicResources?

I am trying to bind the value of an element to a first resource , if present, then another one otherwise. In other words, if the resources look like Hello World my element's value would hold Hello But if the resources have only World the value would be World I have tried a number of solution but none seems to work or is elegant enough. I wish I could write ... where the converter takes care of finding the first non null value. However, WPF does not allow mixing DynamicResource and MultiBinding Do you have a solution?
