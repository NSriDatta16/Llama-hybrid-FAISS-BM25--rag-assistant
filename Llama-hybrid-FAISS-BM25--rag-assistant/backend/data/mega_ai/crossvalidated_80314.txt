Why direct oblimin rotation results in greater eigen values?

I came across this in the Wikipedia page about Factor Analysis. Is that true that direct oblimin rotation results in greater eigen values ? If that is true, what's the reason behind it and does it generalize to other oblique rotations ? (to avoid any confusions consider we only consider PCA as the factor extraction methods)
