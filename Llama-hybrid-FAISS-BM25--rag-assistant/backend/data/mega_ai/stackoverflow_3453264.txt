The reason you can't do it is because it's not safe in the general case. Consider the possibilities. If you want to be able to do this because the base and derived class are interchangeable, then you really only have one class and you should merge the two. If you want to have your cast operator for the convenience of being able to downcast base to derived, then you have to consider that not every variable typed as the base class will point to an instance of the specific derived class you are trying to cast it to. It might be that way, but you would have to check first, or risk an invalid cast exception. That's why downcasting is generally frowned upon and this is nothing more than downcasting in drag. I suggest you rethink your design.
