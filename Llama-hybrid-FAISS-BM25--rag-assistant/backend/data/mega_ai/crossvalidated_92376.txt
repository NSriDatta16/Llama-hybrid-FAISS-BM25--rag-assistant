Expectation expansion query

I am trying to do a proof. Define the best Bayesian estimator by $\theta^B=E(\theta|x)$. Prove that for another estimator $\gamma$ of $\theta$, we have $MSE(\theta^B)\leq$$MSE(\gamma)$. Proof: $E((\gamma-\theta)^2)=E(((\gamma-\theta^B)+(\theta^B-\theta))^2)$. In my book, they now expand out but instead of the cross term which I would expect, namely $2E[(\gamma-\theta^B)(\theta^B-\theta)]$, they get $2E[(\gamma-\theta^B)$$E(\theta^B-\theta|X)]$. How do they get this? I though may be they were using the tower law $E(E[X|Y])=X$ but that doesn't seem to quite fit
