If you want something that is built already build the sample application that comes with Agile Web Development on Rails, buy the pdf from pragprog.com , the latest version is set to work with Rails 2.2, so will work with 2.3 as all the basic features of the framework will be the same. When you are ready to move on from that, the Rails Guides website is all new and is a great resource for all developers new and old. dwc is right though, a blog is a good thing to start on your own, so when you are confident give it a go, even if you don't put it in production it will help you along.
