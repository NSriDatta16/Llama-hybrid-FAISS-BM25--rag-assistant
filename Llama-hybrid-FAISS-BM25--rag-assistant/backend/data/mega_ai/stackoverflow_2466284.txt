The first line of a paragraph is indented by default, thus whether or not you have \indent there won't make a difference. \indent and \noindent can be used to override default behavior. You can see this by replacing your line with the following: Now we are engaged in a great civil war.\\ \indent this is indented\\ this isn't indented \noindent override default indentation (not indented)\\ asdf
