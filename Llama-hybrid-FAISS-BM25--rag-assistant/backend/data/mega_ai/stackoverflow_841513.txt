How do I get SQL SELECT @variable = expression assignments to work like a spreadsheet?

I'm writing a stored procedure for SQL Anywhere 9.0.2, here's some code: ... declare @v_d datetime, @v_d1 datetime, @v_d2 datetime .... select @v_d1 = @v_d, @v_d2 = dateadd(dd, 1, @v_d1) ... it turns out that @v_d2 will not be set as expected. if I modify it to: ... declare @v_d datetime, @v_d1 datetime, @v_d2 datetime .... select @v_d1 = @v_d select @v_d2 = dateadd(dd, 1, @v_d1) ... nothing happens, all the same. finally, I changed it to : ... declare @v_d datetime, @v_d1 datetime, @v_d2 datetime .... begin select @v_d1 = @v_d end begin select @v_d2 = dateadd(dd, 1, @v_d1) end ... now it works fine, looks kind of stupid though. my question is: is it a known issue? or maybe I could do it more neatly? any comments will be appreciated. thanks!
