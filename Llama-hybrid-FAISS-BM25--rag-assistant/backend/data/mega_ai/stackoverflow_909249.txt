Perhaps it's because you're opening some .class files outside the jar file? That way it may not display the warning. I tried doing it that way but it still showed me the certificate warning and for a simple case it actually prevented me from accessing a class from the JAR with the separated class. Maybe your specific setup or file organization causes that behavior. If you can layout that in more detail we could help better (or rather, try putting all those .class files in yet another signed Jar and add it to the archive"..., anotherJar.jar").
