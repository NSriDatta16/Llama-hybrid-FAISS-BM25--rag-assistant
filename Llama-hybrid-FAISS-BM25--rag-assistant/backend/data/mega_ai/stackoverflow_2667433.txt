You could much more easily write another property in your partial that just references this one in it's get/set, then just use that property in your code. For example I'd rename the generated one for SQL to something like DayOfWeekStorage or DayOfWeekSQL and then do this in the partial: public int DayOfWeek { get { return DayOfWeekStorage -1; } set { DayOfWeekStorage = value + 1; } }
