Well without the proper rights it really becomes more tedious and less than ideal. One way that I would recommend though is to drop all of your constraints and indexes and then add them again once the data has been imported/exported. Not an elegant solution but it'll process really fast. EDIT: Another option is to create an SSIS package where you specifically dump the tables in an order that won't violate the constraints.
