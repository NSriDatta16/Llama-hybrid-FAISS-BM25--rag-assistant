Time series forecasting via decomposition and component-wise modelling

Consider a time series $t_{k} = d_{k} + s_{k}$, where $d_{k}$ is a deterministic series (trend or periodic component, for example) and $s_{k}$ - a stochastic process, for example, ARMA(p,q)-GARCH(P,Q). Is it correct to fit ARMA-GARCH part after $d_{k}$ vanishing? Assuming we don't know anything about the type of $d_{k}$, what is the best way to vanish the trend? Is wavelet thresholding a good technique for this? Is it correct to predict $k+1, k+2, \dots$ values of $t_{k}$ by extrapolating $d_{k}$, predicting $s_{k}$ and summing up these values?
