It can be optimised, but the easiest approach would be to reorganize your content architecture to better suit your needs and requirements. Straight from XSLT there is no easy solution, but with a bit of coding you can fAirly easily get all your content items based on your specific template. It would look something like this: Item myTemplate = Sitecore.Context.Database.GetItem( "id-of-your-template" ); LinkItem[] li = Sitecore.Globals.LinkDataBase.GetReferrers( myTemplate ); // li now holds a list of LinkItem for items that are based on your template List myItems = new List (); foreach( LinkItem l in li ) myItems.Add( li.SourceItem() ); // your additional processing/filtering here Keep in mind, this is a very non-specific example of how this can be achieved. I would need to know a lot more about your solution to come up with a better response. And I still feel, the best approach is probably still to look at your information architecture.
