Vim: Error format matches everything

I am trying to match the following error with efm : AssertionError: 1 == 2 at /home/strager/projects/blah/blah.js:13:37 The error message can be anything (i.e. it doesn't always match the AssertionError: .* or .*Error: .* formats). The general format is: errormessage at filename:line:column My problem is that the error message matches any line; I need to restrict the error message to one line only, and only match if it's followed by a matching "at" line. I have tried the following efm : set efm=%Z\ \ \ \ at\ %f:%l:%c,%E%m " %Z at %f:%l:%c,%E%m This almost works, but it matches status lines (e.g. non-errors before and after the error) in addition to the errors. How can I force %E%m ... %Z to be only two lines total (one for the error message, and one for the at line)? I have access to the standard UNIX tools for makeprg if needed.
