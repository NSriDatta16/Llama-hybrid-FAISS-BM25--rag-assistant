There's some problems with the way you're asking the question, as far as I can tell (or perhaps i'm misreading your question). So, frequentist hypothesis testing says given that the null hypothesis $H_0: \theta \in \Theta_0$ is true (versus $H_1: \theta \in \Theta_1$), reject $H_0$ if the test statistic $T = \frac{\sup_{\theta \in \Theta_1} p(D | \theta)}{\sup_{\theta \in \Theta_0} p(D | \theta)}$ is sufficiently large. Notice that at no point in this is there any indication that $\theta$ is a random variable. The unknown value $\theta$ is considered fixed and unknown. Thus a null hypothesis of $H_0: \theta = 0$ (i.e a single-valued hypothesis) is a reasonable hypothesis to pose. In Bayesian hypothesis testing, there is no notion of assuming $H_0$ to be true - just a prior distribution on $\theta$ that weights the various hypotheses. You base your acceptance/rejection criterion on a ratio depending on $p(\theta|H_0)$ and $p(\theta|H_1)$. Notice that $\theta$ is has the posterior distribution associated to it, and so a statement like $H_0:\theta = 0$ will have posterior probability of 0 if the posterior for $\theta$ is a continuous distribution, and so in such cases, it doesn't make sense to have such a null hypothesis - rather you desire to ask $H_0: \theta \in \Theta_0$ for $\Theta_0$ being small interval containing 0, or something like that. Note that the statements $p(\theta|H_0)$ and $p(\theta|H_1)$ are completely meaningless in frequentist testing. Note also that posterior probabilities in no way correspond to p-values - the posterior probabilities are probabilities on $\theta$ given the fixed data $D$ while p-values ask about probabilities of the random data $D$ given fixed $\theta$. These two approaches ask fundamentally different questions. The former asks what you should believe about $\theta$ based on the observed data (and only the observed data), and the latter asks whether your data is extreme assuming the null hypothesis is true (i.e. it considers hypothetical data). Your question asks whether you can get some sort of frequentist bounds on the posterior probabilities given that $H_0$ is true. I suppose you can ask how the posterior probabilities would vary if the data were to vary according to the null hypothesis, as a measure of sensitivity of the posterior to the data. But this wouldn't answer the original hypothesis testing question of whether to accept/reject the hypotheses based on the available data. I hope I haven't misinterpreted your question and I hope this even makes sense and is correct...
