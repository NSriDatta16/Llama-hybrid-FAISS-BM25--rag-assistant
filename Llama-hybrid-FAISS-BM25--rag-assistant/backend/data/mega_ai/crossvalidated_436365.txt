The answer is: you don't know (in general) unless you try :) Say you want to choose between SVM, a Random Forest and KNN. You evaluate their performances on a test set, ending up with three scores (one per model). How to tell which model is better than the other? You use statistics. Most of the things you want to know on this subject are here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.12808.pdf . (On a separate note, I think in your specific case you need a model that can handle time-series, as it appears that your data is dependent on time.)
