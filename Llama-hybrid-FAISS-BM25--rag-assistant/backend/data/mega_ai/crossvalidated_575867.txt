SMOTE parameters optimization problem

I have a date set with 3 imbalanced groups: 10%, 3%, and 88%. I am using the SMOTE algorithm (in the R SMOTE family package) to up-scale the 2 minority groups. I did this twice: dup_size = 3 and 6 respectively for each minority group. This new groups are: 27%, 13%, and 60% dup_size = 6 and 25, resulting in: 31%, 30%, and 39%. Afterwards, I did a ordinal logistic regression. With the first dup-size parameters, none of the instances were classified into the the second class (i.e., all instances were classified in the first or second group). But with the second dup-size parameters, instances were classified into the 3 classes (although the accuracy was low). It seems that the dup_size parameter effects the ordinal logistic regression classification. Should it effect the classification? If so, how do I define the correct dup-size? and if not, what is my error?
