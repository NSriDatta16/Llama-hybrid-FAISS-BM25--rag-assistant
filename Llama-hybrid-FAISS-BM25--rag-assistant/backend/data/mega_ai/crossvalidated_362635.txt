I reckon comparing estimators on samples of different size was the basic idea of Student's test, followed by the work of Fisher on the degree of freedom. So the answer is YES, provided each sample is iid (identical independant distribution) and that you unbias the standard deviation by the correct degree of freedom. Unless you use extra parameters (seasonality, exogenous variable,...) compare $\sigma_{SES} = \sqrt{\frac {SSE} {n-1}}$ for the Single Exponential Smoothing (which estimates 1 parameter), $\sigma_{DES} = \sqrt{\frac {SSE} {n-2}}$ for the Double Exponential Smoothing (which estimates 2 parameters), $\sigma_{MA} = \sqrt{\frac {SSE} {n-1}}$ for the weighted or not weighted average (which estimates 1 parameters), In the above $SS$ is the Sum of Square of the Error and $n$ is the sample size which of course dependent of the sample.
