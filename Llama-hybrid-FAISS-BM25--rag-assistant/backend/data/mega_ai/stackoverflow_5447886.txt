Reformatting xts object based on criteria

I have an xts object with series of monthly compounded returns of stocks in the following form: AALBERTS ABN_AMRO ABN_LNAM ACCELL_G AEGON___ 1973-01 NA NA NA NA NA 1973-02 NA NA NA NA -4.42149834 1973-03 NA NA NA NA 0.03759308 1973-04 NA NA NA NA -1.09827283 1973-05 NA NA NA NA -7.30252682 1973-06 NA NA NA NA -8.98970349 1973-07 NA NA NA NA -5.59685493 : : : : : : : : : : : : I would like to make the following selection: select only those stocks, which have both valid returns data at time t and valid returns data in the previous t-12 months. The stocks, which fulfil the mentioned criteria, need to be added to a separate xts object formatted in the following way: 1974-01 AEGON___ 1974-01 1974-01 : : : 1974-02 So far I wasn't able to solve this issue, as my experience and understanding of R is very limited at this moment, so any help is appreciated.
