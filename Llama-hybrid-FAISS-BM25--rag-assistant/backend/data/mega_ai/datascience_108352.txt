Reconstruct low dimensional PCA projection

Suppose I have high dimensional data (say 32 dimension) and I projected the data onto 2D space. How can I project (or approximate) these 2 dimensional point back onto the original 32 dimensions. \ In particular, I wish to approximate any random point in 2D to the original space. Explanation through python code is much appreciated.
