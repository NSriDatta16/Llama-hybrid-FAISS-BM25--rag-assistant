A useful approach when the variable is used as an independent factor in regression is to replace it by two variables: one is a binary indicator of whether it is zero and the other is the value of the original variable or a re-expression of it, such as its logarithm. This technique is discussed in Hosmer & Lemeshow's book on logistic regression (and in other places, I'm sure). Truncated probability plots of the positive part of the original variable are useful for identifying an appropriate re-expression. (See the analysis at https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/30749/919 for examples.) When the variable is the dependent one in a linear model, censored regression (like Tobit ) can be useful, again obviating the need to produce a started logarithm. This technique is common among econometricians.
