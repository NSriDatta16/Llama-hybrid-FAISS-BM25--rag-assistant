Having not read the whole paper, the wording of your quote sticks out at me Given that the base resolution of the detector is 24x24, the exhaustive set of rectangle features is quite large, over 180,000 . Note that unlike the Haar basis, the set of rectangle features is overcomplete. "The set of rectangle features is overcomplete" "Exhaustive set" it sounds to me like a set up, where I expect the paper writer to follow up with an explaination for how they cull the search space down to a more effective set, by, for example, getting rid of trivial cases such as rectangles with zero surface area. edit: or using some kind of machine learning algorithm, as the abstract hints at. Exhaustive set implies all possibilities, not just "reasonable" ones.
