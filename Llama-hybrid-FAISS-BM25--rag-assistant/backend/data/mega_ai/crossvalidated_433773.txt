You can get the change in odds by taking the anti-log of the coefficients, but the effect is not additive but multiplicative. $ \ln\left(\frac{\mathrm{Pr}}{1-\mathrm{Pr}}\right) = \ln(\mathrm{odds}) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2 $ $ \exp(\ln(\mathrm{odds})) = \exp(\beta_0 + \beta_1 x_1 + \beta_2 x_2) $ $ \mathrm{odds} = \exp(\beta_0) \times \exp(\beta_1 x_1) \times \exp(\beta_2 x_2) $ If we now look at what happens when $x_1$ increases by $1$ , we get: $ \mathrm{odds} = \exp(\beta_0) \times \exp(\beta_1 (x_1+1)) \times \exp(\beta_2 x_2) $ $ \mathrm{odds} = \exp(\beta_0) \times \exp(\beta_1 x_1 + \beta_1) \times \exp(\beta_2 x_2) $ $ \mathrm{odds} = \exp(\beta_0) \times \exp(\beta_1 x_1) \times \exp(\beta_1) \times \exp(\beta_2 x_2) $ So if we compute the ratio of the old and the new odds: $ \frac{\mathrm{odds_{new}}}{\mathrm{odds_{old}}} = \frac{\exp(\beta_0) \times \exp(\beta_1 x_1) \times \exp(\beta_1) \times \exp(\beta_2 x_2)}{\exp(\beta_0) \times \exp(\beta_1 x_1) \times \exp(\beta_2 x_2)} = \exp(\beta_1) $ $\exp(\beta_1)$ is called an odds ratio. Lets say you find an odds ratio of 1.2, then you would interpret that as a unit increase in $x_1$ is associated with an increase in the odds by a factor of 1.2, i.e. the odds needs to be multiplied by 1.2, which corresponds to an increase of 20%. Similarly if we find an odds ratio of 0.8 a unit increase in $x_1$ is associated with a change in the odds by a factor of 0.8, i.e. the new odds is 20% smaller . So no effect is represented by an odds ratio of 1. If you want an additive effect on probabilities you can look at marginal effects. Personally, I consider those as a two-step approximation of a linear probability model. Why would you do something in two steps if you can do so in one? My order of preference would be to use logistic regression and interpret odds ratios, followed by a linear probability model, and never ever ever ever even think about marginal effects. But this ordering is somewhat controversial...
