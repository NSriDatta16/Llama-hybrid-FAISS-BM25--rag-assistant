Markov chain - ergodic theorem

I need help with transition matrix of the following problem On each evening, the owner of a car washes it with probability 0.6. Independently of that event, every night a dirty rain pours on the car with probability 0.2. (the question uses ergodic theorem) In the long run, on which fraction of the mornings is the car clean? my state 1 represents "car is clean" and state 2 represents "car is dirty" I am not sure if my transition matrix is correct
