Your question did not provide an extensive example and it is not clear to me. However, for what I understand, you would like to model a simple logistic regression. It is not clear which kind of plot do you like to produce. I think you need to be more specific regarding your goal. However, you've a simple code to work on: id = "1CA1RPRYqU9oTIaHfSroitnWrI6WpUeBw" d.corona = read.csv(sprintf("https://docs.google.com/uc?id=%s&export=download",id),header = T) results results contains: As you can see, you'll have Odds Ratios . Please be more specific regarding which probabilities you're looking for (predicted probabilities?). A Good reading regarding this topic here . Please note Japan estimation is not computed due to no events in female : df $deceased, df$ sex) female male 0 120 171 1 0 3 As you can see, age is generally the most associated variable with the outcome deceased , while sex did show same features. Notice that Indonesia has different trend in GLM estimates Edits for generating plots Based on your request here a very basic R example for generating plots you need: library(visreg) library(ggplot2) library(gridExtra) id = "1CA1RPRYqU9oTIaHfSroitnWrI6WpUeBw" d.corona = read.csv(sprintf("https://docs.google.com/uc?id=%s&export=download",id),header = T) # Setting needed spaces results Producing these: I would suggest to read visreg documentatio n for improving the plots. Moreover, I would suggest to think on the possibility to dichotomize (i.e 65yrs ) or categorize (i.e. 65yrs ) your age variable. EDT III: Fatality prediction example For the description of the following code reffering here . # Subsetting France df $age), max(df$ age)))), age = seq(min(df $age), max(df$ age))) # Making prediction preds $fit + (critval * preds$ se.fit) lwr $fit - (critval * preds$ se.fit) fit $family$ linkinv(fit) upr2 $family$ linkinv(upr) lwr2 $family$ linkinv(lwr) library(ggplot2) preddata $lwr upr
