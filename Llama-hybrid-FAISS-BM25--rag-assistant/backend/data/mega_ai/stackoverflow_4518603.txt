Is it possible to change the names *shown* for the items in a Java Swing jList?

I have a jList that uses DefaultListModel and I populate it with Objects I get from a list (context: the objects are a type of agent in ABM system). Is it possible to change the name that is shown for the objects in the jList? I haven't been able to find anything on this...
