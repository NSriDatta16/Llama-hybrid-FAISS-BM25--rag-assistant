This depends on what you know about the science behind the data. A mixed model will assume that the structure of all the unobserved pieces (variability within subjects with only 1 obsevation, etc.) is exactly the same as those from which you have more data. Is this an assumption that you consider to be reasonable? The data cannot tell you if this is an assumption you can live with, this has to come from your knowledge of the underlying science. The power (ability of any test to tell you meaningful results) for a binary response variable is more dependent on the smaller of the number of successes and number of failures than the overall sample size, so unless the mean proportion is close to 0.5 in your case you are unlikely to have much power to find anything meaningful with at most 5 observations from a single subject. If you can find some meaningful prior information then a Bayesian approach with informative prior (based on background and science, not the current data) may give you a better chance of getting meaningful answers. Otherwise you will probably need to bound the variance on the random effects to be fairly small to get anything meaningful.
