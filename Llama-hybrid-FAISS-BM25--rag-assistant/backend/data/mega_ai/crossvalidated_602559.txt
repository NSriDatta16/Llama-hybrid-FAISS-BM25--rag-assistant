How can i identify wether a Markov Chain is irreducible?

i am working on understanding Markov-Chains but i have a hard time understanding an irreducible MC. At our uni we have following definitions: "If the set of all states is closed and does not contain any subset that is closed, then DTMC is irreducible Alternative definition: A DTMC is irreducible if every state is reachable from any other state respectively communicates with every other state" Actually, I have understood the definitions so far. But now we have the following question and answer in one of the tasks: "An ergodic Markov chain has not more than 1 absorbing state? Anwser: Ergodicity: Finite, irreducible, aperiodic Markov chain --> Statement: True". As I understood it then, irreducible MC can have one absorbing state. But this would contradict my understanding of the definition of "irreducible", because all non-absorbing states can end up in an absorbing state, but an absorbing state cannot end up in the others. But this contradicts the definition. Why is the Markov chain A ergodic and therefore irreducible and the Markov chain B not?
