How do I add point features from memory rather than a database or file?

I am embedding the MapControl into a C++ application. The application is tied to a proprietary, non-relational database. Therefore, linking the map control directly to GIS data is not feasible. Instead, I want to simply load my own point features into a Feature layer. I understand the mechanics of creating a Feature layer, but they appear to be tied to a data source of some type. How do I load feature data directly into the layer without pointing to a file or database? In other words, I want these features memory resident only.
