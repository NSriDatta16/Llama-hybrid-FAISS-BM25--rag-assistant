At the risk of pointing out the blisteringly obvious... Qt Designer -> File -> New -> Dialog [with buttons/without buttons] -> Create. You then drag widgets from the Widget Box into the dialog. (View -> Widget Box if you can't see it.) If you want auto-sizing support, you drag a Layout into the Dialog, then drag your Widgets into the layout.
