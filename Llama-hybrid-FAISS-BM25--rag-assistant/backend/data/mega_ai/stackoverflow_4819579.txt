I did this in Flash once. What do you mean by local storage area? You can let the user make as many as he wants like this: http://jsfiddle.net/NegYd/14/ using javascript/ jquery. Key being: function appendSticky(){ var e= document.getElementById("submittext").value; $("#stickies").append(" "+e+" "); $.post("store.php", { text: e} );//you'll have to submit user information } and the html: Inside your store.php you then store the stickies into a MySQL Database. $sql="INSERT.." I suggest organizing the stickies with float:left; with a random margin-left value rather than a list for the ultimate post-it feel. Or even better, make the post-its drag-and-dropable.
