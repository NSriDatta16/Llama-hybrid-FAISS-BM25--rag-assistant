Can you generate repeated random samples from the Bayesian network and calculate a test statistic (e.g. some sort of distance metric) that measures how different the each random sample is from the data in question? If so, you can estimate the p-value for an effect of given size from the proportion of random samples giving the same or larger statistic, as Allen Downey describes here .
