Looks like it was a thickbox (Javascript) issue. PHP and Apache work fine when it comes to recognizing the image using mime. If there are arguments in the image URL, eg. (http://127.0.0.1/elegancia/?q=system/files/imagecache/product_full/image_1.jpg&random=1299550719133) - causes Thickbox to show nonsense characters instead due to thickbox image recognition algorithm. URLs not ending with an image extension makes the thickbox javascript to treat the image like another mime type that is not an image. To work around, one needs to modify line 53 of /modules/thickbox/thinkbox.js, by adding " || urlType == '/preview' " to the list of choices in order to make thickbox.js believe in its heart that a Drupal-encoded image link is in fact an image and not an imposter. Assuming your image size is "preview," change line 53 from: if(urlType == '.jpg' || urlType == '.jpeg' || urlType == '.png' || urlType == '.gif' || urlType == '.bmp' ){//code to show images to this: if(urlType == '.jpg' || urlType == '.jpeg' || urlType == '.png' || urlType == '.gif' || urlType == '.bmp' || urlType == '/preview'){//code to show images Also, modify line 50 to this: var urlString = /\.jpg|\.jpeg|\.png|\.gif|\.bmp|\/preview/g; (substitute "/preview" for "/thumbnail," "/quarter," or whatever you configured your image module to create (and name) various sizes.
