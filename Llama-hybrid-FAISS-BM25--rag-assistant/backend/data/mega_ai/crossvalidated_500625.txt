The particular distribution of the population and the parameter being estimated will determine the exact answer to this question. This information is not provided. I will illustrate what I hope is the key issue in terms of a more transparent situation. Suppose you have $n = 25$ observations $X_i$ from $\mathsf{Exp}(\mathrm{rate} = 1/6),$ which has $E(X_i) = \mu = 6.$ The point estimate of $\mu$ is $\hat\mu = \bar X.$ Because $SD(X_i) = E(X_i),$ a symmetrical Wald style 95% (approximate) CI for $\mu$ would be of the form $\bar X \pm 1.96\bar X/\sqrt{n}.$ For a particular sample, we might have the following: set.seed(1212) x = rexp(25, 1/6) mean(x) [1] 6.619402 Thus a 95% CI with limits symmetrically located about $\bar X$ is $(4.02, 9.21)$ . mean(x) + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*mean(x)/sqrt(25) [1] 4.024644 9.214160 However, $\frac{\bar X}{\mu} \sim \mathsf{Gamma}(\mathsf{shape}=25;\mathsf{rate}=25),$ so $P\left(L \le \frac{\bar X}{\mu} \le U\right) = 0.95,$ where $L$ and $U$ cut probability $0.025,$ respectively from the lower and upper tails of this gamma distribution. Upon pivoting, we have an exact 95% CI of the form $$\left(\frac{\bar X}{U},\,\frac{\bar X}{L}\right) = (4.634,10.229).$$ mean(x)/qgamma(c(.975,.025),25,25) [1] 4.634125 10.228587 Note: The following simulation illustrates that the approximate symmetrical "95%" CI actually covers $\mu = 6$ only 93% of the time, even for $n$ as large as $n = 25.$ By contrast, the exact interval has 95% coverage. set.seed(2020) n = 25; lam = 1/6 a = replicate(10^6, mean(rexp(n,lam))) #aprx CI mean( (6 > (1-1.96/sqrt(n))*a) & (6 a/qgamma(.975,25,25)) & (6
