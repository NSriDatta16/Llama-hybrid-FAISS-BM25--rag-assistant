My guess is that you wouldn't need machine learning to do that. Adesh Gautam suggested to create bounding box then apply an ML model. I will sugest more thant that : just use a bounding box algorithm. There are a lot of computer vision techniques that can be applied before resorting to ML. I would suggest you to also look at hedge detection.
