I recently implemented a Suffix Trie in C# that could index novels, and then allow searches to be done extremely fast, linear to the size of the search string. Part of the requirements (this was a homework assignment) was to use offline storage, so I used MS SQL, and needed a structure to represent a Node in a table. I ended up with the following structure : NodeID Character ParentID, etc, where the NodeID was a primary key. I didn't want this to be done as an autoincrementing identity for two main reasons. How do I get the value of a NodeID after I add it to the database/data table? I wanted more control when it came to generating my own IDs.
