You should have a look at MS Concurrency & Coordination Runtime (CCR) , and the Decentralized Software Services (DSS) , part of Robotic Studio . These frameworks would allow you develop loosely coupled services that fulfill most of the actor-approach requirements. Axum would be the best fit, unfortunately it's still in some sort of alpha/beta phase (UPDATE it has been killed in Feb. 2011). I use it for my research and must say that the general direction is great and it has enormous potential. Not C# but C++ is Microsoft's Asynchronous Agents Library which gives you all the features that you need. Have a good look at Parallel related features of .NET 4. Hope it helps!
