How do I pipe my msbuild output to a log file from rake

I'm using the fabulous albacore gem with rake to build a new .NET project. My organization is still using NAnt, and there are lots of folks who expect to see a log file when the build script executes. How do I save the msbuild task output that gets dumped to STDOUT to a log file?
