There are 2 way's I have done this: Drag a tab from the editor panel to the side of the editor window until the red outline shows a rectangle running from top to bottom. Drop the tab there and you get another editor pane. Opening from Project or Files will still use the original panel, but you can drag tabs between the panels. Right click on a tab and choose "Undock Window". This will create a top-level window independent of the main NB window. When you create files with keyboard shortcuts (eg, Ctrl-N for new file) they will open in the current panel. Likewise, navigating to other files (eg, Ctrl-Shift-B for go to source). It's not perfect though. Some keyboard actions will dump you back to the main window, then it's Alt-Tab or fiddle with the mouse to get back.
