An enumerator returns each element of the underlying container per iteration ( MoveNext() call). In this case, your container is a string and its element type is char , so the enumerator will return a character per each iteration. Also, the length of the string is known by the string type, which may be leveraged by the enumerator implementation to know when to terminate its traversal.
