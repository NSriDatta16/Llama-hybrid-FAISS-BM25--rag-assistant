Using Nokogiri HTML Builder to create fragment with multiple root nodes

Well I have a simple problem with Nokogiri. I want to make Nokogiri::HTML::Builder to make an HTML fragment of the following form: #Some stuff in here #Some other stuff in here When trying to do: @builder = Nokogiri::HTML::Builder.new(:encoding => 'UTF-8') do |doc| doc.div { doc.p "first test" } doc.div { doc.p "second test" } end @builder.to_html I get an error: Document has already a root node , which I partly understand. I know I am not wrapping the whole thing into tags (which Nokogiri expects as Nokogiri::HTML::Builder inherits from Nokogiri::XML::Builder and an XML document must have a root node). But I am not building an XML document. Am I missing something? Any kind of help is much appreciated.
