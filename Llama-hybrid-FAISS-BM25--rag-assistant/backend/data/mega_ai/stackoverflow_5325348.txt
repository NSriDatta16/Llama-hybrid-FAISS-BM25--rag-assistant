Cookies: why aren't they big enough? what is there to store that a cookie can't contain?

I am inexperienced and don't understand why you would need more than the size limit of a cookie. Local Storage holds around 5mb, what could someone possibly put into a local storage value that's that big? I really just want to understand, could someone give me examples of what people store that's more than just a few words or a large link?
