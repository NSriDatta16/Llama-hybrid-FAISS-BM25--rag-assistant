You must be talking about NewsDroid? I found that too and had to do a lot of code modification to get it running on the 2.1 SDK. The part I dislike is that you get headlines, but have to navigate to the web page to get details. I prefer to download the story if at possible for off-line caching. There is a nice open source on on GitHub called FeedDroid. ( http://github.com/determinato/feeddroid ). It leverages the Google Reader instead of direct RSS, and it is very well written. It downloads the stories to the local DB. Very helpful for learning as it makes use of a service implementation as well.
