No, I haven't seen anything. I think you have found the best way. The only alternative where to store the inputstream in a byte array or a file and create a Supplier with ByteStreams.newInputStreamSupplier() or Files.newInputStreamSupplier(), but I would discourage to do like that. You could also use public static long copy(InputStream from, OutputStream to) from ByteStreams see: src
