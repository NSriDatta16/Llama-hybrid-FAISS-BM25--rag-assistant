Exceptionally slow javascript performance on one laptop out of a few dozen

I'm working on a web application using a pretty heavy amount of javascript. On the majority of computers (all running IE6...unfortunately), the average document.ready time is about 2 seconds. While this isn't great, it's at least useable. The problem is one computer has ridiculously slow javascript document.ready times. Something that will take 2 seconds on my computer takes 40 seconds on this one. I've been trying to find out why and I'm not getting anywhere. Both computers have the same specs (Intel Core 2 Duo 2GHz, 3 GB of RAM). The slow computer does not have any extra processes running and consistently has a large percentage of System Idle Process (so there's no background processes hogging up the CPU). On both computers when I load the page and watch the task manager, IE peaks around 50%. They both act the same way (other than the ridiculous time difference) Does anyone have any idea why this would happen? I've checked everything I can think of and the javascript performance on this one laptop is just terrible. Edit: Sorry this question is pretty vague. It seems like the two computers are exactly the same in all ways except the drastically different javascript performance. I was hoping someone ran into a similar situation before and knew of something that wasn't obvious to me.
