To detach the console as a separate window: (in a DIY manner) Open a new window ( ⌘ + Shift + T ) Hide the left bar and the utilities bar if open ( ⌘ + 0 and ⌘ + Alt + 0 ) Open the Debug area ( ⌘ + Shift + Y ) Drag the Debug area until it covers the whole window, then hide the toolbar. There, you have a window you can resize or drag anywhere, that shows only the console output. Just like the good old times.
