Weighted average of precision (or recall) of all classes?

How to compute the global precision given the precision calculated for each class? Is it just the average over classes precisions? When I use Weka the global precision is not computed as the average one, but as a "weighted average" and I don't know how this later is computed (weighted by what?). See the example bellow of the results that we get with Weka, can you please tell me how "Weighted Avg." is computed in this result (last line)?
