There's a dozen ways to skin this cat, but my approach would probably be like this (all rough code snippets, not a full implementation) First, the query select `name` , month(`date`) as date_month , year(`date`) as date_year from [Table] order by `date` desc Then, organize the data into the desired logical groups $templateData = array(); foreach ( $rows as $row ) { $templateData[$row->date_year][$row->date_month][] = $row->name; } Then, in a template $months ) : ?> $names ) : ?>
