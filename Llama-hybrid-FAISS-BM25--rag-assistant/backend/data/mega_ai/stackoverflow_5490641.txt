Working with jQuery UI Draggable, Droppable and Sortable

I have an ul of draggable items (#doc-editor-options ul li) , an area for dropping those items (#doc-editor-content) and an ul within that area for holding those items (#items-holder) , which is sortable. This dragging and dropping is only one-way, only items from the list can be dragged and dropped into the holder. $("#doc-editor-options ul li").draggable({ helper: 'clone', connectToSortable: '#item-holder', containment: $(".doc-editor") }); $("#doc-editor-content").droppable({ drop: function(e, ui){ console.log('dropped'); } }); $("#item-holder").sortable({ placeholder: 'placeholder-highlight', cursor: 'pointer', }); Two questions that I have: Right now when I drag an item from the list and drop it into the other list, the drop callback for .droppable() is called twice. I think this has something to do with the #item-holder being sortable. I want it to only be fired when I drop an item into the list and only know about that item's event and ui in the callback. I also need the functionality where by default, the items-holder is not sortable. The only time it becomes sortable is when you are dragging and hovering an item over it. So I can't sort the list by default, but if I drag an item over to it, I can choose where to place that item in the list (i.e. the list is now sortable) and once I drop it, the list becomes unsortable again. EDIT: I figured out #2, I needed to bind mousedown to the draggable items which enables sorting then disables it on mouseup . Still having problems with #1, it seems like some of the sortable events are firing the drop callback when I drop an item in or I hover out of the item holder.
