Anurag's first suggestion (keeping the request data along with the query) is more optimal for the general case thatn returning the username. If you send several long parameters, you don't want them to unnecessarily use your bandwith and increase response time. Quick example, keeping the record of what you send: function checkUserName(){ var uName=$('#uname').val(); // get it immediately stored into the variable $.ajax( {url: '...', data: {username: uName}, success: function(data){ if(data.is_available) alert(uName + " is available."); // this instance of the variable is still in scope, even the checkUserName function has been re-called since }); } This code can still be optimized but you get the idea. If you're using this kind of thing often, you should read about scope in javascript (closures, etc).
