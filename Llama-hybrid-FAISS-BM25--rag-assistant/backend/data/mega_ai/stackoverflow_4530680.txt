Why is the binding icon not visible in blend?

Why is the binding icon (a small gray icon) not visible in blend for some properties even though they are DependencyProperties? For eg. I dragged a button on my page and dragged a textbox. I want to bind button's content property to textbox's text property. But i can't find the Binding icon in Blend. I know if i type the binding syntax in code it will work just fine. But why is that icon missing? Thanks in advance :)
