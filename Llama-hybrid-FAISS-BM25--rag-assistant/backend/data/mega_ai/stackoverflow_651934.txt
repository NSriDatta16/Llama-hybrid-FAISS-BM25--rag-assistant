I think it depends on your use- If your main concern is refactoring to minimize the number of source files and/or classes in an assembly, then yes, extension methods are definitely the way to go, and abstract classes will probably end up being used less. However, for those who care more about what abstract classes represent conceptually , not much has changed. It still makes sense in a code-organizational context to put "public int getCalories()" in abstract class "Food", as it'd be silly for the person eating it (the code using a subclass of food) to define how many calories it has.
