It would depend a great deal on what your prior beliefs/hypotheses are about what might be the cause and effect. For instance, if your monthly dependent variable were corporate profits for the month, and each company put out daily estimates that they fine-tuned as the month went on, then the last day's data is probably the really useful one: it is the ultimate refined answer after all 30 or 31 days are known for all firms, and no more estimates are being made. If the daily variables were a daily profits report for each firm, you probably want to add them all (30 or 31 - or 28) since that would/should add to the monthly report. Those are extreme, and there are cases where a weighted sum, average, or many other things might make the most sense. But you can't really say without knowing more about the hypothesis you already have and what the data is.
