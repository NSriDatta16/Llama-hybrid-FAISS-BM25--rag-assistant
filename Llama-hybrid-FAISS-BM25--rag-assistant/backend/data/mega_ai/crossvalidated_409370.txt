The common practice is to use Cepstral Mean and Variance Normalization (CMVN), and its equation is already mentioned by you. Alternatively, you can try CMVN on sliding window or feature warping. Note that commonly Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are being used in neural network where the normalization can be apparently done by batchnorm inside the network. However, experimental results shows pre-normalization of feature with sliding window CMVN helps.
