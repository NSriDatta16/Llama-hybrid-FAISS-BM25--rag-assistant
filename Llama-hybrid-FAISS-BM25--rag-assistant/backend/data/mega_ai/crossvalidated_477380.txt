What's the REAL difference between moderation and interaction, in ANOVA, in this case? And more

I think the people here will appreciate this. This is a reading assignment/puzzle. I don't see a difference between #1 and #6. This refers to the subject of my question here (moderation and interaction). Note: I've changed ALL the items names in #1 - #6, but I have otherwise left the sentence structures alone. For example, "Male vs. Female" could be "Tall vs. Short." Match the answers below with each question. An answer can only be used once. (Use 6 of 7 of the answers.) The entire set is marked as right or wrong. **Hypothesis** 1. The impact of personal health interest level (minimal, average, high) on average spending on raw vegetables per week is moderated by the state of residence: California or Florida. 2. Food group choice A: [low-carb/high-fat/med-protein], B: [high-carb/low- fat/med-protein], and C: [med-carb/med-fat/med-protein] affects a persons energy level two hours later. The energy level is interval. 3. Tips received by a waitress predicts whether she will look for another job (Boolean outcome). 4. Advertising experience (rating - interval) and experience researching competitors (rating - interval) predicts net income. 5. There is a curviliniear relationship between hours spent on a secondary work assignment and productivity on the primary assignment. 6. There is an interaction effect between age group (A:25-30 or B:35-40) and gender on spending on clothing. **Models** A. Logistic regression B. Linear regression C. One-way ANOVA with post-hoc testing D. One-way ANOVA without post-hoc testing E. Factorial ANOVA with post-hoc testing F. Factorial ANOVA without post-hot testing G. None of these The whole set gets marked right or wrong. I've made two failed attempts: #1 #2 C. E. D. D. A. A. B. B. G. G. E. F. This is from a reading resource in an online graduate course in statistics I'm taking. You have to be logged in to the course to see this. It is not graded, and I don't even have to complete it. My responses are not recorded. I've made two attempts (shown above) and I've done a lot of related reading. What are the correct answers? It only reports if the whole set is right or wrong. I don't see how I've gotten any of the other items wrong (other than the top and bottom ones). Is there a way to test for a curvilinear relationship with ANOVA? I picked "none" for that one, as linear regression is used, and you need to do linear regression + others things for curvilinear. I will post the correct answer once I get it, unless the people here say I shouldn't.
