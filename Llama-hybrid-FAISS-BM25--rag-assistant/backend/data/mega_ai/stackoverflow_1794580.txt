If I were you, ....what I would do is go to your prof and ask to work outside the lines. Ask to be released from the CORBA or ICE requirement. Ask if you can use something that is NOT Corba. Ask if you can use REST, or XML Web services, or even protobufs. CORBA is not irrelevant, as far as the principles go, but it is nearly irrelevant in commercial appeal. Do something that will teach you some more current skills. To me, it would be like studying vacuum tubes. Interesting academically and scientifically, but... Rather than a prime number generator, why not get a little more interesting? a distributed hash table, something like the new BitTorrent design. a work distribution system for a compute farm. How would you build a distributed map/reduce across that farm? you could do encryption, compression, video ripping. Build a general purpose distributed work management system that would be appropriate for any of those jobs, with a modular architecture. How would you detect failures (host offline or non-responsive)? How would you deal with rescusitated hosts? a SETI-@Home type of network. or protein folding. or climate trend analysis (using Public Domain databases - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Domain_Resource ) Something where you're doing something more practical than computing prime numbers. OR - actually do the prime number problem, but apply it to cryptography, breaking keys. a network of agents, where you actually distribute code to the nodes to execute. Something like JavaSpaces. a poker bot. just some ideas.
