If you have a plane, you have a normal vector and an origin. I wouldn't do any "rotations" at all. You're just a few vector operations away from your answer. Let's call your plane's normal vector the new z axis. You can generate the new y axis by crossing the old x axis with the new z axis (your plane's normal). Generate the new x axis by crossing the new z with the new y. Make all your new axis vectors into unit vectors (length 1). For every point you have, create a vector that's from your new origin to the point (vector subtraction of point - plane_origin). Just dot with the new x and new y unit vectors and you get a pair (x,y) you can plot! If you have cross and dot product functions already, this is just a few lines of code. I know it works because most of the 3D videogames I wrote worked this way. Tricks: Pay attention to which directions your vectors are pointing. If they point the wrong way, negate the resultant vector or change the order of the cross product. You have trouble if your plane's normal is exactly the same as your original x axis.
