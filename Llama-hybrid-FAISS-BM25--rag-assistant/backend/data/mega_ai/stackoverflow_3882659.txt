Can I find the most popular keyword for a particular page using the google analytics api?

I was hoping to to use the analytics api to find out the most popular search terms (organic) that lead to a particular page. Is this possible? I've trawled the documentation and found this which looks as if it outlines all possible data I can retrieve from the API and I can't see this information here. http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/gdataReferenceDimensionsMetrics.html If this is the case, is there any reason that the API isn't complete? I would assume if I can access the data using the analytics interface then I should be able to query for it using the API - is this assumption incorrect?
