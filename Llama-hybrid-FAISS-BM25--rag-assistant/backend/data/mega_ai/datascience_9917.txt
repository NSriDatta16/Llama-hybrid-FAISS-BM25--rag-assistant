How to measure confidence in prediction?

I built a prediction model and predicted on new data. I now want to specify a value of my confidence in this predicted value, e.g. ranging from 0 to 1. Three methods come to my mind Built 100 models on bootstrapped data, predict 100 times on each new observation, then calculate confidence intervals. Smaller intervals mean higher confidence. High computational effort. use oob predictions of a random forest from every tree Bayesian methods can give confidence intervals through the posterior Are there other/better ones?
