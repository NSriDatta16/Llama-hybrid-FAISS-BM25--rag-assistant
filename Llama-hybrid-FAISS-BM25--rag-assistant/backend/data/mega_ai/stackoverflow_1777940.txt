touchesMoved:withEvent

I got the coordinates of touchesBegan and touchesEnded. But in touchesMoved can I get all the coordinates of the touch from touchesBegan to touchesEnded. I mean that when I put finger on screen and dragged to some position and then I lifted it. So, can I get all the coordinates of the starting position to end position. If possible, how I can I get them ?
