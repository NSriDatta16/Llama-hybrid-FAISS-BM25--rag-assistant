Calculating return from a factor model

I've been trying to figure this one for weeks so your advise is very appreciated. I have log returns for the past 5 yrs on the following indexes: NYSE, Communication, Growth and Large Cap. I performed PCA on those and kept 2 ‘unobservable factors’ with loadings as follows: NYSE Index 0.2599870 0.6090115 Communications 0.7952713 -0.5660120 Growth 0.3918862 0.2710737 Large Cap 0.3825905 0.4850304 Orthogonal regression of NYSE returns on 2 factor scores gives me 2 betas equal to factor loadings (0.609 and 0.2599). Therefore betas for NYSE are: NYSE Index Communications Growth Large Cap NYSE Index 0.316 0.337 0.309 0.359 respectively To calculate delta R on NYSE in terms of the factors: Return on NYSE= 0.316* R NYSE + 0.337* R Comm+0.309* R Growth +0.359 R Large Cap. However this doesn’t actually work… What am I missing? How can I calculate Return on NYSE Index using PCA's common factors?
