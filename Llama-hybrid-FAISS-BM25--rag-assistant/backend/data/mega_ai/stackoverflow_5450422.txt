I think this has to do with the remote debugger failing to connect to your application on the phone for whatever reason. Does your Xcode 3 project have an Entitlements.plist with get-task-allow set? Are you stripping debugging symbols? Compiler optimizations? Take a look in the Organizer window at the Console log for your device and I bet you'll see errors about com.apple.debugserver if you're sure you don't have other code problems. I was having a similar situation, and maybe it's still not completely resolved. In my "Release" scheme, using an Ad-Hoc build configuration, I told Xcode to not attach to GDB when running, but I noticed it still tried to attach the remote debugger, which is why I think it would crash right away. After it crashes, I would stop the currently running process within Xcode and then manually launch the installed app from the phone, which worked correctly. It's very likely that it's not directly your apps fault, but rather a perfect storm of your project, build settings, and the remote debugger. Try playing around with run settings and maybe you can get a radr out of it.
