I assume you're crawling images or something of that sort, anyway you can get around the problem by adding binmode(FILE) ; or if they are webpages and UTF-8 then try binmode( FILE, ':utf8' ) . See perldoc -f binmode , perldoc perlopentut , and perldoc PerlIO for more information.. The ":bytes", ":crlf", and ":utf8", and any other directives of the form ":...", are called I/O layers. The "open" pragma can be used to establish default I/O layers. See open. To mark FILEHANDLE as UTF-8, use ":utf8" or ":encoding(utf8)". ":utf8" just marks the data as UTF-8 without further checking, while ":encoding(utf8)" checks the data for actually being valid UTF-8. More details can be found in PerlIO::encoding.
