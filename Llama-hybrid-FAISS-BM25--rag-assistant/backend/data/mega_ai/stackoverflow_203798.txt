The PAD (Portable Application Description) specification highest character limit for program description is 2000 chars *see Program Descriptions section. http://www.asp-shareware.org/pad/spec/spec.php Download site submission tools use this spec to make it easier for authors to submit their software. Also I think there are a couple lists you can download that follow the PAD spec. So I would suggest varchar(2000) based on that fact I wouldn't want to store more than I need to. One record would be fine with varchar(max), but when you have thousands the cost of storage might go up. Edit: varchar(max) can be 2GB - 1, that's why I would limit it. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms176089(SQL.90).aspx
