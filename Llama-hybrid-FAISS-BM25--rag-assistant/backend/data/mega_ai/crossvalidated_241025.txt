Why is $\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{\hat{y}}$ perpendicular to the subspace spanned by $\mathbf{x}$ in linear regression?

I'm reading this lecture on Linear, Ridge Regression, and PCA. In slide 10 it says that: The things that I don't understand is the 5th statement which says that $\mathbf{y} - \mathbf{\hat{y}} $ is perpendicular to the subspace. Why is this the case?
