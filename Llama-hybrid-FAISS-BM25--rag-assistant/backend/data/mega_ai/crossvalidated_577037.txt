The re-parameterization $x=\mu + \epsilon \sigma$ where $\mu, \sigma>0$ are the outputs of a neural network and $\epsilon \sim \mathcal N(0,1^2)$ is a standard normal variable implies that $x\sim \mathcal N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ , i.e. $x$ has normal distribution with mean $\mu$ and standard deviation $\sigma$ . Therefore, $x$ is not a discrete random variable. If you have a different reparameterization in mind, or a different sampling of $\epsilon$ , then that would change this result, but it's not clear if that's what you're asking.
