The point of a machine learning model isn't to output the same distribution, it's to minimize prediction error. Of course, if the prediction error is zero for every input, then the input and output distributions will be the same, but this reasoning doesn't work the other way around. Discrepancy in input and output distribution just implies that the model is imperfect; the degree of mismatch might characterize some amount of model misfit, but that's best measured by the usual statistics such as mean squared error, etc. If the prediction error of this model isn't small enough for your needs, then you'll need to do some combination of make a better model, collect more data, or gather more informative features.
