Access control using Spring Security in ExtJS client?

I am using Grails 1.3.7, Spring Security Plugin for Grails, and ExtJS 3.3.1. I will have about 20 roles in my app and use static URL rules to secure my controller layer. My client side will be all ExtJS, as I just started with ExtJS, I'd like to check with you folks there and find out what is the proper way of integrating access control into ExtJS client side. Basically, how to organize the code that determines which part of the UI to display for a given user? And further more, some form maybe read-only for some users.
