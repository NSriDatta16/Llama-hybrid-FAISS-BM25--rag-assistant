I think there's confusion, there is not really a "true value" in Bayesian inference since the parameter of inference is random. You may have to specify what form of credible interval you constructed from the posterior so we can understand what value it attempts to capture, did you use highest modal probability for the Bayesian "MLE"? did you use a symmetric interval about the posterior mean which contains 95% of the posterior? Did you choose the empirical 2.5 and 97.5 quantiles for the posterior median? Once you specify this, you can use simulation and replicate Gibb's sampling for each simulated dataset to sample from the posterior and calculate the respective statistic represented by its credible interval.
