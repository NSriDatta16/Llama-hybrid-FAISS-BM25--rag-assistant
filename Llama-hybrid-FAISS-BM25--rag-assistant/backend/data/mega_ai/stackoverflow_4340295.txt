ZXing BarCode Scanner Only Scans App Barcodes

I have leveraged the ZXing barcode scanner intent, but it will only scan App barcodes (the barcodes that you take a picture of and it installs the app on your phone). I want it to be able to scan the barcodes of everyday objects, such as those found on soda cans and boxes of food. When I put it up to a normal barcode it won't detect it. Here is the code for when I call the intent. public void onClick(View v) { //Link to the Barcode Scanner intent. Intent intent = new Intent("com.google.zxing.client.android.SCAN"); intent.putExtra("SCAN_MODE", "QR_CODE_MODE"); startActivityForResult(intent, 0); } Can you tell me what I'm doing wrong? Any help is appreciated.
