How to use CausalImpact in R to construct an interrupted time series model with >2 periods of interest?

I would like to conduct an interrupted time series analysis on data with three time periods: Pre intervention During intervention Post intervention My outcome variable is a continuous biological measurement recorded every second for approx. 48 hours. I found the CausalImpact package and was able to fit a model with the first two periods (Pre and During), but when I attempted to add a third period, the model would not run: pre.period The error message: Error: args is not a list or args is not NULL Basically, I want to know whether the effect of the intervention was sustained during the post intervention period using the during intervention period as the control. Is this not possible or advisable? Should I run a separate analysis comparing during to post? If so, would this introduce a multiple comparisons issue? I did some research and was able to find a Stata program ( itsa command) that appears to be what I'm looking for, but I am not a Stata user. I have yet to find an analogous R program. I would appreciate it if someone could point me in the right direction. Thanks.
