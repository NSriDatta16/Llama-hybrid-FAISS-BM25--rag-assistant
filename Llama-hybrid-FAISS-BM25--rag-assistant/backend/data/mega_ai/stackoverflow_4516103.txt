Windows Phone 7 WrapPanel within a ScrollViewer

I've got a page with the following XAML in my application. In the page constructor I load a set of images into the WrapPanel . These images are being displayed correctly but scrolling isn't working very well. I'm testing this on the emulator. The problem is that if I drag and scroll downwards as soon as I let the mouse go the ScrollViewer is scrolling back to the top. So it is impossible to get to the bottom of the WrapPanel . If I add the HorizontalScrollBarVisibility property to the ScrollViewer and set it to Auto I get a long line of images that flows off the screen horizontally, but the scrolling works in that case i.e. if I scroll to the right and let go of the mouse it doesn't scroll back to the left automatically. How can I fix this scroll-to-the-top behavior? Or is this a bug in the emulator? My AppHub registration has not been approved yet so I can't sideload the app on my phone to test it.
