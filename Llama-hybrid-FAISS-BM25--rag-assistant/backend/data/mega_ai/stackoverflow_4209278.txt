Magento cart redirects to onepage checkout, how do I make it stop?

Hi I'm new to Magento, so we installed the Magento Simple checkout which is working fine but when you add a product it takes you to the cart (checkout/cart) which is fine but then it suddenly jumps to (checkout/onepage). Both pages look pretty similar except the cart page gives me the option to keep shopping and change cart quantities and update the cart while the checkout page doesn't have this. I can never change the cart options because it always redirects. Is there anyway to stop it from redirecting? I don't even know where to start to look so I could paste some code. Thank you in advance.
