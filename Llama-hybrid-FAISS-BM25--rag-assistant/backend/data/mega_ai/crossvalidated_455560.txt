Why is the mean and log variance specified as the output of an inference network in a variational autoencoder?

This question was also asked in the link below but I don't think the answer there really addressed the question. Latent output of variational autoencoder So why the log variance and mean, why not log standard deviation and mean or standard deviation and mean?
