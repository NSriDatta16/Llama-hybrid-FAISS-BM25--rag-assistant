From my experience with C++/CLI, it performs much better than PInvoke. I have wrapped a lot of C code using C++/CLI and it works great. It also has other benefits: The ability to use C++, the ability to create specific .NET interfaces that call the C functions and even to easily keep allocated unmanaged memory in the .NET classes. It also allows you to see the code coverage inside the unmanaged code when you write and run unit tests. The only problem with C++/CLI is that it is a bit difficult to learn. It's a pretty complicated language since it has both all of the C++ features and all of the .NET features. Visual Studio doesn't treat it that nice like it does with C# and you don't have great tools Resharper to work with. If you care about performance, I'm positive you'll find C++/CLI the right choice.
