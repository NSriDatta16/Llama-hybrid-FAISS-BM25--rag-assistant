Online news classification

I am performing an online news classification. The idea is to recognize group of news of the same topic. My algorithm has these steps: 1) I go through a group of feeds from news sites and I recognize news links. 2) For each new link, I extract the content using dragnet , and then I tokenize it. 3) I find the vector representation of all the old news and the last one using TfidfVectorizer from sklearn. 4) I find the nearest neighbor in my dataset computing euclidean distance from the last news vector representation and all the vector representations of the old news . I have a problem using TfidfVectorizer because it weights more the special words that only appear in a few news, like Apple , and news that talk about Aple are grouped together even when they deal with different topics. So, Is there a common approach more efficient than the one I am using?
