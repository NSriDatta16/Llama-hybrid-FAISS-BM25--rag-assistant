Writing Compilers and Interpreters: A Software Engineering Approach [Paperback] Ronald Mak -> this is a great book to get started with. It leads you through the whole process of building a compiler and an ide with a debugger and many other things you need. At the end of the book you will have a good sense of what to do to branch out on your own. You may also want to look at Language Implementation Patters by PragProg.com publishing too.
