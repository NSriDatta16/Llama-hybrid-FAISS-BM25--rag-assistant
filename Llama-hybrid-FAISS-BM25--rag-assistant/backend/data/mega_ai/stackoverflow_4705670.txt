How to make these video links on the same line?

Please view the Wordpress video gallery here: http://milabalami.com I want the two videos to be on the same line. They are both in the same paragraph and I have not added a tag. As far as I know, the CSS should be correct, but I am suspecting that I am missing something here? Anyone who can solve this puzzle for me?
