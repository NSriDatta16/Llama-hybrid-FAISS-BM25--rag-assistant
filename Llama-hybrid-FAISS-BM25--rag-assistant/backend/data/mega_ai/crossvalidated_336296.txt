Are NMDS Axis the same calculated for one or more dimensions?

I used NMDS axes of an ecological community as proxys for the community similarity in the different samples. I would like to "quantify" the importance of the different NMDS axis according to the stressreduction. Now my question is : If I calculate an NMDS with one dimension would the NMDS axis of that be the same as the first axis of a NMDS calculated with two dimensions? Of course, I tried that myself using the metaMDS function in vegan and the axis are not exactly same but correlate with a coefficient >0.9. How can that be explained?
