How to name and organize unit tests that test a method with multiple parameters?

Given this method that has to be tested: // Search the given value using the provided search options // Return true if the searchValue was found; false otherwise bool Search(string searchValue, bool useExactSearch, bool useIndexing) I have 6 significant searchValues (one with ponctuation, one with accented characters, one with line breaks, etc) that I need to validate with each possible combination of the useExactSearch and useIndexing. This means 54 test cases. How do you go about that? Do you really write 54 unit tests? If so, how do you name them? Do you write tests only for the most significant cases? Do you write a single unit tests that loops over a table of param values and expected results? If I do a single unit test, it's harder to find which case is broken when the Continuous Integration reports a failure.
