I would love to be considered for nomination to help moderate this community. I don't have the highest rep, but I contribute as much as I can. To attribute to my obsession, I've visited StackOverflow.com every day for 249 consecutive days (450 total days over a 1.7 year membership). I answer more questions than I ask, and I try my best to accept an answer for as many of my questions as possible. My philosophy for moderation is that everyone deserves to be respected for their questions, and therefore down votes and close votes definitely don't need to be accompanied by insults. I also know that there are a vast number of (what North Americans would call) foreign members, and a moderator should not judge a member on their linguistic skills, but rather help, encourage, and edit where needed. note: this is not to say that I'm a softy. I'll absolutely do my part to keep this community clean. SO is like my home away from home, I really love this community :) Please consider me for a SO moderator position.
