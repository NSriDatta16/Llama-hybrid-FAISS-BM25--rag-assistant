C# WinForm - Save password locally in Credential Manager (Like Keychain does for iOS)

I would like to create a C# WinForms application which will create web requests to servers that require username and password (Basic authentication). I want to save the password locally (encrypted of course) on the machine that runs the application. Basically, I need something that operates as Keychain in iOS, or "secure storage" in eclipse, only for .NET I've found the Credential Manager in Windows, but all API examples are from .NET Framework V2.0 Isn't there a normal API from Microsoft about how to use it in C#?
