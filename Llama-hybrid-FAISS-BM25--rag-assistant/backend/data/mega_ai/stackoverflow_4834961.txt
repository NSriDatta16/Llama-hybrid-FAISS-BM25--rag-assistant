A suggestion off the top of my head: Save edits on the fly: Create a PHP page that does nothing but accept POST requests from a user (you'll obviously want to have some form of authentication in place so that randoms can't just hit the page with random data, but that's another matter). This page will solely be responsible for accepting AJAX requests from a user. Create your sandbox page using something like jQuery's UI library ( especially if you're new, use something pre-written, don't try to write your own). This will be a PHP page that will simply load whatever values have been already stored in the database by your the AJAX handling page. Using jQuery's drag and drop methods , you can detect whenever an element has been moved. On move end, you'd use jQuery's .ajax functionality to send the element and coordinates to the ajax handling page. Next time the user logs in, it would be trivial to add/position the elements as required.
