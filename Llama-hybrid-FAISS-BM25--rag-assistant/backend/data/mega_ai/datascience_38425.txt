I assume every instance is a grouped data of either hotels or hostels and both. I think this paper discusses your problem, provides solutions and comparisons between different frameworks. Instead of characterising individual pictures, we could characterise the groups using the distribution of all the observations in an instance. We can assume that the pictures of both hostels and hotels are drawn from a parameterised distribution. The main idea suggests to train every image to calculate the probability of belonging in a class. When you calculate the individual probabilities, the aggregation of these in a group would lead to a higher misclassification rate. This method leverages extra information in the instance. For example, if these instances are different neighbourhoods of an area and all the pictures are from different neighbourhoods, then it becomes harder to predict the class of the instance but with DBA, a network can also learn about these neighbourhoods in particular.
