Interpreting Correlations with Dummy Variables

I am working through a paper about grad student "satisfaction" (as measured by a survey), and descriptive statistics are given in a table that looks like this: The "experience of factors" variables in the bottom half of the table are continuous independent variables under test, and their correlation coefficients are understandable. However, the first half of the table contains a number of control dummy/indicator variables coded as 0 or 1. The methods by which these correlations are calculated is not given in the paper. I have a few questions about these correlations: Is point-biserial the right way to calculate correlations between a continuous and binary dummy/indicator variable (with no natural ordering/ordinality/ranking)? How am I to interpret the magnitude of this number? Does a 1.0 mean that all the observations from one of two categories have the same value, and all the observations of the other category have a different value (and those in the "1" category have a higher value, since it's positive 1.0)? To what extent is a correlation the "interesting" quantity here? Why not calculate a difference of means and perform a t-test? Again, the paper is silent about these questions. Thanks for any helpâ€”I am performing some research well outside my field with no in-person colleagues I can consult.
