I feel, from your description of the task, that it can be solved by means of quantifying (turning ordinal-level into scale-level) variables the way that the predictions or associatiations are maximized. This is known as optimal scaling and is implemented in SPSS (and, of course, in R, I believe). You might choose between 3 procedures, all adopting optimal scaling: Categorical PCA (CATPCA, or PRINCALS). Use this if you want PCA or Factor analysis. The procedure itself is PCA, not Factor analysis in narrow sense of the word implying communalities . If you need Factor analysis per se you may input the quantified variables obtained in CATPCA to standard Factor analysis procedure. Having identified components or factors behind your independent "resource" variables and having obtained the factor scores you could then check their effect on each dependent variable via ordinal regression (for example). Categorical Canonical Correlation analysis (OVERALS). Use this to draw latent "traits" which are loaded simultaneously by both independed and dependent sets of variables. You might want to read something about canonical correlations if you are not familiar with it. Categorical regression (CATREG). This is OVERALS in case one of the two sets of variables contains just one variable. Use it if you want to model effects of your independent variables on each dependent variable separately. It is like usual linear regression, only that it is nonlinear because of optimal scaling.
