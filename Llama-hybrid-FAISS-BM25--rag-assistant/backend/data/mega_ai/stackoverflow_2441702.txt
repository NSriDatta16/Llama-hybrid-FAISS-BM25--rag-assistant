If you take a look at the diagram for Activity lifecycle you'll realize that there are no guarantees about you Activity after onPause is called. Android could kill you Activity without even calling onDestroy. You have to save your state using onSaveInstanceState and restore it using onRestoreInstanceState . This might be useful. EDIT: Lifecycle covers different scenarios. If you have only one Activity pressing Back is equivalent to exiting your application. If you have Activity A which starts activity B then onSaveInstanceState is called for Activity A. When you press back in Activity B it just exits and onRestoreInstanceState is called for Activity A. You are trying to save data between two distinct runs of your application and you need to use some kind of persistent storage for this.
