Efficient way to store tuples in the datastore

If I have a pair of floats, is it any more efficient (computationally or storage-wise) to store them as a GeoPtProperty than it would be pickle the tuple and store it as a BlobProperty ? If GeoPt is doing something more clever to keep multiple values in a single property, can it be leveraged for arbitrary data? Can I store the tuple ("Johnny", 5) in a single entity property in a similarly efficient manner?
