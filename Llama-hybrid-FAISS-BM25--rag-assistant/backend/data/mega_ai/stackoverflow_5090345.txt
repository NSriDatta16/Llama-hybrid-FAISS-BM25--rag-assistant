Your options are a) to store entities representing each occurrence of the recurring trip (as you might populate a calendar table with a row representing each day of the year), an approach that leverages SQL or b) store a rule representing the recurring schedule, which will require more procedural code throughout the application. I favor option a), even though it requires routines to populate the trip-occurrences table on a periodic basis.
