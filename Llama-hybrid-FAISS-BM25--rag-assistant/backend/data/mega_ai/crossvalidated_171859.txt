Dictionary creation in deep learning for NLP

After watching the NAACL2013 videos and papers, I have some doubts on how a RNN works. All the words are represented in a matrix $L\in M_{k \times |V|}$ where $k$ is an arbitrary number of dimensions and $V$ the vocabulary. How is this vocabulary created? Let's say that I train my network with some text. At this point I have a vocabulary of the unique words occurring in this text. What happens if I give to the RNN a word never met during training as input? Will it be ignored or a new column is added to $L$? New words In case new words are added to $L$, what should I expect when, for instance, plotting word similarities? Let's say that in my taining dataset I have France and Germany, then I give as input a sentence containing Spain. Will the RNN put it close to other UE states or only close to nouns? Sentences of variable length In text, a sentence has a very variable number of words, but the number of units in the input layer is fixed. Is splitting sentences in blocks of $|input\_units|$ length enough?
