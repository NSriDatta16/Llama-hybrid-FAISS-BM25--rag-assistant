You'll also need at least class Book - it is hard to imagine what would your Library interface would look like otherwise. A good idea is to make Library interface instead of class so you can have multiple implementations for storage - now you want to use a DB, then you may want to use XML suddenly. I would also recommend to not make Library class main, but rather make a separate LibraryCLI class. Then you could add LibraryGUI later without having to do anything with Library class itself. Separation is always good. And no, it is never, ever too soon to read on design patterns. The sooner you start understanding these things, the better. Otherwise, you'll just end up with unreusable and unmaintainable code. Well, you'll end up with some probably anyway, just to a less extent and it will probably be much easier to fix if you were at least trying to figure out how to do things before implementing them.
