The reason for the difference in the number of days between the two is that the EuStockMarkets dataset does not range from 1-1-1991 to 1-1-1998 but from 1-7-1991 to 14-08-1998 so you are comparing two different time ranges. > time(EuStockMarkets) Time Series: Start = c(1991, 130) End = c(1998, 169) Frequency = 260 Using the actual dates when calculating the number of business days in the range using timeanddate.com gives 1860 when including public holidays. So while the documentation notes that it excludes holidays that doesn't seem to actually be the case. This might be linked to your second point regarding the different holidays at only one index. For pandas.date_range the days returned seem to simply only be the weekdays, i.e. Monday through Friday, which include any holidays. If you want to exclude holidays in your python version you can use any of the existing calendar classes or create a custom one yourself in combination with pandas.bdate_range .
