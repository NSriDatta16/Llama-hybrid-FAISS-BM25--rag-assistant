How to determine trend in rainfall data?

I have annual average rainfall data in mm/day units. I want to see the trend of the rainfall, whether its increasing or decreasing. How to do this. My teacher told to put a linear regression line and see its slope. If the slope is negative, trend is decreasing and vice versa. Further, ttest can determine the significance level of the trend present. Is it a correct way to do? I know that the data is not normally distributed. What other way I can determine trend? Also, do I always have to check skewness and kurtosis to see data is normally distributed and then apply ttest or any other test? Please help, I am new in statistics and very confused. Thanks.
