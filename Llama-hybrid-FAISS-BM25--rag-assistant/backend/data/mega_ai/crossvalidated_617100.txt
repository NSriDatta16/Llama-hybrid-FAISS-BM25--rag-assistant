Adequate sample size for non-normal population

There are 197,058 record holders (population) with an average of K shares each. I don’t know K, and the sample collected so far of ~24,000 observations appear to be non-normal (inverse gauss). I’m wondering how big the sample size would need to be such that the sample mean would be approximately equal to the population mean. There are many online statistics calculators, but none that factor in non-normal distributions. Ultimately, I’m looking for K x 197,058 = total number of shares held by record holders.
