How to import csv file( already uploaded in blob storage) in Azure(.Net)

I want to import csv file(already uploaded in blob storage) in Azure. For example I have uploaded test.csv on blob storage, now I just want to import that test.csv file in .net(azure) and after importing I will insert that data into azure database. I am using C# .net. Please suggest how can I achieve this. I want to follow below steps:- Creating a cvs file with all rows. Upload it as blob. Parse it with a Worker role and insert it in the sql azure db. Thanks.
