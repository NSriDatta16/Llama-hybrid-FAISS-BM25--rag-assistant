As you correctly pointed out, the Mann-Whitney U-Test (which is equivalent to the regular Wilcoxon Test) requires independence of the two samples, which is very unlikely in the described setting (not impossible however; imagine a situation in which your measure $X$ depends only on the organ about to be transplanted and is not influenced by e.g. other organs, the patientâ€™s lifestyle, etc.). If you are interested in studying the per-patient changes in those 6 months (imagine weight gain/loss), you are right, it would be correct to use a Wilcoxon Signed-Rank Test, which (simplified) can be interpreted as whether or not the median changes in those 6 months are equal to 0. Whether or not this is satisfying depends on the research question.
