Correlations of correlations using 3 data sets

I'm interested in how 14 environmental parameters co-vary with other environmental parameters and whether they show the same patterns in 3 regions. So 1st, I made a pairwise correlation table of the 14 environmental variables for each region. Then, I made another pairwise correlation table of correlation values from 3 regions (i.e. region1 vs region2 & region1 vs region3 & region2 vs region3). I found a good correlation (a similar pattern) between region2 and region3 (or called "sector" in graphs). What I want to do from here is to put the all correlations values from the 3 regions together in one graph and also calculate correlation values (i.e. correlations of correlation values) because I want to know which environmental variables are correlated well in all 3 regions. I thought of using PCA, but it's not really what I imagined to be the best way to present a pattern. Maybe a 3D graph would be good for presentation. I'm a R user. If you could instruct me with R language on how to make that kind of graph and also how to calculate 3-way correlations, that would be much appreciated. Thanks!
