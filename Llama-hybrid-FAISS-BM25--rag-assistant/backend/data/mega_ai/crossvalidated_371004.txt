' The standard way to estimate $\lambda$ would be to just use the estimator, would it not? $p(\mbox{heads}) = \frac{\mbox{# of heads}}{\mbox{# of flips}}$ "I toss the coin and update my posterior" Or are you trying to come up with an update to your estimate every single time you flip a coin, ie a recursive Bayesian estimation? You could do that by using the posterior at flip $n$ to be the prior distribution at flip $n+1$ and multiplying that by the likelihood to obtain the posterior at flip $n+1$ . But the prior you give, a flat prior on $[0.2, 0.7]$ isn't conjugate to the Bernoulli likelihood, so I don't think you could make a nice updating chain..." ` Is there some particular reason why you want to do this recursively, updating your estimate with every new flip?
