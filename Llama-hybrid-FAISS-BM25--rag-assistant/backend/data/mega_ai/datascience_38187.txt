Predict future value with time period using non linear regression model

Here I have dataset import from csv file. I want to predict the next value with the time series. Can we use nonlinear regression model to predict the value for next time period or Is there any regression model can we use to predict the value? Here I upload the subset of my original dataset. Time x x1 x2 y 0:06:00 63 NaN NaN 63 0:07:00 63 NaN 20 104 0:08:00 104 11 0 93 0:09:00 93 0 0 ?
