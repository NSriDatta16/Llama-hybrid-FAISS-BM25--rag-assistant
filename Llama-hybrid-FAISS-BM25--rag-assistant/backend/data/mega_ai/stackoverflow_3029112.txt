I just started a project to do this. its in pre-alpha stage right now. It is an Eclipse plugin. While I agree that typically a POJO setter/getter doesn't necessarily need a test, I believe it is nice to have the simple test there because as things change over time, it will make it easier for you to add more tests for the POJO's. The Unit test is set up, the methods are there to test the setter/getter, all you have to do is handle the new complexity. This also helps with the code-coverage reports, which, helps keep managers happy. (My company uses Emma). https://sourceforge.net/projects/unittestgplugin/
