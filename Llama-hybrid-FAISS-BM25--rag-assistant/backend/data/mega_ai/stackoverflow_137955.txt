Final when used with variables in Java provides a substitute for constant in C++. So when final and static is used for a variable it becomes immutable. At the same time makes migrated C++ programmers pretty happy ;-) When used with reference variables it does not allow you to re-reference the object, though the object can be manipulated. When final is used with a method, it does not allow the method to be over-ridden by the subclasses. Once the usage is very clear it should be used with care. It mainly depends on the design as using final on the method would not help polymorphism. One should only use it for variables when you are damn sure that the value of the variable will/should never be changed. Also ensure that you follow the coding convention encouraged by SUN.for eg: final int COLOR_RED = 1; (Upper case seperated by underscore) With a reference variable, use it only when we need a an immutable reference to a particular object. Regarding the readability part, ensue that comments play a very important role when using the final modifier.
