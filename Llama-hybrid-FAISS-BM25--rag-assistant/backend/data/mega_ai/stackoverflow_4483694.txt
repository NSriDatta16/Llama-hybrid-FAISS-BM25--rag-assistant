The uploading itself takes a bit more than a minute most of the time. It's the starting up of the instances that take up most of the time. What you can do is to deploy your fixes to staging first (note that it costs money so don't let it be there for too long). Swapping from staging to production only takes a couple of seconds. So while your application's still running you can upload the patched version, let your testers test it on staging and when they give the go then simply swap it to production. I haven't tested your possible alternative approach by first uploading to blob storage first. But I think that's overhead as it doesn't speed up starting up the instances.
