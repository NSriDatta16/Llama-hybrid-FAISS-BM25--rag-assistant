Machine learning models take vectors (arrays of numbers) as input. When working with text, the first thing you must do is come up with a strategy to convert strings to numbers (or to "vectorize" the text) before feeding it to the model. The performance of a Machine Learning Model not only depends on the model and the hyperparameters but also on how we process and feed different types of variables * to the model. Since most machine learning models only accept numerical variables, preprocessing the categorical variables becomes a necessary step. We need to convert these categorical variables to numbers such that the model is able to understand and extract valuable information. Usually there are 2 kinds of categorical data: Ordinal Data: The categories have an inherent order in Job Change dataset are: [ 'education_level', 'experience','company_size','last_new_job'] Nominal Data: The categories do not have an inherent order in Job chanege dataset are: ['city','gender','enrolled_university','major_discipline', 'company_type','relevent_experience',] (binary data could be nominal or ordinal) Generally: In Ordinal data, while encoding, one should retain the information regarding the order in which the category is provided. While encoding Nominal data, we have to consider the presence or absence of a feature. In such a case, no notion of order is present.
