To get an idea why this can occur, take a look at these notes on logistic regression. (They appear to be from Andrew Ng's open course on machine learning; the associated videos may also prove helpful.) In brief, using a polynomial function of your predictive features allows you to fit a non-linear, more expressive decision boundary. Your better performance suggests that the data are better separated this third-order polynomial boundary. I'm not sure what you mean by "corrupt." Using a function of your data is acceptable feature selection. Fitting a more complex boundary runs the risk of overfitting, but that's why one examines test error, which you've already mentioned checking.
