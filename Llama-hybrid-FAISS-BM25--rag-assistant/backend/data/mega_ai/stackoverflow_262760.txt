I normally do TDD, so I write the tests first, which helps me see how I want to be able to use the objects. Then, when I'm writing the classes, for the most part I can spot common pitfalls (i.e. assumptions that I'm making, e.g. a variable being of a particular type, or range of values) and when these come up I write a specific test for that specific case. Aside from that, and getting as good as code coverage as possible (sometimes it's not possible to get 100%), you're more or less done. Then, if any bugs do come up in the future, you just make sure you write a test case for it that exposes it first, and will pass when fixed. Then fix as per normal.
