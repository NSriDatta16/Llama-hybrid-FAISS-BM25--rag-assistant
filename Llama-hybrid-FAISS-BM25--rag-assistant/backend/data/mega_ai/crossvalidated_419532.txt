Let's say you don't know the probability of head , $p$ , of a coin. You decide to conduct an experiment to estimate what it is, via Bayesian analysis. It requires you to choose a prior, and in general you're free to choose one of the feasible ones. If you don't know or don't want to assume anything about this $p$ , you can say that it is uniformly distributed in $[0,1]$ , in which $f_P(p)=1, 0\leq p\leq 1$ , $0$ otherwise. This is quite similar to saying that any $p$ value in $[0,1]$ is equally likely. This prior distribution is a uniform prior . You can also choose other priors, that focus on different regions in $[0,1]$ , for example, if you choose a prior like $f_P(p)=\frac{3}{2}(1-(1-2p)^2),\ \ \ 0\leq p\leq 1$ , you'll assume that $p$ is more likely to be around $0.5$ compared to edge cases, such as $p=0,p=1$ .
