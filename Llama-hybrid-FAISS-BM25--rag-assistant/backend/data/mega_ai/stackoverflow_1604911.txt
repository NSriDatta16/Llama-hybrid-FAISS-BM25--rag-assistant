I went to the Program Portal on Apple's dev site, clicked on Provisioning, clicked on the "Renew" button next to my Profile, the status changed from 'expired' to 'pending', waited a few moments, clicked refresh, the new status was active until 3 months from now, I clicked on "Download", found the downloaded file in my downloads folder, and dragged it onto my XCode Icon. (I had Xcode running already, and had the iphone plugged in). The new profile showed up, and I deleted the old one (being careful because they had the same name, but when you mouse over them the expiration date appears). I think because I had the phone plugged in already it automagically updated to the phone, because I didn't have to re-sync or anything. Now my App works again!
