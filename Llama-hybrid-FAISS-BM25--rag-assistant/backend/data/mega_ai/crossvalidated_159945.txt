You would interpret the regression results as you would any logistic regression model with dummy variables. That is, odds ratios are interpreted as the odds of the category in question relative to the reference category. That said, your model effectively only has one explanatory variable--habitat--so what you show us here is just the binary association between your outcome (threatened/not threatened) and habitat type, i.e. crude ORs. Given that it is likely that other factors affect the species' "threatened status," you need to control for those other factors in your model. Otherwise, the crude ORs are a biased estimate of the effect of habitat type on threatened status. I do not see a problem with having a model with all binary predictors if the data call for it, though you may run into problems if you have small cell sizes. Some variables are necessarily categorical, e.g. habitat type. Sometimes you may need to categorize continuous variables if the relationship between the continuous variable and the outcome is not linear. When you fit a model limited dependent variables, such as logit, multinomial logit, ordered logit, probit, tobit, Poisson, etc., the coefficients are not directly interpretable. Therefore, you will need to calculate some transformation of the $\beta$, either odds ratios (as you have done here), marginal effects, predictive margins, etc. Note also that you can draw conclusions about different habitat types associated with higher or lower likelihood of having threatened status relative to the omitted category, but if you want to know whether habitat type overall is associated with threatened status, you will need to do an F-test of the joint significance of your dummy variables. In a model with just one explanatory variable (as you have here), the model F-test is equivalent to the F-test I just described in the previous sentence. Finally, you should enter all categories of habitat but one into your model. The omitted category is your reference category, and serves as the group that other habitat categories are compared to with regard to risk of threatened status. If you enter only some categories and not others, the omitted categories will all be lumped together in the reference category.
