The referenced post and graphic are misleading because they suggest that kurtosis somehow measures height and/or pointiness/flatness of the distribution, notions which have been thoroughly debunked. Rather, kurtosis is a measure of tailweight (or more specifically tail leverage ), see https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/481022/102879 for a good place to start. It is important to visualize the heaviness of the tails, but the standard histogram/density plot is inadequate for this purpose: The tails, even when heavy, are too close to zero to distinguish "light" from "heavy" in such graphs. Instead, you can use the normal quantile-quantile plot. Tail heaviness is very easy to see in this plot, and there is a direct mathematical connection between the appearance of this plot and the kurtosis statistic.
