I would use a decent smooth for the characteristic time (EWMA, Sgolay, ...) on the time-series, and I would look at divergence from that smooth. If you are sampling every 5 minutes then the EWMA weight should be something like 1/12 or 1/24, or the SG window size should be around 12 or 24 units in size. I would also cyclize the time: (hour of day) --> [cos(hour/24), sin(hour/24)] (day of week) --> [cos(day/7), sin(day/7)] (week of year) --> [cos(week/53), sin(week/53)] And add flags for weekends and holidays. You aren't going to get everything. If someone has a super-bowl (or other sports/ball) party at their house, a kids birthday, or other celebration, then the fridge might get a lot of atypical mileage. A decent Random Forest should do a solid job here. Feed it the errors, the cyclized time/date and flags for weekend or holiday, and it should do a fair job of predicting the defrost events. If you had decent dummy data I could show this to you in pseudocode and give decent graphs and fit analyses.
