UIImage - should be loaded with [UIImage imageNamed:@""] or not?

I am having number of images with in my application. ( images more than 50 - approximately & it can extend according to client's need ) Each image are very large round about - 1024 x 768 & 150 dpi Now, I have to add all this images in a scroll view & display it. Ok, My question is as follows. According to me there are two options of loading large images imageNamed:@"" load asynchronously when viewDidLoad Called. Which is more preferable ? imgModel.image=[UIImage imageNamed:[dMain valueForKey:@"imgVal"]]; or like this. NSURL *ur=[[NSURL alloc] initFileURLWithPath:[[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:lblModelName.text ofType:@"png"] isDirectory:NO]; NSURLRequest *req=[NSURLRequest requestWithURL:ur cachePolicy:NSURLCacheStorageNotAllowed timeoutInterval:40]; [ur release]; NSURLConnection *con=[[NSURLConnection alloc] initWithRequest:req delegate:self]; if(con){ myWebData=[[NSMutableData data] retain]; } else { } -(void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveResponse:(NSURLResponse *)response { [myWebData setLength: 0]; } -(void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didReceiveData:(NSData *)data { [myWebData appendData:data]; } -(void)connection:(NSURLConnection *)connection didFailWithError:(NSError *)error { [connection release]; } -(void)connectionDidFinishLoading:(NSURLConnection *)connection { NSLog(@"ImageView Ref From - %@",imgV); // my image view & set image imgV.image=[UIImage imageWithData:myWebData]; [connection release]; connection=nil; }
