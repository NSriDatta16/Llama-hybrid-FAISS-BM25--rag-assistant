This is done with maximum likelihood. The formula you showed is the log likelihood: the logarithm of the probability of observing the data given the parameters $v$. You try to find those parameters that maximize the probability of observing the data you have observed. Pragmatically, you can estimate many log-linear models using just Poisson regression after you have appropriately prepared the data.
