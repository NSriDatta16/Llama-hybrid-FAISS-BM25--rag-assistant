Statistical modeling with two predictor variables that are dependent, and a response variable that is dependent on both of the predictor variables?

So I am doing a mathematical project about tennis serve speed. The question I want to dig into is that whether player's height and weight has a correlation with average first serve speed. So the predictor variables are height, and weight, and the response variable is average first serve speed. I tried using multiple linear regression, but it did not turn out well because I do not think height and weight are completely independent. In fact, I found a r value of 0.64 with my data. So is there a way for modeling the three variables together then? Thanks
