I think the question of readability is subjective and I personally have no issue with what you've done. I would consider using it if your organization "approved" it. I think the concept is sound and if you changed "With" to "Let" it would be more "functional" or "F#-ish". Personal opinion. Page.FindControl("LocationDropDownList") .CastAs () .Let(d => d.Visible = true) .Let(d => d.SelectedValue = "123");
