Depending on your access level, storing them in a flat file seems the easiest choice. To read the list of options, read the file and return an empty list if it isn't there. To add an item, create the file if it isn't there and then append the option. That means you don't send an empty file with your updates, so the data survives. It appears that you could put the file in the Data Directory or use Isolated Storage.
