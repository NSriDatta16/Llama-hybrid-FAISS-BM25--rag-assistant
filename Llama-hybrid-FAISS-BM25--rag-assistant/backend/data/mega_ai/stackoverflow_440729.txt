bcp.exe supports an "out" parameter that allows you to dump the output of an SQL statement to a flat text file. On the source side: Dump, zip and split the file into smaller portions, upload On the destination side: download, decompress and rejoin the files once you have them all, and bcp in. It's not an elegant solution. If you want to do it programatically, you'll be making process calls. It does, however, get the job done. The question you might want to ask, however, is how cost effective is it to create a solution around the limitations of not having a broadband connection versus getting it (if possible). I expect that regardless of the solution you decide on, you'll have ongoing maintenance problems with using dial-up.
