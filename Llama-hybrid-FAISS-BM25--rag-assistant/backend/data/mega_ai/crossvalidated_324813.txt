Is neural network able to learn from zero inputs?

In his "Deep learning with Python" book, Francois Chollet says that "With neural networks, it's safe to input missing values as 0, with the condition that 0 isn't already a meaningful value. The network will learn from exposure to the data that the value 0 means missing data and will start ignoring the value." As I know, the input value 0 has not any effect in the neural network, since it cancels the corresponding weight after multiplication. So, Q1. Why Chollet says that the network will learn to ignore the value? I think it is not necessary to learn; the network will ignore values 0 without learning! Q2. Why he says that "with the condition that 0 isn't already a meaningful value. As I said, the value 0 cannot carry any meaning, because it has not any effect in the network.
