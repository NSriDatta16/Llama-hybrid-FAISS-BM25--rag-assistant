Migating from CakePHP to Drupal, functionality question

(I've posted this on the drupal forum too btw) I'm converting the company websites to use Drupal, or at least trying to check that its going to be the best way forward. I have a background in PHP development, and I'm currently using the CakePHP framwork. I've built this site (not my design) and I can see how to replicate most of the functionality using Drupal, most likely using the CCK module. http://preview.tinyurl.com/yk6u8mt As you can see from the homepage: A user chooses a country. The country is passed using an ajax call to a script that decides which phone is best based on 'in country' network coverage. A div is shown recommending the visitor the best phone for that country. I'm wondering how to go about this in Drupal, I'm definitely not after a step by step guide, I just want to know if this kind of thing is possible with Drupal, and what approach to use. If someone can help that would be superb. Thanks.
