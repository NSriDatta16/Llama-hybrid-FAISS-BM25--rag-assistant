Calculate the intercept and coefficient in Logistic Regression by hand (manually)

I have a dataset as below . This is for predicting for the patient after taking the Rizatriptan (medicine) whether the they can relief the pain (stop headache) or not (Yes/No). By using spss, we can find the b0 = -2.490 and b1= 0.165 . I want to know the way how we can calculate to find b0 and b1 by mathematics or by hand. Thank you in advance.
