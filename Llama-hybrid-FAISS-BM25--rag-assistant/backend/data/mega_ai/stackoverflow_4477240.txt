Is there something like that? I've heard of no such library. Do you agree it's required? No, I don't. There are so many possible ways that you could write domain objects like this (depending on the business requirements), that organizing such a library would be a nightmare. Besides, this kind of object typically consists of just getters and setters, and can be written very quickly ... or even generated from a model ... so you save very little time / effort by using a library. (By contrast, the kind of classes you find in typical reusable class libraries are much more complicated, and much more difficult to write from scratch.) Having said that, I think there is justification for reuse of this kind of thing on a larger scale; e.g. off-the-shelf components or systems for managing customer databases, or website account details.
