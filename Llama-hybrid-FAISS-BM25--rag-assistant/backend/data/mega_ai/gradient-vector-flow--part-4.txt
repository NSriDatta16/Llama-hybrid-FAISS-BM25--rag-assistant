 a Gaussian blurring kernel with standard deviation σ {\displaystyle \textstyle \sigma } and ∗ {\displaystyle *} is convolution. This definition is applicable in any dimension and yields an edge map that falls in the range [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle [0,1]} . Gaussian blurring is used primarily so that a meaningful gradient vector can always be computed, but σ {\displaystyle \sigma } is generally kept fairly small so that true edge positions are not overly distorted. Given this edge map, the GVF vector field v ( x ) {\displaystyle \textstyle \mathbf {v} (\mathbf {x} )} can be computed by solving (2). The deformable model itself can be implemented in a variety of ways including parametric models such as the original snake or active surfaces and implicit models including geometric deformable models. In the case of parametric deformable models, the GVF vector field v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } can be used directly as the external forces in the model. If the deformable model is defined by the evolution of the (two-dimensional) active contour X ( s , t ) {\displaystyle \mathbf {X} (s,t)} , then a simple parametric active contour evolution equation can be written as Here, the subscripts indicate partial derivatives and γ {\displaystyle \gamma } and α {\displaystyle \alpha } are user-selected constants. In the case of geometric deformable models, then the GVF vector field v {\displaystyle \mathbf {v} } is first projected against the normal direction of the implicit wavefront, which defines an additional speed function. Accordingly, then the evolution of the signed distance function ϕ t ( x ) {\displaystyle \textstyle \phi _{t}(\mathbf {x} )} defining a simple geometric deformable contour can be written as where κ {\displaystyle \kappa } is the curvature of the contour and α {\displaystyle \alpha } is a user-selected constant. A more sophisticated deformable model formulation that combines the geodesic active contour flow with GVF forces was proposed in . This paper also shows how to apply the Additive Operator Splitting schema for rapid computation of this segmentation method. The uniqueness and existence of this combined model were proven in . A further modification of this model by using an external force term minimizing GVF divergence was proposed in to achieve even better segmentation for images with complex geometric objects. GVF has been used to find both inner, central, and central cortical surfaces in the analysis of brain images, as shown in Figure 4. The process first finds the inner surface using a three-dimensional geometric deformable model with conventional forces. Then the central surface is found by exploiting the central tendency property of GVF. In particular, the cortical membership function of the human brain cortex, derived using a fuzzy classifier, is used to compute GVF as if itself were a thick edge map. The computed GVF vectors point towards the center of the cortex and can then be used as external forces to drive the inner surface to the central surface. Finally, another geometric deformable model with conventional forces is used to drive the central surface to a position on the outer surface of the cortex. Several notable recent applications of GVF include constructing graphs for optimal surface segmentation in spectral-domain optical coherence tomography volumes, a learning based probabilistic GVF active contour formulation to give more weights to objects of interest in ultrasound image segmentation, and an adaptive multi-feature GVF active contour for improved ultrasound image segmentation without hand-tuned parameters.
