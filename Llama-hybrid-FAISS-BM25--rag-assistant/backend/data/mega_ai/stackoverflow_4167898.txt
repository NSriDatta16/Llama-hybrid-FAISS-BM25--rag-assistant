jQuery Resizable: getting ui-resizable-w to act like ui-resizable-e

$('#foo').resizable({ resize:function(){} }); Question This creates a east/south handle, how do you create a east/west? By changing the south class (ui-resizable-s) to the west class (ui-resizable-w) -current debug workaround-, the west does not behave like the east. When the east is dragged, the element is expanded. When the west is dragged, the element is expanded but a left positioning is also applied. Any ideas?
