Can I conduct a PCA on binary presence-absence data?

I have presence-absence data for 53 wildlife species at 60 different sites. I am a bit confused as to whether a PCA would be appropriate for this sort of data. If so, is there a specific R package I need to use, and do I need to standardize the data considering it's just 0's and 1's? If not, what other data analysis options do I have? Thank you, and I appreciate any advice. I am not experienced in this topic and have confused myself looking at previous similar questions. I have tried conducting a PCA using a couple different R packages but am unsure if this is a valid technique and if am doing it correctly.
