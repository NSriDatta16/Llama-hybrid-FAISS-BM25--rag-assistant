One thing to note, based upon some of the answers given, is that if you find that you are needing to write numerous unit tests to do the same thing over and over, consider refactoring the root cause of the code in question. Do you need to write a test for everywhere you access a configuration setting? No. You can test it once if you refactor and create a single point of entry for the functionality. I believe in testing as large an amount of functionality as is feasibly possible. But it is really important to realize that if you omit the refactoring step, your code coverage will plummet as you continue to have "one-off" implementations throughout the codebase.
