How to classify or model this problem?

I have a data integration problem between two data sources (lets call them A and B), I have applied three functions(for the three attributes of every instance) in order to calculate the similarity between two instances a and b of each data source. Every function returns a similarity coefficient, a number in R between [0.0, 1.0] describing how similiar are an instance a to an instance b. Example: For the instance a and b we have three different similarity measures $Sim_{1}(a,b) = 0.6$ $Sim_{2}(a,b) = 0.3$ $Sim_{3}(a,b) = 0.7$ With this values I can calcule the pertinence score (PS) that is the result of multiply every similarity measure for the weight of every attribute. The formule is like this: $PS\left(a, b\right) = w_{1} Sim_{1}(a,b) + w_{2} Sim_{2}(a,b) + w_{3} Sim_{3}(a,b)$ An example here can be: Entity1 Entity2 Sim1 Sim2 Sim3 PS —---------------------------------------------------------------------— a b 0.6 0.3 0.7 w1*0.6 + w2*0.3 + w3*0.7 c c 0.4 0.8 0.9 w1*0.4 + w2*0.8 + w3*0.9 I have in addition three sets that have the same form from above: the valid correspondences (user validation), invalid (again the user says so) and not yet classified (examples in the wild). Now, I want to calculate the optimal values for w1, w2 and w3 for maximize the value of PS when the correspondence is valid and at the same time reduce its value when the correspondence is invalid. So, after that I will use those values of w1,w2 and w3 in the not yet classified set and know if an entity is or is not a valid correspondence. My big problem here is that I don't know how classified this problem. At first, I thought it was a classification problem(a machine learning one), but I want to have the optimal values for three variables, so I discarded the idea. I think it is maybe an optimisation(maximisation or minimization) problem, but I don't know how to set up the correspondence function for the math model. have some of you an idea for helping me with this problem? I'm a beginner in this domain.
