As of OpenCV 2.2.0, the package name for the Python bindings is "cv".The old bindings named "opencv" are not maintained any longer. You might have to adjust your code. See http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/PythonInterface . The official OpenCV installer does not install the Python bindings into your Python directory. There should be a Python2.7 directory inside your OpenCV 2.2.0 installation directory. Copy the whole Lib folder from OpenCV\Python2.7\ to C:\Python27\ and make sure your OpenCV\bin directory is in the Windows DLL search path. Alternatively use the opencv-python installers at http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#opencv .
