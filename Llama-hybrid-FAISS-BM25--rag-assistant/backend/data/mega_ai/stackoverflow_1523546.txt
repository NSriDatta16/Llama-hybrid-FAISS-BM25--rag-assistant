ASP.Net: IE6 making invalid requests

I have a live site where every error is logged and e-mailed to me. I've been getting a lot of "Padding is invalid and cannot be removed." errors on requests to WebResource.axd. Looking closely, the request is erroneous. This is the request in question: /webresource.axd?d=mgqvdy8omlq71j1set2ida2&ampt=633700045603820000 And this is how it should look: /WebResource.axd?d=MgQvdy8OmLQ71j1SET2IdA2&amp;t=633700045603820000 Notice the lack of capitalization and, more importantly, the lack of ; after &amp. The user agent is this: UA: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 2.0.50727) What could this be? Could a real, actual user be getting errors because of this? Is this something that IE could actually be doing wrong? Or is this just a badly written bot? This happens every now and then, it definitely doesn't happen to all our users, or even to all our IE users. UPDATE: I'm also getting a lot of "Invalid character in a Base-64 string." when forms are posted, also only from IE 6.0, so i'm guessing they're related. Thanks for your help! Daniel
