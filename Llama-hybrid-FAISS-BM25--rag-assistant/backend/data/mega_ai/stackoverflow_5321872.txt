Formatting the Highcharts multiple-axes graph's zooming effect

I am trying to implement multiple axes chart using high charts. Ref# http://www.highcharts.com/demo/?example=combo-multi-axes&theme=default Can someone please confirm that multiple axes graph can be made zoomable to display date wise data like time series graph (ref# http://highcharts.com/demo/?example=line-time-series&theme=default ). Thanks in advance!
