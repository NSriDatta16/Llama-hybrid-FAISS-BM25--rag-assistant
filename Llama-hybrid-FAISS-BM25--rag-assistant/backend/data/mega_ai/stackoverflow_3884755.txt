Magento: Difference between loading product through collection than product model

So we were trying to load a product through a collection with certain criteria, we didn't have the sku or the id so when we did the following $prodModel->getCollection() ->addAttributeToFilter('visibility', $visibility) ->addAttributeToSelect('*') ->addCategoryFilter($cat) ->addAttributeToFilter('attribute_1', $sattribute_1) ->addAttributeToFilter('attribute_2', $attribute_2) ->addAttributeToFilter('type_id', 'configurable') ->load() ->getFirstItem() When doing this we got the product we wanted but for some reason it didn't have all of the attributes, even though we specified "*" for all attributes. Specifically the one we were not getting was the media gallery attribute. What we ended up doing is saying getFirstItem()->getId() then loaded the product and it worked find. I just don't understand whey loading the product with the catalog product model would have more attributes.
