When you perform a regular Hibernate query (HQL or Criteria), Hibernate will try to map the resultset based on the properties of the entities which you specified in the mapping. If you are not bringing the "promised" data from the database, you'll need to handle the mapping by yourself, using a ResultTransformer . In this case, you'd still use your CityComplete , but they will be without a ZIPCODE . Unfortunately, there's not much documentation about how to use a ResultTransformer , but you can take a look at the Hibernate's JavaDoc and see if there's one that you could use. If not, you'd need to implement your own: http://docs.jboss.org/hibernate/core/3.6/javadocs/org/hibernate/transform/ResultTransformer.html
