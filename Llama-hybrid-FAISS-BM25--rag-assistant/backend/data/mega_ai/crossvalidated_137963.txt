How do AR,ARMA,ARDL and other time series models correct for omitted variable bias

I have come across numerous papers that use an Auto Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) model of the following form: $$ \Delta y_{t}=\alpha_{0}+\beta_1\Delta y_{t-1}+\beta_2\Delta x_{t-i}+\gamma_{1}y_{t-1}+\gamma_{2}x_{t-1} $$ Where $y_{t}$ is one dependent variable and $x_{t}$ is one independent variable. My question is, don't these models suffer from omitted variable bias? What allows time series studies to use only one independent variable as compared to cross sectional and panel studies that rarely ever use less than 2 independent variables? Do time series models have a property that allow researchers to use just one independent variable? I am not aware of this since I have only taken a class in cross sectional econometrics. I would greatly appreciate your help.
