The issue here is you're trying to deal with at least two separate questions . One question is something along the lines of "Is A better than B?" or "Of A and B, which, if any, is better?" A second question is something like "Does A pass some independent-of-B standard?" or "Of A and B, which of them, if any, pass the independent standard?" These two questions are not particularly related. A might be markedly better than B but fail the standard badly. A might be markedly worse than B but pass the standard with flying colors. You can also get situations where you can't distinguish A from B and you can't distinguish B from the pass mark (you can't say it's better or worse on average), but you can distinguish A from the pass mark ! So the basic problem is you can't answer multiple yes-no questions in full generality with a single yes-no analysis. My advice is to treat the questions separately; "Does A pass", "Does B pass" and "Are A and B distinguishable?" even though the three questions together may not be quite independent; the dependence is low enough that they're all worth answering. Another approach would be to set up some contrasts (like (A+B)/2 vs pass and A vs B).
