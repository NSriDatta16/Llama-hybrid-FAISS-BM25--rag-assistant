jQuery For Loop with Post Not Counting Correctly

So, I have the following line of code, that does a for loop and subjects 12 on every loop. If I alert right before the post, it alerts the numbers as you would expect (72, 60, 48, 36, 24). But, with the alert inside the post it alerts the number 12 five times. Any idea why that is? Any idea where the number 12 is coming from? function loadEstimates(option){ for(term_length=72; term_length>=24; term_length-=12){ var post_options = {loadEstimates: 'true', coverage_option:option, term_length:term_length}; $.post('../includes/process.php', post_options, function(response, status){ alert(term_length); }); } } The second part of the question is, I want to output these in order and I've noticed on occasion the post will output something random like 36, 48, 24, 72, 60 because of server response times. How can I put the 'response' from the post into an array or something that will let me sort it before displaying it? Thanks!! /////// EDIT //////// Okay, so I took some of ChessWhiz's advice and used an array and came up with. function loadEstimates(option){ var term_length = new Array('72','60','48','36','24'); var term_length_output = new Array(5); $.each(term_length, function(index, t_length){ var post_options = {loadEstimates: 'true', coverage_option:option, term_length:t_length}; $.post('../includes/process_instantquote.php', post_options, function(response, status){ term_length_output[t_length] = response; }); }); alert(term_length_output); } This also solves my potential future conundrum of if I decide to use a number in the term_length that isn't divisible by 12. But, the term_length_output is still blank. Any idea what I am doing wrong with that? ** FINAL EDIT * **** Here is the code I ended up using. It does exactly what I need it to do. It's probably not the most 100% correct way, but it works. Thank you all very much for your answers and help!!! function loadPriceEstimates(option){ $('#package-term-options table tbody').append(' ').show(); var term_length = new Array('72','60','48','36','24'); var term_length_output = new Array(); var count = 0; $.each(term_length, function(index, t_length){ var post_options = {loadPriceEstimates: 'true', coverage_option:option, term_length:t_length}; $.post('../includes/process_instantquote.php', post_options, function(response, status){ if(status == 'success'){ term_length_output[t_length] = response; count++; if(count == 5){ term_length_output.sort(); term_length_output.reverse(); $('#package-term-options table tbody').html(''); $.each(term_length_output, function(index, value){ $('#package-term-options table tbody').append(value); }); } } }); }); }
