What do you mean by "save images on the screen"? If you want to display an image in a view, you can simply drag a UIImageView onto the view in Interface Builder and set the image to whatever image you want (see Graphics and Drawing for more information). As for scrolling, if you're using standard controls like UITableView or UITextView , these already have scrolling built-in, so you don't need to worry about adding scrolling capabilities. If you're doing something custom, then you probably want to look into UIScrollView .
