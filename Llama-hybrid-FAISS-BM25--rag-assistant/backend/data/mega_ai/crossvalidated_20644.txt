I don't think the Frequentists and Bayesians give different answers to the same questions. I think they are prepared to answer different questions . Therefore, I don't think it makes sense to talk much about one side winning, or even to talk about compromise. Consider all the questions we might want to ask. Many are just impossible questions ("What is the true value of $\theta$?"). It's more useful to consider the subset of these questions that can be answered given various assumptions. The larger subset is the questions that can be answered where you do allow yourself to use priors. Call this set BF. There is a subset of BF, which is the set of questions that do not depend on any prior. Call this second subset F. F is a subset of BF. Define B = BF \ B. However, we cannot choose which questions to answer. In order to make useful inferences about the world, we sometimes have to answer questions that are in B and that means using a prior. Ideally, given an estimator you would do a thorough analysis. You might use a prior, but it also would be cool if you could prove nice things about your estimator which do not depend on any prior. That doesn't mean you can ditch the prior, maybe the really interesting questions require a prior. Everybody agrees on how to answer the questions in F. The worry is whether the really 'interesting' questions are in F or in B? An example: a patient walks into the doctor and is either healthy(H) or sick(S). There is a test that we run, which will return positive(+) or negative(-). The test never gives false negatives - i.e $\mathcal{P}(-|S) = 0$. But it will sometimes give false positives - $\mathcal{P}(+|H) = 0.05$ We have a piece of card and the testing machine will write + or - on one side of the card. Imagine, if you will, that we have an oracle who somehow knows the truth, and this oracle writes the true state, H or S, on the other side of the card before putting the card into an envelope. As the statistically-trained doctor, what can we say about the card in the envolope before we open the card? The following statements can be made (these are in F above): If S on one side of the card, then the other side will be +. $\mathcal{P}(+|S) = 1$ If H, then the other side will be + with 5% probability, - with 95% probability. $\mathcal{P}(-|H) = 0.95$ (summarizing the last two points) The probability that the two sides match is at least 95%. $\mathcal{P}( (-,S) \cup (+,H) ) \geq 0.95$ We don't know what $\mathcal{P}( (-,S) )$ or $\mathcal{P}( (+,H) )$ is. We can't really answer that without some sort of prior for $\mathcal{P}(S)$. But we can make statements about the sum of those two probabilities. This is as far as we can go so far. Before opening the envelope , we can make very positive statements about the accuracy of the test. There is (at least) 95% probability that the test result matches the truth. But what happens when we actually open the card? Given that the test result is positive (or negative), what can we say about whether they are healthy or sick? If the test is positive (+), there is nothing we can say. Maybe they are healthy, and maybe not. Depending on the current prevalence of the disease ($\mathcal{P}(S)$) it might be the case that most patients who test positive are healthy, or it might be the case that most are sick. We can't put any bounds on this, without first allowing ourselves to put some bounds on $\mathcal{P}(S)$. In this simple example, it's clear that everybody with a negative test result is healthy. There are no false negatives, and hence every statistician will happily send that patient home. Therefore, it makes no sense to pay for the advice of a statistician unless the test result has been positive . The three bullet points above are correct, and quite simple. But they're also useless! The really interesting question, in this admittedly contrived model, is: $$ \mathcal{P}(S|+) $$ and this cannot be answered without $\mathcal{P}(S)$ (i.e a prior, or at least some bounds on the prior) I don't deny this is perhaps an oversimplified model, but it does demonstrate that if we want to make useful statements about the health of those patients, we must start off we some prior belief about their health.
