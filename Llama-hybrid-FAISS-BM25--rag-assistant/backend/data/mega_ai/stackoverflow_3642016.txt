Given the structure you've outlined, the only way to detect whether a particular date exists is to loop through the array of Calender objects and then to subsequently loop through its events. As strager has mentioned, you could maintain an object mapping each date to a specific index or CalenderEvent, but this would presumably require modification of the Calender logic.
