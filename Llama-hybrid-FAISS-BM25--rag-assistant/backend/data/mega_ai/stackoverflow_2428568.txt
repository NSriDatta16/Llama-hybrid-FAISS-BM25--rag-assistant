ANTLR ambiguity

I need to match in ANTLR a message containing 2 fields separated by a / First field can have 1..3 digits, the second field can have 1..2 digits, this does not work msg: f1 '/' f2; f1: DIGIT(DIGIT(DIGIT)?)? ; f2: DIGIT(DIGIT)? How can I avoid ambiguity in such a case? Is there a more elegant way to express the number of repetitions with ANTLR ? Thanks a lot Chris
