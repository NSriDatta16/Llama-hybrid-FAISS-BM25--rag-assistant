You can also take a look at AFrameJS . I have created a bare-bones proof of concept note-taking app that works offline using HTML5 WebSQL spec, but also want to create an adapter that uses localStorage as well. My personal opinion (and I am biased) is that using an MVC library of any sorts is going to help you in the long run - the value of libraries such as Backbone, Knockout, and AFrame lie in their ability to reduce the cognitive load of the developer by enforcing a good separation of concerns. Data related functionality reside in models, displaying that data resides in Views, and the glue is kept in Controllers. Separating these three concepts might seem pedantic at first, but the end result is code that is easier to develop, easier to test, easier to maintain, and easier to reuse. A basic tutorial on using AFrameJS can be found on my site at: http://www.shanetomlinson.com/2011/aframejs-tutorial-for-noobs/
