A structured approach to this problem is offered in [1] More precisely the following hypothesis test of linearity is performed: $$\text{H0: The data comes from a model with: $\text{med}(y|x) = \beta x + \alpha$ }$$ You will find more details these papers, more particularly in section 4.3 of 1 where the authors propose a test of linearity (the alternative is convexity/concavity). If you have a vector of values of $y$ and a vector of values of $x$, this approach is fairly easy to implement. Check the description of the catline in 3 The Deepest Regression Method (1997). S. Van Aelst, P.J. Rousseeuw, M. Hubert, A Struyf. Rousseeuw P., Struyf A., (2002). A Depth Test for Symmetry, in: Goodness-of-Fit Tests and Model Validity, Birkhauser Boston, pp.401-412. Edit: You might want to have a look at the recent conproj R package by X. Liao, M. C. Meyer. There is also a JoSS article associated with it by the same authors. Among other things, this package implements a (bootrap based) test of whether the function $f$ in the model: $$y_i=f(x_i)+e_i,\; e_i\sim\text{i.i.d.}\;\mathcal{N}(0,1)$$ is convex (concave) or linear.
