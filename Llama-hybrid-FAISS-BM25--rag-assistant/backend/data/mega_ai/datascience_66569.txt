I suggest to give transfer learning a try for two reasons: Your dataset is relatively small Skin, faces and similar human body features have been successfully classified or segmented by existing neural networks Specifically, you might want to have a look at Skin Lesion Analysis Toward Melanoma Detection . While the tasks were slightly different it did include a segmentation task of Melanomas. Here is an example of what they did: And this is a snapshot of how some of the models performed: Source: both images are from the paper linked above It might be close enough to your task to re-use their networks or some part of it. Once you have found a transfer network, you can vary the degree to which you replace or retrain it`s layers to see what works. Given your relatively small dataset I would not retrain too much but start with the final layers only. However , depending on how exactly your dataset looks like, there might be other tasks (e.g. from security applications where one needs to detect, classify or mask an object (e.g. a person or a face)) which resemble yours even better. Therefore, before digging into a specific model and apply transfer learning I'd do some more research.
