There are no differences between structs and classes in this regard in C++. They all are called just class types . Members of class types have no default values in general case. In order to for a class member to get a deterministic value it has to be initialized , which can be done by Default constructor of the member itself Constructor initializer list of the enclosing class Explicitly specified initializer for object of the enclosing class (that includes value-initialization and initialization with aggregate initializer). Additionally, all objects with static storage duration are zero-initialized at the program startup. Aside from the above cases, class members, once again, have no default values and will initially contain unpredictable garbage values.
