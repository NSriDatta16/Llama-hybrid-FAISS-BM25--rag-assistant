The application icon needs to be a native (Win32) resource in the .exe (or .dll ) file. This is extracted by the shell using the native resource APIs. But the resources that VS embeds in an assembly are managed (.NET) resources. (I.e. there are multiple ways of embedding a resource in a .exe or .dll and you need to use the right way.) VS will show you the native resources if you open the assembly file directly. .NET Reflector will show you the managed resources.
