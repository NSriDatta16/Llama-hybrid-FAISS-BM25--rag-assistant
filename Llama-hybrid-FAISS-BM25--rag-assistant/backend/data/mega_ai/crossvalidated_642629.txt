Determining the probability that a competing event will eventually occur

How does one determine the probability that an event will eventually occur given competing risks? Given the following state machine, I am trying to determine the probability that an observation in state A at time $t_i$ eventually ends up in state C (as opposed to state D ). I am considering using Weibull-AFT to estimate the hazard functions $h_{AB}(t)$ , $h_{BC}(t)$ , $h_{AD}(t)$ , $h_{BD}(t)$ for each of the transitions. This would give me the shape $k$ and scale $\lambda$ parameters for each of the underlying Weibull distributions. What I would like to do is get probabilities for the AB vs. AD transitions and probabilities for the BC vs. BD transitions, then treat the state model like a Markov chain. From there I get stuck. I have looked into Fine and Gray methods, but these seem to be more focused on the likelihood of an event happening during the next time period. I have also considered taking the ratio of the integral of the competing hazard functions, but it seems like I am making things up at this point.
