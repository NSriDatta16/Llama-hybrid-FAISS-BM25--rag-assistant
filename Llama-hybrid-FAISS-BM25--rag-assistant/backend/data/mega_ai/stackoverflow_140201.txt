You need to really sell them on the concepts of version control first so that they understand how svn works. A few things to try are Create a sandbox repository for training and experimentation Try to organise some training sessions/ workshops. If you're not confident in running that your self, try chatting to your local Linux User Group to see if they know someone who can help. Document your development process including the common subversion usage scenarios. Its also worth pointing out to the students that experience with source control will be a plus for their CVs. On your specific issue of committing .project files you can either set the svn:ignore property on a property or you can set the global-ignores value in each users subversion config file.
