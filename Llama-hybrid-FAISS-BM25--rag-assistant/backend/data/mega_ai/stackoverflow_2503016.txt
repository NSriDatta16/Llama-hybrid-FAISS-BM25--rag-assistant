Accessibility and usability issues when designing websites for older computer users

As a part of my final year university project I am designing a social networking website targeted mainly to older users. I was wondering what accessibility and usability issues should be taken into account when creating a website for such users, apart from obvious ones - such as bigger font, compatibility with current standards, straight-forward interface. Or maybe an older user is just the same as an average user and no special design is needed? Let me know what you think. Thanks.
