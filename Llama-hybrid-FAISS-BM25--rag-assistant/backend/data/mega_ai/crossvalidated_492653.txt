Lognormal model: reporting median or geometric mean

I have a bayesian lognormal model as follows ( brms package ): m = brm(y ~ 1, data = df, family = lognormal) Model was run with default priors. This is model's posterior samples on lognormal scale posterior_samples(m) Is exponentiated b_Intercept the median or geometric mean of y variable? I have seen that some websites say that this is a geometric mean, some refer to this as a median. Or if this is something different, could you please provide a formula for calculating geometric mean or median from this posterior? posterior_samples(m) %>% mutate(transformed = exp(b_Intercept)) %>% posterior_summary() %>% as.data.frame() Crude median, mean and geometric mean of Y for comparison Crude geometric mean was calculated as follows: exp(mean(log(df$y))) Data used set.seed(0) pi
