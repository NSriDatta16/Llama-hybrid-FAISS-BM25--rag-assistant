classifiers providing probability of being correct

The way I understand classifiers like kNN, ANN, SVM, Decision Trees... is that after being trained they will associate a new test object to one class out of a set of predefined classes. My question is whether there are classifiers, or extensions to the once mentioned above where objects are not only classified, but also a certain confidence level (probability of being correct) is provided. So something like $x $ belong to class $C_i$ with probability $0.8$. I was especially hoping for something in connection with SVM, maybe based on the distance to the margin?
