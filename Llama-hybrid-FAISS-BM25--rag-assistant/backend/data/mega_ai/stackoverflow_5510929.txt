How to delete jar files and other libraries that i don't need in eclipse?

Somewhere in some of my projects or maybe in eclipse, there are some jar files that i dont use them any more, and now the console displays this warnings every time i build even if it has nothing to do with the current problem: WARNING: JSF1029: Application is versioned at 2.0 (either explicitly by the version of /WEB-INF/faces-config.xml or the lack of a /WEB-INF/faces-confg.xml), however class 'org.richfaces.taglib.CalendarTagHandler' depends on a legacy facelet class.
