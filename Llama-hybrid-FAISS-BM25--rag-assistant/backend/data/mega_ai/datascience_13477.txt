Are there any libraries for drawing a neural network in Python?

I'd like to render a neural network in Python to make sure it is set up properly. I'd like to verify that it has the correct # of nodes, correct edge configuration, and perhaps even correct edge weights after training. I'd like to visually debug simple examples by printing them to a PNG/JPG but do not know any libraries that do this. Is there a library for drawing a neural network for visual debugging? (Such a library would of course make assumptions on the data types/structures - e.g., assuming the neural network comes from Theano, TensorFlow, or some other library. I'm flexible on the assumptions made.)
