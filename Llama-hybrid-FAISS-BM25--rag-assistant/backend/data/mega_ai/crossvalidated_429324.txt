Converting regular time interval to non uniform

I have a time series data set with multiple features. This data set is collected over 8 hours of time at regular intervals of 5 mins. How can i resample and select the data in exponential scale? I mean i would like to take the data at 5th min, 15th min, 1st hour etc...
