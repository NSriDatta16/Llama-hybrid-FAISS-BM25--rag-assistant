In brief, the protocol you are suggesting (PCA followed by k-means) is a manual application of a type of latent class analysis (LCA, also called latent cluster analysis). Your idea of reducing the number of dimensions prior to forming (unsupervised) clusters is not unreasonable. That said, there are far more advanced techniques available to do the process directly using latent variables. (Happy to share more on this as needed.) Furthermore, the use of the manifest variables (the observed variables you have as opposed to the latent variables imposed by a model or the cluster assignments) to elucidate the meaning/interpretation of the clusters is very common. In fact, one might argue that this is essential. The key is that this descriptive analysis of the clusters is not a statistical technique...it is a theoretical technique, and it must draw on the discipline knowledge in which the research question (and resulting data) are situated.
