Your series of times are simply transactions. What you want to do is "bucket" thewe transactions to create a time series e.g. 15 minute buckets or 1 hour buckets. Now that you have a time series you can develop a model that captures/explains the typical expectations. Violations of these expectataions may suggest Pulses or Temporary level shifts or local time trends. The time series may be impacted by day-of-the-week or known events (an ad for example) . Bringing in these possible predictor/exogenous variables can then reduce the number of unusal values providing clarity to the truly unusual.
