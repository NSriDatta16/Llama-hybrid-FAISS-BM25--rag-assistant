Catching mouse events for a custom SplitContainerDesigner

I'm trying to create a user control that will provide a draggable splitter between two panels — exactly like SplitContainer — in a custom IDesignerHost implementation. SplitContainer itself, as far as I can tell, is not an option; it will raise an exception unless used in Visual Studio's Designer. My implementation would look roughly like this , except that I'm not receiving the necessary mouse events. I've tried event handlers, On* overrides and overriding WndProc in the user control itself, the host control, and the parent form, but I don't appear to receive WM_MOUSEMOVE , WM_LBUTTONDOWN or WM_LBUTTONUP events anywhere . Per this bug report , I should be receiving WM_MOUSEMOVE in "the control designer"; I'm not sure what that refers to in this case. Any ideas how I can implement a draggable splitter?
