Is there a data structure that holds sets of data in .NET?

I'm looking for a data structure similar to a dictionary that returns the set of all related items to a key. For example, I would use it like this: var data = new FancyDataStructure(); data.Add(new string[] {"Elizabeth", "Liz", "Betty"}); data.Add(new string[] {"Bob", "Robert", "Rob"}); string[] alternateNames1 = data["Betty"]; string[] alternateNames2 = data["Liz"] In this instance, alternateNames1 would be an array containing "Liz" and "Elizabeth", and alternateNames2 would be an array containing "Elizabeth" and "Betty." I don't want to reinvent this, but I couldn't find any examples of such a structure. Update Thank you to those that have written back with suggestions. Many people have suggested using some version of Dictionary > . Currently I am using this approach, but it doesn't actually fulfill the requirement without being horribly difficult to maintain. Every value in every list needs to be able to function as a key to every other value ever added to it in a set. Thus, given the following: data.Add(new string[] {"Elizabeth", "Liz"} data.Add(new string[] {"Liz", "Betty"} alternates = data["Betty"]; I would expect alternates to now contain "Elizabeth," and "Liz." It looks as though I might just have to build such a structure to suit my needs. Keep the ideas coming though! Brian
