multiple resizables acting strange

I'm trying to place multiple resizable and draggable div's on one page that move (vertically) inside their own parent div. you can take a look at http://bit.ly/bCutBE However, these div's act really strange when I want to resize them, especially from the north side, they kind of move out of the screen very fast, while they shouldn't be able to get outside the parent div. I only want the div to be able to move and resize vertically inside it's parent, the dragging-part works pretty good, but the resize part give this problem. I can't really describe it better than this, but take a look for yourself and it will be clear immediately when you try to resize one of the coloured div's: move it a little downwards and try to resize it from the north side. the problem seems to be caused by the containment: 'parent', line of the resizable. when I delete this line it works fine, but then the coloured blocks don't stay in their parent, and I want them to stay inside their parent. I hope someone can help me with this... the jquery code I used: $(document).ready(function(){ $(".move") .draggable({ containment: 'parent', grid: [50,50], axis: 'y' }) .resizable({ containment: 'parent', grid: [50,50], handles: 'n, s', minHeight: 50 }); });
