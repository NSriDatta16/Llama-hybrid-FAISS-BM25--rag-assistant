I would probably use an InputStreamReader wrapped around a BufferedInputStream , which in turn wraps the socket. And write code that processes a message at a time, potentially blocking for input. If the input is bursty, I might run on a background thread and use a concurrent queue to hold the messages. Reading a buffer at a time and trying to convert it to characters is exactly what BufferedInputStream/InputStreamReader does . And it does so while paying attention to encoding, something that (as other people have noted) your solution does not. I don't know why you're focused on speed, but you'll find that the time to process data coming off a socket is far less than the time it takes to transmit over that socket.
