Using quantile regression to predict probability of surpassing threshold

Consider a continuous response $Y$ and design matrix vector $\mathbf{X}$. These are related through some function $f(X) = Y$. Suppose that I am interested in estimating the probability that $Y \leq 0.1$ conditional on observing $\mathbf{X}$. I want to use quantile regression to do this - can I confirm that this is a legitimate methodology ? We have quantiles $\tau \in [0,1]$ and after estimating our quantile regression for each $\tau$ we have our quantile estimates $\mathbf{q} := \{\hat{Q}(\tau) : \tau \in \{0.01,0.02,...,0.99\}\}$. I want to select the $\tau$ such that $\hat{Q}(\tau) \approx 0.1$. When I find such a $\hat{Q}(\tau)$ it seems to then follow naturally that $P(Y \leq 0.1) = \tau$. The reason is that my model has estimated the $\tau$-th quantile to be $0.1$, which is point on the x-axis in $Y$'s pdf that I need to find to be able to determine $P(Y \leq 0.1)$. In practice this may not work since an estimated quantile can be lower for higher $\tau$ under some $\mathbf{X}$. Not looking for logistic regression with a discretized response as a solution (since I already know about this).
