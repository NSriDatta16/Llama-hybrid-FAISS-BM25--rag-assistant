Define Entity 2 as: class Entity2(db.Expando): entity_1_ref = db.ReferenceProperty(Entity1, collection_name = "set_of_entity_2_elements") prop4=db.StringProperty() This defines a collection name which can be operated from the other side of reference. (Entity1 in this case). I have taken the liberty to rename prop3 as something more appropriate. Now you can do q = entity_1_object.set_of_entity_2_elements (a new property for all your Entity1 objects) which will give you the results you want. For more information, read this article indepth: http://code.google.com/appengine/articles/modeling.html Update: Sorry, I got it wrong. The above suggestion doesnt get only those elements with entity_1_object.prop1 == somevalue You can still get it in a round about way as follows: for obj in q: if ( obj.prop1 == somevalue): # Do your processing here or for obj in q: if ( obj.prop1 != somevalue): # Delete this object from the list 'q' But obviously this is not the best way. Lets wait for a better answer!
