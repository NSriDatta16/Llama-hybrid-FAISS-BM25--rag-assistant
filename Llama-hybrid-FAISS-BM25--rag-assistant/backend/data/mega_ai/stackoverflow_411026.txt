The bad thing about using try-catch block everywhere is that in consuming the exception you potentially conceal bad code. Try-finally (without the catch) does not hide exceptions, but does provide code execution guarantees. In your case, you can expect certain types of exceptions even from well formed SQL commands (like trying to insert a duplicate row) and thus I think the use of finally is well-justified. This assumes that you feel, as I do, that the connections should be short-lived and opened/closed when used and not for the life of your DAL. EDIT : I would second @Dave Markle's recommendation. A using block is much more elegant and semantically equivalent. The only time I might favor a try-finally over using is to avoid multiple, nested usings in favor a single try-finally.
