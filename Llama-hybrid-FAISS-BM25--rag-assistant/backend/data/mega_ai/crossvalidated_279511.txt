Is it legitimate to average internal consistency / cronbach's alpha over multiple scales?

I'm writing a dynamical script which enables the user to select different scales to analyze their reliability. However, I want adress the overall reliability in some kind of global variable. Since the user might select multiple scales which are not related in any empirical or theoretical way, I'm considering just using the mean of the cronbach's alpha value of the selected scales. Is it legitimate to do so?
