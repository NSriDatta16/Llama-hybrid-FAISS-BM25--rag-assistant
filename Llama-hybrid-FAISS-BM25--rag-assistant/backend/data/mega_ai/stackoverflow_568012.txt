WPF Window Drag/Move Boundary

just curious if you know of any way to setup a drag boundary for a window? It would be nice to have these properties: Me.MinLeft = 10 Me.MinTop = 10 Me.MaxLeft = 150 Me.MaxTop = 150 Those are made up properties, btw , which would be nice to have. I know I could probably setup a timer to fire ever 10th of a second and check the left and top and then move it back if it's over. But it would be more elegant to have the window act like it hit a wall and can't go any farther, like moving to the edge of the screen or something similar. Edit: There seems to be some confusion somewhere, the point I'm trying to make is in the paragraph above, dragging, not re-sizing.
