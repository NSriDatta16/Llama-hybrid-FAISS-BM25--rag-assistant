You mean Bloodshed's Dev-C++? It's a nice visual IDE for C++ which uses MinGW's gcc for Windows as the back-the-scenes compiler. The project's been abandoned for a while (in my opinion, using Delphi to develop a C++ IDE is a very stupid thing to do to draw developers' attention), however there's nothing that stops you from using it and updating the version of MinGW's gcc it uses to the latest one - besides it's GPL-licensed.
