Using a button to show certain elements

CODE HERE: http://jsfiddle.net/B7Y43/ Hello fello programmers, I have the following situation: My PHP-script generates multiple DIV's, containing: A question (with a class that is either mainQuestion or subQuestionOf[questionID]) A button A paragraph containing the answer I am trying to achieve the following: When the user clicks the button next to the question, the answer AND the subquestions should fadeIn. I have already managed to fadeIn the answer when the user clicks the button, using $(this).next('p').fadeIn("fast"); but since the subQuestions are rarely the next div, I think I need the use parameters. So in pseudo-code: if user clicks button { show answer; show questions where subquestionof=parent.id; } I have no idea how to use parameters, I tried getting the ID of the button's parent div with no luck: $(function getID(event){ var id = $(this).parent().attr("id"); alert(id); }); Alert shows: "Undefined"
