Custom form designer, move/resize controls using WinAPI

I have to fix some problems and enchance form designer written long ago for a database project. In Design Panel class code I encountered these lines private void DesignPanel_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (e.Button == MouseButtons.Left) { (sender as Control).Capture = false; switch (FMousePosition) { case MousePosition.mpNone: SendMessage((sender as Control).Handle, WM_SYSCOMMAND, 0xF009, 0); break;// Move case MousePosition.mpRightBottom: SendMessage((sender as Control).Handle, WM_SYSCOMMAND, 0xF008, 0); break;//RB case MousePosition.mpLeftBottom: SendMessage((sender as Control).Handle, WM_SYSCOMMAND, 0xF007, 0); // ... here are similar cases ... case MousePosition.mpLeft: SendMessage((sender as Control).Handle, WM_SYSCOMMAND, 0xF001, 0); break;//L } } } FMousePosition indicates whether mouse was over any edge of selected control. What confusing me is these windows messages: it seems there is no documentation on WM_SYSCOMMAND with parameters 0xF001-0xF009 (maybe it starts some kind of 'drag/resize sequence'). Any ideas? If my suggestion is right, then how can I cancel these sequences?
