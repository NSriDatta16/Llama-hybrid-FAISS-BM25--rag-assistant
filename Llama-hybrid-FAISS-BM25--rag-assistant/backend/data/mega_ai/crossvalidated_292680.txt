Volatility of original vs. first-differenced series in ARIMA+GARCH in R

I want to do ARIMA-GARCH modelling on the daily prices of crude. Since ARIMA-GARCH model cannot be applied to the time series in R, I first differenced the series to convert it into a stationary series and applied ARMA-GARCH to the differenced series. When I forecasted using this model, I got a two series of "Series" (forecast of the mean model, I hope I am right) and "Sigma" (forecast of the standard deviations) of the DIFFERENCED SERIES. Now, I want to know whether the standard deviation of the differenced series is the same as that of the original series. If not, how do I get the forecast of the standard deviation (variance or volatility) of the original series?
