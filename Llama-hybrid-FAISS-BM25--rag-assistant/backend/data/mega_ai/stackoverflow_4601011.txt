Each application stores its own data in its own private folder in /data/data on the emulator. Depending on the application it potentially can also store data on the /sdcard (e.g. downloaded images or whatever) which by convention should then be in /sdcard/Android/data/com.yourappspackage.and.so/ so that it gets cleaned up with uninstall but many apps also throw stuff all over the sd card (although they should not..) More is on the dev site e.g. at http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html All this is the same for the emulator as well as the real device. The emulator is just a virtual machine running on qemu.
