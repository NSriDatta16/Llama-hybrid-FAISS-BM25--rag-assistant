The sole reliance on the ACF and PACF using tools suggested in the mid 60's is sometimes but seldomly correct except for simulated data. Model Identification tools like AIC/BIC almost never correctly identify a useful model but rather show what happens when you don't read the small print regarding the assumptions. I would suggest that you start as simply as possible BUT not too simply and estimate a tentative model ; AR(1) as suggested by Glen_b . The residuals/analysis from this tentative model can be used to compute yet another ACF and PACF suggesting potential model augmentation or model simplification. Note that interpretation ala your references REQUIRE that the current series/residuals are free of any deterministic structure i.e. Pulses, Level Shifts, Local Time Trends and Seasonal Pulses and furthermore that the series has constant error variance and that the parameters of the tentative model are invariant over time. If you wish you can post your data and I will attempt to help you form a useful model. EDIT AFTER DATA WAS REPORTED : 365 values were delivered and analyzed, yielding the following AR(1) model with identified Pulses and 2 Level Shifts . . note that this had been a popular guess . The residuals from this model are plotted here . There is a suggestion of variance hetero-scedasticity but this is a symptom and one needs to find the correct cure which we will ultimately find. Proceeding the acf of the residuals shown here exhibits a suggestion of model inadequacy. A closer look at the table of the acf of the residuals is here suggesting structure at lags 7 and 14. Putting the the two clues together ( sample size of 365 and significant weekly i.e. lag 7 structure ) I decided to investigate whether or not this was indeed daily data. New users often omit very important information when they define their data on the mistaken premise that the computer should be smart enough to figure everything out. Note that the lag 7 and lag 14 clues were swamped in the OP'S ACF and PACF plots. The presence of deterministic structure in the residuals increase the error variance thus suppressing the acf. Once the outliers/pulses/level shifts were identified the acf revealed the presence of an autoregressive structure /daily indicators which then needed to be accounted for. I then analyzed the data allowing the software to proceed with the clue that it was daily data. With only 365 values it is not possible to properly construct models containing seasonal/holiday predictors BUT that is possible with more than 1 year of data. The model that was found is presented here containing 5 daily dummies , two Level Shifts , a number of pulses and an arima model of the form (1,0,0)(1,0,0) . The plot of the residuals no longer evidences the non-constancy structure as a better model is in place. . Th e acf of the residuals is much cleaner . The Actual /Cleansed graph highlights the unusual pulse points. . THe lesson here is that when one analyzed the data without the critical piece of information that it was a daily time series there were a ton of pulses reflecting an inadequate representation (or perhaps the advanced knowledge of the daily clue ) . The Actual/Fit and Forecast is presented here . It would be interesting to see what others would do with the same data set. Note that all analyses were conducted in a hands-free mode using software that is commercially available.
