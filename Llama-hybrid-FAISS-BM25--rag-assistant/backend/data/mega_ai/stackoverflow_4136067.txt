Magento: Products missing old-prices, keeps lines from being straight

In grid mode displaying the products, I would like the "Add to cart" buttons to line up. But beacause only som of my products have old-price, the once who lack it will display the button one line higher up. I have looked in prices.phtml without finding out where to edit. td;dr: How to add a empty line in catalog if the old-price is empty?
