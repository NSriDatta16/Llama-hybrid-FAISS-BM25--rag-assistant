Is ASP.Net State Server an elegant solution?

We have an ASP.Net MVC project that will start with a single web server but will likely soon scale into a small web farm. As ASP.Net Authentication stores a UserID, and data caching may also be useful, we will likely need to make the jump to state server fairly soon. I'd like to hear from others how State Server has been to work with and how it scales from a performance perspective. Alternatively, we could architect it as completely stateless by not using data caching and tracking sessions with an encrypted cookie. Update: I had some misinformation previously (from a Microsoft technical advisor...), Auth does not store in session like I thought, it just stores in the cookie. So, we would not need state server in this situation afterall.
