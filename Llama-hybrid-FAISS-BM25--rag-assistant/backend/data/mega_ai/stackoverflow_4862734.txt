I hate to say it since you seem to have put a lot of thought into this but I would say this is not advisable. Storing data like this sounds like a good idea at first but ends up causing problems because you will have many unexpected issues reading and saving the data. It's best to keep separate data as separate variables and columns. If you are really interested in accessing meta-content with out main content I would make two column families. One family has the meta-content and the other the larger main content and both share the same ID key. I don't know much about Cassandra but this seems to be the recommended way to do this sort of thing. I should note that I don't think that all this will be necessary. Unless the users are storing very large amounts of information their size should be trivial and your retrievals of them should remain quick
