I assume "my web-app never do a postback" means you will use AJAX :) There's no difference in using AJAX or server calls but I prefer the use of AJAX to keep a neat UI. Now, after reading your post, you need to know something. You have these two files: file1.js var a = 'Cheers'; var b = ' and beers'; file2.js alert(a + b); To include this files in your html file is the same thing as doing var a = 'Cheers'; var b = ' and beers'; alert(a + b); And this, in fact, is the same as doing var a = 'Cheers'; var b = ' and beers'; alert(a + b); Notice that inversing the order of the source files like this will generate alert(a + b); var a = 'Cheers'; var b = ' and beers'; and you will get a runtime excepcion (a is undefined). So, yes, you can have multiple js files, and organize your code. I usually do it having a single javascript class in a file, like in Java. Good Luck :)
