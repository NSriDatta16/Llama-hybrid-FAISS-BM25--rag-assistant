Created a Java Web app/MySql app

Started coming up with a java web app for online user interaction. Decided to use a MySql DB for data storage. I have already created the tables with the proper/expected data types. My question is I always thought the next step would be to creat stored procedures like Search/Add/Delete/etc.. that the user could envoke from the page. So in my java code I could just call the procedure ex: CallableStatement cs; Try { String outParam = cs.getString(1); // OUT parameter // Call a procedure with one in and out parameter cs = connection.prepareCall("{call SearchIt(?)}"); cs.registerOutParameter(1, Types.VARCHAR); cs.setString(1, "a string"); cs.execute(); outParam = cs.getString(1); } catch (SQLException e) { } but if my application was not in the need for stored procedures because the user actions would be simple enough to execute simple tedious queries. How could I set up my Java and Sql code to handle that. Could I just have the "Select" or "Update" statements in my code to manipulate the data in my MySQL DB. If so how would that syntax look like?
