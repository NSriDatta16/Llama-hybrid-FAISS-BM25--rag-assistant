PRESS is an out-of-sample measure. Even when you have an intercept, out-of-sample $R^2 is possible. It means that you would have been better off predicting the mean of $y$ every time, regardless of your predictors/features. In other words, you have a poor model that is outperformed by a na√Øve model. You say that this is unexpected performance. You're doing machine learning, so prepare yourself to be surprised and disappointed by model performance.
