The javax.inject package is not included as part of Spring 3, but it does support it if it's present. If you look at the source for AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor , you'll see the constructor uses reflection to locate javax.inject.Inject , and logs a message if it finds it. There's no compile-time dependency on it. You'll need to locate the JSR-330 JARs from some other source (e.g. the JavaEE 6 SDK).
