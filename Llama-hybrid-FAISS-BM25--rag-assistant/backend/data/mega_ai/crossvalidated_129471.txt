My advice in two words ( TL;DR mode ): reproducible research . For more details - largely not to repeat myself - let me refer you to my relevant answers elsewhere on StackExchange. These answers represent my thoughts (and some experience) on the topics: data cleaning: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/722/2452 reproducible research: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/759/2452 reports vs. dashboards: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/907/2452 data analysis workflows and EDA: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/1006/2452 big data and R: https://datascience.stackexchange.com/a/780/2452 Final note (sorry, if you find it obvious): regardless of the type of your business environment (which is unclear, by the way), I would recommend to start from business side of things and create a data analysis architecture , which (as all IT-related) should be aligned with business architecture, including business processes, organizational units, culture and people. I hope that this is helpful. UPDATE: In regards to creating a new or improving an existing data analysis architecture (also referred to as data architecture , in enterprise architecture terminology), I thought that these two sets of presentation slides might be useful as well: this and this .
