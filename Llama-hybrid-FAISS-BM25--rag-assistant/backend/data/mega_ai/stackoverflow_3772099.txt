The problem is caused by a couple of interacting things. First, make sure you are using the html strict doctype. This will help mitigate a lot of the formatting issues between browsers around divs. See alistapart for a description and list of real doctypes to use and quirksmode for a detailed comparison of them. Second, you will more than likely have to set the margin of your divs to 0. Browsers have different default settings. A strict doctype will alleviate most of this, but there are usually other areas you have to overcome as well. Also, you might want to grab firebug for firefox and leverage chromes dev tools. firebug will actually show you what all of the margins / padding / everything else is being set to. The Chrome tools don't give you a pretty picture with the details but you can see what the margins/padding/etc are in the Computed Style section.
