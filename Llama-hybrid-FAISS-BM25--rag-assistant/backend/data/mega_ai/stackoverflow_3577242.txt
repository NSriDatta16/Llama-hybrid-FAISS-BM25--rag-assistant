How do I organize/store a "type" field for a comments table?

My application has about half a dozen different types of items that a user can comment on (articles, photos, videos, user profiles, blog posts, forum posts). My plan right now is to have a single comments table in my database and then have parent_id and type fields in the table. The type field would just be a string and the contents of it would be the name of it's parent table. So for an Article comments, the type would be article , for example. Is that the best way to handle the comments table? Or is there some other, more efficient way to do that?
