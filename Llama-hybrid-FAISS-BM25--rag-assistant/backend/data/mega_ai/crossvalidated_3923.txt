For me (and I hope this is useful) factor analysis is much more useful than PCA. Recently, I had the pleasure of analysing a scale through factor analysis. This scale (although it's widely used in industry) was developed by using PCA, and to my knowledge had never been factor analysed. When I performed the factor analysis (principal axis) I discovered that the communalities for three of the items were less than 30%, which means that over 70% of the items' variance was not being analysed. PCA just transforms the data into a new combination and doesn't care about communalities. My conclusion was that the scale was not a very good one from a psychometric point of view, and I've confirmed this with a different sample. Essentially, if you want to predict using the factors, use PCA, while if you want to understand the latent factors, use Factor Analysis.
