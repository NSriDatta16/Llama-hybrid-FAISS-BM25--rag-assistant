I think the real question you need to ask is how much is your data at risk of attack. I'd say 99% of the time you'll be fine with just an obfuscated URL that will be hard to guess, since chances of the average user trying to do anything with it outside your app are slim. If you're worried about competitors stealing from you, I'd suggest something a little more nefarious: In your app, set it up so that your app and server change URLs every so often, maybe every two weeks. Then if someone does attempt to access your XML API, they'll be fighting a constant battle of figuring out your URLs. And as icing on the cake, keep the old URLs active but have them return bad data. I think you can let your imagination run and figure out the rest from here.
