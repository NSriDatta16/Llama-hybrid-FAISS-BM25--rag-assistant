Generalizing the bootstrap method proposed in the question, in which the regression does not attempt to estimate $X$ but instead determines how the distribution $F$ leads to a distribution of logistic regression parameters, one could use marginal maximum likelihood estimation, a technique common in random effects linear models. The likelihood to be maximized is the marginal likelihood $$ \mathcal{L(\beta)} = \prod_i \int_X P(y_i|X,\beta) P(X|\mu_i) \, X $$ Such likelihoods can rarely be solved exactly, but the existing literature may give some inspiration -- and the idea of estimating this $\mathcal{L}$ (or rather the $\beta$ that maximizes it) by Monte Carlo could be a good one. In the case that the distribution is normal, there might be hope of doing something more exact. Assuming for notational simplicity that $E[X|\mu] = \mu$ (just sop that I don't need to make a new variable), $$ \log \mathcal{L(\beta)} \propto \sum_i \log \int_X \left(\frac{1}{1+\exp(-\beta X)} \right)^{y_i} \left(\frac{1}{1+\exp(\beta X)} \right)^{1-y_i} \exp \left( - \frac{1}{2} (X-\mu_i)^T \Sigma^{-1} (X-\mu_i) \right) $$ Since either $y_i = 0$ or $y_i = 1$ , this integral is known as a logistic-normal integral , and there is some accessible literature on it: https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=&id=iaieM_3lcHQC&oi=fnd&pg=PR5&ots=CM9147oK0H&sig=SegYdLgH2UtTDmcspTix2fnBgRg#v=onepage&q=logistic-normal%20integral&f=false This book, in fact, is probably a good reference in general, as it examines this integral in the context of logistic regression with random effects, probably directly applicable to the posed question.
