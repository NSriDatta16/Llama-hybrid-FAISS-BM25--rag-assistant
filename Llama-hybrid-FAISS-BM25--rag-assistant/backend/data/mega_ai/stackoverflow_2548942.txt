It turns out there's an open "feature request" for this on MS Connect - I'd encourage you to vote for it if you'd like the functionality changed. https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/339410/ ADDED: It actually looks like there's another request for this same feature (though poorly named) that's been outstanding since Yukon's development in 2005 that I'd encourage people to vote for as well: https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/125347/ Update 2016 It seems Microsoft has tried to delete evidence of this bug's true age. Fair enough. Find the old site archived here.
