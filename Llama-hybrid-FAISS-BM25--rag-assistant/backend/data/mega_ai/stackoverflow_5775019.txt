It's happening because A isn't getting changed by assign_matrix_storage() . C is pass-by-value, so you're passing in a copy of A. So the change you make to A in the function is lost. The parameter needs to be something like double ***pointerToA and then when you call the function you'd do assign_matrix_storage(&A, 2); And obviously inside assign_matrix_storage() you'll need to properly deference pointerToA one "level".
