But, when I do the math on a $58/42$ split, it seems massively unfavorable to me. Over $100$ games, I would get ( $58$ wins * $\$580$ per win) + ( $42$ losses * $\$420$ per loss) = $\$51,280$ . I would expect this number to also be $\$58,000$ , but clearly I am wrong. Effectively this is like making a smaller bet. You win \$420 no matter what the outcome is. You win an additional \$160 in the case that you are a winner. So effectively the pot is not \$1000 bit instead it is \$160. So your net winning will be \$51280-\$50000 = \$1280 instead of \$58000-\$50000 = \$8000. This difference 1280 versus 8000 is just like the ratio in the difference in the pot 160 versus 1000. Some issues In your question you see to assume that you are winning \$58000 and this goes down to \$51280. However, I guess that this is not a situation where you get this \$58000 for free and you probably needed to invest \$50000 in the pot. So you are not 'winning' less. It is just that the stakes are smaller. On average you will be winning \$1280. The 58000-50000=8000 or 51280-50000=1280 are 'expected' profits or average profits. Going down from 8000 to 1280 means that on average you will have less winnings but also your risks are reduced. You are not always gonna win that 8000 or 1280. This person with the 42% might have some chance to win more often than you do. (But on 100 games with 58% win probability it is a very small overall probability to have a big risk. The consideration to choose a smaller betting amount would be a meta-consideration, outside the scope of the mathematics. E.g. matters like risk-aversion versus risk-seeking. Or possibly there's some game theory, like you need to keep your opponent interested enough to make their stupid 42% bet)
