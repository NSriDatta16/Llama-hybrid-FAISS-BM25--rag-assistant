Pros & Cons of separating the controllers using subfolders on an ruby on rails app based?

Need some help gathering thoughts on this issue. Our team is moving ahead with the idea that separating the authenticated and public sections of our app in two separate folders will allow us to be more organized and secured. I have seen this approach for Admin apps within the site but never for authentication. We are currently using Authlogic. What would be the disadvantage of this? Thanks for your help.
