iTextSharp How include GenericTag using XML Parsing

I'm using iTextSharp library, specifically to view .xml documents and transform them into .pdf files as follows: var docWriter = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, new FileStream("DOC.pdf", FileMode.Create)); ITextHandler xmlHandler = new ITextHandler(document); xmlHandler.Parse("MLDOC.xml"); I need to know if there is any way to include any attribute within the tags in my .xml file to indicate that they are GenericTag, or otherwise how I can identify a paragraph which I include a PdfAnnotation for example. I've tried to subscribe to the event OnGenericTag, but using the XML parser: xmlHandler.Parse("MLDOC.xml");, this method is never executed Thanks!
