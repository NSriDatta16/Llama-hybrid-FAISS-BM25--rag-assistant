To answer the question in your title directly: no, you don't have to. SVN repositories can be organized in any folder structure you choose. That being said, it's probably a good idea to at least put everything in a trunk folder for now, so that if later on you change your mind and decide that branching or tagging would be useful, you can add branch/tag folders easily, without having to move everything around.
