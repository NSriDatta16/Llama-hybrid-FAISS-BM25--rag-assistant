Mobile device identification from http headers

I have a large data-set containing HTTP Header information taken from network measurements. I need to use the UserAgent present in those headers to identify whether the useragent is for a Desktop or a Mobile Device or anything else. After doing that I need to identify the particular mobile device and perform further analysis on these device types. So, can someone tell me a comprehensive free database of mobile devices. Preferably, there should be an easy interface to match these user-agent strings and get the device information. I primarily work in Perl.
