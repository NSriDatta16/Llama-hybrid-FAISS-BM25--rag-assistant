You don't need to call a service to send the notifications, you can do it from the receiver. I don't think there is a way to save the alarm after a power off. What I would do: Start a service at boot . Check if an alarm need to be settled. Notice that you would need to save the alarm info somewhere. Check Android's Data-storage .
