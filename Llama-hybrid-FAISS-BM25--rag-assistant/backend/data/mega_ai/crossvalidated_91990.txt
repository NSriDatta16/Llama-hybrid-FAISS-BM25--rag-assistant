When doing principal components regression, do I need to standardize independent variables and/or dependent variable?

I want to run PCA on a set of variables and then regress my dependent variable on the PCA scores. I have the following questions: Should I scale and center my variables? If yes, should I also standardize my dependent variable before running linear regression? What if I don't standardize my dependent variable?
