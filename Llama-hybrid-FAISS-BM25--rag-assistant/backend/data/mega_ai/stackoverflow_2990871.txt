NSImage different size in code different shown by Finder/Preview

I have a couple of images that i use in my application(one of them is attached). The strange thing is that the real image size(shown by finder and preview) is 1200x701 px. When I access image from the code and as for its size, I get 360x210px. What is going on? Code I'm using to get the size of the image: NSImage *newImg = [[NSImage alloc] initWithContentsOfURL: [NSURL URLFromPasteboard:[sender draggingPasteboard]]]; float h = [newImg size].height; //height is 210px - should be 701px float w = [newImg size].width; //width is 320px - should be 1200px The content of the newImg is the same image that has been pointed and loaded - I display it in the NSImageView anyway so I see. Just the size taken with -size is wrong. This is the image: alt text http://www.tomaszkrasnyk.yoyo.pl/image.jpg
