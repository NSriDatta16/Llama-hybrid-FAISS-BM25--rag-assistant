Unless there is a lot more to this question, just end the thread at an "indefinite" pause and create a new thread after the pause. When the thread isn't running just release all the restorable data/resources that make sense (from within the thread itself, if possible). Take time to come up with a clear life-cycle and resource-ownership model. In general, let the thread be "cooperative" and manage its own resource lifetime. The general create/start/thaw/work/freeze/stop phases is the underlying basis of many long-running and/or pause-able jobs such as SharePoint Timers, Windows Workflow Tasks or SQL Server agents. Note that there is no "suspended indefinitely" phase in the list above -- this is just the space between the create and the start (or the stop and the next start) and is normally where external events enter the system.
