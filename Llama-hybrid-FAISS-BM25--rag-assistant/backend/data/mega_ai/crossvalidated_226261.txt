Not sure how to answer this, maybe you could ask more explicit questions. For sure you first need to transform this data so that all data on a family is merged in one row. So you need to create some aggregation. You cannot keep a 'gender' attribute for example. Maybe you want attributes like: number adults, number children, marital status, sum education years, average adult age, ... Then you can create linear regression models to model the relation age -> income Once you have done this I suggest to create a plot of this relation over the years to answer your second question.
