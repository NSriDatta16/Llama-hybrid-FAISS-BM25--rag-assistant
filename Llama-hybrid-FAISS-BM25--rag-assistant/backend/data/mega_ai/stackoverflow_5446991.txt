JApplet will not launch JComponent in browsers, works in Eclipse

I have coded a game proto-type in Java during my spare-time. This game was merely for my educational purposes only. I have it working fine via a JNLP launch file on the web, as well as on my main machine, via a JFrame. My main intention is to make this proto-type playable in web-browsers via the use of a JApplet. I have coded a class, called AppletPlayer.java. The intention of this class is to essentially serve as a launcher for my Game's main class. The AppletPlayer.java file is pretty much as follows: public class AppletPlayer extends JApplet { private Game myGame_; // This is my game's main class private boolean started_ = false; public void init() {} public void start() { if (!started_) { started_ = true; myGame_ = new Game(); this.setContentPane(myGame_); myGame_.start() // I set focusable, and enabled to 'true' in the Game's start method // My Game class has no init method. Just a start method that spawns a new thread, that the game runs in } } Now, the Game class itself extends JComponent, and implements Runnable, KeyListener, and FocusListener. If I launch AppletPlayer via Eclipse it works like a charm in its Applet Viewer. However, when I deploy to the web I see two things: On a Windows XP machine the Applet loads, stays stuck on the main title screen, never receiving focus, hence never registering any type of user input. On a Windows 7 Machine the Applet loads, I hear my game's music, but the Applet screen itself renders a plain white box and nothing else. These issues occur in both IE and Firefox. I have been perusing Google and StackOverFlow for awhile now, trying to dig up a solution but haven't had any luck. I am a bit unfamiliar with Applets, and was hoping for a nudge in the right direction.
