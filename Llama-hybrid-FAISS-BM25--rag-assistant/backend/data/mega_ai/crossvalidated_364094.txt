Your original model for each time point is $y = mx + b$. This implies a couple of things: on average, a person who reports 0 days of use will give a response of $b$. every day of reported use adds a certain amount ($m$) to $b$. Your revised model is $\log(y) = m'x + b'$. Taking the anti-logarithm of the revised model gives $y' = \exp(m'x)\exp(b') = \exp(b')\exp(m')^x$. This implies: a person who reports 0 days of use will give a response of $\exp(b')$. every day of use multiplies the baseline response by $\exp(m')$. So one way to interpret your anti-logged estimates is that every day of self-reported use results in a 8-11% increase in the measured metabolite.
