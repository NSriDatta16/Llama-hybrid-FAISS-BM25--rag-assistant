I just want to mention that in medicine certain type of interactions are important. They are variables that interact with treatment in a way that you would change the prescription of a drug treatment for example based on this covariates value. It is not always the case that these variables will be among the strongest for predicting the response. Hence standard subset selection methods may not pick these variables. But we would want to include them in the model to let the physician make personalized treatment decisions. Lacey Gunter developed a method to identify these variables in linear regression models in her PhD dissertation at the University of Michigan. This work was published in Statistical Methodology in 2010. In 2011 I coauthored a paper with her in the Pakistan Journal of Statistics and Operations Research which simplified the method in a way to make it applicable in logistic regression and Cox proportional hazards regression. A summary paper on these methods was published in the Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics in November 2011. This idea might extend to other fields of application. If an important variable interacts with another variable where interpretation of the important variable is part of the decisionmaking identifying the variable that interacts with the important variable should be identified and these methods can be used to do that. If this applies to your problem than I think my answer is exceptionally helpful. If not it is at least enlightening information.
