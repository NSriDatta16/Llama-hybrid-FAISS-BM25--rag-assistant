As klew already pointed out you probably want a member action and not a collection action. But before you go this route think if you really needed. adding custom actions is discouraged. You better stay within the constrains of the 7 CRUD operations. The way to do it is to add more controllers :) For example if you have users controller and groups controller, then adding person into the group is not join_group action in the users controller, and not add_user action in the group controller, its a regular create action in memberships controller :). and remember that controllers do not always correspond to models, and models not necessarily correspond to database tables, you can be more flexible. Back to your case, I think you might want to just add a singleton resource nested inside the project resource like this map.namespace :admin do |admin| admin.resources :projects, :has_many_products, :has_one => :plan end and implement :show action in the plans_controller, which should be mapped to /admin/projects/:project_id/plan
