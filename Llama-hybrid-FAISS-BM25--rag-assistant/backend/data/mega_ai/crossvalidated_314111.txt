In the empirical sciences, you can't prove anything, just provide evidence supporting something. Worse, time series can't provide any direct evidence of a causal relationship, because any association between measured variables could be due to a causal effect of unmeasured variables. Finally, beware of testing hypotheses suggested by the data : a typical hypothesis test works on the assumption that you came up with the hypothesis before you saw the data you're testing.
