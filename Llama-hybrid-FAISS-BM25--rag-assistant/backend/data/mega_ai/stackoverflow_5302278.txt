Copying the tools.jar file to a location where Eclipse is looking for it may work, but is messy and fragile since that's a step you may not remember the next time you upgrade your JDK. Better is to convince Eclipse to look for it in the proper location. Setting JAVA_HOME to the correct location works for some tools, but Eclipse does not honor it . A couple of things to try: Make sure your JDK is identified and selected under Preferences->Java->Installed JREs . Make sure Ant is being invoked by the JDK. One clue is that at the top of the Console output you should see the path of the javaw.exe which is being used. If that path is in the JRE, more convincing is needed. Check Run->External Tools->External Tools Configurations->[your Ant build]->JRE and make sure the settings there point to the JDK.
