Python vs. C# Twitter API libraries

I have experience with both .NET(5yrs) and Python(1yr) and I want to create a simple web project with Twitter as the backbone. I have experience with AppEngine, and have always wanted to try Azure. I'm going to make extensive use of sending and parsing tweets from lots of users at a time, and since I've set a short deadline for this I'd like to take the shortest path possible. So does anyone have any experience with both of these, or have any advice? A quick look at the twitter API libraries( http://apiwiki.twitter.com/Libraries ) gave me this for python: python-twitter by DeWitt Clinton. This library provides a pure Python interface for the Twitter API. python-twyt by Andrew Price. BSD licensed Twitter API interface library and command line client. twitty-twister by Dustin Sallings. A Twisted interface to Twitter. and this for C#: Yedda Twitter Library by Yedda. Every Twitter API method has an equivalent .NET method in this wrapper library. TwitterooCore API by Eric Willis/RareEdge Design Group. Binary .NET library that can be used in any .NET project. Twitterizer originally by DigitallyBorn, but now open source. Written for .NET 2.0. tweet# by Daniel Crenna. "100% coverage of the REST and Search APIs".
