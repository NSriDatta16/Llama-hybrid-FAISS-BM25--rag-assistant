You can have as many items in a document library as you want, as long as your last paragraph is true (you wont access the information trough the portal itself) We have a working test of our DMS system with 7 million files on the same document library and under the same folder too. But we never go trough the portal to see that content, we consume those files using the SPWeb.GetFile(guid) method, and we have all the information related to them on another SQL Database (which stores the GUID of the file)
