at produced English, Mandarin, and piano music. WaveNet demonstrated that deep learning models are capable of modeling raw waveforms and generating speech from acoustic features like spectrograms or mel-spectrograms, starting the field of deep learning speech synthesis. This was followed by Google AI's Tacotron 2 in 2018, which demonstrated that neural networks could produce highly natural speech synthesis but required substantial training data—typically tens of hours of audio—to achieve acceptable quality. When trained on smaller datasets, such as 2 hours of speech, the output quality degraded while still being able to maintain intelligible speech, and with just 24 minutes of training data, Tacotron 2 failed to produce intelligible speech. 15.ai, a free text-to-speech web application launched in March 2020, was an early development in the AI boom that used AI for voice synthesis. The platform could generate convincing character voices using as little as 15 seconds of training data. The application gained widespread international attention in early 2021 for its ability to synthesize emotionally expressive speech of fictional characters from popular media. 15.ai is credited with popularizing AI voice cloning in memes and content creation. ElevenLabs allowed users to upload voice samples and create audio that sounds similar to the samples. The company was criticized after controversial statements were generated based on the vocal styles of celebrities, public officials, and other famous individuals, raising concerns that the technology could make deepfakes even more convincing. An unofficial song known as "Heart on My Sleeve", created using the voices of musicians Drake and The Weeknd raised questions about the ethics and legality of similar software. Impact Energy Electricity consumed by hardware used for AI has increased demands on power grids, which has led to prolonged use of fossil fuel power plants which would otherwise have been deactivated. Microsoft, Google, and Amazon have all invested in existing or proposed nuclear power plants to meet these demands. In September 2024, Microsoft signed a deal with Constellation Energy to purchase power from a reactor at Three Mile Island which had been shut down in 2019. The reactor is set to reopen in 2028 to provide power to Microsoft's data centers. The reactor is next to the unit which caused the worst nuclear power accident in US history in 1979. Cultural During the AI boom, different groups emerged, ranging from the ones that want to accelerate AI development as quickly as possible to those that are more concerned about AI safety and would like to "decelerate". According to a survey published in April 2025 by Pew Research Center, 43% of American adults thought that AI technology was more likely to harm themselves in the future, while 24% thought that AI was more likely to benefit themselves in the future. Women were more likely than men to be concerned about AI technology. Business and economy Some economists have been optimistic about the potential of the current wave of AI to boost productivity and economic growth. Notably, Stanford University economist Erik Brynjolfsson, in a series of articles has argued for an "AI-powered Productivity Boom" and a "Coming Productivity Boom". At the same time, others like Northwestern University economist Robert Gordon remain more pessimistic. Brynjolfsson and Gordon have made a formal bet, registered at long bets, about the rate of productivity growth in the 2020s, to be resolved at the end of the decade. Big Tech companies view the AI boom as both opportunity and threat; Alphabet's Google, for example, realized that ChatGPT could be an innovator's dilemma-like replacement for Google Search. The company merged DeepMind and Google Brain, a rival internal unit, to accelerate its AI research. The market capitalization of Nvidia, whose GPUs are in high demand to train and use generative AI models, rose to over US$3.3 trillion, making it the wor
