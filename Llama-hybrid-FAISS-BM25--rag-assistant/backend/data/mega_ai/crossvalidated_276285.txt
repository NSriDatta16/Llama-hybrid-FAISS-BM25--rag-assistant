Logistic regression does of course provide predicted probabilities. You simply obtain them by back-transforming the corresponding linear predictor (on the logit scale). Most software packages will even do this transformation and the creation of confidence intervals for you (including SAS, if you read the documentation - see e.g. the PREDICTED option in the OUTPUT statement of PROC LOGISTIC). Without knowing more on your specific problem it is hard to say what kind of test you are looking for, but the typical hypotheses about probabilities that I see commonly used can also simply be formulated in terms of odds.
