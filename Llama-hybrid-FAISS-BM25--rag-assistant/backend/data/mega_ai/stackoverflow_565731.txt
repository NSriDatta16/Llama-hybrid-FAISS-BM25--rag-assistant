What winforms control to display message with minor html formatting?

Is there a control I can use to display a short message that contains minor html formatting (eg one or more links). I'd prefer not to use the WebBrowser control ( suggested here ) as it's a bit heavy for what I want, so any other suggestions welcome. If a user does click a link from my message I want it to be opened in their default browser, not within my application. I do use the infragistics controls so one of those would be fine but I don't see any that will do this.
