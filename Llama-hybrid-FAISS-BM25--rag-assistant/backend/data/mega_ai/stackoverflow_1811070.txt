SQL Server Management Studio solution vs Visual Studio Projects

Almost all of our projects involve a web application or winforms application and a data access layer (class library) and stored procedures/database scripts. We are looking for a good way to organize the solutions, and found a few ways: 1) We could have a sql server management studio solution for all the db related things, then have a visual studio solution for the application and data access layer projects. 2) We could do it all in visual studio with 3 projects, a sql server project, a web app/winforms app project, and a data access layer project. 3) We could do it all in visual studio with 2 projects, a web app/winforms app project and a data access layer project, and just put the sql scripts in a directory in the data access layer project. I'm sure there's other ways, but I'm just curious to see how others go about doing it.
