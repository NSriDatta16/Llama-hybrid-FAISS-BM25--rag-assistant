I think this excellent tutorial will help to get started with rails real quick: http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2006/12/14/revisiting-ruby-on-rails-revisited.html It demonstrates how you go about building a simple rails app and i think thats the best way to show people how its different. and once you've got their attention, throw in other things like mixins etc.
