There are a few problems with your code: cin >> number; You don't check if the stream extraction operation failed. A simple way to do that is to leverage the operator void*() conversion operator: if (cin >> number) ... operation succeeded ... The above code is equivalent to checking the failbit and badbit . Your usage of isdigit() is also wrong in that you're passing a number (e.g. 1234 of instead of a character (e.g. 'z' ). Regardless, adding a stream extraction operation failure check obviates the need for such a digit based check.
