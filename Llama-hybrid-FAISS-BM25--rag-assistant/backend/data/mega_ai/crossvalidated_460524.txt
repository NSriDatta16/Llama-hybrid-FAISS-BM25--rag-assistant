Interpretation of pacf and acf plots with no lag value exceeding significance bounds

I am trying to estimate a model for my time series data. The data contains Quality Of Life Index values from 1975-2006. auto.arima() suggests an ARIMA(0,1,1) model but I am still confused as to how to interpret it from the ACF and PACF plots of the first differences time series.
