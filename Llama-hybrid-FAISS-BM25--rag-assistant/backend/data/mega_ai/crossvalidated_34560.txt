That can actually sound a little strange within community of statisticians, but I am pretty sure that most of machine learning algorithms can be formulated as a functional minimization problems. That means that this is going to be covered with mathematical optimization . The other thing is that you will probably need calculus and linear algebra to understand what is optimization. And to interpret your results you will better have some background in probability theory and statistics .
