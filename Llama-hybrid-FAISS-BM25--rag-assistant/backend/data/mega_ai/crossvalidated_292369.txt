Kurtosis to detect non-random signals in a spectrum

I have a spectrum that was created from a time series using the FFT. The spectrum has several man-made "channels" in it; some of these are one-bin wide, some are several adjacent bins wide (larger bandwidth). I am trying to find these signals. I am considering using kurtosis to do this. Since everything that is not part of a channel is likely Gaussian, normally distributed noise, I will simply exclude everything that fits this description. For each frequency I create a time series to check for this 'randomness'. My question is, does this time series need to be created specially? Do I need to sample each frequency at a certain rate, before checking for normality?
