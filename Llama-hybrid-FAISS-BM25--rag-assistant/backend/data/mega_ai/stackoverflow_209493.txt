What type should Struts ActionForm properties be?

I inherited this gigantic legacy Java web app using Struts 1.2.4. I have a specific question regarding ActionForms. Some of them have only String properties (even for numbers), some of them use the seemingly appropriate types (Integer, Date, String, etc). What's the best practice here? Also, it seems that if a property is of type Integer, and the value the user entered is not an integer value, Struts silently swallows this and just doesn't set the property. What's up with this?
