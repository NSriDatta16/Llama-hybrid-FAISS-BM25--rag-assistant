I'm not sure "drag" makes sense with the code you've posted. What you've shown would slowly wind the object back to 0 rotation. If you want a drag/acceleration effect, create a separate variable with your acceleration factor, which you apply every frame. Then, you can apply a factor to that variable to slow rotation down/speed it up. Something like: private var _rotationAcceleration:Number = 0; private var _dragFactor:Number = 0.97; private var _clip:Sprite; private function startSpin():void { _rotationAcceleration = 10.0; } private function enterFrameListener(event:Event):void { _clip.rotation += _rotationAcceleration; _rotationAcceleration *= _dragFactor; }
