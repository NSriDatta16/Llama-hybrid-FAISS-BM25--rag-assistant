chrome javascript event handling problem

I have this problem with multiple event handlers being called simultaneously in google chrome. The following code fires the eventHandler function in case of a bookmark create event. chrome.bookmarks.onCreated.addListener(eventHandler); When multiple bookmarks are created, for example by dragging a couple of bookmarkbar links from firefox to chrome, multiple eventHandler functions are run simultaneously which result in undesirable effects. I need to make sure that only one instance of the eventHandler is running at a time and events are handled in first come first served basis. Is there a way in javascript to make sure of this ?
