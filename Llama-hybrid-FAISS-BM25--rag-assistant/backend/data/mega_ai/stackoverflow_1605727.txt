PMTU Discovery is used by you're TCP stack solely for optimizing packet size when sending. At you're level you only see the stream (ie. before packetization even takes place, let alone fragmentation). What you're problem really sounds like is you are trying to send data as you can, however you're tcp/ip connection is slower, so this is causing the space needed in ram to build up. Since you're using FTP, I would expect the FTP implementation you are using to already support and understand this??? Since you are asking for buffers, it sounds like a roll you're own based on a socket or something like that. If you are using the synchronous send methods, when the socket buffer is full, it should block you're sends until it has buffer space. Can you maybe give more details on what API's you're using to send the file, Builtin vs. roll you're own? Whether it be socket, networkstream, etc?
