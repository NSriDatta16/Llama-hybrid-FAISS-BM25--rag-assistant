This appears to be a difficult and ongoing problem in computational stats. However, there are a couple of less state-of-the-art methods that should work ok. Say you have already found several distinct modes of the posterior and you are happy that these are the most important modes, and if the posterior around these modes is reasonably normal. Then you can calculate the hessian at these modes (say, using optim in R with hessian=T) and you can approximate the posterior as a mixture of normals (or t distributions). See p318-319 in Gelman et al. (2003) "Bayesian Data Analysis" for details. Then you can use the normal/t-mixture approximation as the proposal distribution in an independence sampler to obtain samples from the full posterior. Another idea, that I haven't tried, is Annealed Importance Sampling (Radford Neal, 1998, link here ).
