Do edges in directed acyclic graph represent causality?

I am studying Probabilistic Graphical Models , a book for self-study. Do edges in a directed acyclic graph (DAG) represent causal relations? What if I want to construct a Bayesian network , but I am not sure about the direction of arrows in it? All the data will tell me is the correlations observed, not the inter-linking between them. I know I am asking too much, as I am sure following chapters will address these issues, but it's just that I can't stop thinking about it.
