How to alter undirected, binary graph to have specific graph-analytical characteristics while keeping others constant

I am working on a undirected, binary graph (derived from functional neuroimaging). I would like to alter this graph to change specific graph-characteristics (e.g. a specific value for the global clustering coefficient or the average minimal path length) while keeping all other graph-characteristics constant (or as many other as possible). There are some references how to alter a graph to have a specific clustering coefficient (e.g. this question suggests Wang or the block two-level Erdos-Renyi model ). There are existing implementations for the clustering coefficient ( here and here ). Are there similar references with respect to average minimal path length?
