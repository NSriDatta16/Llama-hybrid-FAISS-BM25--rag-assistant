Database Web Frontend

I'm looking for a web frontend for end users of our database (server runs either MySQL or PostgreSQL) for organization-internal contacts and order handling. I've searched the web for free/opensource database web frontends but only found admin tools (phpMyAdmin, ...) and frameworks that only show the tables but you cannot create apps (dadabik, vfront, xataface). I want to create apps like in Access forms but apparently there is no such tool out there... As a backup, I would use openoffice Base with JDBC connection or progam the frontend in PHP manually. An advantage would be user authentication (preferably LDAP). Any suggestions? Thanks in advance.
