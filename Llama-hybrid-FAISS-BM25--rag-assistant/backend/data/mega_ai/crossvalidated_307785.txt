Correlation between two binary time series

I have two binary time series, say df1 and df2. For each 'day' there could be 1 if the user had an activity that day, 0 otherwise. I want to compare the two time series (for two different users) to understand if there is a correlation between the two. First question: does it make sense to use pearson correlation for binary series? if not, what's best? Second question: my activity time series could have some lag, meaning that user 1 can have an activity on a day, but user 2 may respond the next day. How can I best catch this behaviour? If I use a lag of +1 day, I may not catch the 'same day activity' correlation.
