@user777 is of course right, but one shot at the reason for OP's crisis might be that he overlooked that $\bar y$ is defined as $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^ny_i$, not $\frac{y_i}{n}$, and the same of course for $\bar x$. As a matter of notation, it would be good to write $\hat{\epsilon}_i$ instead of $\epsilon$ to emphasize that it is the residual belonging to observation $i$. It drops out when taking averages as the residuals have average zero when the regression includes a constant (as it does here).
