There are two ways of embedding images in an email: As external references: ; and Embedded in the email. (1) is I guess what you're trying to do. Many mail programs will (rightly) block such images as they are used by spammers to test email accounts for liveness. It's better to do (2). See PHP Email: Using Embedded Images in HTML Email . Basically you create a multi-part MIME email (so you can attach HTML and the images) and then reference them by cid instead of a true URL. These are far less suspicious to any mail program that receives them but obviously result in bigger emails (as the image might be sent 100,000 times instead of just sending a URL).
