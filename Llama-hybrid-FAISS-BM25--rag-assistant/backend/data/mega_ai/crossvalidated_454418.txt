I would like to be able to write this as a comment but I do not have enough reputation. From what I read it does seem that running a glm would be the best approach but looking at your variables I think you may have multicollinearity, I am pretty sure light and temperature capturing something very similar even though not exactly the same construct. I would potentially run correlations between predictors and then, if you do have high correlations between variables, I would run a PCA so that you would be able to determine which variables to keep. If you then get to a stage you only have 4 variables, maybe you will be able to fit a glm, though only 30 observations seems quite a low number.
