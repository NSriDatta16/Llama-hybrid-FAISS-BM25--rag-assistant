Have a look at work done at Geography Department of University of Zurich, especially by Patrick Laube and Somayeh Dodge . Have a look at the paper Individual Movements and Geographical Data Mining. Clustering Algorithms for Highlighting Hotspots in Personal Navigation Routes ( link , presentation ). It showcases use of DBSCAN Kernel Density Estimation methods on GPS data. Also papers from Nokia's Mobile Data Challenge 2012 Workshop can be helpful here, especially: MobReduce: Reducing State Complexity of Mobility Traces ( link ) by Fabian Hartmann, Christoph P. Mayer, Ingmar Baumgart and A Trajectory Cleaning Framework for Trajectory Clustering( link ) by Agzam Idrissov, Mario A. Nascimento, University of Alberta
