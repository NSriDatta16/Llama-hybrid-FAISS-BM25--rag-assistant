Confidence Interval of Coverage Probabilities

Does it make much sense to calculate confidence intervals for coverage probabilities? For instance, if a CI coverage probability is estimated to be 0.80, does computing an exact 95% binomial confidence interval for the "true" coverage of (0.6823120, 0.8889842) (actually computed in R via binomial.test()) mean anything? That is, is such an interval "useful"?
