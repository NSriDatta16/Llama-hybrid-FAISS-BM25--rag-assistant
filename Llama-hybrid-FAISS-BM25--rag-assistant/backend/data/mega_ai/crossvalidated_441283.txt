What do you call a machine learning category encoder that involves counts?

At work I often have a variable encoding where you count the number of each category with respect to a key. (Which makes sense for the domain I am in) Does this process have a machine learning or statistical name? Recently, I realized from Encoding Categorical Features that is not exactly "one-hot encoding". For example, given this data: +----+----------+-----+ | id | category | y | +----+----------+-----+ | 1 | A | 40 | +----+----------+-----+ | 1 | B | 40 | +----+----------+-----+ | 1 | C | 40 | +----+----------+-----+ | 2 | B | 50 | +----+----------+-----+ | 3 | A | 100 | +----+----------+-----+ | 3 | A | 100 | +----+----------+-----+ | 3 | C | 100 | +----+----------+-----+ I normally get this: +----+---+---+---+----+ | id | A | B | C | y | +----+---+---+---+----+ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 40 | +----+---+---+---+----+ | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 50 | +----+---+---+---+----+ | 3 | 2 | 0 | 1 |100 | +----+---+---+---+----+ Which makes sense because a repeated category in this particular database is a measure severity and intensity. However, one-hotting is apparently this: +----+---+---+---+----+ | id | A | B | C | y | +----+---+---+---+----+ | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 40 | +----+---+---+---+----+ | 2 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 50 | +----+---+---+---+----+ | 3 | 1 | 0 | 1 |100 | +----+---+---+---+----+ My question is this a common procedure and if so what is its name?
