Depending on how far into development or production you are, you may want to migrate the models out safely using a migration to remove/backup data or what not. Then as bobbywilson0 suggested, using script/destroy model or if you rspec anything script/destroy rspec_model This will remove any spec tests as well. Or you can always just drag them to the trash folder.
