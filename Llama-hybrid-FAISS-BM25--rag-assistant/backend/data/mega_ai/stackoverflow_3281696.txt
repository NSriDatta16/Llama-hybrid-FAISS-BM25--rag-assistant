If you are debugging native code (unmanaged) using msvmon.exe on the guest OS you can use No Authentication mode to allow any remote machine to connect and attach a VS debugger. This is insecure, and precautions such as appropriate host machine firewalls should be put in place, but this will function without the guest VM needing to be on the domain. For moreinformation, see this Microsoft KB article , and this step by step visual guide for the connection procedure. Additionally, if you have any issues setting up msvmon.exe on the guest OS see this MS KB article for setup, and this article for firewall issues.
