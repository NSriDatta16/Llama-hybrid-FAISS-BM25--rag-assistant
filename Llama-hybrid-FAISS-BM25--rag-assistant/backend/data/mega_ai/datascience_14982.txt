Logistic regression with high cardinality categorical variable

I have a logistic regression model where I care about predictive power solely over comprehensibility. I'm interested in predicting win rates in a video game. There are 133 characters. Each team picks 5 of them (no repeats). Each of these characters is assigned to one of five positions (again no repeats). Currently I have each of these characters as a dummy variable. In addition I have an interaction variable between each of these variables. The position of a character is not included in the model at present. I know I can trim down the size of the model by excluding low-playrate characters, however my concern is that the required sample size is still far too small for the complexity of the model. Any advice would be appreciated. Sample Size: Aprox. Two million
