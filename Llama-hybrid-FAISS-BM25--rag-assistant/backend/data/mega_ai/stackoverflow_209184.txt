If you only have a few thousand rows, sure a simple delete will work. But if you expect growth or have a lot of data already then partitioning is your best approach. Delete can be prone to Undo space errors. Delete can be prone to snapshot to old errors. Delete does not reduce the tables HWM (high water mark) Delete may take a while depending upon the data size. Delete generates a lot of redo (depending on how much data you actually delete). Dropping a partition generates very little redo. Partitioning can improve some queries where Oracle performs partition elimination. I probably missed a few features etc., Partitioning will work great for dropping data. Its fast, will keep your data organized. And is scalable to large data volumes.
