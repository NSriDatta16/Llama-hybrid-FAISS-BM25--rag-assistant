This sounds like a namespace issue. You can put classes into unique namespaces to avoid naming conflicts between classes and also to help organize your code. Take a look at each class and determine what namespace it resides in. If they reside in different namespaces you will have to put a using statement at the top of the class your trying to access them from. Also if some of the class reside in physical different projects you will have to reference them as well. Hope this helps. Enjoy!
