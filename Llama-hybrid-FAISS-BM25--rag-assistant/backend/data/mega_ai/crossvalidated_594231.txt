Estimating a value from two factors

I want to meassure satisfaction per customers. I have to factors that define satisfaction: Amount of Incidents Sentiment-score per Incident Sentiment-score is calculated with natural language processing sentiment analysis and is in the range of -1 (negative sentiment) and +1 (positiv sentiment) Amount of Incidents is just the total number of Incidents. I want to put those two numbers in combination, for example: Amount of Incidents goes up by 20% & Average Sentiment over those Incidents stays the same -> Satisfactory -level goes down 5 Points Amount of Incidents goes up by 20% & Average Sentiment over those Incidents worsens -> Satisfactory -level goes down 12 Points etc. What kind of math do i have to look into to combine those factors? Sorry for the bad english and simple explanation
