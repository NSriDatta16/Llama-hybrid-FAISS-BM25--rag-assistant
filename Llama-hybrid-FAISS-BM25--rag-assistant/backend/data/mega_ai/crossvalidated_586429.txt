Longitudinal Binary Logistic Model vs. Cox Model

Longitudinal logistic regression can be used to approximate the hazard ratios from a Cox model: https://hbiostat.org/stat/binarySurv.html In the first paragraph, Frank Harrell states: In the special case where the response variable for a time interval is binary, the event is a terminating event, and interval event probabilities are small, longitudinal binary logistic modelsâ€™ odds ratios are the same as Cox model hazard ratios. My questions are: How do we assess interval event probabilities to decide whether they are "small enough"? What are the advantages of running the analysis as a longitudinal logistic regression as opposed to a Cox model? I'm guessing perhaps computation speed and to reduce assumptions of the model (e.g. to avoid the strong proportional hazards assumption in the Cox model)? If the analsyis is performed using longitudinal logistic regression, should we still call the effect sizes (exponentiated coefficients) "odds ratios" or is it OK to call them "hazard ratios" in this context?
