If you are trying to view a map from a web application (viewed in the mobile browser), simply link to Google maps as you normally would. Some mobile OS's will open their native maps application, and the others will receive Google's mobile-optimized maps website. Edit: As Robot K said, the http://maps.google.com URIs will be intercepted on iOS and open the native map application. If you want to force the same behavior on Android, you will have to do user agent detection and use the geo uri scheme documented here. The user agent detection is to determine whether the link you attempt to load is the http scheme for iOS or the geo scheme for android.
