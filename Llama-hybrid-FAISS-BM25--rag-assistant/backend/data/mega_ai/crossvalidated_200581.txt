What is a vector of effects?

The journal article in question is this article ( General mixed-data model: extension of general location and grouped continuous models , de Leon and Carriere), on p. 535 (or, based on the PDF file, p. 3). Starting at the third full paragraph (emphasis mine), To avoid overparametrizing the model, state $S$ is fixed as a reference state, and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_s$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}^{*}_s$ ($s = 1, \dots, S-1$) are defined as $\boldsymbol{\mu}_s = \boldsymbol{\xi} + \boldsymbol{\xi}_s$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}_s^{*} = \boldsymbol{\xi}^{*} + \boldsymbol{\xi}_s^*$, where $\boldsymbol{\xi}$ and $\boldsymbol{\xi}^{*}$ are the means of $\mathbf{y}$ and $\mathbf{y}^{*}$, respectively, for state $S$, and $\boldsymbol{\xi}_s$ and $\boldsymbol{\xi}_s^*$ are the effects of state $s = 1, \dots, S-1$ relative to that of state $S$ . What are these "effects" supposed to be? I'm familiar with the terminology of a "mixed effects" model, but I'm not sure at all what these "effects" here are.
