The C preprocessor performs a number of tasks, some but not all of which have better alternatives in C++. Where C++ has a better alternative use it. Those alternatives include templates, inlining, and const variables (an oxymoron, but that is what the standard calls them) in place of #define macros. However there are few things that you would not want to do without or simply cannot do without; #include for example is essential, and when coding for multiple platforms or configurations, conditional compilation remains useful (although should be used sparingly in all cases). Compiler specific extensions controlled via #pragma may be unavoidable in some cases.
