What's the newest way to develop gnome panel applets (using python)

Today I've switched to GNOME (from XFCE) and found some of the cool stuff missing and I would like to (try to) do them on my own. I tried to find information on how to develop Gnome applets (items you place within the panel) and most likely in Python, but it's not a hard limitation. I found the article 'Gnome applets with Python' , but it seems quite old (2004). The first thing mentioned there is bonobo (whatever it is), but Gnome page on Bonobo discourages it. Gnome site has a page on applet development , but this one is even older (2003) and incomplete (lot of fixme write ). What is the current approach then? I wouldn't want to learn something outdated.
