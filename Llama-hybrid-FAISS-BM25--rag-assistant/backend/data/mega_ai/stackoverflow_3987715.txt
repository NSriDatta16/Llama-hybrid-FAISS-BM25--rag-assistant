Under what circumstances are RIA services navigation properties loaded?

We have a Silverlight 4 client connecting to RIA services. It's based on the standard "Business Application" Silverlight application in VS 2010. The objects we send to the client over RIA services are EF 4 entities that are POCO objects generated from our edmx by T4. Our RIA service is a LinqToEntitiesDomainService<> of our linq repository. We have two Entities that share similar structure but are unrelated. Both are both have navigation property that represents a single instances of another entity. Both are retrieved using methods marked [Query]. For one entity the navigation property is always correctly populated when we try and access its value; for the other it is never populated, it always remains null (well it seems to hold an EntityRef<> object that points to a null entity). We have verified the relations in the edmx and the generated code on the client side, both seem to share the same structure, so we donâ€™t understand why this difference in behavior is happening. Can anyone shed some light on the subject? Many thanks, Robert
