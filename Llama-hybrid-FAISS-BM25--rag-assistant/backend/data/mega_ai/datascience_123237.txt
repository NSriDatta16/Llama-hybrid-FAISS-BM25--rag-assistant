Python Darts API

I'm using the darts API for some time series prediction in python, while looking at the documentation for the RNN model I saw this parameters called training length. The description is not very clear how it is used internally by the model. As an example, say I have a time series with 20 time steps, and I build a RNN model with the training length equal to 12, does that mean that only the first 12 timesteps will be used in training?
