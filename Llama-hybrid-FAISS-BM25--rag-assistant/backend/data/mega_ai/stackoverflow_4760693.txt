There are cases where callbacks are elegant solutions (event-handlers, timers) where in java you would normally use nested classes. I would consider forward declarations if the owned class is (or could functionally be) a nested class. What else would A call then B? interface would be used when it is reasonable to assume that different callbacks are used, but only 1 per class (less likely). Otherwise, I would use a signaling mechanism as callback (observer) Frankly, I don't see what templated buys you, maybe because I haven't used it yet.
