Why do I need RegisterStartupScript for a simple jquery helloworld in asp.net?

I tried to call my helloworld by just including javascript inside webform but when running it page is blank on both chrome and firefox. In firefox error is "XML Parsing Error: no element found" function helloWorld() { $("#divSample").append("Hello World!!"); } helloWorld(); I needed to add in codebehind: protected override void Render(HtmlTextWriter writer) { this.Page.ClientScript.RegisterStartupScript(this.Page.GetType(), "startup", " helloWorld(); "); base.Render(writer); } In that case it works but I don't understand why I just can't use the 1st syntax why it's so complicated for such a simple stuff ? I also tried the suggestion but it didn't work either: function helloWorld() { $("#divSample").append("Hello World!!"); } $(document).ready(function () { helloWorld(); }); Update: Seems ASP.NET can be unreliable in some circumstances with ajax / jquery ? http://chiragrdarji.wordpress.com/2010/02/17/xml-parsing-error-no-element-found/
