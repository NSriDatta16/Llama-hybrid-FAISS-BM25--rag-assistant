You can get confidence intervals for the parameters in a logistic regression with confint(). E.g. set.seed(938838210) x1 0 m1 However, the odds ratios and their confidence intervals are not unique; they depend on the values of the ivs. I wrote about this (using SAS, but the ideas are the same) in this paper (see "Gotcha 5"). In SAS 9.2 they've implemented a simple solution, but I don't know of an easy one in R.
