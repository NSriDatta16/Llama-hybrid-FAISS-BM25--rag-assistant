I variant of your question is answered here: Linear model with constraints on coefficients in terms of ratios , but your question have a Bayesian twist. First you will need some prior on $b_1$ (maybe a weak prior), then you write $b_2 = \gamma_2 b_1, b_3=\gamma_3 b_1$ and now you need a prior on $\gamma_2$ with prior expectation 2 and (maybe a small) variance, likewise for $\gamma_3$, but now with prior expectation 3. It shouldn't be difficult to program such a model in bugs or stan.
