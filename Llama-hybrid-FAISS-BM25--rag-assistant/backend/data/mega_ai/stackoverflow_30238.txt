In addition to the other answers: The C++ language actually has the auto keyword to explicitly declare the storage class of an object. Of course, it's completely needless because this is the implied storage class for local variables and cannot be used anywhere. The opposite of auto is static (both locally and globall). The following two declarations are equivalent: int main() { int a; auto int b; } Because the keyword is utterly useless, it will actually be recycled in the next C++ standard (“C++0x”) and gets a new meaning, namely, it lets the compiler infer the variable type from its initialization (like var in C#): auto a = std::max(1.0, 4.0); // `a` now has type double.
