PreventDefault alternative for IE8

Situation : Trying to modify VideoJS.com in order to work with IE8 and Youtube Chromeless API. Problem : Progressbar dragging doesn't work (error on event.preventDefault(); 'not supported' according to debug) Demo : http://alpha.dealertouch.mobi/video/demo.html What I tried : Skip 'preventDefault' when it's IE, but if I do that I'll lose the functionality of the progressbar (drag/click forward and backward) Question : What is the best way to solve this problem for IE8?
