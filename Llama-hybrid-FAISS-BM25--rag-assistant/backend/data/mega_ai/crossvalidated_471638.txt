Ordinal, nominal and such categorizations are best suited for stuff that goes into cells in structured, tabular data, like a typical Excel sheet. As you point out, an image is a more complex type of data. In fact it's a table by itself whose pixel values can be categorized in that way. And as you noted, one can extract features from images (e.g. image size, average pixel value, location, ...) that can go into the typical tabular form (Excel sheet) above mentioned. Then the categorizations apply. Even then, as others have pointed out, the categorizations can be fuzzy and should be done depending on the problem requirements.
