You have mixed a couple of ideas. A $t$ -test is a parametric test (although the Bayesian $t$ -test can relax the assumptions) while the Wilcoxon test treats Y as ordinal and uses only its rank ordering. To get a Wilcoxon test, use its generalization the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model. The blrm function in the R rmsb package makes this easy and detailed case studies may be found here . For the Bayesian $t$ -test read this and see examples in BBR . BBR also has more background information about using the proportional odds model to get a Wilcoxon test.
