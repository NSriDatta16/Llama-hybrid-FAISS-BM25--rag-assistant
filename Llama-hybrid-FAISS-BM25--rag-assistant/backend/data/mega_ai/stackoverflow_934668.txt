The normal way would be to use one of the aggregation operators ( Aggregate , Sum , Average etc), but it entirely depends on the type and what you want to do. What type are you interested in? EDIT: Okay, so you want to concatenate strings... I don't think there's anything which will do that in LINQ to SQL itself. Options: Write a stored proc or TVF to do it in SQL Fetch the individual strings in LINQ to SQL and concatenate back on the client side
