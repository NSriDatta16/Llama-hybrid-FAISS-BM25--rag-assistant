I haven't used Bamboo v3, but it looks like you should be able to do it from that version onwards, as it supports a comprehensive "pipeline build system". From what I read here , you would define your two Selenium tests as Jobs that are to be executed in the same Stage. As long as you have sufficient agents available, it should execute them in parallel.
