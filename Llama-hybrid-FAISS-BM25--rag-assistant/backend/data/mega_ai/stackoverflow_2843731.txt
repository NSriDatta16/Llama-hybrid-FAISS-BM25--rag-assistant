I think you should go with a mix of iii) and i). If you know for a fact, that python will throw the exception (i.e. case iii), then let python do it. If there are some other preconditions (e.g. demanded by your business logic) you should throw own exceptions, maybe even derive from Exception . Using asserts is too fragile imho, because they might be turned off.
