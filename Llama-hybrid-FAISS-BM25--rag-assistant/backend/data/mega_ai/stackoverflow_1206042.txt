How to get firefox language setting? (REALLY)

I know this question has been answered before , but the answer given is not the complete story: I went into Firefox's Options->Content and removed all languages except German/Germany, and navigator.language hasn't changed - it's still en-GB (I'm in the UK). I'm told if I get the German Firefox INSTALL it will work, but I shouldn't need to do that, right? The useragent string still contains en-GB, too; but the accept-language on HTTP headers IS set correctly. So this seems to be a bug in Firefox, I spent a bit of time wading through their bugzilla, but I can't see this exact bug logged, though to me it seems a pretty huge oversight?
