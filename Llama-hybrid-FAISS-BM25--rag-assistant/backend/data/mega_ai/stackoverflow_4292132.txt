it's called "THE MIGHTY LINQ TECHNIQUE" :) Jokes apart it is Linq method to get the First element from the collection or return default value. var matchedRun = para.Inlines.FirstOrDefault(inline =>{ Run run = inline as Run; return (run != null && run.Text.EndsWith(inputText));}) as Run; => is called the Lambda techique for shorthand delagate decalaration so you can read it as Find 1st object from the para.Inlines collection where that object EndsWith some user suplied value or retrun default value if no match found if you don't want to use this technique which actually reduces lot of code so you can try below equibvalent code Paragraph para = CaretPosition.Paragraph; var matchedRun = null; foreach (var inl in para.Inlines) { Run run = inl as Run; if ((run != null) && run.Text.EndsWith(inputText)) { matchedRun = run; break; } } Now you can decide which is better to write
