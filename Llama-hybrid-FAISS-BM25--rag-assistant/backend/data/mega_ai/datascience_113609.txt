How to use strong labels in image classification?

I have a dataset where I have localized pixel-level annotations of a dataset of cancer vs non-cancer. Which deep learning methods can I use to optimize the model to focus on the localized regions of the image and ignore the regions outside the annotations? Additionally, I have a set of images with only image level labels. Is there a way to use both localized labels (strong labels) and image level labels (weak labels) in the same model?
