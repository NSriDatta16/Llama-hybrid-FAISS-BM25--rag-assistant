100% branch coverage? Does the person asking for something like that have any real world test coverage experience? In my experience, for reasonably complex projects, obtaining 75-80% code coverage and around 60-70% branch coverage is the best one can hope for. These numbers are usually the raw, pre-analys, numbers. They go up (~92-95% code and 80-85% branch) after the snippets impossible to reach are eliminated, like Asserts, default switch cases, 'defense in depth' code paths and such. As for your question: the less test cases you have the better. Don't forget that tests take time not only to develop, but to run and analyze failures too. After you waited your first time you wait 4 days for the whole test suite to finish, you quickly learn the value of reducing your number of test cases to the minimum that gives confidence in the coverage.
