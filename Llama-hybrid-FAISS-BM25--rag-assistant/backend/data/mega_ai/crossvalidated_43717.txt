I've run into the same problem using LIBSVM in MATLAB. To test it, I created a very simple, 2D linearly separable data set that happened to be translated along one axis to out around -100. Training a linear svm using LIBSVM produced a hyperplane whose intercept was still right around zero (and so the error rate was 50%, naturally). Standardizing the data (subtracting the mean) helped, though the resulting svm still did not perform perfectly...perplexing. It seems as though LIBSVM only rotates the hyperplane about the axis without translating it. Perhaps you should try subtracting the mean from your data, but it seems odd that LIBSVM would behave this way. Perhaps we are missing something. For what it's worth, the built-in MATLAB function svmtrain produced a classifier with 100% accuracy, without standardization.
