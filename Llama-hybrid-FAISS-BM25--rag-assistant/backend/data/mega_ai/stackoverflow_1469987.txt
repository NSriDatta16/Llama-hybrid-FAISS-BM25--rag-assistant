Maybe a bit of an anecdotal story here (but since it's the worst security hole I found)... There was a company which sold a custom CMS (for websites) to a number of companies/organisations (including ours unfortunately). They use quite a bit of (mostly 'LGPL') components they did not make. Lots of clients (including government). Authentication for access to different parts of the website (and the CMS administration system) was handled correctly. They used FCKEditor instances in their CMS (for allowing non-html-savy users to edit webpages). They also used FCKEditor's 'upload-connector' scripts to allow users to add documents, images etc... to the site. The url to this script was hardcoded in one of the publicly visible javascript inludes. They failed to have authentication on the urls with the upload scripts. Result : on every site they built one could (without entering credentials whatsoever) alter/delete/change/upload every single document/file and/or image on the website. We reported this gaping security hole as soon as we found out so it may not have led to direct damage (but it could have easily).
