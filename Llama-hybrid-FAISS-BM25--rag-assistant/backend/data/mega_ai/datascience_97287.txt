There is a confusion between " bias " in the mathematical/statistical sense (that is the difference between 2 values) and " bias " in the psychological/social sense which means prejudice. In fact the two can be related in all sorts of ways, not in a simple one-to-one sense. For example a biased model (in the mathematical sense) may counteract the effect of social prejudice (eg because the data are imbalanced due to social bias, so another bias can equalize this), while another unbiased model may support social bias/prejudice effects. The other way is also possible. There is no simple one-to-one mapping. This researcher focuses on Ethics, transparency and accountability of AI. It can be a start for a more rigorous approach to discrimination in machine learning. See also: What is Inductive bias?
