INARFIMA (integer-valued autoregressive fractionally integerated moving average), where is the error?

In http://www.usbe.umu.se/digitalAssets/9/9491_ues673.pdf the author specifies a model which I am working on implementing. There is a function defined $d_i = \frac{\Gamma (i + d)}{\Gamma (i + 1) \Gamma (d)}$ where $0 \le d \le 1$ and then the function of d defined $D = 1 + \sum_{i = 1}^{\infty} d_i$ yet $D$ diverges $\infty$ so how can this possibly be correct? There must be some mistake and I would appreciate it if someone could try to understand what the author was conveying or if I have completely missed something obvious. Update: the paper is clearly in error.
