The problem is not as you stated (reflecting the beginning of your solution process). That's where your error is. Per the problem statement, the total amount added to the storage bin for the week is the sum of 20 i.i.d. N(1.5,0.0625) random variables, which is N(30,20 * 0.0625). Your calculation is based on making one draw from a N(1.5,0.0625) random variable, call it $A$, say, and then using $20A$. That is very different than the sum of 20 i.i.d. random variables having the same distribution as A. You made the corresponding error on the removal term.
