Counterexample: Acne causes kids to start middle school. No...they simply happen to coincide because both occur around the time kids are 10-12 and therefore starting middle school. This is true for positive correlation only . In the case of negative correlation, the opposite is true: the higher A becomes, the lower B becomes. There's another aspect that differs from the way "correlation" is used in common speech. In formal statistics, correlation refers to a linear relationship, specifically the normalized covariance (divide covariance by the product of each variable's standard deviation). $$cor(A,B) = \dfrac{cov(A,B)}{\sigma_A\sigma_B}$$ What this means is that if an increase in A from 4 to 5 results in an average increase of 3 units in B, then an increase in A from 5 to 6 also results in an average increase of 3 units in B.
