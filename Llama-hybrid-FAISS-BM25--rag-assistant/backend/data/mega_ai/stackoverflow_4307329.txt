Using an external HD to write to and store a mysql Database

I have set up mysql database to run with java and eclipse on my Mac, it is running great, but now I will generate aprox 4.3billion rows of data which will take up approx 64gbs of data, I'm storing a large about of keys and encrypted values, I have a 1TB external i would like to use as a storage location, i first thought i could reinstall mysql onto the external but it no luck as it obviously isnt running mac osx, Is there anyway i Can point mysql to store a database on the external, i have done some searching but have not come across an answer yet. I am running Java to build and query the databse and Table if this comes into play. Thanks.
