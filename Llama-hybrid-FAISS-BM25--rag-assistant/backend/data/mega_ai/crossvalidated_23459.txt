Is there a Project Euler-alike for machine learning?

I found Project Euler http://projecteuler.net/ to be incredibly useful in learning programming languages. Is there a similar site for Machine Learning? I did see http://www.kaggle.com/ , but it is not nearly as accessible to beginners as Project Euler.
