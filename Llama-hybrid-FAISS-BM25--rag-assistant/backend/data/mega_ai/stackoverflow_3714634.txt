How to make sure that the date gets rendered based on the appropriate timezone

We use the following call to set the Date value and store it in the database. setCreationDate(new java.util.Date()); Assuming our database server is in PST timezone and user1 (in PST), user2 (in EST), user3 (in GMT). The user screen gets rendered based on timezone properly. If I move the database data to a different timezone (say EST), will the behavior remain the same or should I store the date value in GMT itself prior to storage. If so how should I address this?
