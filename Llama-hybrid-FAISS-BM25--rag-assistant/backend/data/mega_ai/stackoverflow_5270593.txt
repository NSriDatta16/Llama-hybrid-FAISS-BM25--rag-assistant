Why you are saying that some objects are not responding to TouchBegin and touchEnd methods.Without these methods how can you detect that the user had touched or not.i do not think that using timer in this situation will be a correct way .So make those objets to respond to these methods . Try making a bool variable eg:- BOOL isTouched - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { isTouched = Yes; } Now make you conditions according to this bool variable Good Luck!
