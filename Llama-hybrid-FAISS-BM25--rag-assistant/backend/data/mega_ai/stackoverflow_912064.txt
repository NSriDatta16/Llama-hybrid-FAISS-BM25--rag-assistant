JUnit Max Equivalent Tool for Visual Studio

I have been trying to find a tool similar to JUnit Max for Visual Studio. Preferably, the tool would work with Visual Studio 2008 Professional and NUnit. For those who are apparently unable to click through to the JUnit Max site, here is the description. JUnit Max is a continuous testing plug-in for Eclipse that helps programmers stay focused on coding by running tests intelligently and reporting results unobtrusively. Every time you save a Java file, Max runs your tests and reports errors in the same format as compile errors. Max fails fast, running the tests most likely to fail first. You only have to pay close attention to test results for a second (literally) before getting back to coding, even if you have a long-running test suite Try thinking of it like this... Visual Studio detects and highlights syntax errors. I would like to see unit-test errors highlighted in the IDE just like syntax errors.
