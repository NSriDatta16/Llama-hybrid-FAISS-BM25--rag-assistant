Changing colors of an image dynamically

I was wondering if it was possible if I had an image like: I would be able to change certain parts of the images colors. For example if I wanted the bow green and the present red with yellow stripes, would I have to make a new image that had that or is there a way to program something (elegantly) along the lines of that? I'm just asking to see if its possible and if it is, what language would be best to do this? Keep in mind this would be a feature on a website.
