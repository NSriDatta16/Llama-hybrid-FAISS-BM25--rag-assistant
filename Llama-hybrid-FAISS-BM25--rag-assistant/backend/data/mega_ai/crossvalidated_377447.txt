Machine learning algorithm is the full concept. These are deployed on machines that do not work when they are turned off, they "learn" only when deployed as learning algorithms, and it is an analogy to call what they do learning. However, that is no worse than normal language bending, e.g., calling a representative government, like France or Germany, a "democracy."
