Dividing a string into list according to the format given

I have a string like "SAB_bARGS_D" . What I want is that the string gets divided into list of characters but whenever there is a _ sign the next character gets appended to the previous one. So the answer to above should be ['S','A','B_b','A','R','G','S_D'] It can be done by using a for loop traversing through the list but is there an inbuilt function that I can use..... Thanks a lot Update Hello all Thanks to Robert Rossney , aaronasterling I got the required answer but I have an exactly similar question that I am going to ask here only...... Lets say that now my string has critaria that it can have a letter or a letter followed by _ and a number..... How can I seperate the string into list now...... The solutions suggested cannot be used now since S_10 would be seperated into S_1 and 0 ...... It would be helpful if someone can tell how to do so using RE.... Thanks a lot....
