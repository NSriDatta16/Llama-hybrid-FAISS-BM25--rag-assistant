You probably want to do one of two things: Write your server code such that ajax requests return an ajax error when a session is expired. That way the javascript will expect a return code that indicates a session timeout, and you can tell the user the session expired. If an elegant solution isn't forthcoming because of how your framework handles this stuff, just put a chunk of HTML comment in your login page like Uth7mee3 or something; then check for the existence of that string in your ajax code. Alternative, you can also set a timer on the web page that figures out when the session is about to time out and warn the user with a little message that lets them renew their session. Once it times out, blank out the page and give them a link to login again.
