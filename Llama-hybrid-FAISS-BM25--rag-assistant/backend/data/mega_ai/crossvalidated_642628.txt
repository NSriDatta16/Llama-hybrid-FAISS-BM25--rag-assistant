The conventional wisdom here is based on the readability of categorical labels which are often hard to read if the text is not horizontal. But this can sometimes be unhelpful in context where the categories from part of a regular series. For example, if the plot is of monthly performance over several years. Here, not every bar needs to be labelled with the full name of the month as the reader of the chart knows the sequence of months and the reader can interpolate the specific months easily without the labels (eg when year boundaries are labelled). Plus, for data like time series, the common charts show them from left to right so the bars may be interpreted more naturally in that orientation. So the penalty of readability for a chart oriented this way is not a notable issue.
