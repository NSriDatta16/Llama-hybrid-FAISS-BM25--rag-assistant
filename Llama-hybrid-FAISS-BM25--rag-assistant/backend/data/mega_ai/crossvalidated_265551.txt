Empirical Risk Minimization: empirical vs expected and true vs surrogate

In Tie-Yan Liu's book, he says that in a statistical learning theory for empirical risk minimization has to observe four risk functions: We also need to deÔ¨Åne the true loss of the learning problem, which serves as a reference to study the properties of different surrogate loss functions used by various learning algorithms. Usually the average surrogate loss on the training data is called the empirical surrogate risk (denoted as $\hat{R}_\phi$), the expected surrogate loss on the entire product space of input and output is called the expected surrogate risk (denoted as $R_\phi$), the average true loss on the training data is called the empirical true risk (denoted as $\hat{R}_0$), and the expected true loss on the entire product space of input and output is called the expected true risk (denoted as $R_0$). I'm not very confident that I fully understood the concepts that are being referred by empirical vs expected and true vs surrogate . It seems that empirical risk is what we can measure with our training set, which is a small sample in the possible sample space contained in the input/output space. But what about the true vs surrogate risk?
