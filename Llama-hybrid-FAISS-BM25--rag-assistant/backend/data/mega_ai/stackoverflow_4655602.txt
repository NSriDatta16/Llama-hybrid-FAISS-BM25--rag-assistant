Extern points to 0x00000000

I am using Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express, on Windows XP. I have one application that produces a DLL, a header file in this application also declares a pointer to a BUFFER as an extern. To register this DLL with the system, I drag it onto the regsvr32.exe icon in the system32 folder. I have another application that tests the use of this DLL, by initialising and calling functions from it. This application accesses the same BUFFER as the DLL, by using this extern declaration. At first, when I used the Visual Studio debugger to debug the test application, I could see the contents of the extern BUFFER from the loaded DLL. However, after repeatedly debugging this application, now the BUFFER does not display its memory address, just "0x0000000", so I can't view the data. Does anyone know why this might be? I can't understand why it used to work, but now doesn't. I haven't changed any aspect of this part of the source code, at all. Is it OK to access the BUFFER in the DLL by using an extern pointer like this, or is there a better way? Thanks for your help.
