Place the anchor tag before the paragraph tag and it will float to the right of the paragraph, but this will limit the width of the paragraph. If you really want it over the paragraph, use: #container { position:relative; } a { position: absolute;top:0;right:0} The latter method will allow the anchor to be positioned on top of the paragraph if so desired.
