If you need that level of control, you dont really want to use IB. Because, as you noted, if remove the view and then later recreate it, you would have to do it in code then anyway. Just design most of the views in IB, then write some code that generates just this view. Then you can call that same method again later to recreate that view when you need it. You may be able to archive it and later turn it back into an object, but that seems like an inelgant solution. IB does not allow for dynamic creation of controls at runtime, even if they used to exist but don't anymore. There is no shame in leaving IB out of loop for this. In fact it's probably a good idea. OR If its a complicated view with a lot of pieces, put the view in it's own nib, and make a view controller for it. Then you can simply instatiate the view controller with the nib name, and add the controllers view as a subview to you main view. Then your view controller handles loading of the nib, and you get to design it in IB. Nothing says the view of a view controller has to take up the entire screen either. self.otherController = [[OtherController alloc] initWithNibName:@"Other" bundle:nil]; [self.view addSubview:otherController.view];
