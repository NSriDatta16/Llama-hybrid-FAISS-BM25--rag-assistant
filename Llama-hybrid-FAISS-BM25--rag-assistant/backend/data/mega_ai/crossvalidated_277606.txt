Neural network restrict output range based on input

My goal to implement a neural net which outputs a range of values with an additional restriction: based on an input value selected among the features, certain output values will be forbidden. For example, suppose an input value is in the range 1 to 100. The output would be forced to be greater than the input value but less than 100. Another example would be to restrict output to the input +-10. Would simply adding +Inf to output values in the forbidden range accomplish this?
