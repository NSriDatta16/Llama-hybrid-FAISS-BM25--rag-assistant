Packing arbitrary rectangles into a circle to meet a space efficiency objective is a non-convex (NP-Hard) optimization in general. This means there will be no elegant or simple solution that will solve this problem optimally. The solution methods are all going to depend on any specific domain knowledge you can use to prune the search tree or develop heuristics. If you have no experience in this type of problem you should probably consult with an expert.
