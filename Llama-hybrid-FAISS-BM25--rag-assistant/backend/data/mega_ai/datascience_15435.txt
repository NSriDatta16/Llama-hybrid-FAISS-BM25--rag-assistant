A common example is the Jaccard similarity coefficient: $J(Y, P) = \frac{|Y~\cap~P|}{|Y~\cup~P|}$ where $P$ is the set of predicted labels for an instance and $Y$ is the true set of labels. This gives a value between $0$ and $1$ for each instance, which you can average over the whole test set to give a score. If $P = Y$, then $J(Y, P) = 1$. This is implemented in scikit-learn as sklearn.metrics.jaccard_similarity_score .
