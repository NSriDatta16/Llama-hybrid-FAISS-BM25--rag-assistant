Does application preferences remain after Android system upgrade?

I want to store preferences which are Android version dependent (eg. User Agent string obtained from WebView ). When user is upgrading system (say from 1.6 to 2.1), does those preferences last? I want to retrieve User Agent from WebView once, then store it in SharedPreferences . When system is upgraded I want to update this value.
