Intelligent Database - Capable of identifying out of the ordinary values

I am looking for a tool or system to take a look at the database and identify values that are out of the ordinary. I don't need anything to do real time checks, just a system which does processing overnight or at scheduled points. I am looking for a system at two levels: Database wide: Eg: Compare salaries of all employees and identify ones that are too low or too high from the average. Per employee: Eg: Check salary history for employee and identify payments that are out of the ordinary for the employee. The two above are only examples, take for instance the case with ATM withdrawals, Shopping order history, Invoice history, etc.
