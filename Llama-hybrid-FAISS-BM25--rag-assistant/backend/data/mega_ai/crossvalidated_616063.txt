validation for time series models

Suppose that I have a model $f$ that is trained to predict hourly sales of 100 stores. Each day I retrain the model, and I have 2400 data points each day. Naively, I can split the data into sth like hour 0 - hour 22 as training set, and hour 23 as the validation set. However this does not make too much sense cause the model has not yet seen the pattern on hour 23, how do we expect it to perform well on hour 23? However this seems like the only reasonable approach to validate the model.
