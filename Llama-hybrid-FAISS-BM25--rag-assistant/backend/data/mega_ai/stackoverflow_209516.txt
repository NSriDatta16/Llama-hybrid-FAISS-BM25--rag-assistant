How to deal with monstrous Struts Actions?

I inherited this gigantic legacy Java web app using Struts 1.2.4. I have a specific question regarding Actions. Most of the pages have exactly one Action, and the processExecute() methods are hideous monsters (very long and tons of nested if statements based on request parameters). Given that Actions are an implementation of the command pattern, I'm thinking to split these Actions into one Action per user gesture. This will be a large refactoring though, and I'm wondering: Is this the right direction? Is there an intermediate step I could take, a pattern that deals with the mess inside the monolithic actions? Maybe another command pattern inside the Action?
