How to tell curl to use clients ip not the servers?

i am using curl to get some info from a website, however it uses the server ip address but i want it to use the client ip address, so each user send request with their own ip not the servers, how is that possible? $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "URL"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FAILONERROR, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 0); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 5.01; Windows NT 5.0)"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_TIMEOUT, 50); $buffer = curl_exec($ch); curl_close($ch);
