OOP Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm using the concept of objects . These encapsulates data which is organized in the form of fields (often known as attributes ) and code, in the form of procedures (often known as methods ). Methods can access and often modify attributes of the object with which they are associated. In OOP, computer programs are designed based on having objects interacting among each other. OOP includes features such as data abstraction, encapsulation, messaging, modularity, polymorphism, and inheritance. Many modern programming languages now support OOP.
