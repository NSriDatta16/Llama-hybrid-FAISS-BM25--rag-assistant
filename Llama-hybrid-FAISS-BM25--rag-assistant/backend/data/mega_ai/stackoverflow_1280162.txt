Well, if you're not using an MVC framework of some kind, then I would say that having functions that output HTML isn't going to kill anyone. Generally however, it's helpful to separate HTML from logic, and this is usually done by creating an HTML template and template fragments with interspersed PHP. Something like this: You could then set up a $title variable (and others), and include('title_fragment.php') to output that bit of HTML. You can extend this to work with entire pages, making it so that your code only has to deal with small amounts of data that get passed to the template. When it comes time to make changes to the page layout or look, you don't have to go hunting through the code to find the bits of generated HTML... you can go straight to the template files.
