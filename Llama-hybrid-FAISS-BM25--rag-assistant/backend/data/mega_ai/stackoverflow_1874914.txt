Accessing local Azure blob storage via a simple REST 'GET'

I am working with Windows Azure and am just using the Blob Storage. I have setup my Blob Storage to run in its own Solution file with a dummy web role. I run it first on my development machine so the Azure Services start. I have configured the service to use the development shared key and account name. I am running into an issue when I point my web application (in another solution) to the local Blob Storage service. I can upload a file to the Blob Storage and I can see the records in my local database. Therefore, I have entered the correct settings in the web.config. However, I cannot access the file via a simple Get request. I have verified that the container is public. The URI I am using is: http://127.0.0.1:10000/{container-name}/{filename}.{extension} My code works when I use my production Azure Services, so is there something different about the Development Environment that I am missing? Does the local environment allow REST access? UPDATE: I recently found this MSDN Article that describes the differences between production and development Storage URIs. I also documented my environment here on my blog.
