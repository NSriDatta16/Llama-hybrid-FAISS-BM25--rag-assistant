Is a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm "marginalizing" the likelihood and the prior?

I'm wondering the role of a MCMC algorithm. Is it to marginalize the likelihood function and the prior in order to get the posterior distribution? $$ P(A \mid B) = \frac{P(B \mid A) \, P(A)}{P(B)} $$ Since usually, the ${P(B)} $ is difficult to estimate, is the algorithm replacing the marginal by providing random proposal values for the parameters and see if it should be accepted or not based on the likelihood?
