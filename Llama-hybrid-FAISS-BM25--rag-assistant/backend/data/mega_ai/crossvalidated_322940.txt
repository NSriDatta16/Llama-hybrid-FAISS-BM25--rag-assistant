How to find the relationship between average income and owning a house

I have a sample about the income of 110 households, and I want to see how owning a house is determined by the level of income. Or I want to see the effect of income on school enrollment for boys, girls, and both as three different nominal variables. I use boxplots as descriptive statistics, but it is not that well adequate. Any other method of analysis especially in SPSS would be appreciated.
