Word Embedding or Hash?

In my dataset I have a 'text' column and a 'followers' column containing lists of follower IDs, i.e. '1093777852477116417, 936194589043683328,...'. Some of the 'followers' values contain thousands of IDs. I am preprocessing the data for LSTM, and I will do word embedding on the text column. My question is, should I add the follower IDs to the word embedding of the text column, or should I hash the follower IDs and add an extra LSTM input layer for the IDs? Thanks in advance!
