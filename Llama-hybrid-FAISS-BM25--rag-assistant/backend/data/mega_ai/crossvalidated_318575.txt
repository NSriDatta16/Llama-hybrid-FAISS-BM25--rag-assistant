Am I correct in thinking that the answer has something to do with the neural net exploring different non-linear combinations of the x-values? Yes, you are exactly correct. OLS can only learn a linear combination of the input features, whereas a neural network with one or more hidden layers can learn any function of the input features, including non-linear functions. In this sense the neural network is a universal function approximator . In practice, the neural network's ability to accurately approximate the underlying function of the data will increase with more neurons and more hidden layers. However, increasing the size of the neural network comes with the danger of overfitting the data, in which case it may be ideal to reduce its size again or to add regularization .
