"0 tables, 0 records" after pushing a non-empty sqlite database to Heroku

I created a small sqlite database on my laptop and it has several records: sqlite> .dump PRAGMA foreign_keys=OFF; BEGIN TRANSACTION; CREATE TABLE "bus_bingo_tile_templates" ("id" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, "title" VARCHAR(50), "alt" VARCHAR(50), "image_filename" VARCHAR(50), "enabled" BOOLEAN); INSERT INTO "bus_bingo_tile_templates" VALUES(26,'bed','I took a nap.','nap.gif',1); INSERT INTO "bus_bingo_tile_templates" VALUES(27,'bicyle','Saw someone put a bike on the bus..','bike.gif',1); INSERT INTO "bus_bingo_tile_templates" VALUES(28,'books','I read a book.','book.gif',1); ... But when I try to upload it to Heroku, the result is "0 tables, 0 records": $ heroku db:push sqlite:busbingo.db Loaded Taps v0.3.11 Warning: Data in the app 'busbingo' will be overwritten and will not be recoverable. Are you sure you wish to continue?
