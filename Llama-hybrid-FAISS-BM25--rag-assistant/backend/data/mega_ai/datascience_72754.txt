Perform bootstrapping of an ordinary linear regression model, using B=100 bootstrap resamples of my dataset, and getting RMSE

So Im studying machine learning through R, and Im working with the boston data set from the library MASS. I am practicing bootsrapping. I already carried out analysis to determine how ,many distinct data points on average are drawn from the sample to make up a bootsratp resample, using B=100 resamples of the dataset. Next I would like to do two things- perform boostrapping of an ordinary linear regression model using B=100 resamples of the data set again and use the OOB samples to predict RMSE. And aslo use bootstrapping of a ridge regression model with 100 Bootstrap samples to predict RMSE and then compare my answers. I am having difficulty adapting the code from what I have already done into this. Does anyone have any idea?
