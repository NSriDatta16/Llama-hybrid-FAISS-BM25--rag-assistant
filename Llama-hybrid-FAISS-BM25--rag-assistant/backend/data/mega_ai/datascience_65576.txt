I would not concern yourself too much about any structuring of knowledge that declares that one subject is categorised as one thing or another. These structures are often wrong and knowledge in general is more fluid and difficult to define than can be viewed as some kind of Venn diagram. In addition, both Data Science and AI are poorly defined, and have more in common with marketing terms used to recruit staff and sell products than stricter academic subject areas such as Maths or Modern Languages. You will find Data Scientists working on "AI" projects and "AI Engineers" using basic statistics to analyse data. Having said that, I would prefer to say that Data Science and AI share a common set of tools, especially when it comes to machine learning. Neither contains the other in my opinion.
