This depends on a lot of things but I would say that this is fairly typical. Mostly due to at your lower level (sku level) you probably have more intermittent demand as well as a less stable seasonal signal for more items which makes it harder to do more complex forecasting methods. And, most importantly, you are taking averages across these items where you may actually want to weight the accuracies at this lower level by their volume. For example, if you have 10 products and 8 of them are low volume and 2 are high volume then you care a lot more about the forecast for the high volume. So you should weigh the higher volume forecasts (which will tend to be higher accuracy for the more advanced methods) more when averaging. Or not, but then you may cater more towards those lower impact skus (which will do better with naive methods more often).
