As you discovered in your link, you put the subscriber count in your user-agent, then you contact the Feedburner Support Group and tell them what format you will be using. The consensus format is something User-agent: Service Name (http://example.com/service/info/; ### subscribers ; [optional feed identifier] ) The optional feed identifier is typically used if you run several different services, and fetch the feed separately for each one; e.g. if you have a mail service and a web-based reader service, with different subscribers, then you might either use: User-agent: SO Agg/1.3 (http://example.com/SOAgg ; 5000 subscribers ; feed-id=mail-134 ) on request for the mailer, and User-agent: SO Agg/1.3 (http://example.com/SOAgg ; 2000 subscribers ; feed-id=web-134 ) on the request for the website; or use User-agent: SO Agg/1.3 (http://example.com/SOAgg ; 7000 subscribers ; ) if your system makes only one request for both services... You will usually need to specify what IP addresses are authorised to request the feed with that user-agent, as well.
