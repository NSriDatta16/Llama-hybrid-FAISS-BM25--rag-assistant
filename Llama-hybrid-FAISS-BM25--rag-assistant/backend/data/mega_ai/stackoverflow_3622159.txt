Constructing string with values from hash in Ruby

Suppose I have the hash { "a" => "b", "c" => "d" } and I would like to transform it into the string "a=b\nc=d" . The solution I've come up with so far is { "a" => "b", "c" => "d" }.map { |k, v| k + "=" + v }.join("\n") Is there a better/more elegant way? For example, can it be done using a single method call?
