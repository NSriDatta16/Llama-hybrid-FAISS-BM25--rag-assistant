Few months ago I had a similar problem whilst developing on my local machine an application which involved sending automating email notifications. I have lost quite some time installing Sendmail on OSX and eventually I could not get it working right.. My approach was to use the PEAR Mail as a temporary replacement for php's native mail function. Basically you can define a function called send-mail (see code below) and, once you deploy your app on a server, you can possibly replace the calls to that function with calls to mail(). "Your agent ", 'To' => $recipient, 'Subject' => $subject ); $smtp = Mail::factory( 'smtp', array ('host' => $host, 'auth' => true, 'port' => $port, 'username' => $username, 'password' => $password) ); $smtp->send($recipient, $headers, $body); } ?>
