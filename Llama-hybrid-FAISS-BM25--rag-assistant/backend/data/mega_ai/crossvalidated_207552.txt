Understanding default Bayesian posterior probability shape parameters in multi-armed bandit

Multi-Armed Bandit indicates a best "arm" based on a simple test of proportions and Bayesian posterior probability shape parameters, alpha and beta (some implementations may take a different approach, but I want to understand this one). A simple example could be 3 slot machines I've played thousands of times, with the following results: Machine A: 441 successes; 73,737 arm pulls Machine B: 285 successes; 88,398 arm pulls Machine C: 1,068 successes; 205,234 arm pulls Machine A clearly has the highest proportion (0.005981) of successes. Given that I have no other information about the machines, I would expect a Multi-Armed Bandit to recommend that I play Machine A. Surprisingly (to me) the Bandit strongly recommends Machine C (which has an estimated success-to-trial proportion of 0.005204 based on my sample of plays). The Bayesian posterior probabilities that each arm is the best binomial bandit are: Machine A: 1.799 E-15 Machine B: 2.378 E-15 Machine C: 2.675133 E-12 This surprises me. These results are computed with shape parameters alpha and beta both = 1. Based on these notes , I would've thought that with the shape parameters set to unity that the Bandit results would be the same as the proportions (successes divided by trials)? For those unfamiliar with Bayesian posterior probabilities or Multi-Arm Bandits , I have provided links to both topics.
