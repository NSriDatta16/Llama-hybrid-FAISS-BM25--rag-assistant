How do I get SAS encoding option programmatically?

How do I find out the SAS global encoding option programmatically? I can run proc options , and it will give me the answer, but I need to do it from code. I am hoping for an answer on the lines of "look at the macro symbol &sysencoding", but this might be too much to hope for. I would prefer to avoid fragile things like writing to an external file and re-parsing.
