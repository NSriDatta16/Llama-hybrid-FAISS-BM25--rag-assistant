You can add files to an XCode project either by drag & drop, or by the Project/Add to project... command (2 ways of accomplishing the same thing). The problem appears to be that you have added the "GameEngine.xcodeproj" project file into your "Test" project, but you have not included the files (such as sjeng.h) that actually comprise the "GameEngine" project. That's not going to work. There are two separate ways you could approach this: 1) add all the .c and .h files from "GameEngine" to "Test", and just compile them as part of the iPhone application directly. This is sometimes the most straightforward way, but it's not exactly best practice in terms of modularity and code reuse. 2) make the "GameEngine" project build a Framework (perhaps it's already set up to build as a framework), then add that Framework to your "Test" project. Obviously, you'll need to build the "GameEngine" Framework using the iPhone SDK with appropriate settings (simulator vs. device) to match how you're building the rest of the application. In this case you would have a 2-step build process: first open the "GameEngine" project and build the Framework, then open your "Test" project and build it.
