Well, the proper design is to create an addRow(...) method that receives a row of data and updates the internal storage of your TableModel. This method should then invoke the fileTableRowsInserted() method. Your getValueAt() method also makes no sense. According to your model you have 5 columns of data, yet you never check the column variable to return the proper column object. Take a look at the source code of the DefaultTableModel to see how an insertRow() and getValueAt() method might be coded.
