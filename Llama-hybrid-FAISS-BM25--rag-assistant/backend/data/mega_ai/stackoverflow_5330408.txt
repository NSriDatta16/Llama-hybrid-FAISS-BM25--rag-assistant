The C++ standard does not define the term "anonymous object", but it stands to reason that one might sanely use the term to describe any object that has no name: Temporaries: f(T()); Unnamed function parameters: void func(int, int, int); What I wouldn't count is dynamically-allocated objects: Technically speaking, an "object" is any region of storage [1.8/1 in 2003], which would include the X bytes making up the integer dynamically-allocated by new int; . In int* ptr = new int; the pointer (itself an object too, don't forget!) has the name ptr and the integer itself has no name other than *ptr . Still, I'd hesitate to call this an anonymous object. Again, though, there's no standard terminology.
