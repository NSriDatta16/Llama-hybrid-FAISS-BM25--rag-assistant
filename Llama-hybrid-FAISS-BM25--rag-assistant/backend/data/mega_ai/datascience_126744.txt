What if you consider a multi-modal approach? From the context I assume you have images and some tabular data, then what if you use an autoencoder to extract information from the images, and then use the tabular dataset in conjunction with the extracted data, So you end up with say, Image -> CNN -> vector representation of image, (vector representation of image, tabular data) -> regression. I don't know if this would work, but it would be my initial instinct to try.
