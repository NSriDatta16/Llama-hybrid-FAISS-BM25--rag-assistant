Translating a multiclass problem into a set of binary ones (using 1-vs-all or 1-vs-1) is typically done when you want to use algorithms that don't actually have a multiclass formulation, such as SVM. If you do not plan to change the classification algorithm, you will probably end up with similar results after transforming your problem. Note that changing algorithm will not necessarily improve your performance.
