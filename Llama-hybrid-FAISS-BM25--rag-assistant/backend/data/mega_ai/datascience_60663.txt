Predict items customers would buy in next order

I am working on a time series classification problem to identify what items customers would buy in their next order (customers orders different products every week). Let's say we have a customer who orders every week but different items. Overall, this customer ordered 1k items in the past, and my task would be to identify approximately 80-120 unique items (number of items customer order each week was between 80-120) from these 1k items. Right now, I am using the xgboost classifier, and my precision is close to 70%, and recall is 65%. I understand xgboost cannot handle seasonality by default. So I created additional features like a week of the month, week of the year, season (Spring/summer/winter/fall), etc. I wanted to know if anyone in this community worked on a similar kind of problem. I have seen lot of peoples posting same kind of problem but not sure whether they ended up being helped/ moving it to production.
