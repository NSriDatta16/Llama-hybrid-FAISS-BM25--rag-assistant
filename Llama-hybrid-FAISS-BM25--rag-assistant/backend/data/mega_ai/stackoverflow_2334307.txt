It depends on your project and how your team is organised. I've been involved in the internationalization of a website, and it was one developer full-time for a year, probably about 6-8 months part-time for me to handle installation impacts when needed (reorganising files, etc), and other developers getting involved from time to time when their projects needed heavy refactoring. This was in an application that was at v3. So that's definitely expensive. What you have to ask is how expensive is it to provide a localization system from the start, and how will that impact the project in the early stages. Your project at v1 may not be able to survive delays and setbacks caused by issues with a hastily-designed internationalization framework, while a stable v3 project with a wide customer base may have the capital to invest in doing that properly. It also depends on whether you want to internationalize everything including log messages, or just the UI strings, and how many of those UI strings there are, and who you have available to do localization and the QA that goes with it, and even what languages you want to support - for example, does your system need to support unicode strings (which is a requirement for Asian languages).
