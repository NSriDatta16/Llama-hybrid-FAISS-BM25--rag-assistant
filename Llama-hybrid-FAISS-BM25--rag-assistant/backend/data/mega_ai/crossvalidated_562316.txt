In Holt-Winters exponential smoothing for additive model, the time series $y_t$ is forecast as $$ F_{t+k} = l_t + h T_t + s_{t - p + 1 + (h-1) \text{mod} p} ,$$ where $l_t$ is the level of the time series at time $t$ , $T_t$ is the trend and $s$ represents the seasonal component. $T_{t-1}$ is the trend at time $t-1$ . Defining the seasonal term in terms of $y_t$ and the level $l_t$ works because of an iterative definition, where $l_t$ itself is defined in terms of $y_t$ and past seasonal component. Subtracting the seasonal component from $y_t$ in the level update equation works again because of the iterative definitions. The equations in the link in the answer contains mistakes. Please see the correct equations in other places, e.g., in the R manual for the function .
