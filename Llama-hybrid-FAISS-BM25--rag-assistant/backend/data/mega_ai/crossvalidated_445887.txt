What statistics can I apply to explain how much socio demographics influence revenue?

I'm looking to explain the revenue made by a coffee shop based on socio demographic data like gender , population , education and stores nearby . I've seen that by applying a logistic regression to revenue using those as explanatory variables could work but I don't finalize to understand how it is that I can give out number and compare each one of those variables to say which generates more revenue, could I apply a logistic regression to explain how much influence each one of variables selected have? And how? Also seen that Random Forest might be useful for it but I don't finish to get what it is and how can I apply it in this context?
