In my opinion, it's important to be pragmatic when it comes to testing. Prioritize your testing efforts on the things that are most likely to fail, and/or the things that it is most important that do not fail (i.e. take probability and consequence into consideration). Think, instead of blindly following one metric such as code coverage. Stop when you are comfortable with the test suite and your code. Go back and add more tests when (if?) things start failing.
