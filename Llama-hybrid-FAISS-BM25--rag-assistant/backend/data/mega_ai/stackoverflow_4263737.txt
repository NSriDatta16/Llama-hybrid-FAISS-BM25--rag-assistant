Flex vs. JQuery for Drag-n-Drop Interface

I'm developing an application that will randomize a list of words, and display them to the user. The user will then be able to drag the box containing each word over a Cartesian plane, and drop it anywhere they like. They will also be able to link various words together on the same plane. Once a user has completed these tasks, I want to update a database with that user's data - the coordinates of each word, as well as any parent words that may exist for each word. I started developing the application in Flex, but I'm running into problems integrating the data manipulation. It might just be me, but I find the way Flex is structured to be very counter-intuitive. I'm playing around with shifting the project over to perhaps a JQuery build. I'm proficient in neither JQuery nor Flex, however, and I'm not sure which one will be easier to pick up and develop a working prototype with. Any thoughts?
