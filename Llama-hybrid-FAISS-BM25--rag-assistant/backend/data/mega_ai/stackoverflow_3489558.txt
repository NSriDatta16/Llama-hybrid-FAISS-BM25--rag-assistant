Order-issuing neural network?

I'm interested in writing certain software that uses machine learning, and performs certain actions based on external data. However I've run into problem (that was always interesting to me) - how is it possible to write machine learning software that issues orders or sequences of orders ? The problem is that as I understand it, neural network gets bunch on inputs, and "recalls" output based on results of previous trainings. Instantly (well, more or less). So I'm not sure how "issuing orders" could fit into that system, especially when actions performed by system affect the system with certain delay. I'm also a bit unsure how is it possible to train this thing. Examples of such system: 1. First person shooter enemy controller. As I understand it, it is possible to implement neural network controller for the bot that will switch bot behavior strategies(well, assign priorities to them) based on some inputs (probably something like health, ammo, etc). But I don't see a way to make higher-order controller, that could issue sequence of commands like "go there, then turn left". Also, bot's actions will affect variables that control bot's behavior. I.e. shooting reduces ammo, falling from heights reduces health, etc. 2. Automated market trader. It is certainly possible to make system that will try to predict the next market price of something. However, I don't see how is it possible to make system that would issue order to buy something, watch the trend, then sell it back to gain profit/cover up losses. 3. Car driver. Again, (as I understand it) it is possible to make system that will maintain desired movement vector based on position/velocity/torque data and results of previous training. However I don't see a way to make such system (learn to) perform sequence of actions. I.e. as I understood it, neural net is technically a matrix - you give it input, it produces output. But what about generating sequences of actions that could change environment program operates in? If such tasks are not entirely suitable for neural networks, what else could be used? P.S. I understand that the question isn't exactly clear, and I suspect that I'm missing some knowledge. So I'll appreciate some pointers (i.e. books/resources to read, etc).
