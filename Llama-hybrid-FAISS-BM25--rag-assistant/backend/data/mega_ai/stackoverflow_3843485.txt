You may want to do a join (note that there is actually a join LINQ method you could use, but I'm not using it here): using (var dataContext = new DataContext(connString)) { questionsTable= from q in dataContext.GetTable () from a in dataContext.GetTable () from qa in dataContext.GetTable () where qa.QuestionID == q.QuestionID && qa.AnswerID == a.AnswerID select new { Question = q, Answer = a}; } Another option would be to add association (navigation) properties so that you can get to the info you want right off of your Questions object: [Association(Storage="QuestionsAndAnswers", OtherKey="QuestionID")] public QuestionsAndAnswers QuestionsAndAnswers ... Then you can simply fetch Questions and do myQuestion.QuestionsAndAnswers[0].Answer.IsCorrect
