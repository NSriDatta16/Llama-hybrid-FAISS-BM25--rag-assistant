Web Service method in AXIS2 receives null arguments. Why?

I am new to java web services. While trying out a basic web service operation, I got stuck. I have been following this article as a reference. The service class is pretty simple and looks like this: public class MyService { public MyService() { } public Boolean Configure(String param, String val){ System.out.println("First arg: " + param + " Second arg:" + val); //Added by me. return true; } public Boolean StartMe(){ return true; } public Boolean StopMe(){ return true; } public String getStatus(){ return "No status available!"; } } I have created the service using Eclipse (Bottom up Java bean Web Service) as mentioned on that article. To test my service I used Eclipse Web Service Explorer . Now here comes the issue. When I set param values in the service explorer and hit go I see null values getting printed in the console ( First arg: null Second arg:null ). I have tried to solve this for many hours but still no luck. But there is no problem with other three methods. They are giving responses and I can see it in the service explorer. The WSDL that have been generated is this: Please Type your service description here I'm using : a) Eclipse: Ganymede/Galileo b) Tomcat 6.0 c) AXIS2 1.4.1 Please help me out or let me know whether I'm missing some basic fundamentals. Any help is much appreciated.
