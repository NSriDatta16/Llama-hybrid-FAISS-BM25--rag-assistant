Another option you have, and I have actually seen this done before in a vBulletin installation, is to store a comma separated list of viewed topic ids client-side in a cookie. Server-side, the only thing stored was the time of the user's previous visit. The forum system used this in conjunction with the information in the user's cookie to show 'as read' for any topic where either Last modified date (ie last post) older than the user's previous visit Topic ID found in the user's cookie as a topic the user has visited this session. I'm not saying it's a good idea , but I thought I'd mention it as an alternative - the obvious way to do it has already been stated in other answers, ie store it server-side as a relation table (many to many table). I guess it does have the advantage of putting less burden on the server of keeping that information. The downsides are that it ties it to the session, so once a new session is started everything that occurred before the last session is considered 'already read'. Another downside is that a cookie can only hold so much information, and a user may view hundreds of topics in a session, so it approaches the storage limit of the cookie.
