AIR's applicationStorageDirectory will automatically target these locations depending on which OS the application is running: Windows 7 / Vista: c:\users\USERNAME\appdata\roaming\APPLICATIONNAME Windows XP: c:\Documents and Settings\USERNAME\Application Data\APPLICATIONNAME Mac OS X: /Users/USERNAME/Library/Preferences/APPLICATIONNAME Linux (Ubuntu): /Users/USERNAME/.appdata/ along with desktopDirectory, documentsDirectory, applicationDirectory (read-only), which, too, have their own specific locations, these are built-in conveniences that allow AIR developers to produce cross-platform applications without having to know about (or specifically code for) the file system of a target OS.
