A Bayesian approach would work well for this. $$P(\theta|x,N)=\frac{P(x,N|\theta)P(\theta)}{P(x,N)}$$ In this case, $\theta$ is your proportion parameter, $x=4$ is the number of purple irises sampled, and $n=3456$ is the total number of samples (based on your comment that the sample size of 3840 included the first 348 samples). Your prior probability would be a Beta distribution: $P(\theta) = B(\theta|1,385)$; the parameters are the previously sampled number from each category + 1 (to codify the assumption that there is some chance of getting either type in a sample). Using a Bernoulli likelihood,you can analytically calculate the posterior distribution of theta: $B(\theta|5,3837)$. This gives you a mean estimate of $\theta= 0.13$ and 95% credible intervals of $\{0.04\%, 0.27\%\}$. Given that these are credible intervals and not confidence intervals, you could interpret this as 95% chance that 0.4 to 2.6 out of every 1000 items in the population will have "purple iris." If you are strictly interested in the lower tail of the distribution, you could also calculate that there is a 95% chance that less 2.3 out of every 1000 items have "purple iris."
