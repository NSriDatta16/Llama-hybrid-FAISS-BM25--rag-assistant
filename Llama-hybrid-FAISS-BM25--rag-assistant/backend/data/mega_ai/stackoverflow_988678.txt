The ultimate issue here is that he thinks that putting const after int is so unspeakably ugly, and so harmful to readability that it should be banned in the style guide Really? Show me a programmer who gets bogged down when he sees: int foo() { } vs int foo() { } ...and I'll show you a programmer who doesn't pay close enough attention to detail. No professional programmer worth his salt will have a problem with superficial differences in style. EDIT: It is true that const int* and int* const don't mean exactly the same thing, but that wasn't the point. The point made by OP's coworker was that differences in style make code difficult to understand & maintain. It is this claim I disagree with.
