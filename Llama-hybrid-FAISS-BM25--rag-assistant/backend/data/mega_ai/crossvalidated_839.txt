Though it is not generally labeled as Bayesian search theory, such methods are pretty widely used in oil exploration. There are, however, important differences in the standard examples that drive different features of their respective modeling problems. In the case of lost vessel exploration (in Bayesian search theory), we are looking for a specific point on the sea floor (one elevation), with a distributions modeling the likelihood of its resting location, and another distribution modeling the likelihood of finding the boat were it at that depth. These distributions are then guide search, and are continuously updated through the results of the guided search. Though similar, oil exploration is fraught with complicating features (multiple sampling depths, high sampling costs, variable yields, multiple geological indicators, drilling cost, etc.) that necessitate methods that go beyond what is considered in the prior example. See Learning through Oil and Gas Exploration for an overview of these complicating factors and a way to model them. So, yes, it may be said that the oil exploration problem is different in magnitude, but not kind from lost vessel exploration, and thus similar methods may be fruitfully applied. Finally, a quick literature search reveals many different modeling approaches, which is not too surprising, given the complicated nature of the problem.
