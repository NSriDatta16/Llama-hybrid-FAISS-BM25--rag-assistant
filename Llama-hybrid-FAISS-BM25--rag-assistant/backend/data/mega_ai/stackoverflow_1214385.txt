How to determine how long IIS takes to deliver a web page?

We use IIS servers and would like to know if there is a performance counter or something else which could help us determine how long it's taking to serve web pages (average, actual, whatever)? From the time the page is requested, to the time it has been sent out, how long was it? Is there anything in IIS which can give me this information?
