Why does ridge regression classifier work quite well for text classification?

During an experiment for text classification, I found ridge classifier generating results that constantly top the tests among those classifiers that are more commonly mentioned and applied for text mining tasks, such as SVM, NB, kNN, etc. Though, I haven't elaborated on optimizing each classifier on this specific text classification task except some simple tweaks about parameters. Such result was also mentioned Dikran Marsupial . Not coming from statistics background, after read through some materials online, I still cannot figure out the main reasons for this. Could anyone provide some insights on such outcome?
