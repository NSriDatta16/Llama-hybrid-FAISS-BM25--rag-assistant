When you have a real population as compared to a sample you do not need statistical test (some argue in fact you should not do them). Statistical test are designed to determine commonly if something in a sample is true of the unknown population. If you know the population as you do, then why do a statistical test? The decision if they matter (if there is a real process change) is a substantive decision not a statistical one. People confuse statistical significance with substantive significance in this manner. Having said that I know industrial engineers would likely disagree.:) They use statistical methods to determine if the process has changed (or to suggest that it has changed at least) and that is one approach you could try - if you disagree with my comments. You could look at the six sigma literature. But I am guessing you won't have enough data for that. Another option is segmented regression with a dummy variable that is set to 1 where you think the change occurred. Or simply use interrupted time series. A chow test is yet another option as mentioned.
