Interpretation of priors in example

Suppose you have 3 variances $W_{1},W_{2},W_{3}$ that can be expressed as $W_{j}=q_{j}V$ with $j = 1,2,3$. According to one model, $W_{3}$ should be pronounced and $W_{1}$, $W_{2}$ should be small to avoid large fluctuations. Furthermore, we assume that $V$ has a prior $\text{Ga}(1, 0.001)$ on $1/V$ to make it diffuse. Apparently, priors $q_{3} \sim \text{Ga}(1, 0.001)$ and $q_{1},q_{2} \sim \text{E}(10)$ are good choices although I don't understand why. That is basically my question. I think the distribution for $V$ refers to the inverse gamma distribution. Probably I'm wrong but this corresponds to a distribution $\text{Inv-Gamma}(1, 1/0.001)$. I believe this is the correct change of parameters because the transformation $g(V) = 1/V$ leads to the same shape parameters and the inverse scale parameter (derivation here .) However, this gives an indeterminate mean and standard deviation. That is one problem. The second problem is that $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ have means and standard deviations equal to $0.1$ (assuming that $\text{E}(10)$ refers to a exponential distribution). However, according to previous knowledge of the model, $q_{1}$ and $q_{2}$ are supposed to be smaller than $q_{3}$, but since $q_{3}$ has mean $0.001$ and standard deviation $0.001$, the chosen priors have means that contradict that proposition. After calculating posterior distributions, $q_{1}, q_{2}$ are indeed smaller than $q_{3}$. So I was wondering whether my interpretation of the priors is incorrect or the priors were good enough to obtain acceptable posterior distributions. By the way, this is a part of a small analysis described in Congdon's book Applied-Bayesian-Hierarchical-Methods
