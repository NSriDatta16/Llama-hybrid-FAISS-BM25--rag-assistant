I recommend Rob Hyndman's 1996 article "Computing and Graphing Highest Density Regions" in The American Statistician . Here is the definition of the HDR, taken from that article: Let $f(x)$ be the density function of a random variable $X$ . Then the $100(1-\alpha)\%$ HDR is the subset $R(f_\alpha)$ of the sample space of $X$ such that $$R(f_\alpha) = \{x\colon f(x)\geq f_\alpha\},$$ where $f_\alpha$ is the largest constant such that $$P\big(X\in R(f_\alpha)\big)\geq 1-\alpha.$$ Figure 1 from that article illustrates the difference between the 75% HDR (so $\alpha=0.25$ ) and various other 75% Probability Regions for a mixture of two normals ( $c_q$ is the $q$ -th quantile, $\mu$ the mean and $\sigma$ the standard deviation of the density): The idea in one dimension is to take a horizontal line and shift it up (to $y=f_\alpha$ ) until the area between the $x$ axis and the part of the density where $f(x)\geq f_\alpha$ is $1-\alpha$ . ( Thanks to bobverity for pointing out my error here - now corrected.) Then the HDR $R_\alpha$ is the projection to the $x$ axis of this area. Of course, all this works with any density, whether Bayesian posterior or other. Here is a link to R code, which is the hdrcde package (and to the article on JSTOR).
