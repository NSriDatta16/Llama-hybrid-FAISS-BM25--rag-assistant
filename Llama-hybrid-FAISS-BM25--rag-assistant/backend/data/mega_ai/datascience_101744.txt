Sequence prediction is not the only objective in RNNs and LSTMs. For instance, we have sequence classification, where the input to the RNN/LSTM is the sequence, and the output is its label; a concrete example of that is sentiment analysis, where the input is a sentence, and the output is whether the answer is positive, negative or neutral. You can see specific models and benchmark datasets at paperswithcode . Another objective is sequence tagging where, for each timestep, we output a label; an example is part-of-speech (POS) tagging, where the input is a textual sequence and the output is the POS tag each of the words in the text has.
