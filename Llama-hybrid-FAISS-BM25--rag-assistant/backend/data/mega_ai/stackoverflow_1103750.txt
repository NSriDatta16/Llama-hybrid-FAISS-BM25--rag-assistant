Embed FontDialog in another WinForms Dialog

I would like to embed the FontDialog control into a settings dialog box for my C# WinForms application, but if I drag the control over it, of course, just adds it to the list of Dialog controls at the bottom of the designer. But instead of opening a separate dialog, I would like it to just be part of the settings dialog I already have...so I don't have to recreate the whole thing. Is there anyway to do this, or is there another Font control I can use?
