It shouldn't have any impact, IMHO. I'm not an expert, but my thinking is as follows: Scissor test saves on your GPU's fill rate (the amount of fragments/pixels a hardware can put in the framebuffer per second), if you put a glScissor around each object, the test won't actually cut off anything - the same number of pixels will be rendered, so no fill rate will be saved. If you want to have your rendering optimized, a good place to start is to make sure you're doing optimal batching and reduce the number of draw calls or complex state switches (texture switches). Of course the correct approach to optimizations is to try to diagnose why is your rendering slow, so the above is just my guess which may or may not help in your particular situation.
