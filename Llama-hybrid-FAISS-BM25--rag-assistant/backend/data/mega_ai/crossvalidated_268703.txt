The situation you describe where $p(x|\theta)$ cannot be computed but simulations from $p(\cdot|\theta)$ can be produced is call a generative model . It leads to likelihood-free resolutions like ABC ( Approximate Bayesian computation ), which is indeed properly introduced in the Wikipedia page: Approximate Bayesian computation ; synthetic likelihood, as in Wood (2010) , where the unknown model $p(\cdot|\theta)$ is approximated by a Normal $\text{N}(\mu(\theta),\sigma(\theta)^2)$, where $\mu(\theta),\sigma(\theta)$ are estimated by simulation; Bayesian solutions derived from indirect inference, as in Drovandi et al. (2015)
