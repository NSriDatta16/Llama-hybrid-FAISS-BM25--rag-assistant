Quick thoughts: Let's pretend—instead of scenario-building or making jokes—each of their plot lines are actual predictions. They make a lot of predictions, so their Type I error is very high, but their Type II error is also very low. If every creative choice is making a prediction AND they have been around for decades, then their show is similar to a medical test that almost always says you have whatever disease you are testing for: You will almost never miss a positive case, but you will be telling a lot of people that they have a disease which they do not have. People probably only consider a subset of scenarios ("predictions") that are feasible. If the Simpsons were visited by aliens, nobody would consider this a prediction—because we know the odds of it happening are very low. So the universe of predictions we are considering is highly correlated with the prior probability that they will come true—this is stacking the deck in favor of the Simpsons. The writers of the Simpsons are smart people that also live in the same society in which they are making their "predictions." They are trying to be funny, so what they do, in a Bayesian sense, is construct funny situations that are not assuredly going to happen (these are boring predictions) and are not never going to happen (these are absurd predictions). So again we see the prior probability of these things happening stacking the deck toward the Simpsons being correct: If they write about things with a solid-ish probability of happening (like Canada legalizing weed), then we shouldn't be too surprised when their predictions are correct. There is no time limit on their predictions. This gives us an unlimited amount of "trials" (let's say the unit of analysis is days or elections or news cycles or celebrity careers, etc.), and all we ever need to do is hit truth once and the Simpsons are "correct." When you consider all of these together, we can see that making a ton of predictions over an unlimited number of trials where you only have to hit once to be "correct," and people define "success" by ignoring Type I errors and shaping the universe of possible as things with only some probability of occurring, and the creators themselves generally make predictions in areas that have some prior probability of occurring—we can get to the conclusion that the Simpsons can "predict the future."
