Note that, linear regression is a "data driven" approach (in stead of "knowledge driven"). This means the data will tell you which variable is important, and how much are they important (in terms of p-value etc.). To best of my knowledge, we do not have a good way to tell model which one should be used or not, other than excluding that variable in the model. I am not very familiar with Bayesian approach, but I think One way of doing it is set the prior of $\beta$ for the knowledge driven variable importance?
