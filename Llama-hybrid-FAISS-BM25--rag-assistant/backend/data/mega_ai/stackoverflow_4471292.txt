Using custom xml elements with JQuery

Given the following: This is a Test Fund . More text. How do I extract the text ("Test Fund") from the fund element? I have tried the following: $('fund').each(function(index) { alert($(this).text()); }); I can retrieve the id attribute as follows: alert($(this).attr("id")); I have had no luck with text() html() etc. EDIT: Initially I had only tried IE8, But after test in firefox I discover it works with FF just fine. I then reviewed in IE dev tools and noticed that the Dom explorer was treating the opening tag as a stand-alone node, as well as doing this to the remaining text, and closing tag. I found some info on using a custom namespace as follows: Test $(document).ready(function(){ // Your code here $('myns:fund').each(function(index) { alert(index + ': ' + $(this).attr("id")); }); }); Sample paragraph. This is a Test Fund . More text. This fails also but renders correctly in the IE DOM explorer.
