How does network structure (model complexity) affects covergence speed?

I trained Bi-GRU and HAN (Hierarchical Attention Networks) on my own datasets, and found HAN converges faster than Bi-GRU, within less number of epochs. What would be the reason for this? I guess that this is related to the fact that HAN has more weights (thus more complex) than Bi-GRU. Does complex models converge faster, or slower, than relatively simpler models? Any opinion? Many thanks!
