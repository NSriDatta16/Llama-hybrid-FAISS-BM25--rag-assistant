If you create a class extending UIView, then you can make the File's Owner for your xib implement the extended class. From that point simply add an instance variable to your extended class for the square. The last step in the process is to add methods to your class to bind to each of the controls to actions. - (IBAction) pinSelected: (id)sender; Once you create these methods (be sure to make them return IBAction, it is actually an alias for void but acts as a hint to INterface Builder) then you can bind your controls to the method through File's Owner (using control + drag to establish the link). Good Luck!
