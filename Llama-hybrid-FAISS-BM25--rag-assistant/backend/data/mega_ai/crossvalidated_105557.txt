Stochastic Programming with MCMC

While there are far superior methods for solving deterministic LP problems (e.g. interior point algorithms), can MCMC be used to solve their stochastic variants? By stochastic, I mean, for example, with distributions on coefficients and or constraints, and getting a posterior probability on the solution representing: Uncertainty in the solution given the uncertainty in the coefficients/constraints Uncertainty in the solution considering that MCMC gives you an estimate For example: \begin{equation*} \begin{array}{rrl} \mathbf{x}^* = \underset{\mathbf{x}}{\text{arg}\;\text{min}} & \mathbb{E}\,(c_1x_1 -3x_2)\\ \mbox{s.t.} & -x_1 +x_2 & \le b_1 \\ & x_1, x_2 & \geq 0 \end{array} \end{equation*} and where: $c_1 \sim N(2,0.5)$ $b_1 \sim N(0,3)$ I am inclined to believe that we could use MRF potentials to represent the constraints and objective function, but not sure how to formulate a sampling problem that would help approximate a solution to the Eq. above.
