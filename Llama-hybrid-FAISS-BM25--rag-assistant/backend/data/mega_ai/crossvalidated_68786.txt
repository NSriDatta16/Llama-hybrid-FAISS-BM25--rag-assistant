Mixed effect logistic regression: defining random effect for repeated measure design with replications

I measured a binary response for each subject in 5 different conditions. For each subject and condition, I replicated the experiment 36 times. I thus have 36 binary values per condition per subject. I am trying to build a model for those data. I suppose a logistic regression is what I'm looking for, and I am working with the lmer package. My aim is to check whether the conditions significantly influence the observed values, so I would have two models: lmH1 and lmH0 By looking at the output from anova(lmH0, lmH1) , I would be able to determine the significance of the effect of my condition. I am just not sure what to specify as random effect; the models I defined so far are: lmH1 and lmH2 However I am not sure about how lmer handles the replicates, so I don't know whether I should include those replicates in my random effects or not. I could modify the proposed models so that the grouping defined by the random effects refers to a specific binary values instead of a group of binaries values. My new models would then be lmH1a and lmH2a With those models R returns the warning message Number of levels of a grouping factor for the random effects is equal to n, the number of observations . But the model is still computed. All 4 models return very similar values for the fixed effects and for the random effects that they have in common (e.g. the subject random effects are very similar for all 4 models and the condition within subject random effects are very similar for lmH2 and lmH2a ). How can I check which random effect structure is the most appropriate for my design and collected data?
