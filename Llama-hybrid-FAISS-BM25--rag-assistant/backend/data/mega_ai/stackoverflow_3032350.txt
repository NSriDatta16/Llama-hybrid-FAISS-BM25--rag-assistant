You will be breaching several license terms by doing that, not only Apple's but also YouTube's: Excerpt from YouTube license terms, paragraph 5: Your Use of Content on the Site In addition to the general restrictions above, the following restrictions and conditions apply specifically to your use of content on the YouTube Website. ... B: You may access User Submissions for your information and personal use solely as intended through the provided functionality of the YouTube Website. You shall not copy or download any User Submission unless you see a “download” or similar link displayed by YouTube on the YouTube Website for that User Submission. ... E: You agree to not engage in the use, copying, or distribution of any of the Content other than expressly permitted herein, including any use, copying, or distribution of User Submissions of third parties obtained through the Website for any commercial purposes. There are probably other terms from YouTube that prevents you from distributing these movies though you own application. But just one of those caluses prevents you from distributin it though AppStore as detailed in Apple's terms: 5.1 You represent and warrant that: (a) You have the right to enter into this Agreement, to reproduce and distribute each of the Licensed Applications, and to authorize Apple to permit end-users to download and use each of the Licensed Applications through one or more App Stores; (b) none of the Licensed Applications, or Apple’s or end-users’ permitted uses of those Licensed Applications, violate or infringe any patent, copyright, trademark, trade secret or other intellectual property or contractual rights of any other person, firm, corporation or other entity; ... So the answer in short is no.
