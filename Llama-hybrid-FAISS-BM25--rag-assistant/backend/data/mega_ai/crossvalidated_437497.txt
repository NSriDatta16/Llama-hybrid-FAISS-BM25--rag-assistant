Difference between MA and AR

I fail to see the difference between Moving Average (MA): $x_t=\epsilon_t+β_1\epsilon_{t−1}+…+β_q\epsilon_{t−q}$ Autoregressive (AR): $x_t=\epsilon_t+β_1x_{t−1}+…+β_qx_{t−q}$ $x_t$ is the observed value and $\epsilon$ is the residual. But since both assume a stationary time series with $\mu = 0$ , isn't the residual and the observed value identical? I.e., $\epsilon_i = x_i - \mu = x_i$ ? This would imply that MA and AR are identical, but I can see everyone using these expressions to explain that they differ, so what am I missing here?
