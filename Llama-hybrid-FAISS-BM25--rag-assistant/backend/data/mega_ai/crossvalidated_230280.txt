Per Cliff AB 's comment to the OP, it sounds like they are heading towards an Empirical Bayesian philosophy. There are three main Bayesian schools of thought, and Empirical Bayes estimates priors from data, often with frequentist methods. That doesn't conform exactly to the quote (which implies Bayes up front, frequentist-like concerns afterwards), but we shouldn't overlook Cliff AB 's excellent comment. Also, there was, and may still be, a school of Bayesian thought that you don't have to check anything after a Bayesian procedure. More modern thought would use posterior predictive checks, and perhaps that kind of double-check-your-answers approach is what the quote is referring to. Also, frequentist philosophy is concerned with procedures rather than inferences from data. So perhaps that is also a clue to the quote's meaning.
