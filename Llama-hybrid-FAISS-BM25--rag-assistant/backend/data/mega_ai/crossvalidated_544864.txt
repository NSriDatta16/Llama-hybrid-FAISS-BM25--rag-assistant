Interpretation of logistic regression - interaction between predictors

Context : Workbook question for my high-school statistics subject An experiment was conducted where 30 parasitic worms of each sex were poisoned at each of five dosages, and the number of deaths were counted. This is the data that I read into R: dosage My task is to fit a logistic regression model, with the proportion of dead parasitic worms as the dependent variable and dosage as a predictor, allowing for a different response to the poison for both sexes, and make the model have no explicit intercept term. I originally had this in R as: summary(glm(deaths/30 ~ 0 + dosage + sex,family=binomial, weights=rep(30,10))) And here is the output: Call: glm(formula = deaths/30 ~ 0 + dosage + sex, family = binomial, weights = rep(30, 10)) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.43171 -0.38413 -0.01169 0.47773 0.98391 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) dosage 1.0543 0.1265 8.332 However, when answering the sub-questions about p-values in the R output, one was asking about the interaction term between sex and dosage, which I'm not sure my model has since the coefficients are dosage, sexfemale and sexmale. Did I interpret the question wrong (perhaps I should have * instead of + in my glm() function...), or am I not noticing something in my R output?
