How much control do you have over the input? Can you guarantee that author and title will always be separated by " - " (a space, a dash, and a space)? Do you know for sure that the author won't contain " - " ? And so on. If the input is quite rigid, then you can simply use String#split() , which should make it very clear what you're doing. Don't use a StringTokenizer ( source ): StringTokenizer is a legacy class that is retained for compatibility reasons although its use is discouraged in new code. It is recommended that anyone seeking this functionality use the split method of String or the java.util.regex package instead. Mark Byers' answer shows you how to use split() . However, if you have to worry about more variation in the input (e.g., can the whitespace amount of whitespace around the dash be variable or not exist at all?) then using a regex will be terse and concise. The tradeoff then is code readability and clarity of intent.
