Just ran into this myself and managed to figure it out. By using a getDefaultEntities function, we end up overriding the increment_model attribute for sales_order in the eav_entity_type table. Seems to over-write the increment_model and increment_per_store fields. Glad to see you got it figured out using the above. I'll be using that myself :-) BTW, will be submitting this to Magento's bug tracker.
