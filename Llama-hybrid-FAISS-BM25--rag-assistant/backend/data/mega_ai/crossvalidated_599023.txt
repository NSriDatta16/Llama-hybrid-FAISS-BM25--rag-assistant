Is there a way to measure uniformness of points in a 2D square?

Questions : Say I have 1000 points, that are distributed in a $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ square. It is not uniformly distributed. For example I might have "clusters" of points within the square, and conversely, there may be some empty patches of space within the square. I want to get a measure of uniformness in the distribution of the points. But, I don't think it can be the $\chi^2$ test for a uniform distribution for what I want to do. The measure should be continuous with respect to the point locations. Context: I have a dataset of variables, that are closely linked to the interaction positions within a $[0,1]\times[0,1]$ square. I do not know those points a priori, but I do know that when I map those variables to the points in the square, it has to be somewhat uniformly distributed. (It should look as if they were sampled from a 2d uniform distribution.) I want to learn the mapping between the variables and the point locations, so I am trying to setup a neural network model that can learn to map those variables. Loss function will be a measure of uniformness, so that if the learned mapping does not give a uniformly distribution of points, it will be penalized and the model will be corrected (through backpropagation). Now I've been thinking about what could be used for such measure of uniformness. With some Google search, I learned that the $\chi^2$ test can be used to measure the uniformness of points, but I don't think it can be used for the neural network, because the method is based on dividing the square into many small squares, and counting the number of points in each small squares. The problem is, the gradient cannot be calculated, because an infinitismal change in the point locations won't change the $\chi^2$ test results. So there is no gradient and the model cannot be trained. So I need a measure of uniformness, with which I can calculate the gradient w.r.t. point locations. So it has to be a continuous measure. Does anyone know of such a measure? Thank you.
