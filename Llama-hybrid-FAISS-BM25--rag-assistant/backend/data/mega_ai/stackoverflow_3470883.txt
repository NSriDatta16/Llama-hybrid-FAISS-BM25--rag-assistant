Just as an aside, your trivial case can really be simplified to just WHERE date1 <> date2 OR date1 <> date3 OR date1 <> date4 OR date1 <> date5 Using DeMorgan's Law , this is the same as WHERE NOT(date1 = date2 AND date1 = date3 AND date1 = date4 AND date1 = date5) and then by the transitive property of the equality relation , we'd know that if date1 is equal to the other 4 values, then all 5 are equal to each other.
