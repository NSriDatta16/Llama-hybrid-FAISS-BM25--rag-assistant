This method of two separate models to fight overfitting is unknown to me, and I also don't really see how it should succeed. But since you have good results, you should give it a try. Nevertheless, I would have started with a model that contains all parameters (fine and large scale). Then, there are many methods for both selecting the appropriate parameters ( random forest variable importance , ARD (e.g. relevance vector machines ), spike and slab , and many more, e.g. here and here ), and for fighting overfitting (e.g. regularization , Bayesian methods , or appropriate information criteria ) that can be applied to this model.
