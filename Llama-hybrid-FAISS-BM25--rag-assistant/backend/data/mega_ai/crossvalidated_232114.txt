What type of Test should I conduct?

The same participants are exposed to two different screen sizes 27" (stimulus A) and screen size 9.7" (stimulus B). Independent var is "screen" with two levels - sizes. After exposure to stimulus A, they fill two questionnaires to answer dependent variables Y1 and Y2. After that, they are exposed to stimulus B, and asked to fill the same above questionnaires to respond to the same dependent var Y1 and Y2. Y1: Attention Y2: Endurability I want to compare each set of their responses (dependent var) of each stimulus. What kind of ANOVA test should I conduct?
