The linked definition of "Bayesian Average" appears to be essentially heuristic, and it is not entirely clear what you are asking. However one possible interpretation is in the context of MAP estimation of the mean parameter $\mu$ for a Gaussian population. In this context the sample mean $$\bar{x}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_ix_i$$ is a MLE for $\mu$ . To get the linked formula from a MAP framework, you could use a Gaussian prior for $\mu$ such that the MAP estimate becomes $$\mu_\text{MAP}|\vec{x}=\frac{N\bar{x}+N_0\mu_0}{N+N_0}$$ The required prior is then $$\mu\sim\text{N}(\mu_0,\sigma^2/N_0)$$ where $\sigma^2$ is the variance used in the likelihood, i.e. $x\sim\text{N}(\mu,\sigma^2)$. So it is like specifying the "prior sample size" $N_0$ in terms of a "standard error" . (Note however that the formula is really heuristic, but that is OK, and it is reasonable without needing this sort of circuitous and assumption-laden justification!)
