You need to read up on how Java classpaths work and how you should organize your source code. Basically, your problem is that when javac compiler compiles "Class.java", it does not expect to find "Game.class" in the current directory. It (probably) is looking for it in "Impl/Game.class". The IBM " Managing the Java classpath " page provides an in-depth discussion of how to set your classpath and how java utilities (e.g. java and javac ) use it to find class files. The Oracle " Setting the Classpath " page provides more information more succinctly ... but you need to read it carefully. By the way, you've got some style atrocities in your code: Java package names should be in all lower-case. Calling a class Class is a bad idea, because this collides with the class called java.lang.Class which is imported by default.
