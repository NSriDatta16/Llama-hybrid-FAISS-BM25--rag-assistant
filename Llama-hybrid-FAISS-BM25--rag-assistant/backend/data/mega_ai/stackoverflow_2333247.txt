This is not possible, i'm afraid. Here's the C code that handles unlink in php 5.3. ret = VCWD_UNLINK(url); as you can see, errno is not returned and there's no way to access it later. There's already a bugreport about this, but it doesn't seem to draw too much attention. ;) See also this discussion
