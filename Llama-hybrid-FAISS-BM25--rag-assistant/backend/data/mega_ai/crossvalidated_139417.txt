Posterior predictive test quantities

I've been trying to figure out problem 6.2 from Gelman's book, second edition, page 192 on Bayesian data analysis. Can anyone help? a) Set up predictive test quantities to check the following assumptions: independent Poisson no trend over time b) use simulations from the posterior predictive distributions to measure the discrepancies, display graphically and give p-values.
