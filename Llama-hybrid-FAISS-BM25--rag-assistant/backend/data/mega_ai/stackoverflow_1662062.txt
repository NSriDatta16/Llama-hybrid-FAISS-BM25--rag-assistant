You need a convolution filter. To get the coefficients for the filter, you can look at the impulse response. If you take an out-of-focus picture of a bright point of light, you get a nearly perfect circle - if you generate a circle and average every pixel inside of it, you'll get a good approximation to an unfocused image.
