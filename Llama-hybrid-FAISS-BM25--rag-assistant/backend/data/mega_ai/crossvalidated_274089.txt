Finding steady-state probability of a Markov chain

Let $X_{n}$ be a Markov chain on state space $S = \{ 1,2 \dots, 23 \}$ with transition probability given by $p_{i,i+1}= p_{i,i-1} = \frac {1}{2} \ \ \forall \ 2\le i \le 22 , $ $ p_{1,2}= p_{1,23} = \frac {1}{2} $ $ p_{23,1}= p_{23,22} = \frac {1}{2} $ then we need to show that $P(X_n=i) = \frac {1}{23} $. attempt : ( i thought of many results that i know but i could not figure it out ) i tried to solve equations $\pi_1 = \frac {1}{2} \pi_2 + \frac {1}{2} \pi_{23} $ $\pi_2 = \frac {1}{2} \pi_1 + \frac {1}{2} \pi_3 $ .. .. $ \pi_{23} = \frac {1}{2} \pi_1 + \frac {1}{2} \pi_{22} $ but this seems confusing. Please suggest a proper method .
