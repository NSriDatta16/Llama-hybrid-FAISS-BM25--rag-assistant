Algorithms for detecting pattern shifts in time series data?

I am building a model for time series data that contains ~3 distinct patterns: stable at a 35 deg C, small oscillations around 35C, and large oscillations not centered around 35 deg C. Here is a photo: A first modelling attempt involved creating classes based off daily st.dev, and constructing random forest based CART algorithm from there. However, given the time series structure, I dont think this is the best idea for real-time detection. What would be good algorithms to look into? thanks
