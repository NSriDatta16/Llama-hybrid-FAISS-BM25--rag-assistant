UDDI Best Practices

My organisation is getting into the SOA world (a bit late, but that's what it's like here!) and we're looking into the ESB Toolkit 2.0 (we already have BizTalk Server 2009). We're keen on implementing UDDI (specifically, the UDDI Services v3.0 that ships with BTS 2009), but we're low on actual UDDI experience. We want to manage the ever-burgeoning number of web services we have across all our environments. What are the best practices for implementing UDDI? For example:- Would you implement a single highly-available resilient UDDI server that hosts all services and bindings, including test environment versions? Or would you implement separate UDDI repositories for test and production environments? I'm aware of the Oasis Technical Note v2.0 on WSDL and UDDI, but does anyone actually implement that? I.e. the abstract parts of the WSDL as tModels, the implementation parts of the WSDL as bindings? Would you go to the effort of capturing non-web service endpoints in UDDI, or just use it for WSDL? What are the "gotchas"?
