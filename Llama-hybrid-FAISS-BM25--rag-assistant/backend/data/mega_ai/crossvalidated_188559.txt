Econometric perspective I came to this question from here , a possible duplicate. There are several excellent answers already, but as stated in the accepted answer, there are many different (but related) uses of the term, so it might be valuable to give the perspective as employed in econometrics , which does not yet seem fully addressed here. Consider a linear panel data model: $$ y_{it}=X_{it}\delta+\alpha_i+\eta_{it}, $$ the so-called error component model. Here, $\alpha_i$ is what is sometimes called individual-specific heterogeneity, the error component that is constant over time. The other error component $\eta_{it}$ is "idiosyncratic", varying both over units and over time. A reason to use a random effects approach is that the presence of $\alpha_i$ will lead to an error covariance matrix that is not "spherical" (so not a multiple of the identity matrix), so that a GLS-type approach like random effects will be more efficient than OLS). If, however, the $\alpha_i$ correlate with the regressors $X_{it}$ - as will be the case in many typical applications - one of the underlying assumptions for consistency of the standard textbook (at least what is standard in econometric textbooks) random effects estimator, viz. $Cov(\alpha_i,X_{it})=0$ , is violated. Then, a fixed effect approach which effectively fits such intercepts will be more convincing. The following figure aims to illustrate this point. The raw correlation between $y$ and $X$ is positive. But, the observations belonging to one unit (color) exhibit a negative relationship - this is what we would like to identify, because this is the reaction of $y_{it}$ to a change in $X_{it}$ . Also, there is correlation between the $\alpha_i$ and $X_{it}$ : If the former are individual-specific intercepts (i.e., expected values for unit $i$ when $X_{it}=0$ ), we see that the intercept for, e.g., the lightblue panel unit is much smaller than that for the brown unit. At the same time, the lightblue panel unit has much smaller regressor values $X_{it}$ . So, pooled OLS would be the wrong strategy here, because it would result in a positive esimate of $\delta$ , as this estimator basically ignores the colors. RE would also be biased, being a weighted version of FE and the between estimator, which regresses the "time"-averages over $t$ onto each other. The latter however also requires lack of correlation of $\alpha_i$ and $X_{it}$ . This bias however vanishes as $T$ , the number of time periods per unit ( m in the code below), increases, as the weight on FE then tends to one (see e.g. Hsiao, Analysis of Panel Data, Sec. 3.3.2). Here is the code that generates the data and which produces a positive RE estimate and a "correct", negative FE estimate. (That said, the RE estimates will also often be negative for other seeds, see above.) library(Jmisc) library(plm) library(RColorBrewer) # FE illustration set.seed(324) m = 8 n = 12 step = 5 alpha = runif(n,seq(0,step*n,by=step),seq(step,step*n+step,by=step)) beta = -1 y = X = matrix(NA,nrow=m,ncol=n) for (i in 1:n) { X[,i] = runif(m,i,i+1) X[,i] = rnorm(m,i) y[,i] = alpha[i] + X[,i]*beta + rnorm(m,sd=.75) } stackX = as.vector(X) stackY = as.vector(y) darkcols The output: > fe Model Formula: stackY ~ stackX Coefficients: stackX -1.0451 > re Model Formula: stackY ~ stackX Coefficients: (Intercept) stackX 18.34586 0.77031
