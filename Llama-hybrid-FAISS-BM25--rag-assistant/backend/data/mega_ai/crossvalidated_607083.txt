There is special approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. Have a look at the tree-based annoy from spotify or the hash-based faiss from facebook. Maybe I do not fully understand your question, but why don't you compute the scalar product of your embeddings and then sort (like in semantic search applications) to find the closest embeeding? It is also reasonably fast.
