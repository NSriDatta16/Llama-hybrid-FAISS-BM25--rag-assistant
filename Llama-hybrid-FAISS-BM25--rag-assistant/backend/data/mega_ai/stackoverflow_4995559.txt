JQuery + Display next element one by one

So, I have this HTML Item Name or # Item Name or # Item Name or # Then outside the div myFields I have an image serving as a button (with id="add"). When clicked, the next fieldset is supposed to appear, for which I have this script $(document).ready(function() { $(".newSet").hide(); $("#add").click(function() { $(".newSet").next().show("slow"); }); But it will not show only the next one but all of them at once. I am sure there is a more elegant/efficient way of doing is but I cannot find it. Thanks for the help. Here is a jsFiddle example of the problem: http://jsfiddle.net/XyW4m/
