Carlos' answer is good in that it addresses a major deficiency in regression modeling practice. The term OVB is very imprecise. Except under atypical mathematical structures, adjusting for other variables will change the effect estimated for a primary regressor. This alone does not mean all such variables should be included in a model. The "backdoor criterion" specifically addresses confounding bias. An audience of experts will generally not accept/believe results from models which omit confounding variables from adjustment. This is for good reason. Omitted confounders have led to completely incorrect inference in large confirmatory studies, and further led to policies, drug indications, or media coverage which were costly and damaging. The preferred terminology here is confounding bias, rather than merely OVB. This applies to all types of models, including the most prevalent linear regression. The second most prevalent (perhaps) model is logistic regression. There is another type of "bias" (perhaps) which arises from logistic models unrelated to confounding. You can change the primary effect by adjusting for variables which are uncorrelated with the primary regressor. This is because of the non-collapsibility of the odds ratio . This arises when the primary exposure has a heterogeneous distribution of covariates underlying the baseline risk of the outcome. The slope of the sigmoid which estimates the "averaged out" accumulation of risk per unit difference in a primary regressor is attenuated. This type of bias arises when the target of inference was individual level risk, rather than population averaged. In general, the advice to modelers is to adjust for prognostic variables, or variables which, despite being unrelated to the primary regressor, are causally predictive of the outcome. Examples might be in a study on lung cancer and smoking, groups of participants by environmental ambient pollution. Assume for the moment no evidence suggests that differences in regionality satisfies backdoor criteria to confound the smoking-cancer relationship. However, the difference in risk for this environmental exposure substantially predicts risk of lung cancer. Adjusting for environmental exposure more finely stratifies these participants so that the apparent differences between smoking and non-smoking, and cancer risk are apparent. A very nice description of the difference is found here: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3147074/pdf/dyr041.pdf
