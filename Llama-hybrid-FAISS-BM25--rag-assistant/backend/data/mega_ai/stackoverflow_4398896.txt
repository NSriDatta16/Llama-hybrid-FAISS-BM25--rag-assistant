Using a DLL resource library is a relatively straightforward operation, and allows you to manage not only strings, but other resources as well. And this is its main advantage, because i18n is not only about string translation . However, depending on your needs, a text-based solution may be a better decision, because of its easier handling - resource scripts being more complex than xml files, especially for the average translator. I would suggest creating your own abstraction layer, something like "LoadLocalizedString", etc.; in this way, you can start implementing it just with text files, and then change to something more complex when and if required in a transparent way - all the effort for making your software i18n aware would still be valid.
