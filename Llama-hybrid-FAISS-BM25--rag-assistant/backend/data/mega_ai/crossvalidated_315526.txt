Alternative definitions of posterior probability

This is a follow-up from this question . In the cited article , which uses a bayesian framework to identify prioritized gene lesions, one posterior is defined as the following: $$P(D|S) \quad \stackrel{\text{def}}{=} \quad ∑_iP(D|M_i)·P(M_i|S) \tag{1}$$ which translates to "the posterior that the gene $D$ is a driver gene, assuming that the gene set $S$ expresses the phenotype (i.e. has a driver gene), is defined as the posterior that $D$ is a driver given that $M_i$ is a driver, multiplied with the posterior that $M_i$ is a driver given that $S$ has a driver gene". Aside from the biological definitions (gene, lesion, driver, gene set), it is not clear to me how this relate to the Bayes theorem, i.e. $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(B|A)P(A)}{P(B)} \tag{2}$$ which is used to compute the posterior. Is posterior a generic term with alternative definitions?
