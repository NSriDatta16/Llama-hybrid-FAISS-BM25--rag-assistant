people never want to hear "that's impossible" especially entrepeneurial types, it just makes them more dogged. so just show them what -is- possible for their 10k and let them come to their own conclusion. So, while drawing on other sites for inspiration is fine, "recreate X" is not a scope, it generally means the client hasn't thought it through. For a start, you don't know which parts of that site are really standing out to the client. So sit down with them and plan it properly, get them to lay out what they want from the ground up, without resorting to "however bragster/youtube/ebay do it". Just bullet point it, really quick and dirty. you'll then have an idea of the true scope. i want slick design i want video uploads i want video streaming i want comments ratings sharing competitions blog store leaderboards etc. etc. then you can throw some numbers next to each one, and watch them add up to over 10k. this will illustrate your point, and help your friend/client far better than "Trust me don't bother it's impossible"
