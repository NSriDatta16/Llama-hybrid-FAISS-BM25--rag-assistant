Independent variables with Box-Cox transformed dependent variable

I am trying to determine the factors driving bitcoin prices. I have a time series set of data with my dependent variable as bitcoin prices (denominated in USD). I have a set of explanatory variables including bitcoin-related metrics as well as non-bitcoin metrics. following some research on time series and data transformation, I understood I needed to transform my dependent variable with the Box-Cox method, which I did. I am now confused on which transformation I need to perform on my independent variables. Do I also need to perform Box-Cox transformations? Or maybe did I get it completely wrong ? For info, I am using XL stat.
