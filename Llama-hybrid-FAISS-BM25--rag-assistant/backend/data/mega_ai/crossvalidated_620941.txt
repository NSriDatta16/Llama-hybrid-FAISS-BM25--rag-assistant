First of all, a binomial GLM is more appropriate than a Poisson GLM. (A Poisson GLM is used for unbounded counts; your counts are bounded by the total number of surgeries.) The counts aren't that small and shouldn't pose an obstacle to valid inference. Second, can surgery cancellations be treated as independent? Technically, you have time series data. I'm worried about possible unmeasured factors that affect the probability of cancellation and vary with time.
