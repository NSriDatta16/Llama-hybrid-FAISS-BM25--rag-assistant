It looks like something is referring to class Agent before it is defined, i.e. probably in aStar.h . EDIT: Search for #define AGENT_H everywhere in your source. If you find it anywhere outside Agent.h , that means the Agent class might never be defined, if only because Agent.h can be #included with AGENT_H already #defined .
