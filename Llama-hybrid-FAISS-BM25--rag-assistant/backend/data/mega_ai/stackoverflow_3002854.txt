I'm creating a Collection class that is a collection of domain entities/objects. It's kinda modeled after the List object in .Net. It's generally not a good idea to write one language in another language. You don't need Collections in PHP. If you're going continue down that road, perhaps you should consider using tools supplied to you by PHP. For example, there's ArrayObject , which you can inherit from and override the required methods to ensure that only properly typed things enter the array. ArrayObjects can be used anywhere in PHP where a normal array can be used. Also, the underlying bits and pieces have already been written for you. The rest of the Standard PHP Library may be of some interest to you, the SplObjectStorage class in particular.
