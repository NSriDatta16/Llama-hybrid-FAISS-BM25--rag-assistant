This is usually caused because some of your page items... text boxes, rectangles, lines, tables... fall outside of the margins. I usually work on rather complex reports and what I have to do is put boarders (with different colors) on each thing that has an edge near the right hand of the page.... then when you preview, you can tell by the colors which thing is overflowing. Then you can re-size the objects or the margins until nothing overflows and the extra page is gone. This actually happens a lot with sub-reports. They can push over textboxes, rectangles, lines... anything... that are placed to the right of them. This can be an incredibly frustrating problem but I highly suggest adding colored borders to your report objects until you find what is spilling over. Sometimes - it can even be the canGrow property or it can be just white space left below your lowest report object so be sure to drag the bottom of the report body almost all the way up to the lowest object on your report (sometimes if the report body touches the lowest item that item's content can be cut off though, I always leave a little space, about the height of one of these letter's I am typing)
