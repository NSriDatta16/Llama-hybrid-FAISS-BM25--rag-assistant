Is my logistic regression model correct?

I have a factorial design 2*2 (A and B). Both variables with two responses high (coded as 1) and low (coded as 0) and I have a response variable $y$ , my logistic model include interaction between A and B in R, I coded logit . I verified the data and everything is good. I even ensured the my variables are coded as factors, in the exercise I'm working on I demonstrated that (check the image) The $y$ in the picture are the average response. The table used to calculate the coefficient is : The coefficient I found using the formulas in the picture are not equal to the coefficient in the output of R (see image) I don't understand where the problem is. I hope someone can explain to me the error I made. Thank you.
