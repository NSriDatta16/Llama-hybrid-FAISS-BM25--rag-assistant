Matching, ranking based on relevance of each criteria

I have a growing database containing: a table of demands (multiple criteria) a table of offers (multiple criteria) Criteria can be string (e.g.: country name), boolean, numeric, ... I would like to find all demand-offer which match more or less (a little like job banks, matchmaking, ...) If tables didn't contain many rows I would calculate as follows: for each demand, calculate for each offer the relevance of matching by averaging the relevance of each criteria. But for an important database this would take too much time, wouldn't it? What solution do you recommend?
