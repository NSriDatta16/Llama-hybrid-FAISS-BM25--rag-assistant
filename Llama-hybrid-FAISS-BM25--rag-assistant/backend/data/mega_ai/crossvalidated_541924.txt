Difference between dummy and factor variable?

I've just learnt about dummy variables. Say this is my data: Location Nest XXX Yes XXX No ZZZ Yes YYY Yes YYY No And I want to do multicolinearity tests/logistic regression in RStudio, so I don't want the dependent variable (Nest) to be in this text format. What is the difference between changing all "no" to 0, and all "yes" to 1 versus having the below output (which, as I understand, is the 'dummy' encoded version of the above data). Location Nest No nest XXX 1 0 XXX 0 1 YYY 1 0 Moreover, if I have say 15 categories that I want to analyse, can I just label them #1-15, or do I need to have 14 columns (for the k-1 I suppose) to make the categories into dummy variables?
