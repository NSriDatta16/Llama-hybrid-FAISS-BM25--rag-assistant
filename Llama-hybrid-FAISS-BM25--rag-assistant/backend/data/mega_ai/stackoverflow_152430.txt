Steps: Use external incrementing version number (if you leverage a continuous integration server like CruiseControl.NET, then it comes from the build label). Use GlobalVersionInfo.cs (file link-referenced by all projects in your solution) to hold the current version and update it on the build with the AssemblyInfo task from the MSBuild Community tasks. Script Mage command-line tool from the .NET SDK to update the ClickOnce manifest, using the same version (see the -v and -mv switches). BTW, a nice bonus is that, whenever you automatically publish a newer ClickOnce deployment version via the integration script, if you also specify the minimal version to mage.exe (same as version), then every user will be updated automatically on the next application launch.
