Assuming that each file represents the same population (all NYC or whatever), divide the survey weight on each observation by 2. Just remember what population you are now making inferences for. You now have an average population over the time period 2016-2017. In fact, you don't even have to divide by 2, but doing so will save you some explaining later. If the two surveys represent two completely different populations, the answer is probably don't do anything, but I'm not sure who you are making inferences for. If the two surveys represent some (but not all) of the same population, take the overlap portion and divide those weights by 2.
