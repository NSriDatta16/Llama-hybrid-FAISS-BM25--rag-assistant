Why doesn't setting the pixmap of a QLabel work?

I've created a subclass of QLabel that I intend to use in a QGraphicsView . It serves as a movable "point" that one can click on and drag around the graphics view. Creating the custom class and having it displayed in the graphics view hasn't been an issue; however, trying to get the custom QLabel to paint itself with the image I want isn't happening. The constructor for my custom QLabel class is like so: TrackerPoint::TrackerPoint(QWidget *parent) : QLabel(parent) { this->setFixedSize( 40, 40 ); QPixmap pixmap( ":/images/target.png" ); this->setPixmap( pixmap ); this->setMask( pixmap.mask() ); } I've ensured that the images directory exists in the working directory that the application is run from. If it is relevant at all, my QRC file is like so: images/target.png I've been trying to deal with this problem for days -- any ideas as to why the image isn't appearing would be lovely. (Does it have to do with the fact that I'm setting a pixmap in the constructor of the QLabel ?)
