If you are creating a forecast of a continuous time series, you can do that. This really depends on your objective though. If you are comparing your network model to the ARIMA, then you will probably want to use a similar metric so you can compare their accuracy. You're not treating it as an ARIMA model if you look at residuals. Residual analysis is widely used, as you probably know from GARCH models. This said, have you ever heard of gradient boosting? It essentially defines an additive model where each model forecasts the residuals of the previous model's objective. To be clear, the first learner models the series, then the second learner models the first's residuals, and then the third models the residuals of the model of residual left by the second, etc. See article: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting and talk by Trevor Hastie from Stanford and H20.ai: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wPqtzj5VZus It is commonly used for decision trees, but I am working with logistic boosting (something else) for neural networks in my project. That was a slight digression though since the question was only about residual analysis . You should play around and see what you can come up with it. Maybe try clustering the residuals and see what happens. That's your choice and your exploration. But you want to know about what you're dealing with. What are the limitations and assumptions in looking at residuals only? Are there any in this case? It's your data. You need to know it well. Best of luck.
