The issue with your ARIMA model is that it is making the prediction based on the values in the early stages of the time series. From looking at the graph, there is a "zig-zag" type of pattern, where we see only one change in trend to the upside and the pattern continues as normal. Have you tested for stationarity yet? If not, you should do so as that will give you a good indication as to whether you are using the correct ARIMA configuration. I can't really advise any further without seeing the data up close. That said, there are two options you could try: Use the pyramid package in Python, which replicates the auto.arima() function in R to estimate the ARIMA configuration automatically based on best fit. You can find more information here: https://www.alkaline-ml.com/pyramid/ If your data is volatile, which appears to be the case here, then it is possible that you would need to use a GARCH model to better adjust for the volatility in your data. Here is an example of how this is done: http://www.blackarbs.com/blog/time-series-analysis-in-python-linear-models-to-garch/11/1/2016
