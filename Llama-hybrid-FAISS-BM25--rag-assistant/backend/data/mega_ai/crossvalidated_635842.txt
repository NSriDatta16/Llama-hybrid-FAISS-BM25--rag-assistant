Using the accuracy does not return the proper Bayesian expectation. Let $A$ be the event of a true 5 or 6 Let $B$ be the event of the device showing a 5 or 6 You are asking for $P(A|B)$ or the probability that a true 5 or 6 was rolled given the device shows a 5 or 6. From definitions, we know that $$ P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)} $$ So we can skip sensitivity and specificity completely and work from the data given. $P(A \cap B)$ is where the device shows a 5 or 6 AND that actually occurred, which is the true positive rate or $0.04$ . $P(B) = P(A \cap B) + P(\tilde{A} \cap B)$ by the law of total probability . The first is the set of events we just described and has probability $0.04$ . The second is the set of events in which a five or six is shown on the device but in truth the die rolled a number less than five. This is the False Positive rate or $0.11$ . So what we want is $$ \frac{0.04}{0.04+0.11} = \frac{0.04}{0.15} = 0.2\overline{666} $$ Which is what you got using specificity, etc. subject to rounding. So while you are calculating some statistic using accuracy, it is not the conditional probability of $A$ given $B$ .
