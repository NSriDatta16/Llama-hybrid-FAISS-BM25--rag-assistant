Can the performance of a CNN be dependent on the train-test-val split random seed?

I am doing multi-class classification and comparing the effects of 2 image enhancement techniques (IET). IET 1 performs better than IET 2 at random seed x (for train-test-val split) IET 2 performs better than IET 1 at random seed y (for train-test-val split) Is this normal, or am I doing something wrong?
