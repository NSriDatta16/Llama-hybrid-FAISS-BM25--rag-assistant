Please. OH please go in a bookstore, find "Clean Code" by Robert C. Martin. and browse the chapter on naming. One of the comments in the book is how your code should be clear enough to abstract the types. For example, would anyone think that "user_name" is anything else but a string? Or if you need to know if "user_age" is an int or a float their is also something wrong, the code should abstract that. Avoid prefixes. After a few weeks developers don't see them anymore. It quickly devolves to silly meaningless 2-3 letters that only makes the code harder to read. If you really need to know the type, today's development tool makes it real easy to find it, like hovering the mouse over a variable. Use pronounceable words. This will easily make all variables easy to understand. Avoid things like usrdobisec (user date of birth in seconds)
