In Bayesian statistics, how do I compare proportions between multiple subgroups with weighted data?

I have the following data in R : df Within the Bayesian framework, I'd like to compare for each subgroup whether there is a significant difference from year to year in its proportions, which can be established by the following code: library(dplyr) mutate(df, Sub_A_prop = Sub_A / Total, Sub_B_prop = Sub_B / Total, Sub_C_prop = Sub_C / Total, Sub_D_prop = Sub_D / Total, Sub_E_prop = Sub_E / Total, Sub_F_prop = Sub_F / Total) A vague beta-binomial prior distribution would be fine. How do I go about doing so in R ?
