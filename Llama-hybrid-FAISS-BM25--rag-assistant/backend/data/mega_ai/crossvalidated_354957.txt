Auto-correlation arises in the context of a stochastic time-series $\{ X_t | t \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ where we have one or more variables that vary over time. Within this context, auto-correlation is just the correlation of a variable at two points in time: $$\mathbb{Corr}(X_t, X_{t+k}).$$ A Markov chain is defined by the property that the current state is conditionally independent of all states before the previous state, when you condition on the previous state . This implies that the conditional auto-correlation is zero when we condition on any intervening state: $$\mathbb{Corr}(X_t, X_{t+k} | X_{v}) = 0 \quad \quad \quad \text{for all } 0 This does not imply that the unconditional auto-correlation between separated times will be zero. Since the Markov chain depends on the previous state, and the previous state depends on the one before, and so on, it will generally be the case that states will be auto-correlated over time, beyond just a lag of one.
