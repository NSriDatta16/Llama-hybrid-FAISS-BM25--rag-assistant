If you want to analyze the trends over time for a time period greater than a week, then you can average the count per day and analyze. This would help you look at the trends and (possible)seasonality of the tags. So, as per your problem statement, I would suggest you go with a scatter plot of the tag counts. You would also like to have a look at this post which talks about keeping an eye on the varying number of days and weekends in monthly cycles.
