If you add a default constraint when creating the table, you won't know what it is called. However, if you add a constraint with ALTER TABLE, you must name the constraint. In this case, you would be able to ALTER TABLE DROP CONSTRAINT (This applies to T-SQL, not sure about other databases.) However, this would require you to CREATE TABLE with NULL column, ALTER TABLE to add the constraint, make the column NOT NULL, and finally DROP CONSTRAINT. I don't believe an insert trigger would work as someone else mentioned, because your rows are already added. I think the way you describe may, in fact, be the most efficient and elegant solution.
