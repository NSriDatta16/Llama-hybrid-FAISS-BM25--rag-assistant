"good ui design" is actually two problems : getting the right design getting the design right both are hard problems. in my experience the two things should be explored in parallel , as to not get ugly surprises late in the project ("why is our sexy drag&droping ultra-slow in IE8?? what do you mean it's not fixable???") to get the right design you will have to explore posibilites. books can guide you towards trying out things that make most sense for your cicumstance - experience is even better, of course. also you absolutly need feedback from real users - how else would you find out that the design is already right? ( you certainly can't tell.. read on!) "getting the design right" then is the next problem, as it means the design you found appropriate must be implemented. those "user experience / gui" things are so hard, because finding the right answer involves understanding what humans want - which they can't objectivly tell you and you on the other hand can't find out from "the outside". this means an (experience-) guided trial&error approach is the only way to go. to more clearly answer your question: why is good ui design so hard for some devels for hardcore developers a big problem is, that their understanding of how the software works is so very different from how the users think it works (for example the URL "www.stackoverflow.com" should be written as "com.stackoverflow.com", if you know anything about how DNS works. but try selling a browser that expects URLs it like that :)). as a sidenote: I would suggest you look into "experience design" rather then "user interface design", but that's another story.
