I would start with the one-sample case. Given the trivial linear model $y=\mu+\epsilon$ , where $\epsilon$ is mean zero uncorrelated homoscedestic noise, the OLS estimator is just the sample average. What are some non-linear estimators of $\mu$ ? Can you choose $\epsilon$ so one of them is better than the sample average? If so, can you expand this to where $\mu=X\beta$ is non-trivial. One choice for a non-linear estimator would be the median, so you need to find a distribution for $\epsilon$ where the median is unbiased for the mean but has strictly smaller variance than the mean.
