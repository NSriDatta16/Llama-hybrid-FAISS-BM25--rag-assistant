Is there an equivalent to iOS's Keychain for user credentials on Android?

Is there an equivalent to iOS's Keychain on Android? My understanding of the Preferences API is that it is not encrypted. For my application it doesn't matter whether these credentials are persisted across devices (i.e. a different use-case to iPhone-like Keychain in Android? ) I also looked at the KeyStore API but it seems to leave the actual storage of user credentials up to the application developer.
