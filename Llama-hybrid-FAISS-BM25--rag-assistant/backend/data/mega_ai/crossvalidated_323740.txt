Which algorithms can be expressed with mostly set intersections

I'm sorry in advance if my question is too broad of does not fit here. Which algorithms in machine learning classification and data mining can be expressed entirely or almost entirely as set intersection operations. For example, for the case of machine learning classification I do not care about how those sets are computed, I am only interested in the classification algorithm being mostly set intersection operations. Imagine you have a trained model $M$ for some binary classification task, a threshold $t$, and you are given a sample $s$. In the simplest case: Are there classifiers which work by outputting 1 iff $\vert M \cap SomeProcessingFunction(s) \vert > t$. I am also interested in classification algorithms which consist out of multiple set intersection operations. The rough motivation behind it as follows: I have a (theoretical) model, where (during the classification) set intersection operations of data sets are cheap, when compared to any other type of instructions. I am looking for machine learning classification algorithms, which would be particularly efficient in such a model. thanks in advance!
