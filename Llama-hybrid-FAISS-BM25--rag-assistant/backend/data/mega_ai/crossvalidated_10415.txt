I'll imagine a concrete example, with more context, to make things easy. Assume you measure the score on test of 3k students of 200 schools and you measured each student at 4 time points (say, at each quarter). You have a covariate at student level that doesn't vary by time (like sex), that you called pred1.obs and a covariate by school that vary by time (say the number of meetings between teachers and parents until that moment in time). If this example resembles your study, than I think you have to set up a three level model (individual level, group level and time level for the groups): i = 1 ... 3000 individuals t = 1... 4 periods g = 1... 200 groups The model would be: y_i ~ N(a + b_[groups_g] + b.ind*pred.obs1_i, sigma^2) # 1st level b_g = N(gamma + gamma_[time] + gamma.g[time_t]*pred2.grp, sigma.b^2) # 2nd level gamma.g_t = N(0, sigma.gamma^2) # 3rd level Note that you would have the slope at the second level (group level) varying by time, which makes sense, since you expect that the effect of schools on the perfomance of students may vary by time, depending of the valu of the covariate at the level of schools. I'm not that sure how to estimate this with lmer (I know how to estimate a Bayesian model using WinBugs or Jags, calling them by R). In any case, here is my suggestion. In lme4, I'd try: First, expand pred2.grp (the covariate at group level that vary by time) to the individual level, then you would have repetead measures by individuals at the group and time level. Then: lmer(outcome ~ pred1.obs + pred2.grp + (1|group))
