CausalImpact just performs a cross-correlation of residuals from ARIMA models, with some super beefy (unwarranted) cause-y language thrown on top. Depending on the shape or form of the intervention (like in the case of constant additive effect), you probably won't have a powerful analysis. The approach is just not smart enough to find a lag that best aligns the residuals. To fix this, you can just shift the time series yourself, but be warned this kind of post-processing compromises the validity of statistical analysis. For instance, how could I or any external reviewer trust that the number of lagged days that you tweaked was on the basis of prespecified hypotheses and not "what made the analysis most statistically significant"?
