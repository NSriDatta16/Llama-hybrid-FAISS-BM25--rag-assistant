Looking for a machine learning algorithm that can classify line plots into two groups?

I have a dataset of many 2-D line plots that represent height versus position measured from an AFM. I am interested in training a model by classifying these lines into two groups: presence of a defect and no presence. I believe a neural network would be appropriate for this since there are other features in the line plots that I want to be able to ignore. The problem is that I am just starting by taking a certification course on machine learning but that hasn't given me enough information to develop one on my own. I have worked with a segnet based neural network but at a very user oriented level. So I was wondering if anyone knew of an open-source algorithm that I could feed these lines into (maybe as vectors?) to train a model?
