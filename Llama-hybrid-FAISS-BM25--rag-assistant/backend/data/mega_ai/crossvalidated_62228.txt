If you have no training data even remotely close to the test data then RF cannot hope to predict it with any degree of accuracy. This stems from the way in which RF's work - which is how tree models work. The predicted value from a single tree for an observation is the mean value of the response variable of all the training set samples in the node of the tree to which the predicted sample is assigned. RFs extend this to many trees (so you average over $n$ trees, not just 1) and involve bagging and random selection of variables for each split. But the fundamental feature is an average of the training samples most similar to the predicted sample. Hence you can only operate within the range of the observed response data.
