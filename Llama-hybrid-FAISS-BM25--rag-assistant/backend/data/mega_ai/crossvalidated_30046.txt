I do share your concern about the matter of visual rendering of clusters by means of PCA. If the 1st 2 or 3 principal components account for only small portion of multidimensional variability they are likely to miss most of the directions along which the clusters differentiate. Moreover, even when components are strong they can fail: just consider two oblong parallel clusters in 2 dimensions which are separated from each other by a slit along their length. The 1st pc will lie also along their length and won't show the presence of clusters. Your second question implies now that you know your clusters in advance (because you mention using t-test or similar comparison method). If you succeeded in selecting features (dimensions) which differentiate them most strongly, then using PCA on those selected features may turn meaningless - if the features don't correlate, or may turn valuable - if they all or some of them are pretty well correlated. If you speak of PCA and not of factor analysis in strict meaning and you do neither rotations nor interpretations of the extracted PCs then %Variance is the only important statistic to report, for me. You could also show the scree-plot.
