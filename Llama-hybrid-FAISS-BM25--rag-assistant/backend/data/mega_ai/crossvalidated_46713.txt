I think you're right about the counting. For a Markov model of order $1$, with $K$ states, you need $K\times K$ parameters, minus $K$ parameters, since you have to consider the normalization of the conditional probabilities for each final state $K$; hence, $K\times K - K = K(K-1)$. For order $M$, it generalizes to $K^{M+1} - K = K^M (K-1).$ See this post Number of parameters in a Markov chain , where a similar question has been posted. Is the formula you mention maybe a typo? Or perhaps a different nomenclature for "order"?
