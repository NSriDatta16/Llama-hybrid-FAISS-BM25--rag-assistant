Post-hoc test in two-way ANOVA

I am doing a two-way independent ANOVA using type of organisational change (5 levels) and job level (7 levels) within the organisation as the factors (in SPSS). I followed Andy Field's procedure ( Discovering Statistics Using SPSS , third edition) and I cannot manage to get the option of Post-Hoc tests for cases where equal variance is not assumed, i.e. Games-Howell. I searched the syntax help files and somewhere there's a note saying that when using more than one factor Games-Howell cannot be performed. However, Andy Field did it! (please see page 434 of his book). Any ideas how can I do the same?
