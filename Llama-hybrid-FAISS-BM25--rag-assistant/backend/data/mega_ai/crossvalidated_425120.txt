Time Series/Longitudinal Survival Analysis in R- is this possible?

Wondering if it possible to incorporate time series/longitudinal data into a survival analysis. I have data that represents different cases over a span of 5 years, with the same data gathered during each of the 5 years. After each year survival is recorded along with other measures that were repeated every year. The data looks something like this, but with quite a few more explanatory variables. There are also a few variables that are static such as the year they were initially diagnosed. (yr1-yr5 represent whether they were alive after year 1-5 [2 represents censored data points]; yrs is how many years since they were originally diagnosed; cv1-cv5 represent how many times they came into the clinic during each year 1-5; grp1-5 represent which treatment they had each year- this is something that could change but usually did not) id yr1 yr2 yr3 yr4 yr5 yrs cv1 cv2 cv3 cv4 cv5 grp1 grp2 grp3 grp4 grp5 1 1 1 1 1 1 7 2 0 4 0 1 400 400 400 400 400 2 2 2 2 1 0 2 3 5 300 300 3 2 1 1 1 1 4 4 0 0 0 0 200 200 100 100 4 1 1 0 2 2 9 3 1 0 200 200 200 etc. The goal is to use survivor analysis to forecast death events by identifying patterns over the years leading up to the death event. I've already read through quite a few websites dealing with survival analysis or recurrent events, a few are linked below, but haven't found any that discuss if/how to use time series or longitudinal data in a survival analysis. I would be grateful for any suggestions or resources you can direct me to. https://www.emilyzabor.com/tutorials/survival_analysis_in_r_tutorial.html https://rviews.rstudio.com/2017/09/25/survival-analysis-with-r/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4339761/
