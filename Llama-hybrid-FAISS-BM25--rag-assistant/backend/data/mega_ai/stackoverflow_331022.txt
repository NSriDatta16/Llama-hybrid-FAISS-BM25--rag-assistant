If your UML Diagrams are getting too complex try breaking the digram up into several diagrams each of which covers a smaller subset of classes. You may even want to move your classes into seperate packages to keep them organised. In Star UML (and other UML Tools) classes can appear in more than one diagram so you can include all the classes from one package plus the classes from a differnt package's public interface.
