Your observation is interesting. All tutorials I have seen so far are using the time2vec layer in the way described by you. They are just transforming the input features into the time2vec embedding. In my opinion this would not reproduce the effects which are described in the original paper. A correct usage would use one time related feature (e.g. epoch time), scale it and then use this feature to produce the time2vec embedding.
