The subsets should all be disjoint. If the number of data points isn't evenly divisible by the number of cross validation folds, then some subsets will contain slightly more points than others. This is ok. Of course, for a given number of folds, the subsets should be chosen to be as evenly sized as possible. When computing the average error across test/validation sets, the average should be weighted by the number of points in each set. Edit (how to produce a partition with relatively evenly sized subsets): Standard statistics/machine learning libraries will do this for you automatically. One way to do it yourself: Say you have $n$ data points and want to perform k-fold cross validation. Let $v_i$ denote the $i$th element of vector $v$ (with indices starting at 1). Take the integers from 1 to $n$ (inclusive). Randomly permute their order and store them in vector $p$. Take $k+1$ real numbers evenly spaced from 1 to $n+1$ (inclusive). Round all values to the nearest integer, and store them in vector $q$. The indices of the data points in the $i$th subset are: [$p_{(q_i)}, \dots, p_{(q_{i+1}-1)}]$
