What is the benefit of Recurrent Spiking Neural Network over Feed-forward Spiking Neural Network?

Feed-forward Spiking neural networks allow us to process time data naturally without the additional complexity of a recurrent neural network. So what is the benefit of Recurrent Spiking Neural Networks over Feed-forward Spiking Neural Networks?
