PCA is not a method of causal inference in the sense of recovering a data generating model. All PCA does is decompose a covariance matrix into orthogonal vectors that define a new space with the property that if the data are "projected" onto this space, then each successive axis has less variance. An infinite number of generating models can generate the same covariance matrix and consequently the eigenvectors of a covariance matrix cannot recover the true generating model. Your generating model has three variables (g1, g2, and g3) that all contribute equally to the variation in the data and your PCA recovered this quite well (as the first axis), as it should.
