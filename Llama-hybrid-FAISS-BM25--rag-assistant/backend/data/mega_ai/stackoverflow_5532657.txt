Most (all?) browsers won't load unknown CSS into the DOM, and JavaScript cannot directly access CSS styles directly, only the ones that are loaded into the DOM. The only way I can think of would be to implement your own CSS parsing JavaScript, but for the mostpart, that would probably be excessive for what you want to do, and a pure JavaScript solution or a class value would better. e.g. In HTML Using that example, you could use your JavaScript to get the classname of the element, and if it has the "moveable" class, you know it can move. EDIT: In @Anurag's posted link to the Mozilla bug, it is mentioned that unknown CSS properties are to be ignored as part of the CSS 2.1 specification.
