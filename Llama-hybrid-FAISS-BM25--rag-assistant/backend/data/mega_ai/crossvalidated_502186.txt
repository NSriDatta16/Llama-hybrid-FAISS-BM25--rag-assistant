Is the median of expected values equal to the expected value of median?

Suppose that an individual $i$ earns $X_{1_i}$ with probability $P_i$ and $X_{2_i}$ with probability $1-P_i$ . The expected value of income can be expressed as $E(X_i)=P_i\cdot X_{1_i}+(1-P_i)\cdot X_{2_i}$ . Suppose there are $N$ individuals with unique values of $P$ , $X_1$ , and $X_2$ , such that $P_i\neq P_j$ , $X_{1_i}\neq X_{1_j}$ , and $X_{2_i} \neq X_{2_j}$ . It is straightforward to compute the median of $E(X)$ . Suppose I construct a simulation of the situation described above where for each individual $i$ I draw once from the following Bernoulli distribution: $$E_i \sim B[P_i]$$ and then assign income as follows: \begin{equation} X_i= \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} X_{1_i} & \text{if}\space E_i=1 \\ X_{2_i} & \text{if}\space E_i=0 \end{array} \right. \end{equation} I can then compute the mean of $X$ . If I run this simulation $k$ times I obtain $k$ median values. Should I expect the average of these $k$ observations of the median to converge to the median of $E(X)$ ? Is there some theorem that proves this? Or am I missing the forest for the trees somehow with my logic. Thanks!
