This would be a lot easier for you if you would accept that there is well-established terminology for the concepts that you are having trouble expressing concisely or accurately, and that these mathematical terms have been around far longer than you. Since you've clearly gone through most of the trouble of understanding the concepts, you might as well break down and start calling them by their proper names. That said: There are 2 obvious ways to graph bandwidth, and two ways you might be getting the bandwidth data from the server. First, there's the cumulative usage function, which for any time is simply the total amount of data transferred since the start of the measurement. If you plot this function, you get a graph that never decreases (since you can't un-download something). The units of the values of this function will be bytes or kB or something like that. What users are typically interested is in the instantaneous usage function, which is an indicator of how much bandwidth you are using right now . This is what users typically want to see. In mathematical terms, this is the derivative of the cumulative function. This derivative can take on any value from 0 (you aren't downloading) to the rated speed of your network link (indicating that you're pushing as much data as possible through your connection). The units of this function are bytes per second, or something related like Mbps (megabits per second). You can approximate the instantaneous bandwidth with the average data usage over the past few seconds. This is computed as (number of bytes transferred) ----------------------------------------------------------------- (number of seconds that elapsed while transferring those bytes) Generally speaking, the smaller the time interval, the more accurate the approximation. For simplicity's sake, you usually want to compute this as "number of bytes transferred since last report" divided by "number of seconds since last report". As an example, if the server is giving you a report every 4 minutes of "total number of bytes transferred today", then it is giving you the cumulative function and you need to approximate the derivative. The instantaneous bandwidth usage rate you can report to users is: (total transferred as of now) - (total as of 4 minutes ago) bytes ----------------------------------------------------------- 4*60 seconds If the server is giving you reports of the form "number of bytes transferred since last report", then you can directly report this to users and plot that data relative to time. On the other hand, if the user (or you) is concerned about a quota on total bytes transferred per day, then you will need to transform the (approximately) instantaneous data you have into the cumulative data. This process, known as computing the integral , is the opposite of computing the derivative, and is in some ways conceptually simpler. If you've kept track of each of the reports from the server and the timestamp, then for each time, the value you plot is the total of all the reports that came in before that time. If you're doing this in realtime, then every time you get a new report, the graph jumps up by the amount in that report.
