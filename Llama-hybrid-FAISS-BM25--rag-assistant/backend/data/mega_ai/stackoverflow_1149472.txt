The answer to your question depends on how you expect those class to be modified in the future, as the requirements of the program expand or change. A good guideline for figuring out when to split/join a class, is the Single Responsibility Principle : "There should never be more than one reason for a class to change." Also the Open Closed Principle helps in deciding how to organize classes so, that you can modify the behaviour of existing classes by combining them with new classes, instead of modifying the existing classes: "Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification." http://butunclebob.com/ArticleS.UncleBob.PrinciplesOfOod
