What's the difference between "deep learning" and multilevel/hierarchical modeling?

Is "deep learning" just another term for multilevel/hierarchical modeling? I'm much more familiar with the latter than the former, but from what I can tell, the primary difference is not in their definition, but how they are used and evaluated within their application domain. It looks like the number of nodes in a typical "deep learning" application is larger and uses a generic hierarchical form, whereas applications of multilevel modeling typically uses a hierarchical relationships that mimic the generative process being modeled. Using a generic hierarchy in an applied statistics (hierarchical modeling) domain would be regarded as an "incorrect" model of the phenomena, whereas modeling a domain-specific hierarchy might be regarded as subverting the objective of making a generic deep learning learning machine. Are these two things really the same machinery under two different names, used in two different ways?
