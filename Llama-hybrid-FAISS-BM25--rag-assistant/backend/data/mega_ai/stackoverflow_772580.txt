As our workaround, we captured the enter and leave event for the control that we wanted to have override the acceptbutton functionality. Inside the enter event, we held the current accept button in a private variable and set the acceptbutton to null. On leave, we would reassign the acceptbutton back to the private variable we were holding. The KeyPreview events could have done something similar to the above. If anyone has a more elegant solution, I would still love to know. Thanks.
