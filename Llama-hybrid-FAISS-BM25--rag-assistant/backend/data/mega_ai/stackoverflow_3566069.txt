And what is iSl ? When is it defined ? How are the various arrays initialized ? Here is what I would suggest you. Create a Product class. For this class define as many fields as you have arrays here (id, name, desc, ...). Load Products from your storage and put them in a Collection (a List , a Set , whichever fits your needs). And finally read them. Your code will be easier for you to understand, as you'll have to iterate over only one array, instead of all these ones (one of which I suspect is not initialized with a size greater than 0).
