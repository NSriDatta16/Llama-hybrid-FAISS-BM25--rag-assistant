New products by category in Magento

This should be supposed to be silly thing but it’s driving me nuts! All I want is to show the new products for a specified category, but all I get is new products from any category. Supposing I want to show up the category 74, I’ve tried almost any combination of that code {{block type="catalog/product_new" name="home.catalog.product.new" alias="product_homepage" category_id="74" template="catalog/product/new.phtml"}} With a category_id directly assigned {{block type="catalog/product_new" category_id="74" template="catalog/product/new.phtml"}} With category implicit depending or which category I’m accessing {{block type="catalog/product_new" template="catalog/product/new.phtml"}} This code has been tested, hardcoded in home page code, creating a static block with it and including it through category panel (static block and products)…but worthless. I’ve tested almost any code I’ve found in this and other forums but no result. Regardless of any code (with category_id="74" assigned and not), I’m all the time getting the same result. The category filter doesn’t work and shows me new products from any category, not the new products of the current category, neither the products of a handcoded category (for instance category_id="74") On the other hand if I use list products instead of new products, works OK in home page and as static block, so categories seem to be well created {{block type="catalog/product_list" category_id="74" template="catalog/product/list.phtml"}} That shows me products that belong to category 74 I’m using magento Magento ver. 1.3.2.4, and shows me the same result even using different templates. Any advice will be welcomed Have a nice day, J. PS I've tried also with other categories, not only 74. With parent categories, child categories...but no result at all
