Grails efficient hasMany-Relationship in View

I'm saving contacts (email, mobile phone, ICQ, AIM etc.) for people like this: class Person { static hasMany = { contacts: Contact } } class Contact { String code ContactType type } class ContactType { String name } In my view, I've written some Templates for displaying each contact with a select-box for the contact-type and a textfield for the code, spiced up with some JavaScript for adding and deleting. My question is: Is there an easy and elegant way to update the data similar to personInstance.properties = params or do I have to read out all the fields, deleting removed, updating changed and adding new ones?
