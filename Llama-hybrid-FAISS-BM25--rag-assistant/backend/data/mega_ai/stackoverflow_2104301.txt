The best way to think about this is to think about the variables . Variables are by definition storage locations . What are the storage locations in your program? They are: the formal parameters i and bufOutputStream of the first WriteInt. the local variable buffer in the first WriteInt the elements ("IntSize" of them) of the array referred to by buffer, after it is allocated. the formal parameters i, byte_array and pos of the second WriteInt The byte_array storage location and the buffer storage location are different storage locations. But the byte_array storage location contains a reference to the same array that the buffer storage location refers to. Therefore buffer[0] and byte_array[0] refer to the same storage location. Just think about the storage locations, and it'll all make sense.
