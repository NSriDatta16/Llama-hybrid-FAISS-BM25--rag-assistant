+1 for sparing use of solution folders to help organise stuff. +1 for project building to its own folder. We initially tried a common output folder and this can lead to subtle and painful to find out-of-date references. FWIW, we use project references for solutions, and although nuget is probably a better choice these days, have found svn:externals to work well for both 3rd party and (framework type) in-house assemblies. Just get into the habit of using a specific revision number instead of HEAD when referencing svn:externals (guilty as charged:)
