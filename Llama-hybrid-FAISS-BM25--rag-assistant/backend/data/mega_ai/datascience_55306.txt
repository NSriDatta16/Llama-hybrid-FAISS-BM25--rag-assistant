How do I get similarity with autoencoders

I have build an autoencoder to extract from a very high dimensional (200 dimensions) space a smaller but significant representation (16 dimensions). Now that I have these "encoded" vectors, I would like to compute some kind of similarity score, or clustering. I am not sure which notion of distance to apply at this point. Any ideas how I can get similarity/clusters considering that I have used autoencoders?
