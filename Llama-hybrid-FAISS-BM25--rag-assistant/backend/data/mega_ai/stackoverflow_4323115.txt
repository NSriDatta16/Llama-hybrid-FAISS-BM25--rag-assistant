I refactored the code and views quite a bit. In the end all I'm really trying to acheive is have a parent view (not shown) iterate over an IEnumerable and for each iteration render a partial view (ActiveTranslationRegion) which renders some Html to represent a region model. I also want to be a able to call an action method via an ajax call to render an indivual ActiveTranslationRegion partial view by passing it an individual region model. I've refactored the code accordingly. Partial view (_ActiveTranslationRegion.spark) ${ Model.RegionName } Notice by using I can refer to Model within the view as RobertTheGrey suggested (see above) . I removed all the code to return the view as a string and simply created an action method method that returned a partialViewResult: [UnitOfWork] public PartialViewResult ActivateRegion(int id) { var region = _repos.Get(id); if (region != null) { region.Active = true; _repos.SaveOrUpdate(region); } return PartialView("_ActiveTranslationRegion", region); } One thing I had to do was amend my parent view to look like so: Inactive Regions # Html.RenderPartial("_InActiveTranslationRegion", region); Where previously I had the following: Notice I have to call the Html.RenderPartial rather than use the element. If I try and use the element (which I would prefer to do) I get the following error: Only one viewdata model can be declared. IEnumerable != Region Is there a way round that problem? Update: I tried your recommendation but with no luck. To recap the problem, I want to use the partial in 2 different situations. In the first instance I have a parent view that uses a model of IEnumerable , the partial simply uses Region as its model. So in the parent I iterate over the IEnumerable and pass Region to the partial. In the second instance I want to call PartialView("_ActiveTranslationRegion", region) from an action method. If I remove the from the partial I get an error complaining about the model. The best way round the problem I have found is to add a binding to the bindings.xml file: # Html.RenderPartial("@name", @model); (Note: It seems very important to keep this entry in the bindings file all on te same line) This way I can still call the partial from the action method as described above and pass it a Region as the model, but I can also replace my call to Html.RenderPartial in the parent view with a more 'html' like tag: So my parent view now looks more like this: Inactive Regions Of course under the hood its still making a call to # Html.RenderPartial("_ActiveTranslationRegion", region); But its the best solution we could come up with.
