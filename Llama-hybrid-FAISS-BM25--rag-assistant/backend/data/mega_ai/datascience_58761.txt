Publicly available news APIs/datasets?

In addition to our list of publicly available datasets , I'd like to know if there is any list of publicly available news datasets/crawling APIs. It would be very nice if alongside with a link to the dataset/API, characteristics of the data available were added. Such information should be, and is not limited to: the name of the news network / news aggregator; what kind of news information it provides (title, snippet, full-article, date, author, url, ...); whether it allows for crawling its contents via an API (and rate: 10/min, 1k/month, ...); whether it simply provides a snapshot of the whole dataset. news sources covered date range of news content coverage Any suggestions and further characteristics to be added are very welcome.
