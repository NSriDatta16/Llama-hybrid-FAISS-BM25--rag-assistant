How can I tell which basketball shooting format is better?

I am experimenting with two shooting formats in basketball practice with our team. One format is competitive shooting, and the other one is non-competitive shooting (all same shots, except the motivations are different). I have the following statistics: Makes Takes Average 95%-Confidence Competitive Shooting 98 165 59.39% 51.9% to 66.9% NOT Competitive Shooting 522 963 54.21% 51.1% to 57.4% This is the extent of my knowledge and I'm not sure how to determine whether one format is better than another? Or if I'm using the correct thinking process for this?
