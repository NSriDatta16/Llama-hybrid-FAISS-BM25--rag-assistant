This is not a very sophisticated answer, but I can't help but think it's still a good answer... If your motivation is that correlation parameters produced by time series data tend to look normal, why not just simulate time series data, calculate the correlation parameters and use those? You may have a good reason for not doing this, but it's not clear to me from your question.
