If I understand your question correctly, you are asking how you can get around your secured AJAX requests returning redirects to your login page (or the login page itself) to your AJAX handler? I would organise your application so that calls to secured AJAX request are only done from pages that are secured themselves. That way all requests that you initiate (from your own pages) are guaranteed to work and any requests that come from somewhere else (potentially malicious ones) from AJAX or normal page requests will be redirected to the login page.
