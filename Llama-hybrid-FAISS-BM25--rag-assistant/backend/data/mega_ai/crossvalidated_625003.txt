G Power Settings for Friedman Test Comparing Multiple Models

UPdated to convey statistical question: The underlying statistical question is one of which test to use: I have three models against a single dataset. I want to see which model is better. Is repeated measures ANOVA the appropriate test, or regular one-way ANOVA? Also, is my number of groups 1 since I'm just testing against model type (which has 3 levels representing each of the three models I'm comparing)? Near the end of this post I mention three as the number of my groups, but I think those are just the levels (three different model types)? I'm confused. I'm trying to figure out how to configure GPower's settings for a Friedman's test comparing three machine learning models (RF, LR, and another form of LR). I believe it is a between-factors repeated measures test, but I'm having trouble confirming the "Number of Groups" and "Number of Measurements." I think my "Number of Groups" is three representing the three models. What about "Number of Measurements"?
