My best thought so far is just to scan the data and match to a hard-coded list. So something like: if Count("science fiction & fantasy") > 3 then list is sci fi if Count("business finance & law") > 3 then list is business I think this might not be a bad idea? Grab the top level book categories from Amazon and just match against those. It's not very elegant but it would work. Alternatively, perhaps you could use the dc:subject data from the Google Book API ? (I haven't used it though so it may also be garbage).
