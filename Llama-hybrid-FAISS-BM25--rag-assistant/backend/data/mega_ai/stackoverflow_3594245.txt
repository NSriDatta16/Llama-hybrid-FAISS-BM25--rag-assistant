Percentage display issue

i have a value that i calculate between 0 -100 , its usually a float number like 5.87876 , so i use number_format like : $format_number = number_format($number, 2, '.', ''); the problem is , even the calculate number is integer like : 100 its show 100.00 but i want to display it like : 100 what is the elegant way to achive this ? (i mean without else if ..)
