what are those pages for? how they can redirect to other pages. what should i do to pass these? Sometimes work is done on those pages. Sometimes the JavaScript is there to prevent automated access like what you're trying to do :). A lot of websites have unnecessary checks to make sure you have a "good" browser, so make sure that your user_agent is set to something common, like IE. Sometimes setting the user_agent to look like an old browser will let you get past without JavaScript. Website automation is fun because you have to outsmart the website and its software developers, using multiple strategies. Like the others said, Watir is the best tool for getting past JavaScript at the moment.
