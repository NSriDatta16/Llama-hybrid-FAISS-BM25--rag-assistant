In addition to the other answers I will point out from hard experience that manipulating dom elements in the browser to animate them is really really slow compared to a direct drawing API like the canvas tag provides. There's a lot of overhead not only in the bridge between the javascript and the dom, but also in the browser running a content reflow routine every time some attribute is changed. There's ways around some of this such as ensuring that your animated eliments have display:absolute set in their css (Thus taking them out of the document flow, eliminating the need to reflow) and ensuring in your code that you only touch the dom when something actually needs to change. A dom document fragment can be manipulated, and then inserted into the dom, and that's much faster than manipulating a part of the dom that is displayed on the screen. And also that event handling stuff other people mentioned. Javascript scaling? Yes, yes it can. The browser DOM scaling? No perhaps not. Maybe future browsers will be better at this.
