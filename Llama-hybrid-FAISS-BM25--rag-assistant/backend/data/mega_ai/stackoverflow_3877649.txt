A special case of grouping coordinates

I'm trying to write a program to place students in cars for carpooling to an event. I have the addresses for each student, and can geocode each address to get coordinates (the addresses are close enough that I can simply use euclidean distances between coordinates.) Some of the students have cars and can drives others. How can I efficiently group students in cars? I know that grouping is usually done using algorithms like K-Mean, but I can only find algorithms to group N points into M arbitrary-sized groups. My groups are of a specific size and positioning. Where can I start? A simply greedy algorithm will ensure the first cars assigned have minimum pick-up distance, but the average will be high, I imagine.
