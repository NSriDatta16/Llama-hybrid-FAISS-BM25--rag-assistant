Wikipedia has a roundup of what the various RFCs say about how an email address should be formed. Despite what others have said, email can be case sensitive The local-part is case sensitive, so "jsmith@example.com" and "JSmith@example.com" may be delivered to different people. This practice is discouraged by RFC 5321. However, only the authoritative mail servers for a domain may make that decision . The only exception is for a local-part value of "postmaster" which is case insensitive, and should be forwarded to the server's administrator. The local part is referring to the part of the address to the left of the @ sign. So, as far as your specific concern (case normalization), you could lowercase the server portion (to the right of the @) however you best see fit (split by the @, strToLower the server component, recombine).
