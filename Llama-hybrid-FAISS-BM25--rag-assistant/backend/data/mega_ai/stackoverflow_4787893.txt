How to use PrimeFaces p:droppable inside datatable?

There is business need to categorize items. Best idea seems to be dragdrop items from one list into list of categories. Number of categories can vary so p:dataTable is used. Ajax request is sent but onDrop method is not called from inside dataTable. When Removing datatable and column and having outputpanels statically then onDrop is called? How to best drag and drop items into dynamically changing categories?
