1) Yes and no. If the original scenario had used a lower rate then the number of false positives would fall as well. This article is just showing Bayes theorem. 2) Yes, approximately. However, you may want to read Ruud Wetzels, Dora Matzke, Michael D. Lee, Jeffrey N. Rouder, Geoffrey J. Iverson, and Eric-Jan Wagenmakers. Statistical Evidence in Experimental Psychology: An Empirical Comparison Using 855 t Tests. Perspectives on Psychological Science. 6(3) 291â€“298 They deconstruct 855 published results using Bayesian methods and while the results are generally the same, the Bayesian tests were less likely to find significance and in some cases found support for the null hypothesis, which is something a non-Bayesian test cannot do. Some findings that were statistically significant under a Frequentist t-test favored the null hypothesis when tested using Bayesian methods. And, of course, there is the famous Ioannidis JPA. Why Most Published Research Findings Are False. PLoS Medicine. 2005;2(8):e124. doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124. The difficulty is that most journals will not publish non-significant findings. This, in turn, means that a very large percentage of printed findings were due to chance.
