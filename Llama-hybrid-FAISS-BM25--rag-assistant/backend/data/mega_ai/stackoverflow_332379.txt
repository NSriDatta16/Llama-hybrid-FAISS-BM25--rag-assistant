The writer of the database probably did a sql = "SELECT * FROM STUDENTS WHERE (STUDENT_NAME = '" + student_name + "') AND other stuff"; execute(sql); If student_name is the one given, that does the selection with the name "Robert" and then drops the table. The "-- " part changes the rest of the given query into a comment.
