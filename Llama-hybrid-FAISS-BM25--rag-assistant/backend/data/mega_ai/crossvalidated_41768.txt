There is a very good survey of active learning by Burr Settles that would be a good starting point in answering this question. Also of interest is an open active learning challenge that was organised for AISTATS and WCII conferences, the proceedings are available here . I provided some of the baseline results for the challenge, and a simple approach based on linear (kernel) ridge regression with random active learning (i.e. just pick the next sample from the pool at random) would have finished in second place had I actually competed. I suspect this is because it is difficult to strike a good balance between exploration and exploitation (see my paper in the proceedings on the baseline methods).
