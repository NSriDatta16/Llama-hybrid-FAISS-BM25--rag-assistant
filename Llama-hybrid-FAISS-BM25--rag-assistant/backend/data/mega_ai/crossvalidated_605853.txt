Firstly, I think the derivation in the 1D case doesn't match with the description of the problem given as it says that $q_i$ decreases with $i$ which means you are likely to keep on adding urns which doesn't make sense with steady state probabilities decreasing with $i$ . Assuming you have a solution for the 1D case for the given description, the following might work One possibility is to change your state space to also include n. Specifically, if you take the state space to be $\mathcal{S} = \mathbb{N}^n$ where the markov chain being in a state $\vec{x} = (x_1 , \ldots , x_n )$ represents that currently you have $x_i$ urns with $i$ balls (I am guessing this is the multi in the multi-dimensional asked in the title). Now you can define the transitions in a more refined way. Let $S(\vec{x})$ denote the sum of all the components of $\vec{x}$ . Then from what I understand in the question, we require that the chain be irreducible and the steady state probabilities satisfy $$\Sigma_{\{\vec{x} | S(\vec{x})= k\}} \pi_{\vec{x}} = \frac{1}{k!} e^{-1} = \pi_k $$ From state $\vec{x}$ and denoting $S(\vec{x})$ by $k$ , with probability $1-q_k$ we add a new urn $\textit{i.e}$ $$(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \xrightarrow{1-q_k} (x_1+1, \ldots, x_n)$$ Next in the remaining probability $q_k$ we choose an urn uniformly at random and either add or remove a ball at random. This implies that $$ \vec{x} \longrightarrow \begin{cases} (x_1-1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) & \textrm{w.p } (x_1/2k).q_k \\ (x_1-1, x_2+1, \ldots, x_n) & \textrm{w.p } (x_1/2k).q_k \\ (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{i-1}+1,x_{i}-1, \ldots, x_n) & \textrm{w.p } (x_i/2k).q_k \; \forall \, 2\leqslant i \leqslant n \\ (x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{i}-1,x_{i+1}+1, \ldots, x_n) & \textrm{w.p } (x_i/2k).q_k \; \forall \, 2\leqslant i It should be clear that the chain defined this way is irreducible and aperiodic over $\mathcal{S}$ . Now defining $$\pi_{\vec{x}} = \frac{\binom{k}{x_1, \ldots, x_n}}{n^k} \pi_k$$ I think will satisfy the detailed balance equations
