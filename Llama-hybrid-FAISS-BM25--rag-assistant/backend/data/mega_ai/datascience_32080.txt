a(i) : the average distance between 'i' and all other data within the same cluster ( source ) b(i) : the lowest average distance of 'i' to all points in any other cluster, of which 'i' is not a member ( source ) So, from the question, a(i) will be 24 as point 'Pi' belongs to cluster A and b(i) will be 48 as it is the least average distance that 'Pi' has from any other cluster than A (to which it belongs). So, as a(i)
