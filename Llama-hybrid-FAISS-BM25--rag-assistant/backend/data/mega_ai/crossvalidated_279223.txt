What exactly is neural network learning?

I am a newbie to ML. I was reading about neural networks and was confused about the learning part of the network. Say there are some classes of images $c_1$ to $c_{k}$ and a neural network is trying to learn to classify a given image into these classes. Further assume that it achieved a very good accuracy(99.999%, whatever). So what exactly did it learn? Did it learn the a very good approximation to the distributions of each of $c_i$? If yes, then why do we need GANs to generate new data instead of just sampling (somehow) from this network? If not, without having any idea about the distributions of $c_i$, how is the network able to distinguish the images?
