Difference-in-differences regression in R: validity, assumptions, and correct usage

I am currently writing one of my first empirical papers. As a side note, the topic is the effect of a CEO change on financial performance. Conceptually, I decided on the DiD approach, as I have a matrix of four groups: pre and post deal, as well as CEO change and no change. Using dummy variables, this is rather easy to implement in R. Now, I am just wondering if this makes sense, which assumptions I should check / write about checking, and if my implementation in R makes sense. About the data: I aggregated financial data pre and post deal to single values such as averages because I need one value only per group for this to work. Then I ran many regression models for different dependent variables and with a varying number of control variables for rigidity. The effect I am looking for is described by my constructed interaction variable of the two dummies. Also, I use the plm function with "within" model estimation. Does all this make sense so far, especially the last part about the implementation? I think including an intercept with lm instead of plm doesn't really make sense here, also it would absorb most of the effect as I only have two time periods and two groups. My R code for an example model looks something like this: did Honestly, I read through a lot of blog posts and questions on here but got a little overwhelmed and confused about what makes sense and what doesn't, so a short: "looks fine to me" would be enough for me as an answer. Also, the time variable is automatically excluded in the stargazer output as I noticed, plus the interaction variable when only indirectly including it via * and the two dummies is unfortunately only named as the time variable, I think because stargazer somehow cuts off everything before the last $ . Also, I am unsure about how to include the output as I have quite a lot of regression tables. Does it make sense to only show significant ones and push the rest to the appendix for referral?
