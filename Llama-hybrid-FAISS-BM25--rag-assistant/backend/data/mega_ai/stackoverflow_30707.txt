@thomas -- Amazingly Microsoft's own Windows Vista User Experience Guidelines agree with you ... While having a background window flash its taskbar button is better than having it automatically come to the top and steal input focus, flashing taskbar buttons are still very intrusive. It is hard for users to concentrate when a taskbar button is flashing, so you should assume that users will immediately stop what they are doing to make the flashing stop. Consequently, reserve taskbar flashing only for situations where immediate attention is required. Of course who knows who actually follows those guidelines ... or who even reads them. :)
