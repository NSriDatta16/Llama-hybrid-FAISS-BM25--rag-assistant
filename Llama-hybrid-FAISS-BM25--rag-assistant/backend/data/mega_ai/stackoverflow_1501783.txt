Excel Package is an open-source (GPL) component for reading/writing Excel 2007 files. I used it on a small project, and the API is straightforward. The source code also seems well-organized and easy to get around (if you need to expand functionality or fix minor issues as I did). You can use either approach (customizing a template or creating everything from scratch). Customizing is much easier if you want the result to look nice.
