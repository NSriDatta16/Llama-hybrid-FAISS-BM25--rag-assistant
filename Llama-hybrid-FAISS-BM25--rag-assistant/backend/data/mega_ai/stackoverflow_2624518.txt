Formula to follow addition of rows

New to VBA, please help. My apologies. I have not done a good job of making myself clear. Let me try one more time. My sales reps enter every call into a call sheet. They call on 50-60 people a week; some they will see more than once a week, some only a couple of times a year. On this call sheet are 4 columns; date of call, customer, numerical date, and days since last call. This sheet may have hundreds of rows, many are duplicate customers called on a different date. I have written code that will eliminate duplicates as needed (works fine). New calls are added using NextRow=_ (also works fine). $C$2 is set at TODAY() . Formula in column C is $C10=$A10 (Column C is formatted to number). Column D is number of days since last call; $C$2-$C10 etc. Simple and works fine. Issue is that say I have 50 rows (all different customers) sorted ascending and a new customer is added, key being new. I need the formulas in C and D to drop down one row automatically when the new customer is added. I can drag the formulas down a head of time and everything will work until I sort, then my data is a the bottom of my sort because all rows in column A without a date will produce a 0 in both C and D. My finished product should be a range of different customers (no duplicates); with the customer that has not been called on the longest at the top. I hope this is a better explanation. Can I write code to ignore the 0's?
