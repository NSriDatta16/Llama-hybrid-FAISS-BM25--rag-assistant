Calculating confidence intervals for a logistic regression

I'm using a binomial logistic regression to identify if exposure to has_x or has_y impacts the likelihood that a user will click on something. My model is the following: fit = glm(formula = has_clicked ~ has_x + has_y, data=df, family = binomial()) This the output from my model: Call: glm(formula = has_clicked ~ has_x + has_y, family = binomial(), data = active_domains) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -0.9869 -0.9719 -0.9500 1.3979 1.4233 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.504737 0.008847 -57.050 As each coefficient is significant, using this model I'm able to tell what the value of any of these combinations is using the following approach: predict(fit, data.frame(has_x = TRUE, has_y=TRUE), type = "response") I don't understand how I can report on the Std. Error of the prediction. Do I just need to use $1.96*SE$ ? Or do I need to convert the $SE$ using an approach described here ? If I want to understand the standard-error for both variables how would I consider that? Unlike this question , I am interested in understanding what the upper and lower bounds of the error are in a percentage. For example, of my prediction shows a value of 37% for True,True can I calculate that this is $+/- 0.3%$ for a $95\% CI$ ? (0.3% chosen to illustrate my point)
