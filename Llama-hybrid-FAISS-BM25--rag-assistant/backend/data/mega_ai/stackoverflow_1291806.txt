iPhone dev view swapping

So I'm trying to find out the best way to swap views for an iPhone game I'm making. I have a "root view controller" that has a reference to all the view controllers I want to swap between. So I add the main menu view to this root view controller - [self.view addSubview:mainMenuController.view]; - Then in the main menu view I have an instructions button. I define an IBAction in the mainMenuController to respond to the instructions button being clicked. From there, I call [self.view removeFromSuperview] which works great. It gets rid of the main menu. So next I want to add the instructions view. I figured that it would be as simple as [super.view addSubview:super.instructionsController.view], but no luck! I've thought of a few ways to get around this, but they all seem very inelegant, as I would like to keep all references to my view controllers in one place, the root view controller. Any thoughts?
