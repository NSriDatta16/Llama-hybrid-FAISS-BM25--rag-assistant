My gut feeling is that you're simply fill-rate bound. How many pixels do your 100 sprites cover ? The GPU has a limited capacity of computing pixels (especially with blending on - you have alpha you said- since it requires reading and writing the framebuffer). And if you generate too many of them, your frame rate will suffer dramatically. the worst case for you would be that each sprite covers your whole screen, incurring ~100x the total pixel count of your screen. (that 100x is what we call the overdraw factor). Another alternative is that you're shader bound. What does your fragment shader do ? What happens if you replace it with a simple constant color output ? I don't think that the geometry submission has anything to do with your perf issues (not for 100 sprites). Bottom line is, to look at performance, you want to use performance analysis tools. I don't code myself against the ipad. Does the SDK provide any tool to analyze perf ?
