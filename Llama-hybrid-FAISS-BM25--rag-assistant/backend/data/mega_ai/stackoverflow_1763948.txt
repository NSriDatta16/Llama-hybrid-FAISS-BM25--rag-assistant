I think the advise anytime you need to access a field in a link table is to make the link table an object and a hibernate entity in its own right. A would have a set of AtoB objects and AtoB would have a set of B objects. I have a simmilar situation where the link table has a user associated with the link. select joinTable.b from A a left join a.AtoB joinTable where joinTable.group = 'C' It's not as elegant as having an implicit join done by hibernate, but it does give you the control you need.
