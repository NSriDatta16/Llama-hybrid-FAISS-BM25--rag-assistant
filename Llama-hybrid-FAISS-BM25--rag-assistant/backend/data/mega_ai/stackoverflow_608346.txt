A bit left-field of your question, but if storage is a concern you may want to look into Huffman compression . For example, 00000001 could be squeezed down by frequency to something equivalent to {(7)0, (1)1} . A more "randomized" string 00111010 would require a more complex representation, e.g. {(2)0, (3)1, (1)0, (1)1, (1)0} , and take up more space. Depending on the structure of your bit data, you may get some storage benefit from its use, beyond BitSet .
