Alter Table Drop Column Failed

I'm trying to clean up a database table and I'd really like to drop two columns as they should no longer be being used. 'Property' table - Unable to modify table. The index '_dta_index_Property_7_669245439__K1_K9_K8_K24_K4_2_5_6_13_22_25_26_29' is dependent on column 'AveragePriceMta'. The index '_dta_index_Property_7_669245439__K1_K9_K8_K24_2_4_5_6_7_13_22_25_26_29' is dependent on column 'AveragePriceMta'. ALTER TABLE DROP COLUMN AveragePriceMta failed because one or more objects access this column. I've gone and looked at the indexes for this table found the particular columns I want to delete in a greyed out field of "Included columns". Obviously I don't want to just drop these indexes - but is there a way to refresh the index so that I can remove the columns in question out of the non-editable included columns field? Using SQL Server 2008 but database is 2005.. in case that matters. Thanks for your help! :)
