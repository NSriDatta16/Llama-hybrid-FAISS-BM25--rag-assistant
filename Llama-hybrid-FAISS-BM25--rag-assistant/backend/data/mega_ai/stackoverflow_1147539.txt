Ideas for UI design for editing organizational hierarchies

I am working on an Rails app which has an admin section for setting up organisations. The hierarchy of which is: Organisation Area Office Division Department I have used ActiveScaffold to knock together something really quick, but it makes for a pretty horrid UI. To edit/add a department, I have find the organisation in the table, click a link that opens a nested table of the approriate Area Offices, click another link and get another nested table, finally click one more link to get the Department table. I wonder if there are any better ideas for the appropriate design of this UI?
