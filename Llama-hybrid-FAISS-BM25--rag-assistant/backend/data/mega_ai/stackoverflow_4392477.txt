Best Practices to add meta data to a site in SharePoint Foundation 2010

Scenario I want to create a SharePoint sites (dynamically) for a number of events. Each event has a corresponding ID associated with it along with other corresponding fields. Each site will have a number of custom web parts that will need to reference those fields, particularly the ID. When I create the sites dynamically, I need to assign that ID to the site so that the web parts "know" which site it is. I could always parse the URL (the ID is in the URL) but I would prefer a more elegant solution. Any best practices or ideas out there that you have done to achieve this?
