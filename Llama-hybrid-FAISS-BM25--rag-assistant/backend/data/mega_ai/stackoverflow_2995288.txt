solving an equation where some unknowns must be integers

Solve for s , and t 1 … t n that minimizes the following summation: Σ n k = 1 (1 - min( s · t k , C k )/max( s · t k , C k )), where C 1 … C n > 1, s > 0, t 1 … t n ∈ ℤ + edit to clarify to problem description: "how fast of an algorithm you require." Not super fast (But not multiple seconds). n will be around 5-10 or so. As far as the actual problem, I have a number of "elements" of different sizes on a "page" and this page needs to be translated to a format in which there is a maximum base size for an element of X, and the base size of an element has to be an integer. However in the new format any element can be scaled up by a single scaling factor set for the page. So C 1 ...C n were the sizes of the elements on the original page. t 1 ...t n are the new integer sizes in the new page format. (And t 1 ...t n need to be less than X.) The scaling factor for the new page format is s. More: As far as what I've done previously, I find the largest element on the original page, and if its smaller than X, I just use the existing element sizes on the new page, but rounding each one to an integer. However, If the largest element on the original page is greater than X, I divide its size by X to get the scaling factor s for the new page, and divide C 1 ...C n by s to get t 1 ...t n . But this results in size discrepancies of something like 1-3% on average for every element on the new page but the largest. Not really all that noticeable, but I'm a perfectionist.
