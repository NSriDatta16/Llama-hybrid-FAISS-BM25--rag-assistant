We're building exactly what you described, and we're using L2S to do it. Agreed that the relationship between the DAL and BLL is a bit fuzzy, but we have a distinct BLL and a distinct DAL. All our logic is in the BLL and all data retrieval/modification is done via calls to the DAL (using LINQ calls). Our app uses no typed datasets. We've built entity classes to represent our objects. Now that I've spent a couple months building part of this, I don't see us (me) ever going back to datasets. Also, I wouldn't get hung up on L2S being "aimed at rapid development". This makes it sound like a prototyping tool. We're finding it to be an industrial strength tool. This might be contrary to what Microsoft might now be saying about it, since they would rather people use EF. Randy
