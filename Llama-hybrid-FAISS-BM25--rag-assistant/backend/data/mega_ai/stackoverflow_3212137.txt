As of Java 6, you can use java.text.Normalizer: public String unaccent(String s) { String normalized = Normalizer.normalize(s, Normalizer.Form.NFD); return normalized.replaceAll("[^\\p{ASCII}]", ""); } Note that in Java 5 there is also a sun.text.Normalizer , but its use is strongly discouraged since it's part of Sun's proprietary API and has been removed in Java 6.
