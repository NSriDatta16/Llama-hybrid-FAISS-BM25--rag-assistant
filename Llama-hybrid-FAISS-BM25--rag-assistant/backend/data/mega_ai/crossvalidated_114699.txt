Instead of splitting into 9 groups of 1,000 it's better to split into 9 groups of 8,000 where each sample is missing from exactly one of the nine groups. Then you can test each sample on the other 8 networks for which it was not used as a training example. I'm not sure that it would be more accurate this way. 5a. Some neural networks can't output anything higher than 1.0 or less than 0. It's easier for the network to output a 0.9 instead. This may not apply to your case depending on how the network is set up. 5b. I'm not sure that the exactly 600 category would happen enough for there to be enough training examples. But you could certainly create three different ranges, i.e. below 550, 550-650 and above 650 5c. It will output fractions. You can round to the nearest one. Sometimes you set it up to have multiple output neurons corresponding to the different output categories and you just choose the one with the highest response.
