I actually just fixed a problem similar to this, except with pipes ( Is php's fopen incompatible with the POSIX open for pipes ). I don't know to what extent the solution would be similar, but maybe worth a look? I agree with RageD that you should stick a cout between the read and write lines just to test and see if the C++ is hanging on the sock >> data line or the sock
