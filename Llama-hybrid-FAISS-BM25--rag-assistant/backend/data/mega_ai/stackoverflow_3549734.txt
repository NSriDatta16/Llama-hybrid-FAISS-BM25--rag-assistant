For a while, I was using this: http://talkingandroid.com/2009/11/04/droiddrop-remote-logging-for-android/ It uses a "drop" at http://drop.io to send any info you want. It's not perfect, but it did the job reasonably well until my drop got too large. If this is something that's rather rare, it should be fine. My app was sending too many of them for exceptions that didn't matter all that much, and my user base grew more rapidly than I expected. Now I can't view my drop. Their system seems to have some scaling issues. Once I revamp my error reporting to only send useful info, I'll probably give it another try.
