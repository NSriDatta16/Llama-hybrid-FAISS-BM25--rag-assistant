How do I detect bots programmatically

We have a situation where we log visits and visitors on page hits and bots are clogging up our database. We can't use captcha or other techniques like that because this is before we even ask for human input, basically we are logging page hits and we would like to only log page hits by humans. Is there a list of known bot IP out there? Does checking known bot user-agents work?
