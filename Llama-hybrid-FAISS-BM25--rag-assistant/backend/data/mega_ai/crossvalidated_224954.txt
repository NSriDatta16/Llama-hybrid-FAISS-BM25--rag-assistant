Comparing the degree of similarity between groups

I have three groups A, B and C and I want to prove that similarity between group B and group A is significantly higher than between group B and group C. How to prove it? Simple example: I have three groups of people from three countries Albania (A), Belarus (B) and China (C). I have information about their weights. It occurs that the average weight of Belarussians is the highest, Albanians are thinner, Chinese are the thinnest. I can check using ANOVA or a non-parametrical test that there are significant differences among groups. Additionally I may check that Belarussians are significantly fatter than Albanians and significantly fatter than Chinese. The question is how can I prove that the weight of Albanians is significantly more similar to Belarussians than the weight of Chinese? Of course with just one attribute I can check if Albanians are significantly fatter than Chinese and – if so – it means that they are significantly closer to Belarussians. But is it the only way? And what if it occurs that there are no significant differences between A and C? Now, let’s say that I have two attributes: weight and height. It can be checked that there are significant differences between groups when taking into account both attributes. The question is how can I prove with this attributes that Belarussians and Albanians are more similar to each other than Chinese. This time there are two axes and each person is just a point in two dimensional space so there is no easy answer that A is between B and C as it was in the case of one attribute. I calculate average values of attributes for every group and check Euclidean distances between these three “averaged persons” and it occurs that the distance between B and A is smaller than between B and C. But how to check the significance of this result? Like in the sample picture - how to prove that group A is significantly more similar to B than C to B?
