You don't say why you chose the average linkage method, but since you are only doing that step to generate starting values for k means, the choice of method in the first step might not be very important. Ward's method, also available in the SPSS CLUSTER procedure, may scale better to larger datasets. If the dataset for the first stage turns out to be too large, you could take a random sample to calculate the initial cluster centers. HTH, Jon Peck
