Bayesian testing that one parameter is larger than another

In a Bayesian setting and given data $D$ I want to test the hypothesis that $$H_0: \theta_2 \le \theta_1$$ against alternative $H_1: \theta_2 > \theta_1$. Assume I can only sample from the posterior distributions, e.g. with MCMC. In particular I can sample from the posteriors $p(\theta_2|D)$ and $p(\theta_1|D)$. In a simple situation we could think of the $\theta$ as group means of two independent samples $D_1$ and $D_2$. But in my particular case $\theta$ are different functions $f$ and $g$ applied on partly the same variables, so $\theta_1 = f(Y)$ and $\theta_2 = g(X,Y)$. So I suppose $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are correlated. Is there a way to evaluate the probabilitiy the hypotheses are true using just the posterior samples?
