How can I get the HTTP status and Location header in Perl?

I'm new to Perl but need to use it on a project I'm working on. What I need to do is check to see if a URL has a 301 redirect and if it has, get the location. The following told me the code but not the location: use strict; use warnings; require LWP::UserAgent; my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; $ua->timeout(10); $ua->env_proxy; $ua->max_redirect(0); my $response = $ua->get('http://www.actwebdesigns.co.uk/'); if ($response->is_success) { print $response->status_line; print $response->progress; } else { die $response->status_line; } does anyone know how to get the location? Regards, Phil
