Regex help: capture an entire line if it starts with a 1. or 2.

I'm awful at regexes, but would love some help defining a rule that would take this text: Il Cuccio, via Ronchi 43/b, 14047 Mombercelli, Asti. Tel: 380 7277050 Fax: 0141 959282 E-mail: info@ilcuccio.it www.ilcuccio.it Accommodation in communal room or tent. French and English spoken. Contact: Cristina Belotti. Apicoltura Leida Barbara, Strada Crevenzolo 21, Viguzzolo, 15058 Alessandria. Tel: 0131 899166 & 392 9078020 E-mail: barbaraleida@tiscali.it The farm, situated in the plains, is certified organic (CCPB). and return the addresses, that is, the rest of the line past [1-9]. Extra points for a coherent explanation that would actually help me learn a tad. EDIT : I'll show my work as I go, until someone else steps in. Right now I have ^\d+\. which is a startline, digits, period.
