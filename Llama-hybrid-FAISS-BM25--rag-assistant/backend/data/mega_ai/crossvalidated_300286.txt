You're looking for eigenvector that corresponds to first singular value. The problem with retrieving indices of its nonzero entries will most likely be that most or all entries are nonzero. That is because how PCA works - it finds the rotation of feature space such that its coordinates explain variance best along orthogonal directions. Sparse PCA is used to retrieve sparse directions that explain the data best, with some constraints. Sparse PCA is available for example in scikit-learn. You can also try to play with H2O's GLRM which is available in both R an Python.
