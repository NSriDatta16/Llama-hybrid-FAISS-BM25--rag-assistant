This question is not actually specific to time series. For convenience I will use the same examples (time series a,b,c) in the question but I will ignore periodicity in the answer; including it makes no difference. Imagine that time series (a) increases by 1 unit every time step i.e. it is a perfectly straight line with no error. Now imagine that time series (b) decreases by 1 unit every time step i.e. again, a perfectly straight line with no error. If time series (c) is simply the sum of (a) and (b), then it is simply a flat line. (a) and (b) would give you significant regression results. (c) would not.
