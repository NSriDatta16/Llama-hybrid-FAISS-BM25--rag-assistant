I see there are two parts while handling machine learning in practice Engineering ( which covers all the algorithms, learning different packages, programming). Curiosity/Reasoning (ability to ask better questions to data). I think 'curiosity/reasoning' is the skill which distinguishes one from others. For example, if you see the leader boards of the kaggle completions, many people may have used common(similar) algorithms, what makes the difference is, how one logically question the data and formulate it.
