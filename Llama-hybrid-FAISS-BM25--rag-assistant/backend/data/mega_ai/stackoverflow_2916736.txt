TFS Disk Structure - and "Add new folder" vs "Add solution"

Our organization recently got TFS 2008 set up ready for our use. I have a practice TeamProject available to play with. To simplify slightly, we previous organized our code on disk like this: -EC - Main - Database - someScript1.sql - someScript2.sql - Documents - ReleaseNotes_V1.doc - Source - Common - Company.EC.Common.Biztalk.Artifacts [folder] - Company.EC.Common.BizTalk.Components [folder] - Company.EC.Common.Biztalk.Deployment [folder] - Company.EC.BookTransfer.BizTalk.sln - BookTransfer - Company.EC.BookTransfer.BizTalk.Artifacts [folder] - Company.EC.BookTransfer.BizTalk.Components [folder] - Company.EC.BookTransfer.BizTalk.Components.UnitTest [folder] - Company.EC.BookTransfer.BizTalk.Deployment [folder] - Company.EC.BookTransfer.BizTalk.sln I'm trying to decide, do I want to check in the entire c:\EC directory? Or do I want to open each solution and checkin. What are the pros and cons of each? It seems like by doing the "Add Files/Folder" option, I could check in everything at once and it would match the disk structure. It also looks like that if I check in each solution separately, that creates another working folder in my Workspace. I think if I check in by "add files/folder", I will have one workspace and that would be better. But most of the books and samples I see talk about checking in projects and solutions. P.S. I know I need to add more to my disk structure in accordance with the Branch/Merge guidelines, but that is not the question I'm asking here. Thanks, Neal Walters
