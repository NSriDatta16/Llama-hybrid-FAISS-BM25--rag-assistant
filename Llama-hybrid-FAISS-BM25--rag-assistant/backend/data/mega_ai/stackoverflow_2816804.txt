design question for transportation agency/workflow system

I am designing a transportation agency/workflow system, and it including 3 types of people, customer who requests to transport some stuff, drivers who deliver the stuff, and truck manager who manages transport source/destination truck coordination and communicates/organizes drivers. The system is expected to be a web site, and 3 kinds of people could use the web site to submit request, accept request, monitor status of specific stuff transportation, etc. The web site is more like an open agency or a workflow system. I am wondering whether there are any existing technologies, tools or projects (better to be open source, but not a must) which I could build my application faster based on? I prefer to use .Net technologies, but not a must. thanks in advance, George
