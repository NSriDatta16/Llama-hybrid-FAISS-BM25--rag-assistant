Multiplying means and calculating variance

I have multiplied together two means and now want to calculate the overall standard deviation. The two means and standard deviation are here: 13.7 +/- 12.7 (1SD) and 4.0 +/- 2.6 (1SD). So the answer would be 55.11 with what overall standard deviation? I then want to multiply this answer of 55.1 by 92. There is no standard deviation attached to this because it is 92 days. Does the standard deviation stay the same as the answer for question 1? Edit: My overall goal is looking at seed dispersal in the dry season. There are around 13 seeds in a poo and they poo around 4 times a day. That tells me the number of seeds dispersed on average per day. By multiplying that by 92 it gives a rough indication of the number of seeds dispersed across the dry season. This hasn't previously been studied before, it's not designed to be overly accurate but demonstrate the importance of mutualism in seed dispersal.
