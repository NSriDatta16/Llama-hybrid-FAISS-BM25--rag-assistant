UILongPressGestureRecognizer is what you need. For example, UILongPressGestureRecognizer *longPress_gr = [[UILongPressGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self action:@selector(doAction:)]; [longPress_gr setMinimumPressDuration:2]; // triggers the action after 2 seconds of press [yourButton addGestureRecognizer:longPress_gr]; To let your action get triggered only once(ie., when the 2 seconds duration is over), make sure you have your doAction: method looks something like this, - (void)doAction:(UILongPressGestureRecognizer *)recognizer { if (recognizer.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan) { // Your code here } }
