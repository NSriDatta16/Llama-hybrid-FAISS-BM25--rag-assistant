You can't transform a problem from time series to cross-sectional. Let's get that out of the way. What you can do is to apply to time series problems the techniques that are typically associated with cross sectional analysis. For instance, a typical OLS problem is cross-sectional, because some of its assumptions are reasonable for many cross-sectional cases. Particularly, independence of error terms from regressors. Consider sales $S_i$ in stores $i$ . You can often argue that in a model $S_i=X_i\beta+\varepsilon_i$ , the errors $\varepsilon_i$ are not correlated with the predictors $X_i$ . This is especially easy to argue with random sampling and experiments, where you randomly pick the order and subjects into your sample or control the values of regressors $X_i$ . Note, that when the sampling is not random or when the regressors are not controlled, even the cross-sectional regression becomes difficult. Such is the case of business forecasting. For instance, it is not always possible to control some predictors for the retails stores such as the outside weather. You get the weather that was that day, you can't set the outside temperature and humidity to your liking. With time series the problems become even more difficult because the observations are ordered in time, they can't be random in that sense anymore. This poses difficulties to application of OLS. However, under certain conditions it is still possible to apply OLS to time series, then it is called "time series regression." So, how do you apply cross-sectional tools to time series? You convert the time series data into the format that is expected by cross sectional tools. Suppose, that you think the sales are according to the following model: $$S_t=c+\phi S_{t-1}+X_t\beta_t+\varepsilon_t$$ In this case you re-write it like this: $$S_i=X'_i\beta'_i+\varepsilon_i$$ Here you have design matrix matrix $X'_i=[1, S_{i-1}, X_i]$ , that contains with the predictors a column of past sales of the store. This allows us to apply the OLS to time series. One thing to note that as I wrote earlier simply applying cross-sectional tools to time series problem doesn't make it right to do so. When you recast your problem as cross-sectional you must ensure that the assumptions underlying the tool are still valid, and this is not always the case.
