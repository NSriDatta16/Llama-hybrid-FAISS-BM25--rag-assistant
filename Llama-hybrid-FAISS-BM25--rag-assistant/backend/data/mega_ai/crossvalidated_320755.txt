How do you account for suppressed values in a time series regression?

I'm analysing time series data of monthly traffic fatalities in several US states, but have come upon a problem with suppressed values. The data come from CDC WONDER, and cells with any value less than 10 are automatically suppressed. As many of the states are small, they often include suppressed values. To conduct my regression, I've assigned them as NA (essentially, treated as missing) but this clearly isn't the best approach. What's the best way to account for suppressed values in a time series regression? I'm using R with gls() from the nlme package, if that helps frame the question.
