How go get everything from between parenthesis in PHP?

Array( [1] => put returns (between) paragraphs [2] => (for) linebreak (add) 2 spaces at end [3] => indent code by 4 (spaces!) [4] => to make links ) Want to get text inside brackets (for each value): take only first match remove this match from the value write all matches to new array After function arrays should look like: Array( [1] => put returns paragraphs [2] => linebreak (add) 2 spaces at end [3] => indent code by 4 [4] => to make links ) Array( [1] => between [2] => for [3] => spaces! [4] => ) What is the solution?
