Can I use Adaptive MCMC in any setting?

In time series econometrics and finance, most Bayesian authors approximate their models with a Gibbs Sampler, this is especial true for state space models, SV and so forth. The dimensionality of these problems ranges from 3-20 parameters. The thing is, that for some of the more complex time series models, I find that writing the Gibbs sampling algorithm, or trying to find out how to use good built-ins to implement it, is much more labor intensive than simply writing a likelihood and prior, taking a good guesstimate for the proposal covariance matrix, and giving the whole thing to a function like Metro_Hastings from the library MHadaptive , not to mention that you are no longer restricted to conjugate priors. For these time series models, what are the potential consequences of using Adaptive Metropolis Hastings in place of a Gibbs sampler?
