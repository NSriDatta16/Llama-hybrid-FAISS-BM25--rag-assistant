Sure, This is possible with some programming effort. I work with transaction data a lot. There are two approaches that i have used. Unfortunately there is no standard procedures that is available. Approach 1 (Pattern known a priori): If you interested in finding a priori pattern like trend up trend down, then you could use a similarity analysis or a classification problem, click here for an example implementation in SAS with Proc Similarity. There are 6 types of pattern that you can notice in the transnational data sets and I have used in the past: Increasing trend Decreasing trend Level Shift up Level shift down Spike Up or Down no pattern You could also use neural network to train the 6 patterns and then apply the trained network to your transnational data. See below for these patterns. Approach 2 (Pattern not known a priori) If you do not have a priori pattern, then you would want to use AI techniques based on clustering such as neural networks, kohonen networks etc. to let the method automatically find and cluster similar patterns such as trend increase/down etc. Based on my experience, approach 1 is better than approach 2. If you are intrested in a worked out example, I can post a link to a paper. Hope this is helpful.
