I suppose you could try a a one-way ANOVA or non parametric Kruskal-Wallis H test. A logistic regression might be useful too. These are quite common approaches to look a the relationship between one categorical (i.e day of the week / hour of the day) vs one continuous variable (i.e. Temperature) Hope this helps!
