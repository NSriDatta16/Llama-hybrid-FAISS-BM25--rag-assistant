I don't think there is any particular significance, beyond its appearing as the example 'expires' date in RFC 1945: Hypertext Transfer Protocol -- HTTP/1.0 dated May 1996. At least some of the text would have been written much earlier, indeed RFC 1738: Uniform Resource Locators (URL) is dated December 1994. At the time of writing it would have been a reasonable example value. In the same way the 'date' header example in the RFC 'Tue, 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT', is prevalent in the web. The two values together form a consistent example. In RFC 1945 there's no mention of a specific default value, however it states Note: Applications are encouraged to be tolerant of bad or misinformed implementations of the Expires header. A value of zero (0) or an invalid date format should be considered equivalent to an "expires immediately." Although these values are not legitimate for HTTP/1.0, a robust implementation is always desirable. Implementors of servers will have read the RFC - they'd need to in order to know what to implement - and picked up the example date given, and used it.
