what is a good measure of goodness of fit for survival models that can be used for comparison between models?

I don't see any of such measure in the output from coxph() in R (Cox proportional Hazard model). Is there a goodness of fit measure for survival models similar to R2 for linear regression? Update: Actually I found a measure called "concordance" from the coxph() output, which might be what I need. What does this measure mean? My plan is the following: After initial data cleaning, use random forest to select important variables that predict time to event. However, random forest does not give a risk classification model that can be easily applied in practice. I will then work on the important variables and their interactions in a Cox proportional hazard model to build a model with good fit. Let me know if this sounds right and if you have any suggestion.
