As I understand it (and I could be wrong), you can't use a subform in a subform on a main form without problems. It's better to organize your data and forms so that if you need to view more detailed information on data presented in a subform - it's better to call a new form from a button on the subform, passing a value to it so it pulls the correct record to view. This would, of course, require you to store this subform of the subform data in a related table - then just relate it back to the main database with a unique identifier. This allows you a bit better means to organize your data, indexing isn't a pain, and you don't repeat information entry as much.
