Drupal wizard form: Validation and previous button

In my drupal6 site I have wizard form. I implemented it with FormAPI using form storage and the rebuild property. My form validation is being done with the #required property and with functions in the #element_validate property. It's working fine but for one thing, when I click on the previous button the form is being validated and I don't want it to. Is there a smart and right way to disable the validations when a specific button of the form is clicked?
