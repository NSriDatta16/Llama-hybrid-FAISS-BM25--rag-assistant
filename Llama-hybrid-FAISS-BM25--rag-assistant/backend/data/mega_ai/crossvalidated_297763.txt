Yes, the logit link can be interpreted like that. It's just not a change in "odds" (= ratio of probabilities) but a change in a ratio of proportions. More formally, the model equation for the expectation is the same as in logistic regression: $$ \mathrm{logit}(\mu_i) = x_i^\top \beta $$ where $\mu_i = \mathrm{E}(y_i)$. For your setup this means: $$ \begin{eqnarray*} \mathrm{logit}(\mathrm{E}(\mathtt{Proportion})) & = & -1.31 + 0.004 \cdot \mathtt{Temperature} \\ \frac{\mathrm{E}(\mathtt{Proportion})}{1 - \mathrm{E}(\mathtt{Proportion})} & = & \exp(-1.31 + 0.004 \cdot \mathtt{Temperature}) \end{eqnarray*} $$ Thus, an absolute 1-unit change in $\mathtt{Temperature}$ leads to a relative change of $\exp(0.004) \approx 0.4\%$ in $\mathrm{E}(\mathtt{Proportion})/(1 - \mathrm{E}(\mathtt{Proportion}))$. With a bit of practice you can get a reasonable feeling for what this means in the actual expected $\mathtt{Proportion}$. If you don't have that feeling (yet), you can easily compute the effects of the changes in $\mathtt{Temperature}$, e.g.,: nd to check what the absolute changes in Proportion are for certain absolute changes in TEMPERATURE .
