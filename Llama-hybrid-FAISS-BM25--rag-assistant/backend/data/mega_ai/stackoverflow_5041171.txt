What is the easiest way to replicate the tags textbox that is used in the stackoverflow questions page

i am building a asp.net-mvc website and i want to support tagging on each page. I want to exactly replicate the inteface and UI that is used on stackoverflow (include both behavior and layout, css). What is the easiest way to leverage this. is there some jquery plugin that is used for something like this or is it homegrown?
