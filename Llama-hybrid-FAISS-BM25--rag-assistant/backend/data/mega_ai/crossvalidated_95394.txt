I dont think that Phd is required for any machine learning positions. A good masters and an inquistive mind with mathematical curiosity is all what it needs. A Phd biases your approach towards your specialization which is undesirable. I work on core Machine learning algorithms, and codes most of them in the way i want. And i have seen a lot of Phd people with the wrong mindset. Phds are mostly motivated by pure theoretical problems, unlike in industry where the focus is on working solutions in quick time
