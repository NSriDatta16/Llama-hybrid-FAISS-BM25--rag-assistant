not for nothing, but i've never seen anything like this with cf8. are you sure that you have the latest hotfix and jvm installed? this might have been something in cf8 that was fixed in 8.01. hotfix 2 for cf8.01 list of all hotfixes and updates for cf8.01 hotfix 3 for cf8 list of all hotfixes and updates for cf8 latest jvm upgrade instruction for jvm If you suspect that it's an uncaught exception causing the issue, then might I suggest logging portions of the process. Case in point, I had a similar problem with a scheduled task where it would just bottom out for no reason (never had the reschedule problem though). What I ended up doing to diagnose the problem was use cflog to write out portions of the process as they completed. This particular task too about 4 minutes to complete but ran through about 200 portions (it was a mass emailer for a bunch of clients). I logged the when the portion started and completed along with how log it took. By doing so, i could see what portion would trip up the whole process and knew where to focus my attention.
