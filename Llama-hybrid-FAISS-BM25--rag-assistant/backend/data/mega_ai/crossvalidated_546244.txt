It can be interpreted the same way as linear regression except for the log (conditional) average number of counts (or what ever your outcome is). Alternatively, you can interpret the exponential of the coefficient as the multiplicate increase in the expected number of counts if you increase the covariate associated with the coefficient by a single unit. This is true because the Poisson model is of the form: $$E[Y|X_1, X_2, X_3] = \exp \left\{aX_1 + bX_2 + c X_3 \right\} $$ and thus: $$E[Y|X_1 + 1, X_2, X_3] = \exp \left\{a(X_1+1) + bX_2 + c X_3 \right\}$$ $$ = \exp \left\{a \right\} \exp \left\{ aX_1 + bX_2 + c X_3 \right\} $$ $$= \exp \left\{a \right\}E[Y|X_1, X_2, X_3].$$ So, $$\exp \left\{a \right\} = \frac{E[Y|X_1 + 1, X_2, X_3]}{E[Y|X_1 , X_2, X_3]}$$ You can also show $$\frac{d}{dx} \frac{E[Y|X_1 + x, X_2, X_3]}{E[Y|X_1 , X_2, X_3]} \big |_{x=0} = \exp \left\{a \right\},$$ or $$ \frac{E[Y|X_1 + dx, X_2, X_3]}{E[Y|X_1 , X_2, X_3]} \approx \exp \left\{a \right\} dx,$$ which can be interpreted as the incremental multiplicative change in the expected count.
