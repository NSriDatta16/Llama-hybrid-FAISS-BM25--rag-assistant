jqueryUI droppable "drop" function firing on "over" only if i have on my draggable a "connectToSortable" option set

You can see the code on http://designvictim.com/jqueryui/index.html I'm trying to make something similar to the widget drag and drop from Wordpress. I've gotten pretty close to what we wanted to accomplish but we wanted to be able to when you drag a item out of the "Drop Area's" and drop it outside then it would erase itself and send of course an Ajax call with the updated contents. That is why i made the #body droppable. Also if you start a drag from the Module Column to one of the drop areas i wanted it to be sortable directly before dropping it and i was able to accomplish this with "connectToSortable: '.moduleContainer' " but now every time i start with an item from the module container and start dragging and hover one of the drop areas and continue to another one, the drop function of the $('#body').droppable() fires which boggles my mind! I hope its some clumsy coding of mine and not a bug of jqueryUI. Thanks in advance for any help and i hope i made myself clear on the problem.
