Microsoft SQL Server 2008 Log analysis

I have a SQL Server 2008 database with a transaction log that grows very rapidly each day. Is anyone aware of any tool that could be used to analyze in greater detail what transactions that make up the greater part of the log bulk? This so I know where to direct my attention. Any help greatly appreciated! Best regards Marcus
