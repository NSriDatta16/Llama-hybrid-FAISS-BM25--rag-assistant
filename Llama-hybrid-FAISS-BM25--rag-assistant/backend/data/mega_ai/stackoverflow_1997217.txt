Decreasing font size in rails

Im trying to achieve the following effect in rails: If the text is bigger than x characters then make it smaller, the next x characters smaller, the next character smaller, ad infinitum for example x = 7 would output the following html Lorem i psum do lor sit amet, consecte tur adip isicing and the css would be small {font-size: 95%} What is an elegant way to achieve this?
