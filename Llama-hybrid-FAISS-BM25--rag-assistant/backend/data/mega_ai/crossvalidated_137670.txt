Example of parametric and non-parametric method

I have not understood this example from wikipedia . Suppose we have a sample of 99 test scores with a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of 1. If we assume all 99 test scores are random samples from a normal distribution we predict there is a 1% chance that the 100th test score will be higher than 102.365 (that is the mean plus 2.365 standard deviations) assuming that the 100th test score comes from the same distribution as the others. How did they compute that the $1$% chance of the $100$th test score will be higher than $102.365$ ? And in non-parametric method why is maximum the estimate of the same thing of the $99$ scores ? Why maximum ? Why not the estimate is average of the $99$ scores? Why is there a $1$% chance(instead of 2%,3%,etc.) that the 100th is higher than any of the $99$ that preceded it ?
