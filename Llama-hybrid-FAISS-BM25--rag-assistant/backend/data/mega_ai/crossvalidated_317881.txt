Everywhere this question says "inflation index" it should instead say price index . Let $X_t$ be the price of some basket of food items at time $t$. Inflation $\pi_t$ (from $t-1$ to $t$) is given by the percent change in the price index from $t-1$ to $t$. $$ \pi_t = \frac{X_t - X_{t-1}}{X_{t-1}}$$ $\pi_t$ is inflation. $X_t$ is the price index (or price level). 1) If the food price index were reset to 100 in the 3rd quarter, what would be the 4th quarter price index for food? Let $Y_t = \frac{100}{X_3} X_t $. Now $Y_t$ is a rescaled version of the price index $X_t$ that is rescaled so $Y_3 = 100$. What is $Y_4$? 2) If the average family food basket costs 100 Euros at 2nd Quarter prices, how much would it cost at 3rd Quarter prices? $$ \require{cancel}100 \cancel{\text{ Q2 euros}} \cdot \frac{95 {\text{ Q3 euros}}}{97.5 \cancel{\text{ Q2 euros}}} = $$
