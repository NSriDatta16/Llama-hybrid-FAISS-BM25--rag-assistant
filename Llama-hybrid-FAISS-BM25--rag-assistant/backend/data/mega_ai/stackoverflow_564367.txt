XML Parsing Problem

I have an XML parser that crashes on incomplete XML data. So XML data fed to it could be one of the following: twocontent ( the parser treats it as two root elements ) Element attributes are also handled ( though not shown above ). Now, the problem is when I read data from socket I get data in fragments. For example: one content Thus, before sending the XML to the parser I have to construct a valid XML and send it. What programming construct ( like iteration, recursion etc ) would be the best fit for this kind of scenario. I am programming in C++. Please help.
