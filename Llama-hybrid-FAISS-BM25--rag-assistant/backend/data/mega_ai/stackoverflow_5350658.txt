Well, I never did work out the reason this occurs, but it looks like a bug somewhere in the ASP.NET page caching infrastructure which the [OutputCache] attribute uses. I ended up writing a custom [HttpCache] attribute with much the same public interface, but which calls the appropriate cache methods on the Response.Cache object directly rather than delegating to the ASP.NET page caching infrastructure. That works fine. It's a shame the built-in attribute doesn't.
