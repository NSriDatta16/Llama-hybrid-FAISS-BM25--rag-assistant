Is there a way to disable urlencoding of anchor attributes in lxml

I am using lxml 2.2.8 and trying to transform some existing html files into django templates. the only problem that i am having is that lxml urlencodes the anchor name and href attributes. for example: {{item.name}} {{item.nid}} {{item.class_one}} produces html like this: more info what I am trying for is this: more info is there a way to disable the (automatic) urlencoding that lxml is doing? here is (basically) the code I am using to generate and parse the file: from lxml import etree, html from StringIO import StringIO doc = StringIO( ''' An experiment This is an interesting paragraph detailing the inner workings of something paragraph with more info posted by: me ''') stylesheet = StringIO( ''' {{item.class_one}} {{item.nid}} {{item.name}} {{item.nid}} {{item.class_one}} ''') def parse_doc(): xsl = etree.parse(stylesheet) trans = etree.XSLT(xsl) root = html.parse(doc, etree.HTMLParser(encoding="windows-1252")) transformed = trans(root) print html.tostring(transformed) if __name__ == '__main__': parse_doc() with the exception that these files are all malformed html :)
