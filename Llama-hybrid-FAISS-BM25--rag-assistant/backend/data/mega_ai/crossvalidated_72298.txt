Proof of Theorem 7.3 in book of Probabilistic Graphical Models by Daphne Koller

I'm studying graphical models myself and reading contents about bayesian networks. When I am reading in page 371, section 8.1.4 Linear-Gaussian models, in Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, I cannot derive myself the equation of $$\mathrm{Cov}[x_i, x_j] = \sum\left(w_{jk} \mathrm{cov}[x_i,x_k]\right) + I_{ij}v_j $$ where $x_k$ are the parents of $x_j$, especially I don't know how the second term $I_{ij}v_j$ comes. I try to find the proof in other references, like in Probabilistic Graphical Models by Koller. There is a theorem 7.3 in the page 251 which states the same thing as the above equation, but it also does not supply a proof.
