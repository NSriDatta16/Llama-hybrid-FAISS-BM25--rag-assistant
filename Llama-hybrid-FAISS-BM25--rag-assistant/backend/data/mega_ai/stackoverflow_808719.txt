Contrary to what Damien said, the mouse was not invented at Xerox; rather, it was invented by team at Stanford Research Institute led by Douglas Engelbart as part of their revolutionary ONLINE system. The coloring of the buttons is an old, old convention, one that I personally tend not to pay much attention to. The odd thing about that image you posted, though, is that the right button ("yellow" in Smalltalk parlance) appears more green than yellow--at least, to me. Does it appear that way to anyone else? Perhaps this is in part why the coloring convention was dropped elsewhere (and ought similarly be abandoned in Squeak).
