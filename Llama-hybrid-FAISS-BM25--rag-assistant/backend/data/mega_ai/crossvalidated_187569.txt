Blood pressure traces have the advantage of containing a well defined nearly periodic structure. As I recall from my long-ago training in physiology there is a substantial history of frequency analysis of blood pressure traces. So you might consider an application of time series frequency analysis. The artifacts seem to have either much lower or much higher frequency components (flat resp. noisy traces) than the normal blood pressure traces do, so detecting breaks over time in the frequency components of the signal might work well. See the Frequency Analysis and the Decomposition and Filtering sections of the CRAN Task View for Time Series. The kza package in particular includes facilities for break detection, with an example in its manual. Distinguishing true signals from artifacts in blood pressure, pulse-oximeter and electrocardiogram traces is of great practical importance for clinical device manufacturers, medical professionals, and patients. I've seen artifacts cut out or noted electronically on pulse-oximeter and electrocardiogram traces when visiting friends in the hospital, so there probably already are real-time solutions for this problem, although they might be covered by intellectual property restrictions rather than being open-source.
