How do I convert my software application into a software appliance?

Assuming I want to sell a hardware appliance with only my software on it, what do I need to do? Where can I find the hardware? How can I remote into the machine to fix things if I need to? Google used to do this with the search appliance (don't know if they still do). VMWare should have a website like cafepress where you upload a logo, choose specs, and then give them an image and they dropship you a server with that on it. Edits to this question are encouraged, for all the things I forgot.
