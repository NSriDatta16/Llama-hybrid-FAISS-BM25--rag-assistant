Django template filter - one line

I'm looking for a Django template filter that turns a multi-line construction into one big line. Has anyone implemented it? The reason is - I have a form, {{form.as_p}} creates a multi-line html fragment, I want to create a javascript variable which is an html fragment, but when I do like this: var new_div_text = '{{form.as_p}}'; it doesn't work. The reason is obvious, in javascript constructions like var hello = 'Hello world'; are invalid!
