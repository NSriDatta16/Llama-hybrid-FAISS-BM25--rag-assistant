If you installed wexpect somewhere in the module search path ( sys.path ), then import wexpect is what you would use. You have to make sure you installed it in the right path, though (the usual location is Lib\site-packages inside the Python installation.) If the package wexpect.py was in came with a setup.py file, you could install it with \path\to\python setup.py install from a DOS prompt . Depending on what else you did you may need to restart the Python interpreter or IDE that you're using for it to pick it up. You should also pay attention to the errors you get when you try import wexpect , as it may have dependencies you need to install.
