How to detect payment's fraud using Machine Learning?

While browsing Machine Learning problems, I came across this question: "Given a monthâ€™s worth of login data from Netflix such as account_id, device_id, and metadata concerning payments, how would you detect payment fraud?" Now, I would approach this problem as a supervised learning exercise and leverage past data as training data where hopefully, a response was provided for each sample and determined to be fraudulent or not. I would train a classification model on this training data with the objective of minimizing the False Positives (Type I error), i.e. after obtaining a model, I would set the probability threshold to be low so as to minimize the False Negatives. I am thinking that most of these problems are usually highly imbalanced (with very few cases of fraud), and so, I would probably not use accuracy as a performance metric to evaluate the performance of the model (and use precision instead, or perhaps precision-recall AUC). Now I am wondering if my approach is correct, is there anything missing from my Logic? In the past I have solved similar 'fraud' problems, however, the question were regarding credit card transactions, and the challenge was to detect whether a particular transaction was fraudulent or not. And so, for this particular Netflix problem, I am not sure if the fact that, here, the challenge is to detect whether payments are fraudulent (instead of transactions) makes any difference or not. I am curious to hear what other people think.
