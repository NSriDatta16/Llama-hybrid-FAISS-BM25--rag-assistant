I don't think there is a strong convention within the entire community. From what I have seen, there seems to be a bias towards ignoring single quotes altogether and always using double quotes. In some circles, that is even a convention, but a localized one, not one for the whole community. Personally, whenever I have several different ways to express the same thing, I tend to use those different ways to convey different semantics. (For example, I use curly braces vs. do / end in blocks to distinguish between blocks that are used for their side effects and blocks that are used for their return value.) So, I only use double quotes when I actually want to use string interpolation or escaping, otherwise I use single quotes. That way, when I see a string I can immediately tell that there's no funny business going on, and there's no code hidden inside of it. I am pragmatic, though. I very much prefer "It's a string!" over 'It\'s a string!' or %q[It's a string!] .
