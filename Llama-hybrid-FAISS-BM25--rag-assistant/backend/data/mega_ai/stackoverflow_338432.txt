I've used DokuWiki in the past and have been fairly happy with it. It's pretty small, the code isn't the cleanest, but it's not too tough to drop in your own authentication scheme (for example) to integrate with an existing user system. It is GPL2, which fits your requirement. It uses the file system as storage, so may not scale that well, but for basic wiki stuff with a decent feature set it might be what you're looking for.
