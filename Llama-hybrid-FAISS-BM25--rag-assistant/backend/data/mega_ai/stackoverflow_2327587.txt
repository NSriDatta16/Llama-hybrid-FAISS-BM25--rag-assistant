Access Windows Azure API via Silverlight?

I am interested in the best practices to access Windows Azure API from a Silverlight application? I am pretty sure as an experienced developer it will require me to build a back end web service that silverlight can then use as an interface between Azure API and Silverlight. But I am concerned with speed and security...For instance I am guessing I can use WCF, but what is the fastest way to get this communication to occur? Also this is an assumption on my part that a webservice is needed, is there any support from Azure for Silverlight? I couldn't find anything on Microsoft site about this, only how to host a Silverlight application on your Azure Storage Blob which is not what I am asking... Thanks!
