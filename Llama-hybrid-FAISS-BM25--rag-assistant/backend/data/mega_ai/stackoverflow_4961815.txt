You can detect if the application was launched using webstart by checking on the availability of the jnlp services. Something like: public boolean launchedByJNLP(){ try { ServiceManager.lookup("javax.jnlp.BasicService"); } catch (UnavailableServiceException e) { return false; } return true; } As for getting jnlp information for an About dialog, I think your best solution is to include whatever information you want in your about dialog in a separate properties file packaged with your application.
