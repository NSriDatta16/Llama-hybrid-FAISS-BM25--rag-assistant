context.Load(query) is an async operation. It returns immediately, before the network request under the hood has retrieved the data. You need to listen for the operation completed event as indicated in Levisaxos' answer. If you hook up the operation.Completed event and still don't see any data in the context, then it's time to turn your attention to the domain service on the server side. Set a breakpoint in the domain service method corresponding to GetEmployeeQuery (probably GetEmployee) and make sure it's getting called. Then set a breakpoint in the entity collection property in your model - probably in mymodel.Designer.cs, property ObjectSet Employees, to see what data is actually being retrieved.
