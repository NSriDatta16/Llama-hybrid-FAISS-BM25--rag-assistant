VSTS give you all the architect, database and test capability that pro does not have. You also get code analysis and code coverage. None of it is necessary, but a lot of it is very nice. And, if it's just for you, you could look at Perforce for source control (it's free for 2 accounts and not as heavyweight as TFS). Edit per comment: Yes, we use CruiseControl.NET for our CI and for solo dev, take a look at BugHost .
