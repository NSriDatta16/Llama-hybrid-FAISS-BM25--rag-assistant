My recommendation is to use SQL Server Compact edition ( http://www.microsoft.com/Sqlserver/2008/en/us/compact.aspx ) for storage engine, and ADO.net implementation of SqlCe in System.Data.SqlServerCe namespace ( http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlserverce.aspx ) for code interaction. They are very well integrated with Visual Studio 2008, including designer support of strong-type dataset and run-time examination of data content on device etc. No idea about the printing.
