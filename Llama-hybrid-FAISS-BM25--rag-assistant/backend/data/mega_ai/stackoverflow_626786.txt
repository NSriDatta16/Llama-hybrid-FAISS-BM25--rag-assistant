BUT... The next question is how do you caculate your commitment for sprint after Y. If your past weather shows you have a an average velocity of 20pts. If you carry the story over then you carry over 10pts. However if you think there is only 3pts left of the story: Do you A) Take on another 17pt to fill your estimated capacity of 20pts B) Only take on 10pt more as the story carried over was originally estimated at 10pts We got into a mess trying to do A. What do other people think ? [Update] I posted a question about this: Work out sprint capacity when carrying over story points in scrum
