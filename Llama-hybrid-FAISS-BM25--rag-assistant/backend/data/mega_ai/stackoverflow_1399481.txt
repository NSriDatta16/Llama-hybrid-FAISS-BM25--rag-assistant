PragProg have two relevant books in beta: their iPhone book includes a solid section on Core Data, and there's also their Core Data book itself. Apple's Core Data Tutorial for iPhone OS is actually very good indeed, and worth working through. I found it to be the resource that most helped me click into Core Data, before looking in detail at the above books. (Of course, it is also worth looking through the non-iPhone specific Core Data docs.) Also, Jeff LaMarche (co-author of the Apress Beginning iPhone Dev) has been posting up a fair bit of Core Data content on his blog lately, including paths past some basic but not always intuitive iPhone-specific gotchas. It's worth subscribing to his blog while you're getting into iPhone dev.
