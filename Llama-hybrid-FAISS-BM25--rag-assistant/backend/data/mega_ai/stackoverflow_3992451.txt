ivysvn: file organization and passwords

I'm looking at using ivysvn to help us use a local ivy repository in our svn repository. I found this tutorial which I found easy to follow, and almost works, except for 3 points: The tutorial has a blank username and password. How can I get this to work with our SVN repository (which does not allow anonymous commits) without having to put my username and password in the ivysettings.xml or build.xml? The closest I could think of was to use in ivysettings.xml: and then at the command prompt do ant -Dsvn.user.name={{{deleted}}} -Dsvn.user.password={{{deleted}}} publish I thought the organization of the repository was as follows (for example suppose the server URL is http://someserver/svn/cache/ivy , the organization is Yoyodyne, and the module is HappyFunBall) http://someserver/svn/cache/ivy/ Yoyodyne/ HappyFunBall/ 1.0/ ivy.txt libraries here This would imply in ivysettings.xml and not Which is correct? Ideally there would be a mapping of SVN version # to artifact revision, and then you wouldn't need to create [revision] directories, but something doesn't make sense. The blog post had, in the source project, an ivy.xml file with this: and I think I understand all of it except for the publishivy="false" part, since the retrieval part wouldn't work except when I changed it to publishivy="true" . Which is correct? Where does the ivy.xml file come in w/r/t putting a copy of it into the repository?
