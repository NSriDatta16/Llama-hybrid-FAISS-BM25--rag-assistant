Flash inside a draggable div

I have a flash video player sitting inside a div container. That is made draggable using javascript. I dont want it to be sensitive to dragging when the mouse is on the flash part. It should be draggable only when mouse is on the remaining div container. The expected behavior happens in Linux. However, in windows cursor on mouse makes it draggable as well. How can I avoid that. Thanks in advance :)
