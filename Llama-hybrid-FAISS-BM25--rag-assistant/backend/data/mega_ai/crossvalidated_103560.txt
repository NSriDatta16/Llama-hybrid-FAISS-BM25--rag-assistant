How to do significance testing on averages of regression coefficients across multiple groups?

I have over 1000 respondents each with their own regression coefficients. I am analyzing data by different segments by averaging the constant and coefficient scores for each group. Sometimes I will have 2 groups (gender, yes/no questions, etc.) and sometimes I will have multiple groups (Ethnicity, age groups, etc.) What significance test should be used to see if the average coefficient scores are significantly different from each other?
