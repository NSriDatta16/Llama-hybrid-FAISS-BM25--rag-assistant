Interpreting "elliptic" shape in visualization of high-dimensional dataset, e.g. COIL-20?

There exist an image dataset referred to as COIL-20 . There are several paper that describes different dimensionality reduction methods and apply them to produce a 2d plot of this dataset. These pictures often contain one or several "elliptic" shapes. Is there any particular explanation for this? If yes, can we extend it to other datasets? E.g. if we observe the similar"elliptic" shapes on completely different dataset (not images), is it possible to infer something about its structure? For example, the picture by t-SNE : or from here : and here :
