Since you want to leverage BuildProvider make sure you're doing all those steps in Web Site project (not Web Application) Add configuration stuff (you already done this) Add "App_Code" to the solution in Visual Studio Create a text file, e.g. model.abp in App_Code folder and add some content into it (for example, just type one star * or anything else) Press F6, wait until it completes the build, then go to default.aspx.cs and try to type Northwind. you should see IntelliSense. But I always prefer generating the model via Command Line tool instead of build provider because it's not dependent on project type and you can integrate it to automated builds.
