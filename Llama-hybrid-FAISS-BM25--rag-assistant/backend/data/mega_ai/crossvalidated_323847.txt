Characterization of autocovariance function

I a studying from Brockwell and Davis Time series Theory and Methods. I have the theorem 1.5.1. I am not clear with the first part of the proof. The theorem is the next one: In the first part of the proof, I can't see how to compute: $$0\leq Var(a'Z_t)$$ I have that $Var(a'Z_t)=a'Var(Z_t)a$, then $Var(Z_t)=Var(X_t-EX_t)$ since $EX_t$ is a constat I would get $Var(Z_t)=Var(X_t)$ , but I can't see how this is equal to $E[Z_tZ_t']$.
