Javascript: how to fill part of the page with html frome some url and update it ragulary?

So I have simple html web page with one div with id="toFill" on it. Page has header script stule and body blocks. I have some file like markUpToAdd.html with for example html list (no header body etc - just etc) jo my server will update file from time to time. I need using Javascript to put contents of markUpToAdd into that div and update each 30 seconds. How to do such thing? Not using Jquery or any special libs.
