This is basically an implementation detail and trying to figure out how the CLR works by poking around the internal structures is not easy to say the least. A lot of the internal structures are optimized in various ways, which makes dumping the relevant information hard. I have a similar question here . If you haven't already looked at it, I recommend you read Shared Source CLI essentials . While it doesn't cover all the gory details, it does give a pretty good explanation of how the shared source CLI is organized. In my experience some of these structures cannot easily be mapped without the use of utility methods that encapsulates what the CLR is doing internally. That is basically what SOS does for us. If you get the source for the SSCLI , you can dig into the source for the shared source version of SOS for additional details. Of course the SSCLI isn't the same as the current Microsoft CLR, but in my experience they have a lot in common, so it is usually a good source of information. There's a detailed write up of how the method table was implemented in .NET 1.x here . It has a lot of details, but alas the implementation has been changed so it isn't valid for the current CLR.
