This is a theoretical possibility, but it's not in any samples I've seen. Basically what you'd do is either base64 encode the DLLs / Files into the database or zip them up and store them in one blob. You'd download them in your bootstrapper and copy them locally (in a temp directory) and then allows them to load normally from the filesystem using the DirectoryModuleCatalog. If you wanted it to be a bit more elegant, you could write your own ModuleCatalog that encapsulates this logic. This is very similar to what I do... I actually download a zip file of all of the modules from a website at launch time and unzip them and load them with the DirectoryModuleCatalog.
