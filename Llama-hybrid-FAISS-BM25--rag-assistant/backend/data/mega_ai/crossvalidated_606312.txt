Mann kendall test

How to derive the variance formula in Mann kendall test in the below link. https://vsp.pnnl.gov/help/vsample/design_trend_mann_kendall.htm The idea for this test looks kind of random if I want to design test for testing trend of a time series how do I ensure that it is non biased and correct. in general if I have an idea for a test based on some statistics of the data points how do I go about calculating the variance and others so that I can assign some P value to the significance of the test Any good resources would be appreciated.
