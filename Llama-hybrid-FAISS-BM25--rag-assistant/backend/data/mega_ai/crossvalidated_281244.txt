I assume you added those other variables to your model because you wanted to control for them. If that is the case, then those smaller odds ratios are the odds ratios you want. There is no guarantee that effects will get bigger if you control for other variables; they could very well get smaller, as happened in your case. If you don't want to control for those other variables, then you can just look at the two dimensional cross tabulation. In fact the odds ratio you get out of that will be the same as the odds ratio in logistic regression without other control variables.
