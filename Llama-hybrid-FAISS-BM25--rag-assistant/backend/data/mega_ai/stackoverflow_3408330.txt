How to define permissions in Amazon s3

I have a structure on amazon like this - (bucket name) MyImages --- (key) general ---- 1.jpg ---- 2.jpg I have created the key (general) by using S3 Firefox Organizer tool and set read permission for all. Now, by a java program when I am uploading the images inside this key, I want to set the permission of each object as the key have. But its not happening and I have to write some extra line of code for setting up the permissions of each object. AccessControlList acl = s3.getBucketAcl("MyImages"); // give everyone read access acl.grantPermission(GroupGrantee.AllUsers, Permission.Read); s3.setObjectAcl("MyImages", "general/1.jpg", acl); Is there any way to get rid of above code. Why the objects are not getting the permission as the key or bucket?
