We converted a home-grown web framework to stripes in about a week. We're using it in production at this time and it's a great framework. The community is extremely helpful, and the framework doesn't get in your way. It can be extended in many places to change the behavior as you see fit. The url binding feature is awesome as well. We implemented a robust security framework using annotations and interceptors. We're using spring for dependency injection and stripes has excellent support for that. I'd definitely use the new 1.5 release if you're going to use it. I'm a huge fan of the framework. I came from a struts background and it's the exact framework I was looking for. The other developers on our team really enjoy using the stripes framework. I just bought the stripes beta book from the pragmatic programmer's site. It's a great resource on Stripes 1.5.
