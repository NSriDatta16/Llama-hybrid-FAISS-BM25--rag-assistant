Flash is not limited for GUI possibilities because you can create custom controls with vector graphics. You have a blank slate with Flash to create as complex a GUI as you desire. But if you are prototyping for Windows use Visual Studio to drag and drop or numerous open source tools for UNIX and MAC GUI drag and drop or just use an image creation tool. In short, Flash could be a good tool to prototype if you are creating highly customized interfaces. Otherwise, no. There are easier UI development tools out there for standardized stuff.
