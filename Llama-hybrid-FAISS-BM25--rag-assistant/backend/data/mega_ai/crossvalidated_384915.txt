I'll make some assumptions for one fixed kind of job. If they're not realistic, that may help you ask a more targeted question. You repeatedly encounter a binomial random variable $X \sim \mathsf{Binom}(n = 10, p),$ where $n$ is the maximum number of items you might need for the job, $X$ is the number actually required, and $p$ is unknown. [This is realistic if items fail independently of one another.] You have data from $m = 100$ previous jobs of this kind. Out of the maximum number $mn = 100(10) = 1000$ of items you might have needed, you actually needed $700,$ so a reasonable estimate of $p$ is $\hat p = 700/1000 = 0.7.$ Based on the above, a traditional ('Wald') 95% confidence interval (CI) for $p$ is of the form $\hat p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\hat p(1 - \hat p)/1000},$ approximately $(.67,.73).$ [Possible variations: With substantially less preliminary data, an Agresti-Coull style of CI might be better, but with amount of data assumed above, the difference between the two styles of CI is negligible. Also with th amount of previous data assumed above, a Bayesian interval estimate, based on an uninformative prior distribution such as $p \sim \mathsf{Beta}(.5, .5)$ or $p \sim \mathsf{Unif}(0,1),$ would be numerically about the same.] qbeta(c(.025, .975), 700.5, 300.5) # for Bayesian prior BETA(.5,.5) [1] 0.6710503 0.7277938 Then, playing it safe by using the top end of the interval estimate, it would be sensible to ask whether $X = 8$ items would be enough for the next repair job of this kind: $P(X \le 8\,|\,p =.73) \approx 0.80.$ If that seems too risky, you might ask the probability that nine items would be sufficient; that probability is about $0.96.$ [Computations in R.] pbinom(8, 10, .73) [1] 0.7980705 pbinom(9, 10, .73) [1] 0.9570237 Of course, you could change $n = 10$ to something else and imagine a different amount of prior data, making changes that I hope are obvious. The main issue is whether this very elementary approach provides a reasonable answer to your Question. If not, please edit your question or leave comments so that the next try to give an answer can be more useful.
