AIC has a component for the closeness of the fit (smaller is better) and a component for the number of parameters (again small is good, reflecting the principle of parsimony). So AIC tends to favour models which follow the data as closely as possible but with a minimum of parameters. Use of the AIC criterion can be shown to roughly mimic a likelihood ratio test between models, with a significance level of around 0.30. It therefore tends to overfit the data. A criterion that is closer to an alpha of 0.05 is the Schwarz Bayesian Criterion.
