This solution worked better for me: Make a macro (I used Organize Imports, Format Code, Save All) Assign it a keystroke (I overrode Ctrl + S ) Note: You will have to check the box "Do not show this message again" the first time for the organized imports, but it works as expected after that. Step-by-step for IntelliJ 10.0: Code -> "Optimize Imports...", if a dialogue box appears, check the box that says "Do not show this message again.", then click "Run". Tools -> "Start Macro Recording" Code -> "Optimize Imports..." Code -> "Reformat Code..." File -> "Save all" Tools -> "Stop Macro Recording" Name the macro (something like "formatted save") In File -> Settings -> Keymap, select your macro located at "Main Menu -> Tools -> "formatted save" Click "Add Keyboard Shortcut", then perform the keystroke you want. If you choose Ctrl + S like me, it will ask you what to do with the previous Ctrl + S shortcut. Remove it. You can always reassign it later if you want. Enjoy! For IntelliJ 11, replace step 2. with: Edit -> Macros -> "Start Macro Recording" step 6. with: Edit -> Macros -> "Stop Macro Recording" Everything else remains the same. IntelliJ 12 8. The Preferences contain the Keymap settings. Use the input field to filter the content, as shown in the screenshot.
