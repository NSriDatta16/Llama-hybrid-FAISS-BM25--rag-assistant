Finding T-SQL code with literal strings for localization project

Does anyone have experience with tools/techniques that would help identify T-SQL code with literal strings (that may require language translation for a localization project)? Would love to leverage another's experience that may save me time developing my own tool or - god forbid - doing it manually.
