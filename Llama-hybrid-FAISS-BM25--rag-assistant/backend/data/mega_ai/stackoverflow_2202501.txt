Entity Framework deletion of non-null foreign keyed rows

I have a schema similar to the standard Product / OrderDetails / Order setup. I want to delete a single Product and cascade delete all OrderDetails which reference that product. Assuming that I've thought this through from the business rules perspective, what's the most elegant way to handle that with Entity Framework 4?
