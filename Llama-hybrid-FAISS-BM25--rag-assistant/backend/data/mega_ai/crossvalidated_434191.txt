Statistical test for comparing means of two AR(1) time series

Say I have two time series which each follow the AR(1) model: $$ X_{t+1} = X_t + (1 - \theta_X) (\mu_X - X_t) + \epsilon_X(t) $$ $$ Y_{t+1} = Y_t + (1 - \theta_Y) (\mu_Y - Y_t) + \epsilon_Y(t) $$ Here, $\theta_X$ and $\theta_Y$ are parameters with absolute value less than one, $\mu_X, \mu_Y$ are the "means" of the time series, and $\epsilon_X(t), \epsilon_Y(t)$ are normal with standard deviations $\sigma_X, \sigma_Y >0$ . The parameters can be estimated from the data, I believe. What would be a test similar to the $t$ -test which would allow me to reject the null hypothesis that $X_{t}$ and $Y_{t}$ are sampled from distributions which have the same mean?
