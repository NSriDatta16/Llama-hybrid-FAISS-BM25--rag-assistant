Gary's answer is the most appropriate. You can actually identify the server name using hierarchical syntax to. dim session as new notesSession dim strCurrServer as string dim nmServer as notesName strCurrServer = session.currentagent.servername ' this bit is optional set nmServer = new notesName(strCurrServer) ' then you can do stuff like this print nmServer.Abbreviated That would be the fastest (dirtiest?) way to get the server name from the webquery open agent. The notesName class is a handy object for dealing with hierarchical names link text
