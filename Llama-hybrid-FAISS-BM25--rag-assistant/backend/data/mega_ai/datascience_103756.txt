This is interesting idea and I think it makes sense to share weights. I have not seen exactly what you described, but it is common to share weights in cases that two inputs has similar meaning. For example, in this article they use shared embeddings for the target video and video from the user history that has the same video_id . It is definitely possible to implement it in TensorFlow, if the two inputs has the same dimensions. The way to implement it is straight forward, create a weights matrix with dimension of ( feature_dimension , num_neuron ) and multiply the different inputs with the same matrix.
