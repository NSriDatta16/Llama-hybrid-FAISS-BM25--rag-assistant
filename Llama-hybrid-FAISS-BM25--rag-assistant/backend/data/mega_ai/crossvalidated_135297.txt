Can I use an SVM for labeling data as more than one class

I'm trying to classify e-mails using Mallet. If the classifier is too unsure about a new e-mail I would like a user to do the classification instead. I figured I could use the Mallet Labeling output for this: Labeling labeling = classifier.classify(instance).getLabeling(); My problem is that when I use an SVM my labels are all of certainty 1 or 0. CLASS1: 1,0 CLASS2: 0,0 CLASS3: 0,0 CLASS4: 0,0 CLASS5: 0,0 I would like the output to be more like this: CLASS1: 0,9945 CLASS2: 0,0047 CLASS3: 0,0005 CLASS4: 0,0001 CLASS5: 0,0001 The second output was generated using the Maximum Entropy classifier. My question is: Can an SVM give me estimates between 1 and 0? Is this behavior typical of an SVM or is it just the implementation I'm using. Follow up question: Is the Maximum Entropy classifier generally just as good as an SVM when it comes to text?
