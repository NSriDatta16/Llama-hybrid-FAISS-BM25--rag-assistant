Most elegant way to morph this sequence

I've got the Day of the week stored in a database table (that I do not control), and I need to use it in my code. Problem is, I want to use the System.DayOfWeek enum for representation for this, and the sequences are not the same. In the database, it's as follows: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 S M T W T F S I need it as follows: 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 M T W T F S S What's the most elegant way to do this? for example, I could do: i = dayOfWeek; i = i - 2; if (i but that's a bit inelegant. Any suggestions? Ahem. Apparently (.net reflector says) DayOfWeek is 0 indexed starting with Sunday. Always read the docs before asking daft questions. However, I'm still interested in an answer, just to satisfy my own curiosity, so go for it.
