My knowledge of this is very shallow, but I thought that was only true for disks formatted with GPT (Guid Partition Table) partitions, rather than the old-style MBR format which 99% of the world is still stuck with? Not to sounds like a linux user cliche but it Works For Me.. I use it with NTFS partitions and have had no problems. As I said in my edit, vol_id may be generating them itself. If that were the case there would be no reliance on any particular partition format, which would be swell.
