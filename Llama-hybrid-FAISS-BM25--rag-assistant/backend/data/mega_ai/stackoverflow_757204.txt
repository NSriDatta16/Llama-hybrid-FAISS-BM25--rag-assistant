The main advantage is that you can limit which values you can enter in the table; if you try to enter a value that doesn't exist in the referenced table, you won't be able to do it. Also, if you update or delete the value in the referenced table, you can set it to automatically update the value or delete in cascade any row containing that value. It's indeed a great feature leveraging your code.
