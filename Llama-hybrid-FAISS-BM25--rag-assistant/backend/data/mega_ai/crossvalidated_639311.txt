Choosing a suitable sample size for a Random Forest Model

I know that this isn't always a straight forward question to answer, but I am working on a provincial wide wetland classification model that has $7$ classes and $32$ or so explanatory variables. In my model, I have a $92 \%$ OA and somewhere in the ball park from $90 - 98$ PA and UA. After inspecting the model and using it daily for my research, I am finding it to be fairly accurate. I have $2000$ training/validation points. $20 \%$ were validation. I stopped training the model and building my training and validation set once I started getting the results I was looking for. Do you think my sample size is large enough and is it defensible?
