Note that Hani's comment was in regards to Geronimo 1.0/OpenEJB 2.0. Hani was wrong in the frankenstein comment as the OpenEJB 2.x codebase was built entirely from scratch for Geronimo and as a result it only ran in Geronimo; the embedded, tomcat, and standalone modes were all lost. We found Hani's comment was right in that the performance was not good. For OpenEJB 3.x we abandoned the 2.x codebase and picked things up from where we left off in OpenEJB 1.x and brought it up to EJB 3.0 certification. 2.x and 3.x share no code. OpenEJB 3.x turned out very well and the project has been growing pretty rapidly since the first 3.0 release in 2008. The EJB 3.1 Embedded Container and EJBs in .wars features came from OpenEJB. We had the first @Singleton implementation and hope to complete the rest of EJB 3.1 and certify web profile by Q4 this year. Failover and JMX monitoring have been under heavy development since January, are now complete, and will be released in 3.1.3 in a couple weeks. The failover is actually second generation, the first failover support was released in 3.1.1. There was significant remote performance work done in the 3.1.1 release as well bringing RPC calls up to a mean of 7300 TPS in our benchmarking. Less important to some, but very important to others, Apache OpenEJB is not a corporately controlled open source project. The majority of committers are users who have earned commit and use OpenEJB at work. This has its advantages and disadvantages, but the bottom line is OpenEJB is filled with people who love it and use it and the community is just as open as the source. UPDATE In October 2011, we obtained Java EE 6 Web Profile certification with "Tomcat+OpenEJB", now called Apache TomEE. Certified and with a clearer name, we hope this makes the stack easier to both understand and compare. On a personal note, I view the comments in this thread as one of the major motivators for taking the certification step. Thank you to everyone at StackOverlfow for feedback which I find both encouraging and grounding. Connecting with this community has resulted in so much positive change in OpenEJB/TomEE.
