Hurdle model: How to compare slopes?

I'm analyzing the change in seagrass cover (count data of shoots) between two years of different species. Therefore, I made a model similar to this: cover ~ species * time Since my data is zero-inlated (a lot of seagrass disappeared), I'm using a zero inflated hurdle model, using a beta distribution to describe the probability for the presence of seagrass and a poisson distribution for the shoot counts. This model was implemented as a Bayesian model using R2jags . However, my question relates to hurdle models in general. Since the model outputs coefficients for the beta and for the poisson model: How is it possible to get an 'overall' slope for the different species? How is it possible to compare these slopes? Thanks a lot for your help!
