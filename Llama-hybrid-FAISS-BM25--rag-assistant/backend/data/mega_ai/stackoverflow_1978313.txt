The answer to your question is ultimately, it depends. The links in that navigation are added via different layout XML files. Here's the code that first defines the block in layout/customer.xml . Notice that it also defines some links to add to the menu: account customer/account/ Account Dashboard account_edit customer/account/edit/ Account Information address_book customer/address/ Address Book Other menu items are defined in other layout files. For example, the Reviews module uses layout/review.xml to define its layout, and contains the following: reviews review/customer My Product Reviews To remove this link, just comment out or remove the tag and the menu item will disappear. If you want to find all menu items at once, use your favorite file search and find any instances of name="customer_account_navigation" , which is the handle that Magento uses for that navigation block.
