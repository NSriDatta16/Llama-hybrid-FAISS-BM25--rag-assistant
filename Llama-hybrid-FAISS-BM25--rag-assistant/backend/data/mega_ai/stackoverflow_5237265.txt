Berkeley DB has the capabilities that you're looking for. It's library that links into your application. It's small and very fast. It supports key/value pairs and an easy-to-use API. It's very portable, reliable and scalable . It runs on lots of platforms. It's designed to be used in constrained environments and runs on lots of different devices and appliances. Disclaimer: I'm the Product Manager for Berkeley DB, so I'm a little biased. But BDB was designed to do exactly what you're looking for -- fast, reliable, portable, scalable embedded data storage. We've been doing key/value pairs for years. We were NoSQL before NoSQL was popular. :-) Good luck in your search. - Dave
