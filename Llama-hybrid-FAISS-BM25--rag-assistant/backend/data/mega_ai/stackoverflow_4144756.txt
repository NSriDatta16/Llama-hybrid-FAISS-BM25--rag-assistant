Here's one idea how to do it: Make a class named DBConnection with a static factory method getNewDBConnection During application startup, verify that your db connection is valid, and using ServletContextListener , set up the DBConnection class so the mentioned method will always return a new connection Use throughout your code DBConnection.getNewDBConnection() . I'll leave the boilerplate and exception handling up to you. There are more elegant ways to do this, using JPA for example, but this is outside of this answer's scope. Beware of above idea. I have only written it; but haven't tried it and proven it correct.
