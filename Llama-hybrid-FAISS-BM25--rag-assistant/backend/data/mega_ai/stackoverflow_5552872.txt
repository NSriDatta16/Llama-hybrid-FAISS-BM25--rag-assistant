The traffic might be useless, indeed. You're right. But like Pointy said, unfortunatelly there's no way by simply using javascript. If you would just like to have your download implemented in a more elegant way (than page reload), make use of a "hidden" iframe, that loads the PHP-response. Maybe you could easily switch the PHP processing from POST to GET and ... myForm.onsubmit = function(formValueSavename, formValueSavedata) { // phpIframeRef addresses you hidden iframe phpIframeRef.loaction.href = 'sendData.php?savename=' + formValueSavename + '&savedata=' + formValueSavedata; } You'll propably need some code to suppress your default handling of the form... which I don't know.
