The placeholder text you were putting in the default for the switch statement was creating a view via your LinearLayout actionPane. A fragment was never added to the container. When you hit your buttons, the swapFragment method was called and a fragment added to the container next to the actionPane view. If you delete the creation of the actionPane in the default you didn't see the issue as you noted. If you wanted to display some default view or text in a fragment for the initial launch of the app to be replaced by the fragments fired by the buttons, you can add a fragment to the container in the hc_test onCreate method. This will then be swapped out when you fire the buttons. I tested this and it works, may not be the best way and its 2 am now so please excuse me if I'm not writing clearly! Can send you or post the code if you like. I'm curious if you found a tutorial to help you set up your fragments with the buttons? All I could find were listFragment examples and was struggling until I found your post. Thanks,
