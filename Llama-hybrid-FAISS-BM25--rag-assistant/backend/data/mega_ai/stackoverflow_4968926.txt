Progress bar appears with loading string before fragment gets loaded in HoneyComb 3.0

I am writing an Android 3.0 application in which I displays a List. Clicking on any item on list will display another list which is a Fragment. Say this Fragment as Fragment1. I will display this fragment every time I click 1,2,4 listitems. But when I click ListItem3 I will display another Fragment say Fragment2 besides Fragment1. My question is before clicking the ListItem3, a ProgressBar with "Loading" text is displayed at a place where Fragment2 is supposed to be displayed when I click ListItem3. The ProgressBar is there even after the Fragment2 is displayed. What is the reason why this ProgressBar is displayed?
