It's been a while since I've worked with Magento CE, but I think isSaleable is tied to the stock management system. I think you need to check the stock options and mark it in stock (with, of course, the product set to enabled). I would avoid hardcoding any of the functions if possible. Edit: Did you try Inventory -> Manage Stock to "No" ? This is kind of a no-brainer, but products are set to be disabled by default, so General -> Status to "Enabled" is also required.
