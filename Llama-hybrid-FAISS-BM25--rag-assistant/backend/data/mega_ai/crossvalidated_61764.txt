As I understand it, you have a set of clusters and are assigning each cluster to receive the intervention at a random time point, and assessing whether receipt of the intervention changes the disease prevalence in the cluster. So, you want to know either the prevalence difference E[Y|intervention=1] - E[Y|intervention=0] or the prevalence ratio E[Y|intervention=1]/E[Y|intervention=0]. Where Y = prevalence = $x_{ij}/N_{i}$. If you think the intervention has a single unique effect in each cluster (time-invariant effect), then you should probably just be calculating those from your data. You may get bias if you have within-cluster time-varying confounding, in any given cluster - ex. other reasons the prevalence of disease naturally changes over time. So you may want to consider measuring any important confounders of that type. If you believe instead that there is a single time-invariant effect of the intervention on average over all the clusters, and wanted to adjust for the fact that clusters are matched to themselves, you could analyze this like a crossover study and run a conditional logistic regression $clogit(Y) = \beta_{0,i} +\beta_1I_{i,j}$. However, you will once again have to worry about bias if there are time-varying confounders within the clusters. You can adjust for this by including these variables in the regression model. This gives you the prevalence odds, but since you have a longitudinal study, you should be able to validly convert that back to the prevalence by taking the expit. If you think the effect varies over time, then I'm not sure what the best approach is.
