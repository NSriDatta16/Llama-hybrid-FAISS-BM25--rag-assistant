The reason why commonly the columns of $Z$ are a subset of the columns of $X$ is because you typically assume that the random effects $u$ have mean zero. The fixed effects that correspond to the random effects (e.g., in your example the fixed-effects intercept and time) quantify the average $y$ for these variables. If you would put a variable, say $w$ , into $Z$ but not in $X$ you would assume that the average change in $y$ for a unit increase in $w$ is zero, which is a strong assumption unless you have a-priori reasons that support that.
