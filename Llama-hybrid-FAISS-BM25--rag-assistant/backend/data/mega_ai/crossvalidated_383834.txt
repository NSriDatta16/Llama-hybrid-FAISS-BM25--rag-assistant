It may help to look at the square of $U \sim \mathsf{Unif}(0,1),$ which is $X = U^2 \sim \mathsf{Beta}(.5,1).$ [See Wikipedia .] Because the density of $U$ is $f_U(u) = 1,$ for $0 the entire form of the density of $X$ is due to the Jacobian factor $J = |du/dx|.$ In the simulation below, there are $n = 10^5$ values of $U$ and of $X,$ of which approximately $10,000$ fall into each bin of each histogram. Rectangular bars for both distributions are all of (essentially) the same area: Specifically, the red bin for the $u_i$ 's has width $0.1$ and height $1$ giving area $0.1$ Similarly, the corresponding bin for the $x_i$ 's has base $(0,.01)$ of length $0.01$ and height determined by the value of $J$ in that interval, which averages about $10.$ [Perhaps more simply, you might investigate what happens to values $0.9 (violet bar) under the transformation.] set.seed(1219) u = runif(10^5); x = u^2 par(mfrow=c(1,2)) bin.u = seq(0,1,by=.1) hist(u, prob=T, ylim=c(0,10), br=bin.u, col=rainbow(12)[1:10]) curve(dunif(x), add=T, lwd=2) bin.x = bin.u^2 hist(x, prob=T, br=bin.x, col=rainbow(12)[1:10]) curve(dbeta(x,.5,1), add=T, lwd=2) par(mfrow=c(1,1)) Note: It is generally a good idea to choose all bars in a histogram to be of the same width, unless there is a good reason to do otherwise (as here).
