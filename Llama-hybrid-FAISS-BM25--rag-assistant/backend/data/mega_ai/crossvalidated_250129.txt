What does it mean for something to have good frequentist properties?

I've often heard this phrase, but have never entirely understood what it means. The phrase "good frequentist properties" has ~2750 hits on google at present, 536 on scholar.google.com, and 4 on stats.stackexchange.com . The closest thing I found to a clear definition comes from the final slide in this Stanford University presentation , which states [T]he meaning of reporting 95% confidence intervals is that you “trap” the true parameter in 95% of the claims that you make, even across different estimation problems. This is the defining characteristic of estimation procedures with good frequentist properties: they hold up to scrutiny when repeatedly used. Reflecting a bit on this, I assume that the phrase "good frequentist properties" implies some assessment of a Bayesian method, and in particular a Bayesian method of interval construction. I understand that Bayesian intervals are meant to contain the true value of the parameter with probability $p$. Frequentist intervals are meant to be constructed such that such that if the if the process of interval construction was repeated many times about $p*100\%$ of the intervals would contain the true value of the parameter. Bayesian intervals don't in general make any promises about what % of the intervals will cover the true value of the parameter. However, some Bayesian methods also happen to have the property that if repeated many times they cover the true value about $p*100\%$ of the time. When they have that property, we say they have "good frequentist properties". Is that right? I figure that there must be more to it than that, since the phrase refers to good frequentist properties , rather than having a good frequentist property .
