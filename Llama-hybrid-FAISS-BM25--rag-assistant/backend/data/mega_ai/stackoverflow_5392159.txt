Can the GetField() method of the PrivateObject class access a private const string in C# 4.0?

I'm writing a unit test that accesses a file in isolated data storage. The file name is stored in a private const string within the class because I don't use it anywhere else in the whole application. However, when I run my unit test I get a "Field not found" error when I call the GetField("fieldName") method of the PrivateObject class instance. string historyFileName = (string)history.GetField("ISOLATED_HISTORY_FILE");
