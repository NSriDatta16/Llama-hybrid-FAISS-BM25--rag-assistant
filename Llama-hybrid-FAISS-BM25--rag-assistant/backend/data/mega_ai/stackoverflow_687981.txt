The question invites misleading answers. You can only authoritatively answer "is it atomic" questions about assembly/machine language. Any given C/C++ code fragment makes no guarantees, can vary depending on exactly which compiler (and version) you use, etc. (Unless you call some platform-specific intrinsic or whatnot that is guaranteed to compile to a known atomic machine instruction.)
