Strangely, nobody mentioned Real Studio (now Xojo ) which does meet all your requirements: It is easy to install and does not require a separate run-time It compiles to native code so is reasonably fast It has a good UI library that is native for each platform The IDE is very nice with drag and drop UI designers Target applications are fully native and use native controls
