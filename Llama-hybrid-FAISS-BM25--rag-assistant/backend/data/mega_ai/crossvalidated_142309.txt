Basil covered the essential issue (that the average distance from the mean is not the same thing as the standard deviation), but I think there's some additional points that should be added to that. The mean of the absolute deviations (from the mean) - which is the average distance from the mean - will always be $\leq$ than the root-mean-square deviation from the mean, which is the standard deviation This follows from the triangle inequality, for example, or from Jensen's inequality. In the case of data drawn from a normal distribution, in large samples the mean deviation is $\sqrt{2/\pi}$ times the standard deviation ... which is about 0.798, so that's your 80%.
