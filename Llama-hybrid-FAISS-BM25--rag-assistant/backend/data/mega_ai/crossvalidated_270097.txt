Though I haven't fully understood the problem, I am answering as per my understanding of the question. Have you tried including Epsilon in param_grid Dictionary of Grid_searchCV. I see you have only used the C and gamma as the parameters in param_grid dict. Then i think the system would itself pick the best Epsilon for you. Example: from sklearn.svm import SVR import numpy as np n_samples, n_features = 10, 5 np.random.seed(0) y = np.random.randn(n_samples) X = np.random.randn(n_samples, n_features) parameters = {'kernel': ('linear', 'rbf','poly'), 'C':[1.5, 10],'gamma': [1e-7, 1e-4],'epsilon':[0.1,0.2,0.5,0.3]} svr = svm.SVR() clf = grid_search.GridSearchCV(svr, parameters) clf.fit(X,y) clf.best_params_ output: {'C': 1.5, 'epsilon': 0.1, 'gamma': 1e-07, 'kernel': 'poly'}
