Regarding jQuery, I found jQuery in Action very useful. It is not just as exciting as the bungee book on prototype , but it is very pragmatic, just as the library is. Prototype is so clever and jQuery is so powerful. Skimming the book and browsing examples is enough to get you started, but be sure to read also the appendix on advanced JavaScript because it is where you will learn what language features have been leveraged to create the library. Regarding jQuery and ASP.NET, two things are worth noticing. 1) Microsoft is supporting jQuery as is in visual studio. No forks, no embrace and extend, just clean support, so you will be able to learn all you need in a non specific book. 2) developing with jQuery is orthogonal to ASP.NET. You will use Visual Studio as a powerful text editor without thinking in terms of ASP.NET components and code behind. There is no code behind in an interactive web application built with jQuery. If you need to do something on the server, you will build an aspx page processing parameters and returning raw data without user interface and call it with ajax. The ideal format is JSON . I would not choose a book particularly targeted to jQuery and ASP.NET without good reason, especially at the beginning.
