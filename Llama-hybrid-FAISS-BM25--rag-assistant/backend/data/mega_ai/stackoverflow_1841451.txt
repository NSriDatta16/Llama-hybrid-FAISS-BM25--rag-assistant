If you're trying to find the average, you shouldn't be using a select to start with - that's going to create a new result for each row, whereas you want just two results for the whole table. I suggest you do something like: Dim filtered = From dtRow in dtIn.AsEnumerable _ Where dtRow.Field(Of String)("FOLLOWUP") = "Alert" Dim functionalAvg = filtered.Average(Function(f) f("Brand_Functional")) Dim personalAvg = filtered.Average(Function(f) f("Brand_Personal"))
