Every view inherits UIResponder so every view gets touchesBegan/Moved/Ended - I do not think starting the touch outside the view means the view gets no event when the touch moves over the view. If you want to get a notification that something has been dragged onto your MKMapView you should make a subclass that handles the touch but then passes the event to super , allowing the hierarchy to do whatever it needs to do with the touch. You don't need to capture or modify the event just observe it.
