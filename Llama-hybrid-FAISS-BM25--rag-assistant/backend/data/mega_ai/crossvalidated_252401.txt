Two different things to think about: How to code the models in a logically convenient way, and how to get MCMC to sample efficiently from the models. Even if you solve the first, it might be difficult to solve the second. First, it appears that your model is just multiple regression with two predictor variables that you call x and z . Your different models consider including or excluding x and z . This situation is typically called "variable selection," and this exact situation is addressed extensively in Section 18.4 of the 2nd edition of Doing Bayesian Data Analysis . The idea is that every predictor variables is provided with a multiplicative inclusion parameter delta[i] that can take on values of 0 or 1. A version of the analysis was discussed on my blog before the 2nd Edition was published, here: http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2014/01/bayesian-variable-selection-in-multiple.html A follow-up regarding $R^2$ was posted here: http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2016/07/bayesian-variable-selection-in-multiple.html Second, there's the issue of getting MCMC to efficiently sample from the four discrete models. The problem is that MCMC can get stuck and not jump between models well. The problem sometimes can be ameliorated by using pseudo-priors as discussed in DBDA2E. With a small set of models as in the present case, you can probably get nice mixing of the chains and a useful analysis. With larger sets of models, this method becomes unwieldy and ineffective.
