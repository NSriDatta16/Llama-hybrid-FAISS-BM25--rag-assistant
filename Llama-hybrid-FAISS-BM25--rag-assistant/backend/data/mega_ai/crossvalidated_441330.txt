Intuitive understanding of the t-value

A manufacturer claims that the fuses blow less than 10 minutes on the average. You take a sample of 20 fuses and record the sample mean as 10.4. The sample standard deviation as 1.6 minutes. The sample is from a normal population. Does the data support or refute the manufacturer's claim. My doubt: Calculating the t-value is easy, you get 1.118. My doubt is that the book states the answer as "the probability that t exceeds 1.328 is 0.10 and because the observed value is less than 1.328 and 0.10 is a large probability, we can claim that the manufacturer is correct." I don't understand how to interpret this statement or understand what the calculated t-value (1.118) actually means.
