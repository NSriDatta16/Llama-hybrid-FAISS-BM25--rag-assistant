How many diagnoses do you have? I not many, you could divide patients in groups of all combinations of diagnoses. For example: - patient 1 has diag A - patient 2 has diag B - patient 3 has diag A and B - patient 4 has diag B and C - patient 5 has diag A - patient 6 has diag A and B For this data, I am proposing the following groups: Group 1: diag A - patient 1 - patient 5 Group 2: diag B - patient 2 Group 3: diag A and B - patient 3 - patient 6 Group 4: diag B and C - patient 4 If you do not have a lot of diagnoses and a lot of people with weird combinations of diagnoses, this would be feasible. This way you eliminate the effect of multiple diagnoses on a persons' life expectancy. Also, you could calculate the average lifespan of people with a certain combination of diagnoses (e.g. A and B).
