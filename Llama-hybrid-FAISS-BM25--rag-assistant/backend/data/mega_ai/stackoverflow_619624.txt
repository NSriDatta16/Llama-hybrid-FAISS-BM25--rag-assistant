What I ended up using as a workaround was to not try and retrieve objects by their id. So for the example given in the question, I changed my domain object: class Foo { short code /* new field */ String name static constraints = { code(unique: true) name() } } I then used an enum to hold all of the possible values for code (which are static), and would retrieve Foo objects by doing a Foo.findByCode() with the appropriate enum value (instead of using Foo.get() with the id like I wanted to do previously). It's not the most elegant solution, but it worked for me.
