JPA only updates entities that are changed. Iâ€™m not aware of any update() method, you can just use commit() or flush() and all entities in you session that are changed will be persisted to the database. Lazy loaded properties are just proxy objects that are not loaded at all, you can also do this manually by invoking: [entityManager.getReference][3] [3]: http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/persistence/EntityManager.html#getReference(java.lang.Class , java.lang.Object)
