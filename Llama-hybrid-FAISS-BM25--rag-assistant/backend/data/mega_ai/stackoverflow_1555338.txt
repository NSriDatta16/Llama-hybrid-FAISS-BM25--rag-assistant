When I had a similar need recently, I found this code that uses HTTP_X_WAP_PROFILE , HTTP_ACCEPT , and HTTP_USER_AGENT to identify a browser as mobile or non-mobile. It's PHP but could be converted fairly easily into whatever you need (I implemented it in VBScript for classic ASP). Ironically, it turned out that I didn't end up using the code because we decided to provide specific URLs for mobile and non-mobile users, but it certainly worked when I was testing it ...
