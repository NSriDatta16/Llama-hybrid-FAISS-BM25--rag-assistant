Could ResNet curve be used for a regression problem, e.g. housing price prediction?

A Residual Neural Network (ResNet) is an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) of a kind that builds on constructs known from pyramidal cells in the cerebral cortex. Residual Neural Networks do this by utilizing skip connections, or shortcuts to jump over some layers. Could it be used for a regression problem, e.g. housing price prediction? How about bias-variance? Actually I am trying to train a model that predict the length of cut for operation on patients. I guess I can use FCNN to do the job. How about ResNet?
