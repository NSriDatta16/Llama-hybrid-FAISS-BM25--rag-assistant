Isn't any model with logit-link doing exactly this? $y$ approaches $1$ if $x$ goes to $\infty$ ? Since classical logistic regression requires your $y$ to be binary, you could use a beta regression and standardize your independent variable to take on only values between 0 and 1. This would not exactly be a confirmation of the convergence to a certain value, but investigating model fit and comparing with other models, e.g. a linear model, could provide insights regarding the appropriateness of this model.
