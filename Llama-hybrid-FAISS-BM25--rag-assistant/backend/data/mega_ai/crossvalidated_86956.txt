When using a Neural Network to classify more than two classes, is it better to have multiple output nodes (one for each class) or one output node?

Currently, I am using a neural network to classify data into one of three groups (a logistic activation function is used on all but the output nodes). I can train the neural network in two ways: 1) For each observation $X_{i}$ I can have one output variable $O_{i}$ that can take three values: $1,2,$ or $3$. Or, 2) For each observation $X_{i}$ I can have three output variables $O_{i1},O_{i2}$, and $O_{i3}$ that would take on the values $0$ or $1$ based on what the class label for that observation is. So for example, if observation $i$ belongs to class 2, $O_{i2}$ would be $1$, whereas $O_{i1}$ and $O_{i3}$ would be $0$. Are the above two approaches equivalent? Is one better than the other? Are there any theoretical reasons to believe one should produce better results than the other?
