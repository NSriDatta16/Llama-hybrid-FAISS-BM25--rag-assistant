As you can see here ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autoregressive%E2%80%93moving-average_model#ARMA_model ) the ARMA(2,1) will only depend on the last two values, and on the last noise variable, when the ARMA(13,9) will consider 13 values to the past and 9 past noise variables. To forecast it all depends on your what you're trying to forecast. If your variables do not depend strongly on lots of values in the past, you can use the ARMA(2,1). It all depends on the nature of what you're trying to predict.
