Coefficients for every group in ordered logistic regression (polr) in R

When running an ordered logistic regression using the polr function of the MASS package (DV is low, medium, high) and have a look at the summary I get βs for every IV and the intercepts for low|medium and medium|high. The predict function for assessing the probabilities ( type='p' ) or the classes ( type='class' ) also works just fine. However I want to calculate the probabilities myself in order to use them with different data sets. If I use the following code for a logistic model with a binary (!) dependent variable , I can exactly replicate the predict - outcome: log_pred logit_model is my glm -object logit_model$zeta[1] is the first intercept logit_model$zeta[2] is the second intercept logit_model$coefficients[1] is the β of IV_1 logit_model$coefficients[2] is the β of IV_2 the only thing I have to do now, to get the predicted probabilities is: log_pred_probs If I understand all the posts on ordered logistic regression I read correctly, the only thing I have to change with a polr object with the 3 "groups" of low, medium, and high would be to: run the log-pred part for each group using their own intercepts, let's call them log_pred1 and log_pred2 and to, then, run the following code (similar to the logistic model above): log_pred_probs1 for "low" log_pred_probs2 for "medium" log_pred_probs3 for "high" I think there are at least two problems ('cause this doesn't work at all): I need the β-coefficients for every level of the dependent variable, and summary(polr-object) does only show the βs for the first group (so does $coefficients ) and I am not sure about the computation of the predicted probabilities for group 3, "high". So these are the questions in short: How do I assess the β-coefficients for every level of the DV in a polr object? And How do I compute the predicted probabilities for every level of the DV myself?
