Another approach is to put the capturing groups inside lookaheads: Regex r = new Regex(@" ]*?user=(? \w+))" + @"(?=[^""<>]*?section=(? \w+))"; If there are only two parameters, there's no reason to prefer this way over the alternation-based approaches suggested by Mike and strager. But if you needed to match three parameters, the other regexes would grow to several times their current length, while this one would only need another lookahead like just like the two existing ones. By the way, contrary to your response to Claus, it matters quite a bit which language you're working in. There's a huge variation in capabilities, syntax, and API from one language to the next.
