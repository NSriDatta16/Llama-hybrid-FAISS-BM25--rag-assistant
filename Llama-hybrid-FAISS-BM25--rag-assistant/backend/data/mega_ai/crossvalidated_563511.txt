In VAEs the conditional distribution $p(x|z)$ is (usually) assumed to be a Gaussian distribution, i.e. $p(x|z)=\mathcal N(x;f_{dec}(z), \sigma^2 I)$ where $\sigma^2$ is a hyperparameter. Hence the first term of ELBO, the logarithm of $p(x|z)$ , would be just a MSE loss between $f_{dec}(z)$ and $x$ . Other assumptions of $p(x|z)$ can be used. For example, when you are dealing with discrete $x$ that can only take values from $\{0,1\}$ , then you would probably assume $p(x|z)$ to be Bernoulli distribution. I guess that will lead to a binary cross entropy loss.
