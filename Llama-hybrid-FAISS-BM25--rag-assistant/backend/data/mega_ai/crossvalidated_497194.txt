Hello me of 6 months ago, answered, exist a lot of tools to apply PCA, in R prcomp() in python with sklearn PCA() , if you want an introduction I recollect these books : https://github.com/sisifo3/PCAIntroduction/tree/main Now, in the question of use Naive Bayes, like a personal thought, I don't think that NB could be a good method for this kind of problem, right now I'm using Deep Neural Networks Specific ResNet151 a pre-trained model in Pytorch
