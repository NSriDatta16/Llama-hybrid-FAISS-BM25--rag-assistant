Is a Type III statistical error just a subset of Type I or II error?

I have recently come across the idea of a type III error through discussion with colleagues. The definition they gave me was something along these lines : "Type III error occurs when you correctly conclude that the two groups are statistically different, but you are wrong about the direction of the difference. Say that a treatment increases some variable. But in your experiment, random sampling leads the value of that variable to be lower (on average) in the treated group, and enough lower that the difference is statistically significant." To me, it sounds like A specific Type II error in a one-sided test Arguably, a specific Type I error in a two-sided test (a form of "False Positive", in the wrong direction) Is type III considered a "real error", just like Type I or II, or just a subset of those two? I did not find literature on the topic.
