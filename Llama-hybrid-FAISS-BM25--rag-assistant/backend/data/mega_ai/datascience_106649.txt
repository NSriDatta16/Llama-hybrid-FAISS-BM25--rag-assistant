If you are just using the CoAtNet.py file it gives this error since it is missing relative imports from other folder in the repository (i.e. the MBConvBlock and ScaledDotProductAttention classes). Make sure to either clone the full repository or copy just the two python files ( SelfAttention.py and MBConv.py ) in which the two classes are defined.
