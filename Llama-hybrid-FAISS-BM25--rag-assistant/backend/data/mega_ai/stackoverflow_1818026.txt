As others have said, you'd probably be best served using MSMQ. I'd take it step further and encourage you to write your service using WCF and deploy it to IIS. It's not exactly easy, but Microsoft has already done so much of the work that you'd like to do. Tom Hollander has a great series of articles on setting up MSMQ, WCF and IIS here: http://blogs.msdn.com/tomholl/archive/2008/07/12/msmq-wcf-and-iis-getting-them-to-play-nice-part-1.aspx
