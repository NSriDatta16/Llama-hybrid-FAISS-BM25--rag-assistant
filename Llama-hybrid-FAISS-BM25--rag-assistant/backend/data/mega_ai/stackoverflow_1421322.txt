How do I sort a list by different parameters at different timed

I have a class named Person with multiple properties, for example: public class Person { private int id; private String name, address; // Many more properties. } A lot of Person -objects are stored in an ArrayList . I want to sort this list by multiple sort parameters, and different from time to time. For instance I might one time want to sort by name ascending and then address descending, and another time just by id descending. And I don't want to create my own sort methods (i.e., I want to use Collections.sort(personList, someComparator) . What is the most elegant solution that achieves this?
