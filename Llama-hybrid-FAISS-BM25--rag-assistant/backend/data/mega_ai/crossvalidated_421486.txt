Transformed variable interpretation

In the analysis of my data, the dependent variable was non normally distributed. I used the two-steps approach by Templeton to transform the variable, and the normality was met. NOW: In the interpretation the results and reporting the descriptive results, which variable I should use (I mean the original one or the transformed one?)? And for the binary logistic regression, I need to create two categories. So, should I use the original variable or transformed variable to obtain the two categories for the logistic regression? Thank you for each try to help.
