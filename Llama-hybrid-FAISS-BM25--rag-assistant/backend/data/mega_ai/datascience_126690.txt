What feature selection method is best for a multi class classification problem with one-hot-encoded columns?

I am trying to solve a multi-class classification involving prediction the outcome of a football match (target variable = Win, Lose or Draw). With a dataset of 2280 rows, which is 6 seasons of football data. I have features with both numerical and categorical values (which I have encoded using one encoding). However, after doing research online I am getting mixed answers on if I should perform feature selection before or after one hot encoding. And also what specific feature selection methods are my best option. Before one hot encoding I get 25 features and after 128 features. When training several different machine learning models without any feature selection and all 128 features, I get some good results mainly with a decision tree, SVM and custom neural network, which I achieve higher 90% accuracy for all 3. With na√Øve bayes and KNN I get around 60%. However, I have read here: https://machinelearningmastery.com/feature-selection-with-real-and-categorical-data/ where it mentions the best feature selection method based on if a the input data is categorical or numeric. However in my situation it is technically both.
