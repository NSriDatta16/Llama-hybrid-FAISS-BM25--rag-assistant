Specifically for your example: You don't want user information like name and address stored in the same table as the login and password information, because this way you can grant someone in your organization permission on the user info table, and not on the login data table. I don't agree with the others on the "too many fields for one table" subject. If there's many fields, and you don't need them all in your form or report, you can select just the fields you need with sql, or even use a view to make sure you don't get too much data.
