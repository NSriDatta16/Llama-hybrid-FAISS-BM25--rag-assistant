to four hours, spending approximately 16 person-hours in total. Using these scenarios and COAs, the user had CADET generate automatically detailed plans and express them as synchronization matrices. The user, a retired US Army officer, reviewed and slightly edited the matrices. The entire process took less than two minutes of computations by and approximately 20 minutes of review and post-editing, approximately 0.4 person-hour in total per product. The experimenters gave the resulting matrices the same visual style as those produced by humans. The judges, who did not know whether a planning product was a traditional product of humans, or with computerized aids, were asked to grade the products. The result was that the average grades for manual products and CADET-generated products were statistically indistinguishable, even though CADET-generated products required far less time to produce. Legacy CADET served as “...an example of how even relatively basic AI systems can potentially affect the implementation of IHL during the military decision-making process.” In early 2000s, CADET influenced the DARPA RAID program (started 2004). The RAID program in turn produced a technology adopted by the Army and the United Sattes Marine Corps. Criticisms It was argued that in the CADET approach “...the decision-making of the process is obscured, and unaccountable,” and optimality of the planning process is traded for speed. == References ==
