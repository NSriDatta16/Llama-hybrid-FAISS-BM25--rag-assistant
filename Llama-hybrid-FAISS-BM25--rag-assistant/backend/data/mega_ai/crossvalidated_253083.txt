I think your testing provided all the information you need. You are in an ambiguous situation whereby one sample is explicitly Normally distributed. Meanwhile, the second one apparently is not but is probably way too small to statistically test whether it is truly Normally distributed or not. You have done the right thing anyway. And, that is to test whether the average of the two samples are different using both parametric and nonparametric tests. Your situation is very common (ambivalence whether the samples are truly Normally distributed or not). Therefore, testing such hypothesis both ways is most often the best way to go. The three tests you have used cover the whole range of underlying statistical assumptions from the unpaired Student t test that assumes that your data is Normally distributed and that your samples have reasonably similar variances to the Welch's test that relaxes the assumption of equal variance (can handle unequal variance) and the Mann-Whitney test that does not assume the underlying data is Normally distributed. The three tests directionally tell you the same thing. Category B's average is greater than Category A's average (at different Alpha threshold levels). Granted two of the tests are associated with p-values meeting standard statistically significant thresholds. And, one of the tests (Welch) has a p-value a bit greater than that. I think the divergence, of the Welch test in particular, is due in good part to the small size of the respective samples more than the lack of a true difference between the two groups averages. Heck, Category B average is more than 3 x greater than Category A. So, this difference is very material. Keep in mind that in various statistical testing it is very common for tests to have different sensitivities and generate diverging outcome in terms of statistical significance.
