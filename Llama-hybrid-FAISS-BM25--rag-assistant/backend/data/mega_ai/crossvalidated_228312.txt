Which stats test to use for the following data?

A hypothetical study I am creating focuses on whether deer assess each other's fighting prowess based on their antler size. For a sample size of 20, whereby I have all 20 deer antler measurements (this is more than one factor and will be length, width and number of points), I would like to assess different levels of interaction with other deer. To clarify, deer A who has 3 antler points, 12cm length and 3 width has 3 ignore him, 4 get within 5 metres, 6 engage in parallel walking, and the remainder engaging in full battle. I then want to compare whether this deer is approached for fights more than the remaining 19 deer, based on the different features of their antlers and the differing levels of interactions. Does anyone know what statistics test would be best for SPSS? This paper is primarily based on animal behaviour and statistics is not a focus, but of course accuracy and insight would be great. I'm a basic statistician so simple terms would be appreciated, and please do remember I will not need to run the test, merely state what I would do. EDIT - Through research and my statistics class notes, my current thoughts are that multinomial logistic regression might work? Or, a Spearmans Correlation?
