PNG Encoder - Add own filter implementation

I am currently working on my own implementation of a PNG Filter. I am using a Neural Network to try to create a better prediction than the current existing PNG Filters: 0 - None 1 - Sub 2 - Up 3 - Average 4 - Paeth 5 - My Implementation (with Neural Network prediction) For further info: http://www.w3.org/TR/PNG/#9Filters I already looked at several Libraries: pngcrush (is implemented in c..) Keypoint - PngEncoder (is my current favourite) ObjectPlanet - PngEncoder (I have to pay 1000$ for the src.. :P) There are some more. But my question is now, do you know some other PNG Encoders (written in Java) where it is easy possible to add an own implementation of a filter or are there any other possibilities to use my own filter? Thanks very much for your answers!
