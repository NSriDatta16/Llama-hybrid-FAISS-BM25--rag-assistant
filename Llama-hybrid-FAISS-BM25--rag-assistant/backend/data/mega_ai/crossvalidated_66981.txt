You might want to look at Forecasting hourly time series with daily, weekly & annual periodicity for a discussion of hourly data involving daily data and holidays/regressors. You have 5 years of data while the other discussion involved 883 daily values. What I would suggest is that you could build an hourly forecast incorporating regressors such as day-of-the-week; week-of-the-year and holidays using daily totals as an additional predictor. In this way you would have 24 model for each of the 3,000 companies. Now what you want to do is by hour, estimate the 3,000 models using a common ARIMAX structure accounting for the pattern of response around each of the regressors, the day-of-the-week, changes in the day-of-the-week parameters and weekly indicators while isolating outliers. Then you could estimate the parameters globally using all 3000 companies. Perform a Chow Test http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chow_test for constancy of parameters and upon rejection cluster the companies into homogenous groups . I have referred to this as single dimension cluster analysis. Since SPSS has very limited capabilities in time series you might want to look elsehere for software.
