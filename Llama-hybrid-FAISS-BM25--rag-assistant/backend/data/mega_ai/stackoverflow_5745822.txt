Open a "Help" page after Chrome extension is installed first time

I am new to Chrome extension. I have a question about how to make the extension to open a "Help" page automatically after installation. Currently, I am able to check whether the extension is running the first time or not by saving a value into localStorage. But this checking is only carried out when using click the icon on the tool bar. Just wondering if there is a way that likes FF extension which uses the javascript in to open a help page after the installation. Thanks. Edit: Thanks for the answer from davgothic. I have solved this problem. I have another question about the popup. My extension checks the url of current tab, if OK(url){ //open a tab and do something } else{ //display popup } Is it possible to show the popup in this way?
