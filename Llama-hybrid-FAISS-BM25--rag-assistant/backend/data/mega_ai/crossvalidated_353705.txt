Solving the SVM problem by inspection By inspection we can see that the boundary decision line is the function $x_2 = x_1 - 3$ . Using the formula $w^T x + b = 0$ we can obtain a first guess of the parameters as $$ w = [1,-1] \ \ b = -3$$ Using these values we would obtain the following width between the support vectors: $\frac{2}{\sqrt{2}} = \sqrt{2}$ . Again by inspection we see that the width between the support vectors is in fact of length $4 \sqrt{2}$ meaning that these values are incorrect. Recall that scaling the boundary by a factor of $c$ does not change the boundary line, hence we can generalize the equation as $$ cx_1 - xc_2 - 3c = 0$$ $$ w = [c,-c] \ \ b = -3c$$ Plugging back into the equation for the width we get \begin{aligned} \frac{2}{||w||} & = 4 \sqrt{2} \\ \frac{2}{\sqrt{2}c} & = 4 \sqrt{2} \\ c = \frac{1}{4} \end{aligned} Hence the parameters are in fact $$ w = [\frac{1}{4},-\frac{1}{4}] \ \ b = -\frac{3}{4}$$ To find the values of $\alpha_i$ we can use the following two constraints which come from the dual problem: $$ w = \sum_i^m \alpha_i y^{(i)} x^{(i)} $$ $$\sum_i^m \alpha_i y^{(i)} = 0 $$ And using the fact that $\alpha_i \geq 0$ for support vectors only (i.e. 3 vectors in this case) we obtain the system of simultaneous linear equations: \begin{aligned} \begin{bmatrix} 6 \alpha_1 - 2 \alpha_2 - 3 \alpha_3 \\ -1 \alpha_1 - 3 \alpha_2 - 4 \alpha_3 \\ 1 \alpha_1 - 2 \alpha_2 - 1 \alpha_3 \end{bmatrix} & = \begin{bmatrix} 1/4 \\ -1/4 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \\ \alpha & = \begin{bmatrix} 1/16 \\ 1/16 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix} \end{aligned} Source https://ai6034.mit.edu/wiki/images/SVM_and_Boosting.pdf Full post here
