You need a permanent storage, not cache or something like that. If your application doesn't use a database already, there are several options you can choose from: write to a text file, a simple one line entry or preferably in a format like xml, json write to a light storage engine like sqlite, simple storage (Amazon S3) If your app uses a database already, why not store that data in a separate table?
