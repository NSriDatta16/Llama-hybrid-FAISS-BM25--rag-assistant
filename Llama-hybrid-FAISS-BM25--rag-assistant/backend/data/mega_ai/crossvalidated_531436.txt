If the distribution of the data is unknown, the Bayesian way of handling this uncertainty is to put a prior on it. There exists a huge literature on Bayesian non-parametrics , including the Fundamentals of Nonparametric Bayesian inference by Ghosal and van der Vaart . The default priors in such settings are distributions on distributions, like Dirichlet processes. Check e.g. the webpage Tutorials on Bayesian Nonparametrics , maintained by Peter Orbanz . Here is a list of seminal papers given to our students. Concerning MCMC, there exist MCMC algorithms that handle Bayesian nonparametrics as well. See e.g. this book by Dey et al. Check also the dirichlet-process tag on this forum. A milder solution is to use Bayesian model averaging , that is, to list all (!) the plausible families that could fit the data, choose a reference prior on each, and use the posterior mixture for quantities of interest [common to all families].
