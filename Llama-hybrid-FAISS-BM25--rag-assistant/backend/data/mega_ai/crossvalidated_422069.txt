I have looked at data on durations of eruptions of Old Faithful geyser collected during the summers of 1978 and 1979. (There have been several earthquakes nearby since then, so the underground 'plumbing' of the geyser, and hence behavior of eruptions may be different now.) Although 222 eruptions were observed, only 205 of them were adjacent pairs, and we focus on those. (Data were not collected at night.) A histogram of durations is bi-modal. Somewhat arbitrarily, eruptions shorter than 3 min. in length are called Short (0) and others Long (1). We can model eruption lengths $X_i$ as a 2-state homogeneous Markov chain. Based on counts, one can estimate: $$p_{01} = \alpha = P(X_{n} = 1\,|\, X_{n-1} = 0) = 1$$ and $$p_{10} = \beta = P(X_{n} = 0\,|\, X_{n-1} = 1) = 0.44.$$ The stationary distribution (hence the limiting distribution) of this ergodic chain can be shown to be $$\sigma = \left(\frac{\beta}{\alpha+\beta}, \frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}\right) = (0.3056, 0.6944).$$ This is in good agreement with the 69.8% of long eruptions in the original data. Notes: [a] I have heard theories (based on two underground reservoirs of hot water, with either one or both emptied in any eruption), but I have not seen them confirmed. [b] I have seen regression analyses that attempt to predict the waiting time for the next eruption, based on the duration and waiting time for the preceding eruption. Predictions of waiting times between eruptions based on regression have been useful for park visitors, trying to view eruptions. However, to the extent that these regressions depend on independent sequences of events for the predictor variables, they may not be exactly correct---we have successfully modeled durations of eruptions as Markovian, not independent. Waiting times also seem not to be independent. [c] The dataset I used is a classic one, with data collected by park rangers, reported in Weisberg, S. (1985), Applied linear regression, Wiley. Various websites have undertaken to report data on contemporary eruptions of Old Faithful geyser. I do not know what data you are using.
