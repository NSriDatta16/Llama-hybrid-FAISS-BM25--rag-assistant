If you have a country with complete data, you might use it as the "base" country, as suggested in another answer. If all of them are incomplete, things are a bit more complex. I would impute all missing prices using the EM algortihm (see, for instance, R package norm ) and then use the completed data as per the suggestion above. I am assuming that you have data for a single point in time; if you have data for different times, then perhaps the methodology in CASTROVIEJO, P.M. y TUSELL, F. (2007) Using redundant and incomplete time series for the estimation of cost of living indices, Review of Income and Wealth , vol. 53 , p. 673-691. can be of help.
