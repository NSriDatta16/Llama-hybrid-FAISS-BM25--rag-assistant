I take you have some users. I suggest asking them what they would like in colors. Aside from that, to deliver data effectively you have to keep visual clutter to a minimum. Gray is a time-tested agent for helping with that. I see from your comment that gray is despised. Well, you could spell it "grey" -- British-isms are are classic chic. Seriously, you need to go for three pastels in this situation.
