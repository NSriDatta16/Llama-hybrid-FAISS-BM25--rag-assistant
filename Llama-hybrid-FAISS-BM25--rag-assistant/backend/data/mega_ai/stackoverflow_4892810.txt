Since I began in Android, I have always created my own preference activities. It seems really difficult because there is not much documentation on the internet on how to do it, but it is, in fact, really quite simple. As you said, it gives you a lot more freedom in deciding exactly how your UI looks and acts. Just in case you're wondering how to do preferences yourself, here's a little simple snippet: public class myprefs extends Activity{ private static final String PREFS_XML = "prefs_xml"; private static final String PREF_1 = "pref_1"; String preference; private SharedPreferences preferences = null; public void loadPrefs(){ preferences = this.getSharedPreferences(PREFS_XML, Activity.MODE_PRIVATE); preference = preferences.getString(PREF_1, "default value"); } } That's pretty much how simple it is to get your own preferences. To set them you use preferences.edit().putString(PREF_1, "hello!").commit(); That can be put into an onClick, onItemSelected, or any other 'event' you want to put it into. I made 'preferences' a class wide instance so that I can access it anywhere in the class without having to re-instantiate it. I hope this helps you out a little bit. As a specific answer to your specific question, I would think your plan is perfectly reasonable.
