How to prevent pinch gesture in MPMoviePlayerViewController?

As MPMoviePlayerViewController supports pinch gesture ( two fingers move apart ) to make the movie player full screen, is there any method to remove this gesture? Because if I use the gesture, the movie is still playing without the video. I think the view of movie controller is removed from super view. I tried overriding touchesBegan and the notification WillEnterFullScreenNotification & DidEnterFullScreenNotfication , but it didn't work.
