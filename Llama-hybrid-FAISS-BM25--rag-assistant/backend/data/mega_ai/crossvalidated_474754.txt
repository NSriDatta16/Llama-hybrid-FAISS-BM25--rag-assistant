Reducing training dataset for architecture testing

I want to quickly test many CNN architectures on the MNIST dataset, but I don't want to train each on the whole dataset. Is it possible to reduce the training dataset size and still be able to accurately determine which model is better? If so, what's minimum size I can reduce it to?
