Any time you have logic that might go wrong you should probably write a test for it (if you can). That being said, you can probably have a pass on most of the UI if it truly does not have any hand coded logic. There is not much point in testing form mappings for each form as long as the form mapping system is either under test or is from Microsoft or some vendor Tragically logic can sometimes leak into the view. A good way to help avoid this is to write functional tests using something like Fitnesse (yes there is a .NET version). Fitnesse is designed to test the app all the way through, as an alternative UI and when done right makes it hard for people to put something in the view. You can also do tests of these sorts in a unit testing framework but I find the seperation to be helpful, plus Business people can help write and run the tests (because they are in wiki format).
