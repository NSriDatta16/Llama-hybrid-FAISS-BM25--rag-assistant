How to test a null hypothesis regarding 2 dichotomous variables?

After an interesting lecture on Bayesian statistics (research master), all 4 males went immediately to the (female) teacher to ask questions. The 8 females did not. I am interested in how to test a two-tailed significance null hypothesis with this, in R . H0: no difference between males and females in talking to teacher yes/no H1: difference between males and females in talking to teacher yes/no What is the correct test? I have a difficulty with this since: unequal group length should we use 2 variables? (male/female and outcome yes or no), or just one which combines? I tried many things, but I can't decide what is the correct way. ( I understand that this is kind of a ridiculous question, and understand the irony for such a test after having had Bayesian statistics, but I am really interested)
