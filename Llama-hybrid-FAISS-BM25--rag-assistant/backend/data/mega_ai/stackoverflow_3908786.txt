There are stuff like bold letters that I prefer to still leverage to html, SEO mainly. But if you combine more than one stile i.e. Bold and Italic it would be good to have an style called accent maybe. But trying to keep style out of html would make you happy (Less stuff to maintain) and your users happy (less code to transfer, they would access slim pages).
