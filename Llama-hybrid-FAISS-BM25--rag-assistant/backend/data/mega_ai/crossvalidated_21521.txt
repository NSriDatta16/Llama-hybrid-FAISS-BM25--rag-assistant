The Titanic dataset used by Harrell in "Regression Modeling Strategies". I use a simplified version of his analysis when explaining logistic regression, explaining survival using sex, class and age. The Loyn dataset discussed in "Experimental Design and Data Analysis for Biologists" by Gerry Quinn and Mick Keough contains nice problems requiring transformation for multiple linear regression.
