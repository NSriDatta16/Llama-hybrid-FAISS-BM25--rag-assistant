! Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup. latex

hey, I met these latex format problem, anyone can offer some help? the .tex file: \begin{table}{} \renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.1} \caption{Cambridge Flow feature definition and description} \label{cambridge-feature}} \centering \begin{tabular}{|c|c|} \hline\bfseries Abbreviation &\bfseries Description\\ \hline serv-port & Server port\\ \hline clnt-port & Client port\\ \hline push-pkts-serv & count of all packets with\\ & push bit set in TCP header (server to client)\\ \hline init-win-bytes-clnt & the total number of bytes \\ & sent in initial window (client to server)\\ \hline init-win-bytes-serv & the total number of bytes sent\\ & in initial window (server to client)\\ \hline avg-seg-size-clnt & average segment size: \\ & data bytes devided by number of packets\\ \hline IP-bytes-med-clnt & median of total bytes in IP packet\\ \hline act-data-pkt-serv & count of packet with at least one byte \\ & of TCP data playload (server to client)\\ \hline data-bytes-var-clnt & variance of total \\ & bytes in packets (client to server)\\ \hline min-seg-size-serv & minimum segment size \\ & observed (server to client)\\ \hline RTT-samples-serv & total number of RTT samples\\ & found (server to client),\\ & {\bf see also \cite{Moore05discriminators}}\\ \hline push-pkts-clnt & count of all packets with push bit set \\ & in TCP header (server to client)\\ \hline \end{tabular} \end{table} and the error message: ! Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup. \@endfloatbox ...pagefalse \outer@nobreak \egroup \color@endbox l.892 \end{table} I've deleted a group-closing symbol because it seems to be spurious, as in $x}$'. But perhaps the } is legitimate and you forgot something else, as in \hbox{$x}'. In such cases the way to recover is to insert both the forgotten and the deleted material, e.g., by typing `I$}'. there is no $ in my table, also this { are matching with the }, and also after I comment the citation, the error remains. anyone can offer help? really appreciate all the comments! ! Extra }, or forgotten \endgroup.
