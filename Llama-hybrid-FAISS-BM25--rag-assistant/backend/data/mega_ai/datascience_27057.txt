Automated Hyperparameter tuning

Are there any advanced packages that allow automated hyperparameter tuning for neural networks and traditional machine learning algorithms like XGBoost, random forest (using method like Bayesian, random search etc. that could allow for faster discovery of the optimal parameters)? I have heard of hyperopt, but it seems there are some problems , and I am not sure it can train traditional machine learning algorithms?
