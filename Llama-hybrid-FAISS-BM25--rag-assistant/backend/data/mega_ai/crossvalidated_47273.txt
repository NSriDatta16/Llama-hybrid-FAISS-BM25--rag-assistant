I believe what you are looking for is known as "bagging", a portmanteau of "boostrap aggregation". Indeed, the Random Forest algorithm is sometimes referred to as the bagged trees algorithm. There are various implementations of this, for instance the R library CARET provides a framework for creating bagging models from any base model of your choice (such as SVM, logistic regression or whatever else you like).
