For a much smaller number of properties, consider a log-linear model , or perhaps some other generalized linear model depending on the underlying process generating your data. Specifically, each of the "properties" of interest should be considered a binary variable (presence vs absence of property). Note that this approach can flexibly handle variables with any number of categories. The gist of this approach is that you are modeling log cell counts in the P-way table based on the P variables used. Your question number (1) involves testing for interactions between the variables. Your question (2) would involve creating a new categorical variable based on group membership, and testing whether or not this new variable is significantly related to log cell count. Depending upon your objectives, you should look into latent class models . This is similar to PCA, but adapted to categorical variables. If you would indeed rather use a large number of variables as stated in your question, this will combine the initial variables in an optimal way, thereby reducing them down to a smaller number of varibles that captures as large a proportion of the total variance as possible. This may help achieving your objective (1), as you can see which variables get grouped together.
