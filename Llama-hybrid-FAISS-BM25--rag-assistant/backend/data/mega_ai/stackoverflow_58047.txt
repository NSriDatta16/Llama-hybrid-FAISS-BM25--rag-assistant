We have been using Flexjson for converting Java objects to JSON and have found it very easy to use. http://flexjson.sourceforge.net Here are some examples: public String searchCars() { List cars = carsService.getCars(manufacturerId); return new JSONSerializer().serialize(cars); } It has some cool features such as deepSerialize to send the entire graph and it doesn't break with bi directional relationships. new JSONSerializer().deepSerialize(user); Formatting dates on the server side is often handy too new JSONSerializer().transform( new DateTransformer("dd/MM/yyyy"),"startDate","endDate" ).serialize(contract);
