It is possible to do exactly that with MS projects, just think about your company as a big project, and each projects as tasks on which ressources are assigned. Still I wouldn't recommend MS project because it doesn't scale well, but if you only want to make a gantt chart in order to support your point, it will do a good job. In my experience, people managing multiple projects use custom excel sheet and it usually do the job well. Exemple: Timeline in the first columns, one column per ressource per projects, drop down for actual ressource.
