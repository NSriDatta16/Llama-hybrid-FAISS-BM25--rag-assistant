How to detect when a drawable is touched

I'm working on an app that has a canvas with a bunch of little images that the user can drag around, and a "box" that the user will drag from to create new image objects or drag an existing image to it, and it will remove it. What is the best way to detect if the user has touched an area, or an image on the screen? The first thing that comes to mind is obviously comparing the touch coordinates with each object's coordinates, but that seems a little cumbersome. Is there a better, or built in way? Thanks
