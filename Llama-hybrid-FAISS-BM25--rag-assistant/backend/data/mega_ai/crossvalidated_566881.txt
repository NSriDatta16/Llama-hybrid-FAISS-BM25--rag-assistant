How to compare two PCA results?

I have two datasets which contains the same samples, but have different measures. I wanted to test which measures were better to separate the groups in a PCA. Thus, I plotted a PCA for both datasets and observed that one dataset had a better clustering. The question is: Is there a quantitative measure that could indicate which PCA is better? Why I want it: I want to demonstrate using the PCA that one type of measure is better than the other to cluster the groups.
