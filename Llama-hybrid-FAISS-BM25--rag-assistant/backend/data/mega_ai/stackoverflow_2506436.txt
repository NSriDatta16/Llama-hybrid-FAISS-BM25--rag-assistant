Touch and Drag from one view to another

I've search for some clues on this problem without much success. Hope someone can kick me in the right direction. I am prototyping a couple of apps where I need to design my own GUI. The GUI is made up by two separated UIViews where one of them contains a small thumb of an image. I want to be able to drag this thumb from the first view to the other. Simple as that! But I haven't figured out how this is done. Here is the exact flow I am looking for: touch the thumb animate a small enlargement of the thumb drag the thumb to the other UIView drop the thumb animate a shrink of the thumb Not particularly strange, but the thumb remains related to the first view all the time. I've tried to move the thumb via the first views superview and then back to the second view, but with no luck.
