The main advantage of NoSQL is horizontal scalability and distributed storage. That means you can have a large number of 'cluster nodes' and write to them in parallel. The cluster will ensure changes are propagated to the other cluster nodes eventually (eventual consistency). NoSQL is not so much about SQL (the term means "not only SQL"). In fact, some NoSQL products do support a subset of SQL. The reason the data format is different (JSON or list of property / value pairs versus tabular data) is: within relational databases, the number of columns (and column names) is defined in a central place, which doesn't work well with horizontal scalability (you would need to stop all cluster nodes for schema changes). Also, joins are not supported as much because that would break horizontal scalability (data from multiple cluster nodes may need to be read, if the data is distributed).
