You know what, I was just working on this yesterday, so here you go with a little bonus animation: - (void)previewImageTouchUpInside:(UIButton*)aButton { if (!previewImageDragged) { [self selectPreviewImage:aButton]; return; } previewImageDragged = NO; // If user drag photo a little and then release, we'll still treat it as a tap // instead of drag if ((originalPositionOfButton.x - aButton.center.x) * (originalPositionOfButton.x - aButton.center.x) + (originalPositionOfButton.y - aButton.center.y) * (originalPositionOfButton.y - aButton.center.y) It still has a few magic numbers and I haven't renamed the functions and variables to suit your example, but it should be clear. I also did the indentation here since I don't manually break long lines in my code.
