I had to do exactly this with the IG WebGrid a few years back, and it was ... shall we say ... painful. However, the WebGrid had the advantage of a single render point -- once the HTML was emitted, we were set! For dealing with this in WinGrid, I tried a variety of different events, both on the grid and the datasource, and met with abject failure every step of the way. The only event I got to work was Paint , which will likely create a performance issue. For Paint , here's what I hacked together. I'm not proud of this code, and I likely wouldn't put it in production, but here it is anyway (C#): private void UltraGrid1_Paint(object sender, System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs e) { foreach (UltraGridRow r in UltraGrid1.Rows) { foreach (UltraGridCell c in r.Cells) { if (c.Text == "foo") c.Appearance.BackColor = Color.Green; } } } and VB: Private Sub UltraGrid1_Paint(ByVal sender As System.Object, ByVal e As System.Windows.Forms.PaintEventArgs) Handles UltraGrid1.Paint For Each r As UltraGridRow In UltraGrid1.Rows For Each c As UltraGridCell In r.Cells If c.Text = "foo" Then c.Appearance.BackColor = Color.Green End If Next Next End Sub
