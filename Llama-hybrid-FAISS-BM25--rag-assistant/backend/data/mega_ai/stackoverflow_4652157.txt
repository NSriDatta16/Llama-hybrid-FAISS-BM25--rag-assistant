Storage size of 'var' isn't known

I have a program which works fine under VC++, but is giving me an error under GCC. within log.h : namespace logType { enum Enum { None = 0, Info, Warning, Error, }; std::string Name[]; } within log.cpp : std::string logType::Name[] = { "None", "Info", "WARNING", "ERROR" }; This works fine when I compile log.cpp. However, if any other file includes log.h, that file errors out: error: storage size of ‘logType::Name’ isn't known I've tried specifying the array size for Name[] in one or both of the files, but that just changes the error to that of redeclaration. How do I get this to cooperate under GCC?
