You cannot do this for security reasons: Silverlight-based applications do not use the file system of the operating system and are restricted to using isolated storage to persist and access files, so this namespace [System.IO] does not provide any additional functionality. For more information about how Silverlight-based applications use isolated storage, see Isolated Storage . If possible, you might want to shift it such that the server does the encoding and the file is made available for download in a traditional manner. If you're encoding for privacy/security consider offering the download only on a secure protocol (HTTPS using SSL).
