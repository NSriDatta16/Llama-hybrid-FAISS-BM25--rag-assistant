I believe you can do this with the OPTIONS Http verb. Also the status code of 300 Multiple Choices could be used if your scenario fits a certain use case. If they send a request with an Accept header of application/xml and you only support text/plain and that representation lives at a distinct URL then you can respond with a 300 and in the Location header the URL of that representation. I realize this might not exactly fit your question, but it's another possible option. And from the HTTP Spec: 10.4.7 406 Not Acceptable The resource identified by the request is only capable of generating response entities which have content characteristics not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request. Unless it was a HEAD request, the response SHOULD include an entity containing a list of available entity characteristics and location(s) from which the user or user agent can choose the one most appropriate. The entity format is specified by the media type given in the Content-Type header field. Depending upon the format and the capabilities of the user agent, selection of the most appropriate choice MAY be performed automatically. However, this specification does not define any standard for such automatic selection. Note: HTTP/1.1 servers are allowed to return responses which are not acceptable according to the accept headers sent in the request. In some cases, this may even be preferable to sending a 406 response. User agents are encouraged to inspect the headers of an incoming response to determine if it is acceptable.
