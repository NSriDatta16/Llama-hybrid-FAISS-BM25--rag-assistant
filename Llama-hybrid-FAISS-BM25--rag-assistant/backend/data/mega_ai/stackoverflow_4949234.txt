As the error message states you need to add an alias for your subquery: SELECT rating_id, average_rating FROM ( SELECT rating_id, AVG(rating_num) AS average_rating FROM ratings GROUP BY rating_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 50 ) AS some_alias WHERE average_rating > 4 The some_alias can be anything - either a descriptive name for the subquery, or else since you never need to refer to the subquery by name you can just use non-descriptive names such as T1 (then T2, T3 etc. if you have other subqueries). Also you can use WHERE in your outer query rather than HAVING.
