This sounds something like what hushmail did. However, there was a major problem in that, since they had the private key of the users (encrypted) they just had to push down a hacked java applet which would transmit the user's password to the server (which they did). A much better solution is to avoid having that private key on the server at all. With the requirement of no local storage, that's out. Why not use symmetric encryption via a pre-shared password? It can be done without storage on the client side. I believe this is what @erickson was saying in his last paragraph.
