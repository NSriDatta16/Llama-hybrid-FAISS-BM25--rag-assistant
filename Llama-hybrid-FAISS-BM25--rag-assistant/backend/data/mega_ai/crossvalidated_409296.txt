How to test whether birds spend more time in specific areas along a time-segmented track?

I have geolocation data on birds with 1 position per day (latitude + longitude) plus I have for each day, a corresponding binary time series that takes values 0 or 1. There is periods of minimum 10 days during which days are zeros followed by period during which days are ones and so forth. ex: > data[1:11, ] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 > data[12:26, ] 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 >data[26:39, ] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 . . . I would like to statistically assess whether the bird is staying more in the same areas in the "1" periods relative to the "0" period. The adehabitatLT package offers ways to segment an animal track in a specified number of segment based on speed for example. But this is not what I want. I want to see if during 1 versus 0, the bird is staying more, or not, in the same area.
