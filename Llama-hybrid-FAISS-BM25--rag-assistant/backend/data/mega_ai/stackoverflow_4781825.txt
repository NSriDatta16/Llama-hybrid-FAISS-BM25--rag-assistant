You could try storing data in a sqlite database - there are lots of examples around the internet about how you can use sqlite database in an android application : http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/data/data-storage.html http://www.screaming-penguin.com/node/7742 or, you could store stuff in xml files http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/x-android/ if you store data in xml or an sqlite database - the data is persistent until you specifically remove it.
