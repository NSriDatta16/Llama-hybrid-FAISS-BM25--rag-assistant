Welcome to Cross Validated! This is a common task in so-called classification problems in machine learning and statistical modeling. While plenty of people will be content to runs the probabilities to the nearest integer (so either zero or one), that puts you in a problematic situation where $0.51$ and $0.49$ are very different, but $0.51$ and $0.91$ are the same. There are two common strictly proper scoring rules that measure the difference between claimed event probability values and the event occurrences: log loss and Brier score. These should work for your task, even if the probabilities are not generated from a machine learning model. In both of these cases, the lower the number, the better, and consider the logarithm to be the natural logarithm. $$ \text{Log Loss}\\ -\sum_i \bigg[y_i\log(p_i)+(1-y_i)\log(1-p_i)\bigg]\\ \text{Brier Score}\\ \sum_i \bigg(y_i-p_i\bigg)^2 $$
