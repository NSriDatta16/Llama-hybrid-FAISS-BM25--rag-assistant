How to correctly interpret results of logistics regression in R?

I ran a logistics regression on my data where I am trying to predict the affect state using the emotions. I am trying to predict SelfReport State (factors are "FLOW" and "NOFLOW") using the values of Anger, Disgust, Fear, Happiness, Sadness, Surprise, Contempt, Valence which are all continuous and belongs to the range [0,100], except valence which is in the range [-100,100]. Data looks like the one below: Below is the piece of code that I am executing using the tutorial from this page . library(ROCR) library(Amelia) library(readxl) library(psych) library(irr) library(dplyr) library(zoo) library(pscl) library(readr) library(openxlsx) # LOGISTIC REGRESSION FOR FLOW flowData $SelfReport SelfReport) # Split Data into Training and Testing in R sample_size = floor(0.8*nrow(flowData)) set.seed(777) # randomly split data in r picked = sample(seq_len(nrow(flowData)),size = sample_size) train = flowData[picked,] test = flowData[-picked,] emoteModel 0.5,"FLOW","NOFLOW") # or should it be other way around, i.e. ifelse(fitted.results > 0.5,"NOFLOW","FLOW") misClasificError However, I am not sure if p here refers to the probability of state being FLOW or NOFLOW. I request you to help me interpret it correctly. UPDATE: It seems like contrasts(flowData$SelfReport) is the one which is helpful here. As per the coding shown below, p is probability of it being NOFLOW. UPDATE: found a bit of info here , but that info is based on his code test. so I can not be sure about how good is it. UPDATE: It seems like contrasts(flowData$SelfReport) is the one which is helpful here. As per the coding shown below, p is probability of it being NOFLOW.
