First: S3VM and LapSVM are NOT label propagation algos. Second: it is never this simple. For the S3VM , you usually need to know the fraction of (+) labels in the unlabelled set. It is certainly true for the TSVM in SvmLin. I don't know if LapSVM will be skewed if the Unlabelled set has a very different balance. I have a blog post on this https://charlesmartin14.wordpress.com/2014/11/01/machine-learning-with-missing-labels-part-3-experiments/
