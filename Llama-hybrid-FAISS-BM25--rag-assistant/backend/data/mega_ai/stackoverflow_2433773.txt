Nested sortable table rows jQuery

I am trying to sort rows of a table, and put them as 'child' elements of a table row I found this: http://code.google.com/p/nestedsortables/ this works with ul li lists, but I want to build it for a table. tablehead somevalue somevalue2 So you could use jquery.sortable() and sort the rows, but I want 'somevalue' to be become a child element of 'somevalue2' if you drag 'somevalue' over 'somevalue2' I don't know if it is possible with a table. Can anyone help me?
