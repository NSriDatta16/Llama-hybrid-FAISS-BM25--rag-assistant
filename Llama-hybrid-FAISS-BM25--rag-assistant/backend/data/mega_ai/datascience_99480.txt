Some unsupervised models use random functions and you might not have the same clusters as before. Nevertheless, you can apply some functions to know the clusters features'ranges and define them with specific labels, so that you can identify future clusters easily (but not the ones out of the ranges, in that case you migh group them in a label "other" and reorganise them later).
