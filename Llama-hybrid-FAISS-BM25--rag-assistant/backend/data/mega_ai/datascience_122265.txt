What is a proven text classification method beyond tfidf+svm?

I'm doing text classification and Tfidf+LinearSVM does pretty well. Do you know a reference which demonstrates another technique that is shown to do better? I'm specifically looking for evidence that another specific model does better, because there are a lot of opinions what should do better, but most of it doesn't, and I'd like to start with something promising based on real evidence.
