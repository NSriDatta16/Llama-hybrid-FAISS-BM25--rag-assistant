Why is Expected value of a random variable equal to the mean

This is a derivation I found online for the mean of a random variable: Let $X_1, X_2, \dots, X_n$ be $n$ independently drawn observations from a distribution with mean $\mu.$ Let $\bar X$ be the mean of these $n$ independent observations: $\bar X = \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n}{n}.$ $$E(\bar X) = E\left( \frac{X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n}{n} \right) \\ = \frac{1}{n}E(X_1 + X_2 + \dots + X_n)\\ = \frac{1}{n} \left( E(X_1) + E(X_2) + \dots + E(X_n)\right)\\ = \frac{1}{n} ( \mu + \mu + \dots + \mu) = \mu$$ Why is $E(X_i) = \mu,$ where $i = 1, 2, \dots, n?$ In other words, if the expected value is the same thing as the average, what do we mean when we talk about the average of a variable (i.e., $E(X_1)=\mu)?$ I'm' not sure if the question is structured well, but even after trying to understand the concept of expected value, I'm not quite able to get it.
