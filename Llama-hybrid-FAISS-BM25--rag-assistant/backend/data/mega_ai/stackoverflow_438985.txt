You don't need public key for this - in fact public key decryption is limited to encrypting other symmetric keys and certificates in practice because its computationally very expensive. You just need a shared secret. Encrypt the webpages using AES (for instance), using a key derived from the passphrase (by hashing). You then have to securely communicate the pass phrase to the user(s) and write some javascript to download the encrypted content, prompt for a passphrase, decrypt the data and incorporate it into the DOM. Its all rather messy and very brittle - only one password for all users, as soon as its compromised you have to replace the stuff on the server and hope against hope that google hasn't cached it... Suggest you move to a real ISP As to the HTML password program you refer to, there's no way to know its not snake-oil or broken... The phrase "best security with strong algorithms" is not exactly encouraging!
