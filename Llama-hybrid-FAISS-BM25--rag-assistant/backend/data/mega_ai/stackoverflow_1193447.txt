Drag and drop what? The thing here is not the behavior. A computer can drag and drop programmatically. The issue here is things computers cannot do, or do well. For instance, recent ideas have suggested orienting images right-side up. Like a dog upside down needing to be flipped vertically, or a stop sign needing to be oriented 45 degrees clock-wise. More complicated images would be children hanging upside down on monkey-bars, etc. Drag-and-drop won't cut it alone. What will you be dragging, and where will you be dropping it ;)
