Excluding standard directories from code coverage results with C++/CLI

I have a Visual Studio 2010 .NET 4 solution with C# projects and a C++/CLI project. I use Visual Studio's built in unit tests and code coverage. Other than the fact that Visual Studio 2010 coverage tool for C++/CLI projects seems to be much weaker than Visual Studio 2008 coverage tool, I get weird results. For example, I get uncovered code in this file: c:\program files (x86)\microsoft visual studio 10.0\vc\include\xstring And some other files in that directory. I want to exclude this code from coverage results. Is there a way to put some exclude attributes on that code? If not, is there a different automatic way to exclude that code from coverage? If not, is there a way to use EXCLUDE option to exclude it? Can it be done automatically within Visual Studio without running the coverage tool from command prompt? Any other solutions?
