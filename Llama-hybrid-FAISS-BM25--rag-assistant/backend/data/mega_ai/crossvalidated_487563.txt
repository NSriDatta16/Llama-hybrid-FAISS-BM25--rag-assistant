Term for exp(beta) from a Gamma-GLM

I have read a lot about interpretation of coefficients from Gamma-GLMs (using a log-link function), e. g. from this thread How to interpret parameters in GLM with family=Gamma , and found this to be very helpful. However, I wonder what is the correct scientific term for the exp(coefficient) from a Gamma-GLM? From my understanding this would describe the ratio between two means, and could therefore be interpreted as a mean-ratio. This should be somewhat similar like when you would compare two odds in a logistic regression and call it an odds-ratio. Is this correct or is there any other more suitable term?
