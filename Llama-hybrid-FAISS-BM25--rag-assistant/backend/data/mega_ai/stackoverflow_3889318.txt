How to query snmp trap through system floating IP?

I have written a snmp-agent, and it can run in system (rhel5). By querying oid from snmp client, it will get snmp trap. But my problem is: if there are two servers(one is stand-by system, one is active system),If I query snmp trap by floating IP , I will get no snmp trap. That is, I have to query by the true(active) IP, not floating IP. My question is : is there a way to query snmp trap through floating IP? How to configure my snmp-agent? Thanks!
