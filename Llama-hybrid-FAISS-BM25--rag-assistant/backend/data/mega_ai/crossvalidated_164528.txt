There is a R package called mobForest which can fit a real random forest for count data. It is based on mod() (model-based recursive partitioning) in the party package. It performs Poisson regression if the family argument is specified as poisson() . The package is no longer in the CRAN repository, but formerly available versions can be obtained from the archive. If you are not restricted to random forest / bagging, a boosting version is also available for count data. That is, gbm (generalized boosted regression models). It can also fit a Poisson model.
