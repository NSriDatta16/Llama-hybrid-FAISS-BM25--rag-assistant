Nested cross-validation is used to avoid optimistically biased estimates of performance that result from using the same cross-validation to set the values of the hyper-parameters of the model (e.g. the regularisation parameter, $C$, and kernel parameters of an SVM) and performance estimation. I wrote a paper on this topic after being rather alarmed by the magnitude of the bias introduced by a seemingly benign short cut often used in the evaluation of kernel machines. I investigated this topic in order to discover why my results were worse than other research groups using similar methods on the same datasets, the reason turned out to be that I was using nested cross-validation and hence didn't benefit from the optimistic bias. G. C. Cawley and N. L. C. Talbot, Over-fitting in model selection and subsequent selection bias in performance evaluation, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 2010. Research, vol. 11, pp. 2079-2107, July 2010. ( http://jmlr.org/papers/volume11/cawley10a/cawley10a.pdf ) The reasons for the bias with illustrative examples and experimental evaluation can be found in the paper, but essentially the point is that if the performance evaluation criterion is used in any way to make choices about the model, then those choices are based on (i) genuine improvements in generalisation performance and (ii) the statistical peculiarities of the particular sample of data on which the performance evaluation criterion is evaluated. In other words, the bias arises because it is possible (all too easy) to over-fit the cross-validation error when tuning the hyper-parameters.
