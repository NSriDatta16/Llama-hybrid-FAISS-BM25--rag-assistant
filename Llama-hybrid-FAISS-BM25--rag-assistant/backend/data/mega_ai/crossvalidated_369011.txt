Yes. A naive and potentially slow approach might be, Create your all cluster combinations. k is for cluster count and n is for number of series. The number of items returned should be n! / k! / (n-k)! . These would be something like potential centers. For each series, calculate distances via DTW for each center in each cluster groups and assign it to the minimum one. For each cluster groups, calculate total distance within individual clusters. Choose the minimum. I used this for a small project. Here is the my repository about Time Series Clustering and my other answer about this.
