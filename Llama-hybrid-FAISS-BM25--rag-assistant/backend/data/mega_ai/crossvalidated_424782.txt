High odds ratio for composite score created by ridge regression

This question is a follow up to one of my previous questions asked on this site. The goal was to create a composite score for biomarkers related to a binary outcome and then use that in a regression to see if the composite score can significantly predict the outcome. I had 30+ biomarkers and I ended up selecting 4 of them which were bivariately ( $p ) related to the outcome. I made a composite of these 4 biomarkers using ridge regression following the helpful answer by EdM . That way I could account for the natural correlation present among these markers and get adjusted $\beta$ 's (adjusting for other biomarkers and covariates like age, sex, etc.). I had 109 complete observations. The coefficients look as follows: > ridge.mod.bestlam coef(ridge.mod.bestlam) 10 x 1 sparse Matrix of class "dgCMatrix" s0 (Intercept) -0.0252900970 Age 0.0003756038 female 0.0603410625 Premorbid_depression -0.0338846415 antidep12 0.0556264177 nGCS_Bestin24 0.0135018439 log_med_IL_10 0.0530590200 log_med_ITAC 0.0478298328 log_med_sIL_6R -0.0881823906 log_med_RANTES 0.0568835030 I multiplied the last 4 coefficients with the respective (scaled) marker values and obtained the composite score that I'd call ILS.ridge here. I used it as an input in a final logistic regression model. The odds ratio was 423.3499, extremely high. I must be doing something wrong but cannot figure it out. I checked the VIF and it was well below 1.5 for all variables. I also provide with the final regression results here. glm(formula = nPTDCategory_m12 ~ Age + factor(female) + factor(nGCS_Bestin24) + factor(Premorbid_depression) + factor(antidep12) + ILS.ridge, family = "binomial", data = data2) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.0708 -0.6266 -0.4577 -0.2850 2.6085 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

Can anyone tell if I'm doing something wrong?
