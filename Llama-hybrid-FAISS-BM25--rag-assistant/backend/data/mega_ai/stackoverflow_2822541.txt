Float as DateTime

SQL Server 2008 I almost have, I think, what I'm looking to do. I'm just trying to fine tune the result. I have a table that stores timestamps of all transactions that occur on the system. I'm writing a query to give an average transaction time. This is what I have so far: With TransTime AS ( select endtime-starttime AS Totaltime from transactiontime where starttime > '2010-05-12' and endtime I'm getting the following result: 1900-01-01 00:00:00.007 I can't figure out how to strip the date off and just display the time, 00:00:00:007. Any help would be appreciated. Thank you.
