The answer is elaboration of my comment, because you asked. The core action of PCA is singular-value decomposition of data matrix X . It is the same thing as eigen-decomposition of square symmetrical matrix X'X : both actions will leave you the same matrix of eigenvectors (which within SVD you call V matrix). This matrix of eigenvectors is the matrix of orthogonal rotation of old axes (columns of X ) into new axes (principal components), and its elements are cosines between these and those. When columns of X are standardized then X'X is a correlation matrix (multiplied by N-1; this multiplication will have no effect on the matrix of eigenvectors). Thus, PCA of standardized data columns is eigen-decomposition of correlation matrix between the data columns. You have 2 standardized data columns. Whenever correlation between them is not exactly zero you will always get eigenvector matrix which is the 45 degree rotation. If the correlation is exactly zero, no rotation is needed and eigenvector matrix is {1,0;0,1}.
