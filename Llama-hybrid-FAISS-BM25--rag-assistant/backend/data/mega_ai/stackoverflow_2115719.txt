jQuery UI draggable - Custom data disappears

I'm having a weird problem with using jQuery UI Draggable and setting custom data. My code: $('.drag') .data('foo', 'bar') .draggable({ stop: function(event, ui) { var foo = $(this).data('foo'); alert(foo); // alerts 'undefined' } }); It seems it's losing all it's when dragging (console.log'ing $(this).data inside stop() shows an empty object). Is Any ideas? EDIT: Silly silly me, I was doing a $(ui.draggable).remove() inside the drop-function of the droppable i was dragging the object into, so the object was removed before it could get any data. You would think that the draggable's 'stop'-event would be called before the droppable's 'drop' event though...
