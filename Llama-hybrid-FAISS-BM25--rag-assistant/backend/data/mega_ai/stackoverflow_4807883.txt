jQuery UI: smooth slider with one snap (to default value)?

I'd like to make a slider that snaps to the center while retaining smooth action elsewhere. Something like a jQuery version of a real-life speaker balance slider. Is it possible? Or should I just create my own slider with a draggable object, constricted to one axis with containing it frame, snapping to another object (or grid) positioned in the center of the frame? Edit: I simply need a slider that allows values e.g. from -10 to -1, 0, and 1 to 10 (between -1 and 1 snap to 0) with step: 0.1
