In OLS is it methodologically correct to use the variance of a variable as an explanatory variable?

Are some OLS assumptions not satisfied if I use the variance of a variable as a proxy of uncertainty in a regression? For instance, would it be methodologically correct if I use moving averages of rainfall and moving averages of the variance of rainfall in a regression were the dependent variable is production at the farm level? I have not found examples of regressions containing the variance of a variable in the X's so I wonder if that is because there are some modeling issues with that approach. Thank you for your help.
