For me this works fine in Ganymede on OS X. Two ideas: Maybe your install of the Web Developer Tools ( Update Manager -> Ganymede -> Web and Java EE Development -> Web Developer Tools ) is incomplete or missing? Could it be that you are not opening the files with the HTML editor ( Open With -> HTML Editor )?
