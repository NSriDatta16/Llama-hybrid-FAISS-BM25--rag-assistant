In statistics these terms have formal meanings. Likelihood is the function of the unknown parameters that represents the probability of the observed data given the parameters. Confidence refers to the level of coverage for a confidence interval/region as a 95% confidence level means that the prescription for constructing the confidence region would include the true parameter(s) 95% of the time in repeated sampling. After reading the linked document it seems that the authors do not clearly define either term. Their meaning of level of confidence has to do with expert agreement and objective evidence. The greater each is the more confidence you have. Likelihood seems to be related to the formal statistical term but is not defined clearly enough to be sure whether or not they are one in the same. I have to agree with tel about being careful not to confuse the authors terms with the standard statistical terms.
