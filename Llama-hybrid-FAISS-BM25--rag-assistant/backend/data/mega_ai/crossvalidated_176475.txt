Replicating a Neural Network Paper

I have a pretty good understanding of basic concepts in neural networks. I'm looking to replicate the findings of a paper to get a better understanding of some more advanced concepts. I'm open to anything from momentum, deep networks, RNNs, etc. Any suggestions on which papers would be best for this, or even for reading. Google wasn't all that helpful. Bonus points for open datasets and free publications.
