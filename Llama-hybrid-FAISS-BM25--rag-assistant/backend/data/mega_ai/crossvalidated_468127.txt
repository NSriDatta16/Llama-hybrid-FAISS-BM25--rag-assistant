One possible interpretation is the following: Let $p$ be the Boltzmann distribution distribution (i.e. $p(z)\propto\exp(-E(z))$ ), and let $\mu_t$ be the distribution over the units after $t$ iterations of MCMC, e.g. Gibbs sampling, targeting $p$ . One can then show under fairly general circumstances that the quantity $$D_t = KL (\mu_t | p)$$ decreases towards $0$ as $t$ grows. Noting the equivalence between the KL divergence and the free energy, $$KL(q|p) = \mathbf{E}_{q(z)} [ E (z) ] - H (q)$$ where $H$ is the entropy, one can thus argue that the stochastic system is also minimising the free energy, through its evolution.
