How to debug win 32 process to find memory access violation?

I have Agent installed on remote machine, this agent behave like process works in background, the process open socket connection with port number. The problem: this agent was exploited by security company, I am as QA want to find the problem for fix it. I have Perl script that able to connect to the agent by socket connection and send some data to let the agent be : (db8.dc4): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance) . How can I debug the process while sending the data using the script to find this message of the access violation. Maybe to use : windbg or Immunity Debugger ? exception details: (db8.dc4): Access violation - code c0000005 (first chance) First chance exceptions are reported before any exception handling. This exception may be expected and handled. eax=01554b40 ebx=00000000 ecx=01558c66 edx=014a0041 esi=0000139a edi=015537a6 eip=0036cf14 esp=0145e44c ebp=ffffffff iopl=0 nv up ei pl nz na pe nc cs=001b ss=0023 ds=0023 es=0023 fs=003b gs=0000 efl=00010206 mosifs32!os_last_trim_trailing_space+0xb717: 0036cf14 88140e mov byte ptr [esi+ecx],dl ds:0023:0155a000=?? 0:002> k ChildEBP RetAddr WARNING: Stack unwind information not available.
