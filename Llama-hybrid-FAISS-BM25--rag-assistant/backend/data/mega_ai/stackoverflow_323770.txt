I've been working as a contractor for a few years, and this posting shows a few specific instances of reasons I've walked away from jobs. What I want to see in a contract engagement: A strong business sponsor with genuine commitment to the project and the clout to remove obstacles. Evidence of adequate funding and support within the organisation for the project. A line manager who won't drop you in it or interfere in your work to cover their own arse. This is a particular problem as you tend to be reporting directly to people on the first rung of the management ladder who don't really have much clout. For this reason the first point about a strong business sponsor is quite important. Evidence that the project does not have powerful enemies within the organisation. Edit: For the first point, asking who the businss sponsor is and where they live in the organisation is a good start. For the second point, ask for a reasonable market rate and if they quibble, it's a bit of a sign that someone's trying to do it on the cheap. For the third point, the line manager's approach is often apparent from the way the conduct interviews. For the fourth point, ask who might block the project and look for any hesitation in the response. These are not hard and fast rules, but heuristics.
