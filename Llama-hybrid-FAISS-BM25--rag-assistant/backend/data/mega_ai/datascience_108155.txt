You can use the binarization method of image embeddings in image retrieval tasks like https://arxiv.org/pdf/1609.08291.pdf However, binary inputs might be tricky as neural network input. Initialization plays an important role and pure ones and zeros might hinder the model from converging. So, you might need to apply layer normalization or some other technique to stabilize the training.
