I've used the following in a header file occasionally to produce clickable items in the VC6 and recent VS(2003+) compiler ouptut window. Basically, this exploits the fact that items output in the compiler output are essentially being parsed for "PATH(LINENUM): message". This presumes on the Microsoft compiler's treatment of "pragma remind". This isn't quite exactly what you asked... but it might be generally helpful in arriving at something you can get the compiler to emit that some editors might honor. // The following definitions will allow you to insert // clickable items in the output stream of the Microsoft compiler. // The error and warning variants will be reported by the // IDE as actual warnings and errors... which means you can make // them occur in the task list. // In theory, the coding standards could be checked to some extent // in this way and reminders that show up as warnings or even // errors inserted... #define strify0(X) #X #define strify(X) strify0(X) #define remind(S) message(__FILE__ "(" strify( __LINE__ ) ") : " S) // example usage #pragma remind("warning: fake warning") #pragma remind("error: fake error") I haven't tried it in a while but it should still work.
