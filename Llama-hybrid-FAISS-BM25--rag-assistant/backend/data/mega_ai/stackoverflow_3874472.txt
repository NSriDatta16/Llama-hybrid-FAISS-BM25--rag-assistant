Paragraphs vs ordered lists

I Have coded a "terms and conditions" page with numbered paragraphs as follows: 1. content 2. more content 3. even more content as opposed to: content more content even more content I have been told by someone that this is extremely bad practice and is generally wrong . Now, My question to you lot is - why ? This still validates and it is still picked up by search engines etc. Am I being stupid or is the other person just being picky?
