Further to what @Bernhard has noted, you are after the binomial distribution as you have yes/no trials (did they take public transport or not). You might use the Poisson distribution when: The experiment results in outcomes that can be classified as successes or failures. The average number of successes (Î¼) that occurs in a specified region is known. The probability that a success will occur is proportional to the size of the region. The probability that a success will occur in an extremely small region is virtually zero. A way to show the 'no upper limit' might be goals in football (or any sport where the highest score is not limited (e.g. not tennis)). There could be between 0 and any number of goals in a game. You would have an average number of goals in a game though and from that you can calculate the probability of (for example) six goals in a game. Example here .
