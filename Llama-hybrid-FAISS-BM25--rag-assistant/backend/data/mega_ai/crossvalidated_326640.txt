Clustering and Dirichlet process' parameter

I am reading a paper in which they describe a bayesian model in which the prior $a_i$ is defined as a Dirichlet Process (DP). They say: "We use a DP to find the optimal $a_i$ via clustering". Later on they write: "In order to divide our customers in clusters we consider the posterior estimates of the non parametric $a_i$ that induces a partition on the dataset. For each iteration [of the chain] we have a partition of our clients with respect to number of clusters" Can someone explain? I see a contradiction here, because as I undestrand it, DP can be used for clustering in the sense that I claim that two customers are in the same cluster if tehy have the same $a_i$. But then I don't undestrand the first quote.
