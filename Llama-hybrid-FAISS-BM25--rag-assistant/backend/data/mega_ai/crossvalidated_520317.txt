It depends on the unit your weights are associated with. From what I can understand from the question, your weight vector may be associated in two ways: Weights are associated with y-axis (i.e. rate): In this case you need to multiply the individual weights with the x-length of your individual rectangles, and your average becomes (9*35.2*0.21) + (41*13*0.07) + (24.6*112*0.67) + (43.3*5.6*0.035) -------------------------------------------------------------------------- (35.2*0.21 + 13*0.07 + 112*0.67 + 5.6*0.035) This is because no matter how many layers of weights you want to apply, they have a multiplicative effect. Weights are associated with rectangles (i.e. their areas): Here your intention would be to calculate weighted average area of the rectangles (e.g. distance in a speed-time setting), and your average becomes (9*35.2*0.21) + (41*13*0.07) + (24.6*112*0.67) + (43.3*5.6*0.035) -------------------------------------------------------------------------- (0.21 + 0.07 + 0.67 + 0.035) Basically, the length of x-axis is no more acting as a weight in this case and has been removed from the denominator.
