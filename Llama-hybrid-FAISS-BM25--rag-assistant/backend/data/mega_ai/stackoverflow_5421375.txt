"Your main program should only have declarations and calls to global functions," I believe your instructor is encouraging you to divide your code into individual subroutines, each of which does only one thing. In that style, a typical main might be: int main() { MyDataStruct x; ReadInput(x); ProcessData(x); WriteOutput(x); } Notice that there are no for loops in main , no add-up-the-sales-and-copmute-the-tax expressions, nothing in main that requires any processing at all. All of the good stuff is either in your global functions or the methods of your data structures. Applying that to your program, your main might look like: int globalExitFlag; int main() { Queue q; Car c; while( !globalExitFlag ) { int cmd; cmd = PrintMenuAndAcceptOneAnswer(q, c); DoOneCommand(q, c, cmd); } } Then you can put the guts of your cin reading in PrintMenuAndAcceptOneAnswer , while the printing and queue manipulation lives in DoOneCommand . Of course, you have to write PrintMenuAndAcceptOneAnswer and DoOneCommand yourself. I would further break down those subroutines -- for example, DoOneCommand should call DoPrintAllCars , DoExit , DoParkOneCar , etc. Finally, I did put a while in this main() , which I think is appropriate. Notice the global variable. I assume that when you process the "exit" command, you'll set that variable to indicate the processing should end. Good luck, and come back to tell us how your assignment works out for you.
