Can PCA scores be used as dependent variable?

I am working on a research project where I have several questions from a survey data that measures the same underlying quantity (my dv), possibly each with some measurement error. I was thinking about using PCA method to extract the most relevant component. My initial analysis turns out to give what I wanted, but I'm not sure if this is a generally accepted practice in statistics. Could someone let me know if there is any problem with this, and if there is any publication that has taken a similar approach? Thanks a lot
