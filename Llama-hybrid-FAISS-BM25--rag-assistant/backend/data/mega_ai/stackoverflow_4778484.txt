ASIHTTPRequest objects store the user information in a "session" by default, you have to disable this feature on every request you create to get the behavior that you want. From the website docs: NSURL *url = [NSURL URLWithString:@"http://allseeing-i.com/top_secret/"]; ASIHTTPRequest *request = [ASIHTTPRequest requestWithURL:url]; [request setUsername:@"username"]; [request setPassword:@"password"]; [request setUseSessionPersistence:NO]; //this is the line that disables storage More on it here .
