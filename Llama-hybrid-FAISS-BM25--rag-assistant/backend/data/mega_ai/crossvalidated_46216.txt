PCA and k-fold cross-validation in caret package in R

I just re-watched a lecture from the Machine Learning course on Coursera. In the section where the professor discusses PCA for pre-processing data in supervised learning applications, he says PCA should only be performed on the training data and then the mapping is used to transform the cross validation and test sets. See also PCA and the train/test split . However, in the caret R package, the training data you pass into the train() function is already processed by PCA. So when the algorithm performs k-fold cross validation, the cross validation set has already been processed with PCA via preProcess() and predict() and is in fact used in the PCA "fitting". Is my understanding of the situation correct? I.e. caret's procedure for cross-validation with PCA (or in fact, with any rescaling/centering method) is "wrong" because the pre-processing of data is performed on the cross-validation set as well as the training set? And if so, how big an impact would this have on the results?
