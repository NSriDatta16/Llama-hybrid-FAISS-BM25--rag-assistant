The problem is that you're re-evaluating $(div) . The first line that operates on the not-yet-added DOM fragment does not update the string value of "div" . Thus, the second time you create $(div) you start back over with the original fragment! Try this: $(div).find('.ps_desc').html(' Hello World ').end().appendTo($('body')); The jQuery .end() method "pops" the effect of the preceding .find() call, so in this case it gets you back to the original point of navigation, which is the fragment you're building from the string. The subsequent call to .appendTo() therefore will act on the outer you've built, and so that should do the right thing.
