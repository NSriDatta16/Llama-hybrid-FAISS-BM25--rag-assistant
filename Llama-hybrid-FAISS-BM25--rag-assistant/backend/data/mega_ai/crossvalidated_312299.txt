That is fairly complicated because you are attempting to use a combination of string inputs to determine the worth. But it's not just that, you are interpreting the portion of value in relation to another title. In the case above, you would need a system to determine that the second book is one within a series described by the first title. That sort of thing requires complex processing to determine. No clue what that looks like from a programmatic standpoint. But your broad process is: Determine what the title is Find relevant titles Extract relevant information about those titles Predict price of the original title The first two steps involve natural language processing (NLP) which then allows you to select the set of features and relevant information to run some predictive analysis against. It is outside of the scope of regression in my opinion and is closer to ML techniques like an neural network of some sort. Seems like a fairly large undertaking
