Consider a simple problem like estimating means of multiple groups. If your model treats them as completely unrelated then the only information you have about each mean is the information within that group. If your model treats their means as somewhat related (such as in some mixed-effects type model) then the estimates will be more precise because information from other groups informs (regularizes, shrinks toward a common mean) the estimate for a given group. That's an example of 'borrowing information'. The notion crops up in actuarial work related to credibility (not necessarily with that specific term of 'borrowing' though borrowing in that sense is explicit in the formulas); this goes back a long way, to at least a century ago, with clear precursors going back to the mid-nineteenth century. For example, see Longley-Cook, L.H. (1962) An introduction to credibility theory PCAS, 49, 194-221. Here's Whitney, 1918 (The Theory of Experience Rating, PCAS, 4, 274-292): Here is a risk, for instance, that is clearly to be classified as a machine shop. In the absence of other information it should therefore fake the machine shop rate, namely, the average rate for all risks of this class. On the other hand the risk has had an experience of its own. If the risk is large, this may be a better guide to its hazard than the class-experience. In any event, whether the risk is large or small, both of these elements have their value as evidence, and both must be taken into account. The difficulty arises from the fact that in general the evidence is contradictory; the problem therefore is to find and apply a criterion which will give each its proper weight. While the term borrowing is absent here the notion of using the group-level information to inform us about this machine shop is clearly there. [The notions remain unchanged when "borrowing strength" and "borrowing information" start to be applied to this situation]
