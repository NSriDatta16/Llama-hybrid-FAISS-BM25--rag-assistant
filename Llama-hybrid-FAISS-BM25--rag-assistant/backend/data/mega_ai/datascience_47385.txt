Variational auto-encoders (VAE): why the random sample?

Why do people train variational auto-encoders (VAE) to encode means and variances (regularised towards 0 and 1), and then sample a random Gaussian, rather that simply encode latent vectors and regularise them to follow a standard N(0,I), which would appear as a more natural choice?
