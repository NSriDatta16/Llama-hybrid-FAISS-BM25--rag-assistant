What you are talking about is a mapping function, I've not come across any predefined mapping functions in vb.net, but you could achieve this in either the manner you have or using a lambda expression, delegates or LINQ. There's a great blog post here on use of delegates for this purpose at http://www.panopticoncentral.net/archive/2006/12/08/18587.aspx The joy of this is it'll work in .NET 2.0 - but it's not nearly as elegant as LINQ which can be used in 3.5 and up... inputList.Select(Function(s) String.Format("{0}{1}", pre, s).ToList();
