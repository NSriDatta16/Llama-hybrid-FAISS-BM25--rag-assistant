Binary predictors with very wide 95% CI in the Logistic Regression

When I fit a binary predictor in the logistic regression model, I got a high odds ratio and a very wide 95% CI (e.g. OR=11, 95% CI [1.5-229.5]; p = 0.041) . My binary predictor is smoking status and my outcome is having the disease or not. The distribution is as follows: smoking+disease: n= 7 ; smoking+non-disease: n= 1 ; non-smoking+disease: n=7 ; non-smoking+non-disease: n = 11 I have never seen this wide 95% CI before and believe it is not correct. What should I do next to fix this issue?
