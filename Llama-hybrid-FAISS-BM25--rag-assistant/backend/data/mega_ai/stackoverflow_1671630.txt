My opinion is that generative music only works when it goes through a rigorous selection process. David Cope, an algorithmic music pioneer, would go through hours of musical output from his algorithms (which I think were mostly Markov Chain based) to pick out the few that actually turned out well. I think this selection process could be automated by modeling the characteristics of a particular musical style. For instance, a "disco" style would award lots of points for a bassline that features offbeats and drum parts with snares on the backbeats but subtract points for heavily dissonant harmonies. The fact is that the music composition process is filled with so many idiomatic practices that they are very difficult to model without specific knowledge of the field.
