There is no "myViewController" property as you know. The easiest way to give any object access to some other object is through a delegate relationship. Define a protocol for the delegate - typically in the module that wants access to the object which will be the delegate, i.e. the view controller @protocol MyViewControllerDelegate - (void)someActionTheViewControllerWillDo; #end Advertise the delegate support in the class implementing it @interface MyViewController : UIViewController ... @end Implement the function you defined as being part of the protocol in the view controller: @implementation MyViewController etc. etc. #pragma mark - #pragma mark MyViewControllerDelegateMethods - (void)someActionTheViewControllerWillDo { NSLog(@"I'm being called from an object that has me as a delegate"); } etc. etc. @end Make a variable in the calling object to store the delegate object @interface MyObject : NSObject { etc. etc. id myDelegate; etc. etc. } Initialize that object MyObject* myObject = [[MyObject alloc] initWithblahblah... myObject.myDelegate = self /* assuming myObject is being created in the view controller... */ In myObject - use the defined protocol to access methods in the delegate object!
