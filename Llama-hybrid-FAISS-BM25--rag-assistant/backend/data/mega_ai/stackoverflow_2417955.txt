It might be possible with masterful excel-fu, but even if it can be done, it's not likely to be more readable than your original solution. The problem is that even after 20+ years, Excel still borks discontinuous ranges. Naming them won't work, array formulas won't work and as you see with SUMPRODUCT, they don't generally work in tuple-wise array functions. Your best bet here is to come up with a custom function. UPDATE You're question got me thinking about how to handle discontinuous ranges. It's not something I've had to deal with much in the past. I didn't have the time to give a better answer when you asked the question but now that I've got a few minutes, I've whipped up a custom function that will do what you want: Function gvSUMPRODUCT(ParamArray rng() As Variant) Dim sumProd As Integer Dim valuesIndex As Integer Dim values() As Double For Each r In rng() For Each c In r.Cells On Error GoTo VBAIsSuchAPainInTheAssSometimes valuesIndex = UBound(values) + 1 On Error GoTo 0 ReDim Preserve values(valuesIndex) values(valuesIndex) = c.Value Next c Next r If valuesIndex Mod 2 = 1 Then For i = 0 To (valuesIndex - 1) / 2 sumProd = sumProd + values(i) * values(i + (valuesIndex + 1) / 2) Next i gvSUMPRODUCT = sumProd Exit Function Else gvSUMPRODUCT = CVErr(xlErrValue) Exit Function End If VBAIsSuchAPainInTheAssSometimes: valuesIndex = 0 Resume Next End Function Some notes: Excel enumerates ranges by column then row so if you have a continuous range where the data is organized by column, you have to select separate ranges: gvSUMPRODUCT(A1:A10,B1:B10) and not gvSUMPRODUCT(A1:B10). The function works by pairwise multiplying the first half of cells with the second and then summing those products: gvSUMPRODUCT(A1,C3,L2,B2,G5,F4) = A1*B2 + C3*G5 + L2*F4. I.e. order matters. You could extend the function to include n-wise multiplication by doing something like gvNSUMPRODUCT(n,ranges). If there are an odd number of cells (not ranges), it returns the #VALUE error.
