Reinforcement Learning and Introduction - Chapter 3 - Continuing vs Episodic Tasks

The exercise 3.5 in the book "Reinforcement Learning - an introduciton" asks for a modified version of eq (3.3) for the episodic tasks. The Equation (3.3) states that, considering all $s'$ and $r$ on a given time, $\sum_{s',r} p(s', r| s, a)=1 $ I fail to see how this rule is changed in the case of episodic tasks. Shouldn't the same apply for continuous and episodic tasks ?
