Structure tag and name, why does a local variable declared as name compile?

In some code I saw recently there was a structure defined like this: typedef struct tagMyStruct { int numberOne; int numberTwo; } MYSTRUCT; The way I understand this, tagMyStruct is the new data type and MYSTRUCT is a variable that is created right there. At another place, this was used like this: MYSTRUCT *pStruct = new MYSTRUCT; and it compiled fine with Visual Studio 2010. How is that valid C++? I thought MYSTRUCT was a variable and not a type?
