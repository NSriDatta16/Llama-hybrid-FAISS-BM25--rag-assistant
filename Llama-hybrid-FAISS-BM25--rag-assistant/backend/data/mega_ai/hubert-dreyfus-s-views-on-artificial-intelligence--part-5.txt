tion, towards new models that are intended to capture more of our unconscious reasoning. Daniel Crevier writes that by 1993, unlike 1965, AI researchers "no longer made the psychological assumption", and had continued forward without it. "Sub-symbolic" AI techniques operate in a way that is superficially similar to what Dreyfus called "sizing up the situation and reacting", but here the "situation" consists of vast amounts of numerical data. Dreyfus agreed in 1992 that these methods can capture some "tendencies" and "attitudes" that he considers essential for intelligence and expertise. Sub-symbolic approaches to AI include: Robotics researchers like Hans Moravec and Rodney Brooks were among the first to realize that unconscious skills would prove to be the most difficult to reverse engineer. (See Moravec's paradox.) Brooks would spearhead a movement in the late 80s that took direct aim at the use of high-level symbols, called Nouvelle AI. The situated movement in robotics research attempts to capture our unconscious skills at perception and attention. (Dreyfus would critique this research program in 2012.) Connectionism, an umbrella term in the 1980s for the research program that included artificial neural networks. In the 1990s, soft computing paradigms allowed machines to "guess" â€“ to make inexact, probabilistic decisions and predictions based on experience and learning. Computational intelligence was a sub-field of AI in the 1990s and early 2000s that collected all these sub-symbolic techniques under one roof. Finally, in the first decades of the 21st century, artificial neural networks were enormously successful, culminating in the dominance of "deep learning" after 2012. All of this research has gone forward without any direct connection to Dreyfus' work. Knowing-how and knowing-that. Research in psychology and economics has been able to show that Dreyfus' (and Heidegger's) arguments about the nature of human problem solving was essentially correct. Daniel Kahnemann and Amos Tversky collected a vast amount of hard evidence that human beings use (at least) two very different methods to solve problems, which they named "system 1" and "system 2". System one, also known as the adaptive unconscious, is fast, intuitive and unconscious. System 2 is slow, logical and deliberate. Their research was collected in the book Thinking, Fast and Slow, and inspired Canadian journalist Malcolm Gladwell's popular book Blink. As with AI, this research was entirely independent of both Dreyfus and Heidegger. Ignored Although clearly AI research has come to agree with aspects of Dreyfus' thought, McCorduck claimed that "my impression is that this progress has taken place piecemeal and in response to tough given problems, and owes nothing to Dreyfus." The AI community, with a few exceptions, chose not to respond to Dreyfus directly. "He's too silly to take seriously" a researcher told Pamela McCorduck. Marvin Minsky said of Dreyfus (and the other critiques coming from philosophy) that "they misunderstand, and should be ignored." When Dreyfus expanded Alchemy and AI to book length and published it as What Computers Can't Do in 1972, no one from the AI community chose to respond (with the exception of a few critical reviews). McCorduck asks "If Dreyfus is so wrong-headed, why haven't the artificial intelligence people made more effort to contradict him?" Part of the problem was the kind of philosophy that Dreyfus used in his critique. Dreyfus was an expert in modern European philosophers (like Heidegger and Merleau-Ponty). AI researchers of the 1960s, by contrast, based their understanding of the human mind on engineering principles and efficient problem solving techniques related to management science. On a fundamental level, they spoke a different language. Edward Feigenbaum complained, "What does he offer us? Phenomenology! That ball of fluff. That cotton candy!" In 1965, there was simply too huge a gap between European philosophy and artifici
