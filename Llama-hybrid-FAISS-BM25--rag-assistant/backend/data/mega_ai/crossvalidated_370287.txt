I think you need to pay attention to what @mdewey is saying: Based on the data you've shown, cont_1 is not really continuous (it only takes on a few values) and is the same variable as cat_1. So, you can't use both cont_1 and cat_1 in any model and PCA can't solve this - the two variables are the same, just with different labels. Almost the same thing happens with Cat_2 (Cont_1 only varies when Cat_2 is GR) Even without that problem you have N of 80. Fitting a model with just Cat_1 is already near the limits of what the data can do. PCA cannot solve this problem. You need more data and you need data that doesn't duplicate itself.
