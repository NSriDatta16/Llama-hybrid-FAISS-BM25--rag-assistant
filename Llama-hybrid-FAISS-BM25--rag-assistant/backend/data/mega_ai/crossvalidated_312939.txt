Basing an FF Neural network on Vector3

I'm having some fun with Unity and neuralnets. At first I've based it on an array of float s. It had 8 inputs and 3 outputs: 2 eye inputs for x,z coords 2 nose inputs for x,z coords 3 wall inputs for a,b,c distances 1 for current health which resulted in 3 floats for movement x,y for direction and a for speed Than I had the idea to use Vector3 's instead of floats. My guess was that this way spatial movement will be more "organic" to the system. Now it takes 4 Vector3's and outputs two. (the seconds magnitude is used for speed) Surprisingly it worked pretty well. Consistently the first 2 generations has members that avoids walls and eats food. Of course not very well, but they are doing things that before needed at least 10-20 generations to reach this level. Is this special? I mean just because I'm feeding in (forward) vectors the output is more reasonable? Float version Vector3 version
