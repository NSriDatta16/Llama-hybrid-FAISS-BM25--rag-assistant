Somewhat of an odd workaround, but you can set the following rules for the second div: { position:relative; top:10px; } Online demo: http://jsbin.com/enala/edit I would also encourage you to consider Doug's Answer . If setting a padding on your parent container produces undesired results, you could fall back on this solution as an alternative.
