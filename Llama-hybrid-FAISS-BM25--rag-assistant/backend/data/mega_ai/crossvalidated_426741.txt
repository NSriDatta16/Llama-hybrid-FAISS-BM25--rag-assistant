Interpretaion Of ordinal logistic regression

I have one variable overall_sentiment with (Positive, Negative, Neutral) three levels. I have one more variable comments_created_at with (Monday, Tuesday, Wed, Thu, Fri, sat, sun) 7 levels. I have to find the relationship between sentiment and days of the week. I have fitted below the ordinal regression model. Can anyone help me to interpret this result? Or any other way to perform this kind of analysis. Call: polr(formula = overall_sentiment ~ comments_created_at, data = Meteor, Hess = TRUE) Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value comments_created_atMon -0.008606 0.03981 -0.2162 comments_created_atSat -0.091378 0.04950 -1.8460 comments_created_atSun -0.189184 0.05357 -3.5315 comments_created_atThu -0.016743 0.03864 -0.4334 comments_created_atTue 0.101762 0.03608 2.8206 comments_created_atWed 0.022987 0.03724 0.6173 Intercepts: Value Std. Error t value negative|neutral -1.2325 0.0289 -42.7141 neutral|positive -0.0855 0.0279 -3.0695 Residual Deviance: 62299.23 AIC: 62315.23 ```
