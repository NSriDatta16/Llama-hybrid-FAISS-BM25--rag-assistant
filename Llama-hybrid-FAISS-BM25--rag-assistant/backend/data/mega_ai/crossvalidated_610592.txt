Providing 95% confidence intervals for VTT calculation using logistic regression coefficients

I appreciate that similar questions have been asked and answered to this, but I think that my case is substantively different as the specific interpretation of the coefficient is not relevant. I have a set of choice experiment results that I am using to calculate the 'Valuation of Travel Time' for the participants. The standard process for doing this is to fit a logistic regression model to the result of whether someone accepts a specific level of compensation for a specific travel time. You can then divide the time coefficient by the compensation one to generate the valuation of travel time (don't worry if doesn't make sense). Hence for the below model: term estimate std.error z value p.value (Intercept) 1.256319853 0.1096819372 11.45420919 2.24E-30 time 0.1015354957 0.003527728861 -28.78211442 3.59E-182 comp 0.1532430136 0.005337402709 28.7111582 2.77E-181 The 'VTT' is (approximately) 0.102/0.153 - which, is £0.67 per minute, or £40 per hour. I want to provide a 95% confidence interval for this valuation and I've been searching for the correct method. My instinct is that it's just: upper limit: time_coef + 1.96 time_SE / comp_coef - 1.96 comp_SE lower limit: time_coef - 1.96 time_SE / comp_coef + 1.96 comp_SE Without a detailed understanding of VTT methodology, does this look correct? Edit - following useful feedback, I can include the covariance table if anyone else is able to use this data to help me validate that I am using the correct method.
