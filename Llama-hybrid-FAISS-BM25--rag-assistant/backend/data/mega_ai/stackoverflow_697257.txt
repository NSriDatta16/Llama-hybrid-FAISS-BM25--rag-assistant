I wrote the following file in Visual Studio 2008 as a new XML file, and it reports the following error. What is the error message about and why it is treated as a wrong format XML file? According to the W3C XML 1.0 Specification , the only characters allowed in an XML document that are below &#x20; are the tab (09), newline (0A) and carriage return (0D). XML 1.1 allows almost all characters , excluding 00, but is very rarely implemented and one should not rely on finding an XML 1.1 implementation. Even in the XML 1.1 Spec. it is said that the use of the now allowed characters below &#x20; "is strongly discouraged".
