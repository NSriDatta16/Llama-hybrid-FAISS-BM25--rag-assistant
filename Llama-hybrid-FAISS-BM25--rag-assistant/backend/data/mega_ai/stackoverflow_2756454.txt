If you look up perlfaq7 you'll find that the answer is to use the overload pragma, though they probably could have given the FAQ question a better name (in my opinion). package SomeThing; use overload '+' => \&myadd, '-' => \&mysub; Basically (assuming $a is an object of the SomeThing class and $b isn't), the above would overload $a + $b to be $a->myadd($b, 0) and $b + $a to $a->myadd($b, 1) (that is, the third argument is a boolean meaning "were the arguments to this operator flipped" and the first-argument-is-self syntax is preserved), and the same for - and mysub . Read the documentation for the full explanation.
