Windows XP is not a realtime system, and I don't think there's a way to guarantee timers in the 10 microsecond range. You can look around in the Microsoft.Ccr.Core library, I think it's the closest you'll get. Edit: I found more information from Microsoft. According to the How To Use QueryPerformanceCounter to Time Code knowledge-base article, Function Units Resolution --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Now, Time, Timer seconds 1 second GetTickCount milliseconds approx. 10 ms TimeGetTime milliseconds approx. 10 ms QueryPerformanceCounter QueryPerformanceFrequency same and that's in the context of an article that starts with the statement: When timing code to identify performance bottlenecks, you want to use the highest resolution timer the system has to offer. Robert Harvey is right, the QueryPerformanceFrequency is in the tens of microseconds range, but I don't think there is a way to use it to precisely trigger events. I think that makes it a complete bust for a software only solution. Have you looked at any chips like the Arduino that are fairly cheap? From the Arduino forums , it looks like 10 microsecond precision is possible.
