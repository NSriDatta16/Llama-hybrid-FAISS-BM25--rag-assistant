The quick answers to your question are: You are absolutely right: it is not generally valid to swap the order of summation when the interior sum is squared. It's not even true when $n=1$ and $m=2$ : $$ \sum_{i=1}^{1} \left(\sum_{j=1}^{2} x_{ij} \right)^2 = (x_{11} + x_{12})^2 = x_{11}^2 + 2x_{11}x_{12} + x_{12}^2 $$ $$ \sum_{j=1}^{2} \left(\sum_{i=1}^{1} x_{ij} \right)^2 = x_{11}^2 + x_{12}^2 $$ The blog post has a few mistakes in it, and you would be better working through the (quite nicely written and much better type-scripted) introduction in the XGBoost docs .
