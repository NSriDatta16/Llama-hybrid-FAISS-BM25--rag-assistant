Alternatively, you could also use only the first element in the collection returned by parent() : $(this).parent('.parent_menu').eq(0).find('.child_menu').slideDown('slow'); However, I agree that closest() is more elegant, and it basically does the same thing. Hope my post clarifies things for you, anyway.
