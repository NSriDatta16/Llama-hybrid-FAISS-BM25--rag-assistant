Logistic regression is a model for probabilities of binary events. Another concept that is closely related to probabilities is odds , i.e. ratios of probabilities. If the probability of observing a binary event is $p$ , the odds of observing it is $\tfrac{p}{1-p}$ . It's a fairly simple and commonly understood concept. Logistic regression predicts log-odds . They are "simpler" to interpret because odds are already related to probabilities of binary events, while normal quantiles do not directly translate to them in a meaningful way. If the predicted quantile is $Q(p)$ , how "likely" is this to happen? To answer the question, you need to translate the value to probability, while in the case of odds it just re-phrases the question to probability relative to the probability of the opposite event.
