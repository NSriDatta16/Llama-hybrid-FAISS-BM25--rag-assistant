I've always displayed file size in 1000-byte Kilobytes. It hardly ever matters to the people who can't tell the difference, and often relieves confusion when they see the actual number. 65323 bytes = 65Kb when rounded, and the "normal" people like that. I probably won't ever display "KiB", since that's never what my customers want. The arrogance of deciding not to follow the standard created by more than just the computer community (see... it isn't "new" that Kilo actually means 1000) is staggering.
