The ReadToEnd() function loads the entire stream into memory. You are better off using an XmlReader to stream the document in chunks, and then run xslt against smaller fragments. You may also want to consider passing the document with XmlReader entirely and not use xslt which is less suited to streaming data and less scalable for large files.
