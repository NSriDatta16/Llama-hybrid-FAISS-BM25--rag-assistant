How to make Rails generate 'schema.rb' with bigint support for MySQL?

I am using Rails 3.0.5. I am using MySQL as a database storage. I have a model in which one of the columns needs to be BIGINT. I am using the following in my create migration file: t.column :my_column_name, :bigint which works fine. However, when I run rake db:migrate the generated 'schema.rb' file creates the following line for the particular column: t.integer "my_column_name", :limit => 8 which is not correct. My question is where am I wrong with that? Is there something that I should do in order to get the correct 'schema.rb' file? Can I change the way 'schema.rb' file is generated? Please, note that the fact that the 'schema.rb' file is wrong causes problems to my continuous integration server, which runs tests and creates the db from scratch (before running tests) using the 'schema.rb' file.
