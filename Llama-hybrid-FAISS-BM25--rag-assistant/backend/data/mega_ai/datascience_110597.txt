Using CNNs to detect incorrect label images in dataset

What I want to do is to train a model to identify the images that are incorrectly labeled in my dataset, for example, in a class of dogs, I can find cats images and I want a model that detects all those images that are in the wrong class. Does any one tried this to have more details or does any one have any ideas? I'm open for all ideas and thank you in advance.
