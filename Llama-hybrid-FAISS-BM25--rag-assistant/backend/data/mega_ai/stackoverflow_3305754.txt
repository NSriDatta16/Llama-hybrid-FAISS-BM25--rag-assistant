The main question I would ask is what is this WYSIWYG for? Many WYSIWYG's allow you to define specific tags to have stripped out of the code. For instance you can have TinyMCE strip out the script tags with http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:Configuration/invalid_elements This unfortunately does not solve your problem since all client side data form submissions are circumventable. If you must use a WYSIWYG ,then what you really need to make sure to do is to cover all your bases on the form's validation and display. You can strip out all script tags and make sure to remove any event attributes and javascript code in links href attributes. If it is acceptable to only allow a specific subset of tags I would suggest either using BBML, BBCode, or Markdown. http://www.depressedpress.com/Content/Development/ColdFusion/Extensions/DP_ParseBBML/Index.cfm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBCode http://sebduggan.com/projects/cfxmarkdown You can use TinyMCE as a WYSIWYG for BBCode http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/examples/example_09.php and StackOverflow uses a great markdown editor http://github.com/cky/wmd Here is some good info if you would like to render BBCode in Coldfusion http://www.sitepoint.com/forums/showthread.php?t=248040
