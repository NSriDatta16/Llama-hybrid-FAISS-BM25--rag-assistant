Hopefully, you have put files that don't interact with browsers in their own directory. If that is the case, its relatively simple to use grep to find out what is still including or requiring them. If not, pull a local copy, rename files one by one and see what breaks. I was about to suggest using regex to figure out what files actually output HTML, but that would not significantly narrow the possibility of breakage. In any event, this process presents a good opportunity to better organize your code. I really do feel your pain, I'm going back on sites I launched five years ago and doing the same thing.
