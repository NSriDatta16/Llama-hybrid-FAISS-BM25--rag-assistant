If I understand your question correctly, it's not about http vs. command line call, but rather browser vs. "non-browser" (e.g. via curl, wget etc) call. There's no way to check this, because wget etc are technically browsers, they just don't happen to have a GUI. You can try checking HTTP_USER_AGENT, but this is totally unreliable, because there's no way to enforce a client to identify itself correctly.
