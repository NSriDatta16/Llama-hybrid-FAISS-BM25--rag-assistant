Choosing Best Average Method-Calculating the average over time

Suppose we want to calculate the average annual balance of a customer in the bank. If we want to have a normal average, we will add up the customer balance in the year and then dividing by the number of days in the year. Now consider a customer who had a high balance only in the last month of the year and for the last 11 months his account balance has been very low. But because he had a high account balance only in the last month, his annual average shows a high number. How can we calculate the annual average balance in a way that 11 months of low customer balance affects his annual average and in fact the annual average of the customer does not increase only because of the last month?
