We talk about dimensionality reduction when you use the SVD as part of Principal Component Analysis and choose to use a subset of the available dimensions. Check out: Relationship between SVD and PCA. How to use SVD to perform PCA? SVD can be used for an incredible amount of things, few of which relate to reducing dimensionality. Examples of use off the top of my head: calculating pseudoinverses, solving least squares problems, analysing time-dependent concentrations in chemical reactions, X-ray scattering time series analysis, non-linear corrections on pixel array detectors, estimating the rank/finding the null space of a matrix, and inversion problems.
