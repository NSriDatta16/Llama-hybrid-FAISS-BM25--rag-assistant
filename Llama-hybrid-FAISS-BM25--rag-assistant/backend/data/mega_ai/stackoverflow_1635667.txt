As far as I know, MySQL's default storage engine MyISAM does not support transactions . MySQL Server (version 3.23-max and all versions 4.0 and above) supports transactions with the InnoDB and BDB transactional storage engines. InnoDB provides full ACID compliance. ... The other nontransactional storage engines in MySQL Server (such as MyISAM) follow a different paradigm for data integrity called “atomic operations.” In transactional terms, MyISAM tables effectively always operate in autocommit = 1 mode In order to get transactions working, you'll have to switch your storage engine for those tables to InnoDB. You may also want to use Hibernate's MySQLInnodDBDialect if you generate your tables ( hdm2ddl ) from your mappings: org.hibernate.dialect.MySQLInnoDBDialect As mentioned by @gid, it's not a requirement for transactions though.
