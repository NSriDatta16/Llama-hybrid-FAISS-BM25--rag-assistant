An alternative strategy is to test for Normality. If your data comes from a single Gaussian, you should fail to reject the null hypothesis. Conversely, if you get a statistically significant p-value for rejecting the null hypothesis, then you know that k > 1. This strategy can be easily generalized to the multi-variate case by performing PCA and testing each principal component separately. Since you're working with R, I recommend you take a look at the nortest package.
