Delphi Windows Services command line arguments

I have a Deplhi based Windows Service that, on installation, parses some command line arguments. I want those arguments to be added to the services command line (ImagePath value on the registry) so that the service is always started with them. How can I accomplish this? I want the regedit look like this: at registry key HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\ControlSet001\Services\MyService ImagePath = C:\Path\to\my\service.exe -some -arguments Thanks Update: The installation is done with >MyService.exe /install -some -arguments . Those arguments are the ones I want to persist in the command line. Update: I found a solution by writing directly to the registry (see here ), but I'd still like a more elegant solution, like using some TService property or something of that sort. Thanks!
