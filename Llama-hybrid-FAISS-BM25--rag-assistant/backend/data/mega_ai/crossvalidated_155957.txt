Significance of explanatory variables in Bayesian models

I was wondering if there is a general way to handle parameters of which posterior distributions include zero. Should one remove these parameters and refit the model? E.g. You fit a regression model y = N(a + B_1*x_1 + B_2*x2,sigma). Now, B_2's posterior includes zero, maybe p(B_2 = 0) = 10%. Should one consider B_2 insignificant, throw it out of the model and refit?
