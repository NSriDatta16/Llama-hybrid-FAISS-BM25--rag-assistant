A possible solution... Depending upon your application the following might be a possible solution (or completetly not applicable) : Popup a dialog-box with a sample paragraph containing all the characters that you intend to use. Render the paragraph using the FONT u have in mind. Display a message to the user to -- Select OK (if he/she can read the text i.e. only if no "squares" visible) -- Select a different FONT (if any "squares" are visible) NOTE: In case you are wondering, this is not a very uncommon behaviour for apps. MS-WORD does this when it detects non-standard encoding in a doc file. GoodLUCK!!
