Yep. Check out autodie from CPAN. From the docs: The autodie pragma provides a convenient way to replace functions that normally return false on failure with equivalents that throw an exception on failure. The autodie pragma has lexical scope , meaning that functions and subroutines altered with autodie will only change their behaviour until the end of the enclosing block, file, or eval .
