Time distibution in Markov chain

Let $E=\{A,B\}$ be a set and $X_{1,t}, X_{2,t}, X_{3,t}$ three independent Markov chains on the set $E$ with respective transition probability $P^{(1)}, P^{(2)}, P^{(3)}$ where $$P^{(i)}=\begin{bmatrix}p^{(i)} & 1-p^{(i)}\\ 1-p^{(i)} & p^{(i)} \end{bmatrix}$$ Let $P = P^{(1)}\otimes P^{(2)}\otimes P^{(3)}$ where $\otimes$ is the Kronecker product. The process $Y_t = X_{1,t}\times X_{2,t}\times X_{3,t}$ (product of the three Markov chain) is a Markov chain with transition probability $P$ and state space $E_Y = E\times E\times E = \{AAA, AAB, ABA, ABB, BAA, BAB, BBA, BBB\}$ and we can use the standard Markov theory to compute anything we want. But, here are my questions : 1 - As $ ''AAB '' $ and $ ''ABA '' $ are the same value equal to $A^2B$ , then $E_Y$ can be reduce to $\{A^3, A^2B, AB^2, B^3\}$ . Is $Y_t$ still a Markov chain if we combine the transition probability in other to set it in that reduced space? 2 - How can I determine the time distribution probability of begin in a particular state. In other word, how can I compute $$\mathbb{P}[Y_{t+1} \neq A^2B, Y_t = A^2B, Y_{t-1} = A^2B, \dots, Y_1 = A^2B | Y_0=A^2B]$$ for each $t\in \mathbb{N}$ .
