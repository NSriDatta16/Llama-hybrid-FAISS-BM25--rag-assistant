Video with iPhone 3.0 OS application getting crash while running in iphone 4.0 OS

I am having a crash issue while playing video in iphone 4.0 OS. Actually, I have created application with base SDK 3.0 and now i am just installing application to 4.0 OS device. It is not working in that... I have debugged that issue and found that in 4.0 OS, apple change the framework and methods to play the video. Any one help me how to overcome this issue. Here is my code which is running fine in 3.0 OS. -(void)play { NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle]; //NSString *path = [bundle pathForResource:@"Icon" ofType:@"png"]; NSString *path = [bundle pathForResource:@"loader" ofType:@"m4v"]; NSURL *url = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:path]; moviePlayer = [[MPMoviePlayerController alloc] initWithContentURL:url]; moviePlayer.scalingMode = MPMovieScalingModeAspectFill; [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(moviePlayBackDidFinish:) name:MPMoviePlayerPlaybackDidFinishNotification object:moviePlayer]; moviePlayer.movieControlMode = MPMovieControlModeHidden; [moviePlayer play]; } Thanks in advance, Pragnesh
