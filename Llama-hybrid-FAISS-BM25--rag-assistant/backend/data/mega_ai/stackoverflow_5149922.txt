C#: Average From Series of Images

Suppose I have a series of black and white images, NOT grayscale. I'm trying to calculate an average of all images. I have some sample code that should work but I'm wondering if there is a better way? Bitmap[] Images = ReadAndScale(Width: 50, Height: 50); int Width = 50; int Height = 50; double[,] Result = new int[50,50] for (int i = 0 i At the end of these loops you have an array Result[] that contains the average value; > .5 is black otherwise the average is white.
