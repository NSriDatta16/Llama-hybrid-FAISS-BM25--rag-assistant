First of all I donâ€™t know Indian. According to the sub-topics you have learnt parsing would be a better selection. However for many languages syntactic parsing is highly dependent to morphologic analysis. And unlike English many languages have complex morphologies. Additionally neither writing a parser nor writing a morphologic analyzer from scratch is possible in three months for many languages. So if Indian morphology is not complex go for the analyzer. It is the basic level of NLP and you will learn a lot. If it is rather hard and there are sufficient analyzers that you can use with your parsing project go for the parser. Finally either you select the parser or analyzer, reduce your target or the project and complete it on time. For example instead of trying to write a full analyzer, try to write one that works just for inflectional suffixes. By the way how about a stemmer?
