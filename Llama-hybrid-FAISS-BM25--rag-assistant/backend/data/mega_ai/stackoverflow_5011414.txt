Is the password case senstivie when given to OCIAttrSet with OCI_ATTR_PASSWORD?

In a fragment of a (c++) OCI programm, I use OCIAttrSet with the OCI_ATTR_PASSWORD flag in order to pass (or set) the password to initialize a session like so: success = OCIAttrSet ( ses, OCI_HTYPE_SESSION, (text *) password.c_str(), password.length(), OCI_ATTR_PASSWORD, err ); The subsequent success = OCISessionBegin ( svc, err, ses, OCI_CRED_RDBMS, OCI_DEFAULT ); works ok if the password is given in small letters. If at least one character of password is in upper case, OCISessionBegin return the error ORA-01017: invalid username/password; logon denied . This behaviour in contrast to every password handling I have seen in Oracle because up to now I believed them to be case insenstive. Yet, I don't find this behaviour documented somewhere. So, is this expected behaviour (and I am unable to find the documentation) or is there going on something else?
