High dimensional space is dense or sparse?

I read some blog articles recently. One mentions that you could not imagine high dimensional space as 2d or 3d as distance between any 2 points in high dimensional space tends to be similar, which means 'dense'. However in the t-SNE paper , it says high dimensional space tends to be sparse such that you have to employ special dimensionality reduction techniques to visualize in 2d or 3d space in meaningful way. So how to reconciliate these 2 different views?
