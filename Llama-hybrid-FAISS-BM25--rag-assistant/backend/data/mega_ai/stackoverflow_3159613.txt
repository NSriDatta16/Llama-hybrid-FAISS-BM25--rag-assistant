Simple API for random access into a compressed data file

Please recommend a technology suitable for the following task. I have a rather big (500MB) data chunk, which is basically a matrix of numbers. The data entropy is low (it should be well-compressible) and the storage is expensive where it sits. What I am looking for, is to compress it with a good compression algorithm (Like, say, GZip) with markers that would enable very occasional random access. Random access as in "read byte from location [64bit address] in the original (uncompressed) stream". This is a little different than the classic deflator libraries like ZLIB, which would let you decompress the stream continuously. What I would like, is have the random access at latency of, say, as much as 1MB of decompression work per byte read. Of course, I hope to use existing library rather than reinvent the NIH wheel.
