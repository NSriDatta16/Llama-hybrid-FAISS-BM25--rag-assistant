Don't get me wrong, there are several other improvements to consider since IS12, but especially if you are creating .msi installations, you can probably continue to use IS12. In fact, if you are creating patches, you should continue to use the same version of IS that the base used until you can hop a major upgrade. You'll hit the occasional bug or feature limitation, and in particular Windows PCA may misidentify installers due to aged manifests (See InstallShield 2010 SP1's release notes for that). If you have time to evaluate whether the upgrade it worth your while, I'd suggest starting with the release notes (search for InstallShield 20xx Release Notes, with xx as 08, 09, and 10 so far).
