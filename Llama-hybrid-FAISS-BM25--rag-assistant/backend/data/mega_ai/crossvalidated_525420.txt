Unlike maximum likelihood estimation for a well-chosen correlation structure, the cluster bootstrap doesn't really "know" about the correlation structure. The cluster bootstrap allows for a fairly general correlation structure (just as the robust cluster sandwich estimator does) but that's not necessarily enough to be optimal. The sandwich estimator and the cluster bootstrap do not properly handle imbalanced cases either, i.e., cases where some subjects have many more measurements than others. The bootstrap distribution doesn't always reflect the sampling distribution, and as a result confidence intervals can be inaccurate if you do your simulation correct, i.e., look at the non-coverage separately in the left and right tails. Overall I don't find a compelling reason to do the bootstrap in this case and would rather spend time getting the correlation structure right. For example, random effects without anything else assumes compound symmetry, which is unrealistic for serial data. There are many good choices for serial correlation structures. Markov modeling is a another very general and flexible way to go.
