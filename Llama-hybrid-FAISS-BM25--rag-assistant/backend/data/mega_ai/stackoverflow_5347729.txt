Your image is 404ing due to your css rule for .project .thumb a{} It points to "images/snbw_thumb.jpg" but you'll likely want to use "/images/snbw_thumb.jpg" Bad URL : http://dragonfly.zymichost.com/css/images/snbw_thumb.jpg Good URL : http://dragonfly.zymichost.com/images/snbw_thumb.jpg (Also, it looks like your pages aren't really serving 404s as the bad URL ) Hope this helps -Chris
