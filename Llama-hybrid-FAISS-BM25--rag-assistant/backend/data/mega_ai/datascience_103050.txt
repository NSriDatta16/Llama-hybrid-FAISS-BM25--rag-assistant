These are a few approaches I found in the research field that combines both RNN and Reinforcement Learning that looks promising Reinforcement learning with LSTM networks Reinforcement learning with RNN Hybrid RNN approach Research paper links A Reinforcement Learning and Recurrent Neural Network Based Dynamic User Modeling System Supervised Reinforcement Learning with Recurrent Neural Network for Dynamic Treatment Recommendation The state of mind: Reinforcement learning with recurrent neural networks Reinforcement learning by backpropagation through an LSTM model/critic Hybrid RNN Note : The following paper seems to be the only one verified in the industry and applied to an industrial problem D.
