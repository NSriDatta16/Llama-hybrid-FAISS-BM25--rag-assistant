Variance Covariance for logit with elastic net

How do you calculate an estimate for the variance covariance matrix of a logistic regression with elastic net regularization? Starting from the variance-covariance matrix of a plain vanilla logistic regression, how does the formula need to be augmented: $\hat{\Sigma}=-\left[\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})XX^{T}\right]^{-1}$ where $\hat{p}=\frac{1}{1+exp(X^{T}\hat{\Theta})}$ If you don't know the answer for elastic net, how would this be implemented for a logistic regression with ridge regularization? Update: This link suggests OLS ridge is: M = $(X'X+λI)^{−1}X'$ var(β)= ${\sigma}^{2}MM'$
