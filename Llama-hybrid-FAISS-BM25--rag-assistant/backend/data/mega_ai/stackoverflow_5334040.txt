The language that F# is based on is OCaml which does not do operator overloading or automatic data coercion (they prefer explicit coercion). Thus even adding doubles requires a different operator (+.). I'm not sure if this is where F# gets its strictness on it for sure but I am guessing it is. In dynamic languages like Python or Scheme you would get automatic data coercion to a bigger data storage if the number was too big. For example you could have integers with integer exponents giving a big-integer for the result. OCaml and F# have a spirit of extreme type safety.
