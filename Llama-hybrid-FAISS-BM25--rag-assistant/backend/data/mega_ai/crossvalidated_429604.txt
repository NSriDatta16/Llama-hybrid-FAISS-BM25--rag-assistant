How to perform significance tests on distributions with unclear sample size?

I have a problem that seems like it should be very simple, but I've come up dry searching for answers (which probably indicates some basic conceptual failure on my part). Basically, I have two sets of measurements that I need to multiply in order to get a third value, and I want to compare this value between two populations. Each set of measurements obviously has an associated error, and I understand how to propagate the error using the standard formulae. This gives me the derived value and its error term. However, in order to perform a t-test I'd also need the sample size, and I don't know what that would mean for this derived value (particularly because the two original sets of measurements had different sample sizes). EDIT I think that the BMI framing is a bad example, so please ignore. My actual problem is below. My actual application is in cell biology, but in order to avoid getting down into the weeds with the details I have a toy example that I think captures the problem: imagine I want to determine whether body mass index (BMI, which is $\frac{weight}{height^2}$ ) is significantly different between men and women. Unfortunately I don't have a dataset of BMIs from individual men and women, but I do have separate datasets of height ( n = 100) and weight ( n = 200) for both men and women (assume both datasets were sampled from identical populations). It seems I should be able to estimate the average BMI as $\mu_{BMI} = \frac{\mu_{weight}}{\mu_{height}^2}$ and the error as $\sigma_{BMI} = \lvert \mu_{BMI}\rvert \sqrt {\left(\frac {\sigma_{weight}}{\mu_{weight}}\right)^2+2 {\left(\frac {\sigma_{height}}{\mu_{height}}\right)^2} }$ But how would I run a t-test on these average BMIs? All the t-test formulae require a sample size n and I don't know what that would mean in this case since the BMI is calculated from two samples of different sizes. Or is a t-test the wrong test to use? Thanks in advance, and apologies for the inevitable errors. EDIT I'm running two experiments: in one, I feed cells in a dish some isotope-labeled glucose, and do some mass spec analysis to determine what fraction of glucose enters the pentose phosphate pathway ( n = 5 biological replicates); in the other, I measure the total amount of glucose consumed ( n = 6). Multiplying those measurements (fraction of glucose entering PPP X amount of glucose consumed) gives me what I want (amount of glucose entering PPP). If I want to then see whether (amount of glucose entering PPP) differs significantly between two strains of cells, how would I run the test? Unlike in the BMI example, where you can and should measure individual heights/weights, for technical reasons I have to make these measurements in separate experiments. So if I multiply a measured quantity with n =5 by another quantity with n =6, what's the sample size of the derived quantity? Or am I just thinking about it wrong, and there's another test I should be using?
