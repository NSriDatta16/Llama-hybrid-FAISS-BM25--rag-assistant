Yes, you are missing something. No, that's not the correct answer :-) Your original calculation is for a password that is exactly eight characters long, not one that is eight or less. For a password which can be between four and eight characters, there's actually more search space than in your original calculation (not because less search space equates to more time taken, but because the original calculation was wrong). For a password of one to eight characters, the search space is actually: (62 ^ 1) + (62 ^ 2) + (62 ^ 3) + (62 ^ 4) + (62 ^ 5) + (62 ^ 6) + (62 ^ 7) + (62 ^ 8) and then you can divide that by two for the average number of checks (I won't since we're really only talking about ratios here). Then, if you have the extra information that the password is at least four characters long, you can discount the first three terms to get: (62 ^ 4) + (62 ^ 5) + (62 ^ 6) + (62 ^ 7) + (62 ^ 8)
