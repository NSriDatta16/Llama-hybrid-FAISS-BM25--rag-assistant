Help with question comparing logistic regression analyses

I have accounted a problem when trying to finish my analyses. So, I want to compare the beta weights between two logistic regression analyses from independent samples (same IV and DV in both regression analyses). As far as I know, there are not any established tests to test the significance in differences between beta weights. So I have standardized the beta weights and applied the method of comparing the confidence overlap described in the article of G. Cumming from 2009 (Inference by eye: reading the overlap of independent confidence intervals. Stat Med, 28(2), 205-220.). My question: is it accurate to compare the beta weights from two logistic regression models in this way? Appreciated if not trying to overcomplicate the answer. I do not want to be more confused.
