Sequence to Sequence models only returning the same response?

I've tried out my code just to make sure it works on a dataset of 100 input and output sentences. Turns out that no matter what I insert, the trained model only responds with either 1 of 2 phrases. I convert the sentences into one-hot vectors, and my matrix is very sparce, in other words, I have some very long sentences and some very short ones, and the short ones are padded with zero vectors. I also do not implement attention and beam search. Is this because of the incredibly small dataset, or does that normally not occur?
