CodeIgniter/PHP - Calling a view from within a view

Basically for my webapp I'm trying to organise it a bit better. As it at the moment, every time I want to load a page, I have to do it from my controller like so: $this->load->view('subviews/template/headerview'); $this->load->view('subviews/template/menuview'); $this->load->view('The-View-I-Want-To-Load'); $this->load->view('subviews/template/sidebar'); $this->load->view('subviews/template/footerview'); As you can tell it's not really very efficient. So I thought I'd create one 'master' view - It's called template.php. This is the contents of the template view: load->view('subviews/template/headerview'); $this->load->view('subviews/template/menuview'); $this->load->view($view); $this->load->view('subviews/template/sidebar'); $this->load->view('subviews/template/footerview'); ?> And then I thought I'd be able to call it from a controller like this: $data['view'] = 'homecontent'; $this->load->view('template',$data); Unfortunately I simply cannot make this work. Does anyone have any ways around this or fixes I can put into place? I've tried putting ""s and ''s around $view in template.php but that makes no difference. The usual error is "Undefined variable: data" or "Cannot load view: $view.php" etc. Thanks folks! Jack
