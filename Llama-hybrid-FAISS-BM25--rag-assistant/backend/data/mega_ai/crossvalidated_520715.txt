Are principal component analysis (PCA) and empirical orthogonal function (EOF) methods the same?

As far as I've seen, EOF is just PCA but instead of thinking about the data matrix X as (number of samples, number of features), you consider it as (number of time points, number of different spatial positions). Am I correct? Is the difference only conceptual? I'm a bit confused because I've seen python packages specifically designed for EOF, which increases the confusion. Thanks
