Retrieving FBO data in GLSL

I'm trying to get MRT working in OpenGL to try out deferred rendering. Here's the situation as I understand it. Create 3 render buffers (for example). Two RGBA8 and one Depth32. Create an FBO. Attach render buffers to FBO. ColorAttachment0/1 for color buffers, DepthAttachment for depth buffer. Bind the FBO. Draw geometry. Send data to different attachments using gl_FragData[] in the frag shader. At this point I would want to take the data in another pass using GLSL, how can a) retrieve data from the framebuffer color attachments, b) get data from the depth component.
