What is mode-averaging in wake-sleep algorithm?

I was reading Hinton's paper on Deep Belief Nets, A Fast Learning Algo for DBNs . In the introduction section, the authors write: Section 5 shows how the weights produced by the fast greedy algorithm can be fine-tuned using the “up-down” algorithm. This is a contrastive version of the wake-sleep algorithm Hinton et al. (1995) that does not suffer from the “mode-averaging” problems that can cause the wake-sleep algorithm to learn poor recognition weights. However, the authors do not expand on the term "mode-averaging", neither in this paper nor in the original paper on wake-sleep algorithm . What exactly does it mean and how does it make the wake-sleep algorithm to learn poor recognition weights?
