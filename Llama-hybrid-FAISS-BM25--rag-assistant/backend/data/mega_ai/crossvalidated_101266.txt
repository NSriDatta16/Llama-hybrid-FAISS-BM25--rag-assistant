You may want to look into the field of statistical classification , since you are unsure whether to use logistic regression to predict the response variable. Classification is a related field - some sources, including Wikipedia, regard classification as the field encompassing logistic regression. To handle the categorical variables, use a suitable encoding that transforms them into numbers, and consider normalizing all data features: most classification algorithms require this in order to avoid the counts with highest maxima to dominate the result. In order to tell which algorithm works best, or to tune the parameter values once you have one algorithm selected, use cross validation on the data you already have .
