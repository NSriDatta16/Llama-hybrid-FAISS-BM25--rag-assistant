This is just confusion with the terminology. It's not that you need to "use" a Markov chain to draw Metropolis-Hastings samples, it's that the sequence of Metropolis-Hastings draws is a Markov chain. This is an innate part of the algorithm design. "Markov chain Monte Carlo" is just a qualifier indicating that the draws from this Monte Carlo algorithm produce a Markov chain.
