Confidence intervals in probabilities for mixed effects logistic regression

A while back I was helped to get correct confidence intervals for predicted probabilities in a logistic regression model: Correct interpretation of confidence interval for logistic regression? Now, I want to do the same but for a mixed effects logistic regression. I use the glmer function in the lme4 package to build the mixed effects logistic regression. I can then use the predict function to get at probabilities; predict(glmer_model, newdata = new, type = "response") . But, in the non-mixed effects case, I was directed to predict(log_model, newdata = new, type = "link", se.fit = TRUE) to get the standard errors, the 95% intervals for the logits and transform back to probabilities. Problem is, predict.merMod does not take type = "link" and se.fit = TRUE as arguments. I'm guessing this is not a problem of R syntax, but rather a deeper problem of standard errors for these models, but I would be grateful for any feedback between a fix to pointing out material for me to digest.
