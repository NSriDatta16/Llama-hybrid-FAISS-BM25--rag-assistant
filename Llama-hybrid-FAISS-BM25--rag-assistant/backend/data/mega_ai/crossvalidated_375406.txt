Exploratory factor analysis of a non-normally distributed data set with probable multicollinearity problems

I am trying to develop a scale measuring employee satisfaction regarding organizational support using spss. Most of my variables are positively skewed which should not be a problem in EFA as long as PAF is used for extraction . When examining the factorability of the data, kmo and Bartlettas are OK, however, the determinant is much lower than the .00001cutoff, indicating severe multicollinearity. Is VIF still the appropriate collinearity diagnostics indicator? Or should I transform all the variables first which is not recommended generally? Thank you. Best, Chiman
