Since this is homework, I'll just give you some clues. Right now, you're setting "max" each time through the loop. Try only setting temp, and see what happens. You might want to consider defaulting max (when you create it) to a very small number instead of 0. Also, you'll need to do something similar for "min", but default it to a very large number. int max = int.MinValue; int min = int.MaxValue; In order to get the average, you'll need to have a sum and a count, and keep track of those. Then, at the end, use a double to compute the average, and print. To get 2 decimal places, you can use average. ToString ("N") - the "N" format does a nicely formatted number with 2 decimal places by default.
