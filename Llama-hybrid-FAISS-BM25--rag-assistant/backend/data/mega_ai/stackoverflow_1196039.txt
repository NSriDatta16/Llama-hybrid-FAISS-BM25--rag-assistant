How to use MS SOAP toolkit?

I know that the Microsoft SOAP toolkit has been deprecated for a while now (.NET has all this stuff built in) but I was wondering in anyone has a quick bit of info on setting up a simple app that uses it. I was referred to http://www.devarticles.com/c/a/Cplusplus/Building-A-SOAP-Client-With-Visual-C-plus/ but the service in the example is no longer functioning and I can't seem to find any documentation online. I've looked into gSoap, but it seems overly complicated for what I have to do and despite not being able to get it to work, the SOAP toolkit seems (relatively) elegant.
