return focus to contenteditable after execCommand?

I have the following code demonstrating contenteditable property and a button that will inject bold text into the paragraph with contenteditable area. My question is how to return focus to where i left off after clicking on bold, if you highlight some text, and click bold, it'll bold those text, but the focus will not be there anymore. Same thing happens if you don't select anything and click bold, the focus will be gone and if you click where you left off again, you can type bold texts. Thank you very much for your help! #container{ width:500; } .handle{ float:left; } $(function(){ $('#bold').click(function (){ document.execCommand('bold', false, true); }); }); Bold Some text here asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asd fasd fsa dfsa df asdf sadf sa dfa sdf sadf asd fsa df sadf asdf asdf asd fas df asdf as Some text here asdf asdf asdf asdf asdf asd fasd fsa dfsa df asdf sadf sa dfa sdf sadf asd fsa df sadf asdf asdf asd fas df asdf as
