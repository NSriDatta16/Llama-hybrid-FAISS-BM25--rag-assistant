In the RoleTailored Client, if you go into Departments->Administration->RoleTailored Client->User Personalization you can specify which role center each user has. From here, you can give yourself the Purchasing Agent role, for example. You can do this programmatically from AL by manipulating table 20000000073: User Personalization. In RoleTailored client it is not possible to change the departments menu itself. The idea is that you create a role center based on the pages and reports the user needs most frequently.
