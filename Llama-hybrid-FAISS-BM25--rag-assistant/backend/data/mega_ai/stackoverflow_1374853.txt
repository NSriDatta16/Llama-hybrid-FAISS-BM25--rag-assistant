ASP.NET MVC: convention for organizing ViewModels

This doesn't feel right. alt text http://www.imagechicken.com/uploads/1252003002097179400.png Question: What's the common accepted convention on which directory to store your ViewModels? What are your suggestions or what is the established convention?
