Taking the log of a variable with a distribution that follows a power-law will often do a pretty good job of making it more gaussian. This would definitely be the first thing to try, and by itself will likely give you satisfactory results. In my limited experience, RBF kernels seem pretty robust, even if they are based on the Gaussian distribution. If simply logging doesn't work, using domain-specific knowledge to focus on a subset of variables can also be helpful. You could also use PCA or autoencoding to reduce the number of variables, although the distortion of the data might potentially not be worth it.
