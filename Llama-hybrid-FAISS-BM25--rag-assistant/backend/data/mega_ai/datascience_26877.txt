How to implement handmade features in a Keras Sequential model?

I wanted to know how to implement my handmade features in my Keras model. Below I have some code where the embedding_matrix is the Stanford Glove NLP dataset. def BidLstm(maxlen, max_features, embed_size, embedding_matrix): inp = Input(shape=(maxlen, )) x = Embedding(max_features, embed_size, weights=[embedding_matrix], trainable=False)(inp) x = Bidirectional(LSTM(300, return_sequences=True, dropout=0.25, recurrent_dropout=0.25))(x) x = Attention(maxlen)(x) x = Dense(256, activation="relu")(x) x = Dropout(0.25)(x) x = Dense(6, activation="sigmoid")(x) model = Model(inputs=inp, outputs=x) I want to implement some extra features (preferably numpy array of features) into my keras model. Any suggestions?
