Primary Keys - Native, Sequence, or GUID keys?

In reading this and this and then reading this (which references the other two ironically) I find myself wondering just how big the discussion of this topic is? I am a SQL Server guy and so I tend to use an Identity that is auto generated in the form of an int. However, when I know that I will need some form of replication between server and server or synchronization between client and server I tend to use a GUID as my key. Question: Should I just use a GUID as my primary key across all tables at all times just in case I might need this possible scalability down the road? Does this make my schema more flexible in that it can be migrated between platforms at all times? Does this help me maintain the flexibility of my ORM (regardless of flavor) by not embedding platform specific features? Responses: @David Archer: Per your comment I updated my post to not say "Natural Key". Your are correct in that natural key is defined as such . Thanks for the correction.
