How to flash a JFrame on the Windows taskbar when it needs attention

I'm a computer science student working on a Yahoo! Messenger-like program implemented in Java. My problem is that whenever the JTextArea inside my frame contains new message updates, the user must be prompted even when his/her frame is minimized. Is there a workaround on how to make the JFrame on the taskbar blink when updates are received? In short, I need a way to notify the user that the frame has been updated even though it is minimized. How can I do that?
