Sorry, I don't have time to fix your problem totally but I guess you can do it on your own when you read the comment of Autotest#add_mapping method. You have to play a little bit with regex. Pay attention at "+proc+ is passed a matched filename and Regexp.last_match". Here's full comment: # Adds a file mapping, optionally prepending the mapping to the # front of the list if +prepend+ is true. +regexp+ should match a # file path in the codebase. +proc+ is passed a matched filename and # Regexp.last_match. +proc+ should return an array of tests to run. # # For example, if test_helper.rb is modified, rerun all tests: # # at.add_mapping(/test_helper.rb/) do |f, _| # at.files_matching(/^test.*rb$/) # end def add_mapping regexp, prepend = false, &proc
