Paired one sided binomial hypothesis test with two groups

I have paired sets of binomial data $(X_i, Y_i)$ for $i = 1, \ldots, N$ . If I want to test if a the mean of $X_i$ is larger than the mean of $Y_i$ , I do a binomial hypothesis test. What if I want to test if the set $\{ X_i\}_{i=1}^N$ has an average mean that is higher than $\{ Y_i\}_{i=1}^N$ ? For example, i divide a class into siblings, with e.g. older sibling $X_i$ and younger sibling $Y_i$ . The siblings play a game (not zero sum - they can both win and both lose), and I record the number of wins for each student. I can use a one sided binomial test to determine if each older sibling is significantly better than their younger sibling. How do I determine the significance with which older siblings on average are better than younger siblings?
