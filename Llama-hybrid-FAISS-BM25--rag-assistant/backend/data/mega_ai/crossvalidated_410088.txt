Will out of bag error always be 100% for classes of size 1 using random forests

My understanding is that given a sample data point $x_i$ the OOB prediction for this point will be calculated using only trees in the ensemble that do not contain $x_i$ in their bootstrap sample. Thus if $x_i$ is the only value in a given class the trees used for generating an OOB prediction for $x_i$ will be grown using no samples from the same class, thus will always incorrectly classify $x_i$ . is this correct? If so, whats the best way to deal with classes containing only one value, simply remove them?
