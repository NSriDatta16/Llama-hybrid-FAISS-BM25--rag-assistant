I think there is a missunderstanding in your question. In your question you imply that you take the average of the weights of the networks, and you should not do this. Instead, what you average are the predictions of different networks. For this reason, if you average two correct predictions the result will be a correct prediction, and the problem you were thinking about does not exist.
