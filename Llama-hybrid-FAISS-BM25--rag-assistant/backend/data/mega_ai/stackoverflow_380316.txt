What is the best online resource for 3D rendering in JavaScript?

First a little intro: Last year i wrote this http://dragan.yourtree.org/code/canvas-3d-graph/ Now, i want to make complete rewrite of it, because that old version have some limitations, for example: sometimes it happens that bars are not visible, because they are drawn one behind another. In this old version there is no real 3d, just bunck of 2D lines, which emulate 3D. Now, what i want is to go to full blown 3D scene, i want to keep all the objects in memory, and add some kind of 3D navigation buttons that will enable users to rotate whole scene on all 3 axis, and zoom camera in and out. I've already decided that i will use http://sylvester.jcoglan.com/ for vector/matrix stuff, but i'm still unable to find good tutorial for 3D. There are tons of texts on the Internet, most of them date from the 90s, an are incomplete or written really bad. So, my question is: what is the best online resource/tutorial that will enable me to write my own JS 3D engine from scratch. It should cover all relevant topics: vectors matrices objects camera scene rendering lighting rotating objects on scene moving the camera etc.. (i'm fairly familiar with first two) Thank you for your time.
