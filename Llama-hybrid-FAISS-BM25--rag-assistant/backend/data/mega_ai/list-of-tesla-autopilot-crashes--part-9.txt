 that since "the vehicle drove off the road with no evidence of a sudden maneuver, that fits with the [driver-assistance] feature being engaged". In an article published by The Washington Post in 2024, based on the driver's history and interviews with the surviving passenger and the driver's spouse, the newspaper concluded this was likely the first fatality with FSD engaged. The Post article also used features enabled in the vehicle purchase order, vehicle records, and "a recent message from the company offering [the driver's] account the ability to 'Transfer Your Full Self-Driving Capability to a New Tesla'" to determine the car was equipped with FSD. Mission Viejo, California, US (May 17, 2022) At 10:51 p.m. PDT on May 17, 2022, a pedestrian walking on southbound I-5 near Crown Valley Parkway in Mission Viejo, California was struck and killed by a driver operating a Tesla Model 3. After the pedestrian was hit, the driver of the Tesla parked the car and exited it to stand on the right shoulder of the freeway; an impaired driver then crashed their car into the Tesla, and a third driver crashed into the two-car wreck, which was in a construction zone. Field report data confirmed the Tesla was operating in Autopilot when the pedestrian was killed. Gainesville, Florida, US (July 6, 2022) At approximately 2:00 p.m. EDT on July 6, 2022, the driver of a Tesla Model S traveling southbound on I-75 exited at a rest area just south of Gainesville, Florida, near Paynes Prairie Preserve State Park, and smashed into the rear of a parked Walmart tractor-trailer. Both the driver and passenger of the Tesla, a married couple from Lompoc, California, were killed. A spokesperson for the Florida Highway Patrol noted "[The vehicle] came off the exit ramp to the rest area, continued south for a short period, and turned into an easterly direction and that's at what time we had the collision where the Tesla struck the rear of the tractor-trailer." The NHTSA confirmed it had sent an investigation team to the site. Data reported by Tesla under NHTSA SGO-2021-01 indicate that Autopilot may have been engaged during the crash. However, in February 2023, a Florida Highway Patrol investigation concluded the crash was due to driver error: while exiting the freeway to the rest area, the driver pressed the accelerator pedal instead of the brake, and the Tesla hit a curb at 60 mph (97 km/h), then collided with the parked truck. The family sued Tesla in March 2023, alleging the "defective and unreasonably dangerous" Tesla had "malfunctioned during reasonable and foreseeable use", adding the vehicle "was equipped with several crash avoidance and crash mitigation features and technologies". Riverside, California, US (July 7, 2022) It was initially (and incorrectly) reported that at 4:47 a.m. PDT on July 7, 2022, a driver in a Tesla Model Y approached from behind, and then struck a motorcyclist on a Yamaha V-Star. Both vehicles were traveling eastbound in the high-occupancy vehicle lane of SR 91, west of Magnolia Avenue in Riverside, California. The motorcyclist was ejected from his vehicle and died at the scene, while the driver of the Tesla was uninjured after the Model Y went off the road. The driver of the Tesla was not arrested. Subsequent CHP investigation showed the motorcyclist struck the dividing wall and fell off his motorcycle; the Tesla Model Y following behind struck the motorcycle (which was already lying on its side) but not the motorcyclist. Telemetry data from Tesla later confirmed the Model Y driver was using Autopilot. Data reported by Tesla under NHTSA SGO-2021-01 also confirmed that Autopilot was engaged during the crash. Draper, Utah, US (July 24, 2022) A motorcycle rider was struck from behind by a driver using Autopilot in a Tesla Model 3 on southbound Interstate 15 near 15000 S in Draper, Utah, at 1:09 a.m. MDT on July 24, 2022. The collision threw the motorcycle rider from his Harley-Davidson to the ground, killing him. The driver told pol
