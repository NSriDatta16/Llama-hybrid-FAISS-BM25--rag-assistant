calculating average hours required per week

This may be an embarrassingly simple question - sorry. Let us say I collect hours spent per week to produce widgets. The following table shows a simplified example for 2 widgets: Would one calculate the average (e.g. mean) hours required per week like this: mean_hours_week_1 = (10 + 12) / 2 = 11 mean_hours_week_2 = (10 + 11) / 2 = 10.5 mean_hours_week_3 = (3 + 0) / 2 = 1.5 Thanks.
