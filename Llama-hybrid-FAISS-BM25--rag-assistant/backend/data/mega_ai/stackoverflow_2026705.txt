For the current state of affairs I can offer the following points As mentioned above there is technic in java doing that: SQLJ which never took of. Typically one uses an ORM to get a similiar result ( iBatis and Hibernate being the ones I here most about C# has LINQ which does something similiar There are many problems with embedding sql as part of the language: It tends to tie your language to a database vendor, since the various sql dialects are very different. This is a no go for most modern languages. This wasn't a problem for COBOL since portability was not a requirement. It makes either the language way more complex or requires preprocessing, both are bad things in their own right. But with modern IDEs this is even worse, since they would have a hard time to handle sql inside their code (although they start to actually do it, even when sql is embedded in Strings). This wasn't a problem for COBOL, since in a modern sense it is a butt ugly language anyway (although it probably was nice when it was invented) It requires resources for compiling that are hard to control (namingly the database) and follow a completely different approach then 'normal' programming. Again a COBOL Programm and it's database is pretty much fused together so no problem there. SQL doesn't fit to the OO Paradigm. It returns two dimensional arrays of values, not objects. So you need some kind of ORM anyway. On the other hand DSLs are all the hype now. And there are languages that have XML literals. So I think it is quite possible that languages emerge (or already exist) that have ORM like capabilities embedded in them and allow you to use a SQL (or HQL?) like DSL inside the code.
