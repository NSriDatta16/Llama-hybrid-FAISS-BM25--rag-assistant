Comment: You may want to check your analytic answer (approximately) against a simulation to make sure you have done the combinatorial analysis correctly. Here is a simulation for $n = 12$ and $N = 25.$ You might think of it as a kind of 'reversal' of the famous birthday problem. Birth months equally likely. Room of 25 students. What is the probability all 12 months are represented? The answer is about $18\%.$ set.seed(2019); pop = 1:12; N = 25 x = replicate( 10^6, length(unique(sample(pop, N, repl=T))) ) mean(x); mean(x == 12); 2*sd(x == 12)/1000 [1] 10.63755 # aprx E(X) [1] 0.181771 # aprx P(X = 12) [1] 0.0007713117 # 95% margin of sim error for P(X = 12) table(x)/10^6 n 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 0.000029 0.000944 0.014487 0.097603 0.301636 0.403530 0.181771 With a million iterations, you can expect two, maybe three, place accuracy. Also, if you consider the the number $N$ required on average to see all $n$ objects in the population, then you have the much studied 'coupon collecting' problem.
