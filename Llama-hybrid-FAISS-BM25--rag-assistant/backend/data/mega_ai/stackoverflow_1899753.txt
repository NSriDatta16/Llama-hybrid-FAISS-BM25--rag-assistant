It sounds like there are two possible questions, you should clarify which one: The 'text file' contains probability values and "n" and you build the matrix directly, but how to code it? This question is trivial, so let's disregard it The 'text file' contains something like signal data and you want to model it as a Markov Chain. 'Markov Chain' generally refers to a first order stochastic process, so I'm not sure then what you mean by "order", probably the size of the matrix, but that is not typical terminology. Anyway, for 1st-order, n x n matrix, discrete time random process, you should look at Viterbi Algorithm: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viterbi_algorithm
