More than likely there isn't an "elegant" way of doing this at the database level. But there are a few routes you could do. Add a "locked" bit field to each table, and when "locking" the parent cascade that value. In conjunction with #1 add a trigger on update and delete, if the flag is set, you can cancel the update or delete. That is about the only real easy way to enforce it at the db level that I can think of.
