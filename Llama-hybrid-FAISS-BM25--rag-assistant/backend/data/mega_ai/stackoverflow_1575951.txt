The Visual C++ compiler will compile C++ code into standalone EXEs that have nothing to do with the .NET framework. The only way to get the .NET baggage thrown in is to compile the C++ as "managed". If you create a new project (File|New|New Project) Then choose "Win32" from the Visual C++ submenu in the project types and choose "Win32 Console Application" Visual studio will create a simple project with a couple of source files that will compile to a little executable. Most of the time, Visual C++ is very similar to other compilers. Avoid #pragmas, microsoft libraries (MFC, ATL) and you should be fine. Edit (thanks Cheeso) - Documentation of where Visual C++ diverges from standard . In general I would advise using boost libraries for threads and networking because they work on many platforms (i.e linux). Also if your code can compile in GCC and Visual Studio then you are doing a good job keeping it portable.
