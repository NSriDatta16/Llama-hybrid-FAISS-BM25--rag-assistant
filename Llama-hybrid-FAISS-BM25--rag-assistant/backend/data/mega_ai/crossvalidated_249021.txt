The point of providing descriptive statistics is to characterise your sample so that people in other centres or countries can assess whether your results generalise to their situation. So in your case tabulating the sex, grades and so on would be a beneficial addition to the logistic regression. It is not to enable people to check your assumptions although they may try to do that too. ============== Edit to give links to some guidelines used in health In the field with which I am familiar, health, there are specific guidelines for reporting. These have been collected together in the EQUATOR network which should be consulted for up to date details. As an example we may take clinical trials where the relevant guideline is CONSORT. In the document outlining the guideline available here and elsewhere we read in Table 1 recommendation 15 "A table showing baseline demographic and clinical characteristics for each group". There are similar recommendations for other study types.
