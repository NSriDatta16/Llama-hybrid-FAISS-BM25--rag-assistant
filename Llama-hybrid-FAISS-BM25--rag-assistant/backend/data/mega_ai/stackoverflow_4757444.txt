How can i style textnodes that are direct children of a body-element?

I have a body elemnt containing textnodes as a direct children, but patragraphs too. Now, i would like to create my css so that this textnodes get specific css settings. On the other hand i do not want to style textnodes that are deeper down the hierachie (i.e. children of one of the paragraphs). How can i style this textnodes that are direct children of a body-element without styling textnodes that are not direct children?
