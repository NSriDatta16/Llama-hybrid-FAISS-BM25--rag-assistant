Actually, the "tune" function already split the data into training and validation set and performs, automatically, the cross-validation (10 fold) of your data. The default parameter of the "tune" function can be found by typing "?tune.control" in R console. So, what you did in your code was correct! Obs.: If you want to use the function svm directly, you should split between training, validation and test set and implement, for example, the cross-validation of the models.
