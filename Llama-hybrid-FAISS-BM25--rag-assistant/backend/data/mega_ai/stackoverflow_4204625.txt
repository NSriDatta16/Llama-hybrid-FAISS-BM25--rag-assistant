There is no way to do this using CSS. The browser indicates that a link has been visited based upon a database entry only it knows about, and then uses default colours specified in the specific browsers configuration. CSS physically just cannot obtain the colour of something on the page. That is just the way it is. The only way is to use javascript like Danny Roberts' answer. The reason I think that his answer is not working correctly is that $('a:visited') just selects all the visited links at that point in time and then the colour is changed for them. What you need to do is watch for click events and re run the code each time: var normalColor = $('a:link').css('color'); $('a').click(function() { $('a:visited').css('color', normalColor); });
