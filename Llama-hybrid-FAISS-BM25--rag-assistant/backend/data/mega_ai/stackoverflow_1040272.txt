Javascript does http requests almost just like a browser does, once you figure out what they are you can try to re-create them in perl/python/etc. With Firefox+Firebug you can see the requests in the 'Net' panel. Things you might have to take into account are user-agent string, cookies, the fact that sometimes the returned data is meant to be run/interpreted by Javascript etc. Maybe your language of choice has a nice httpbrowser class you can use? Just took a look, searching for IBM, took the post data from Firebug, replaced newlines with '&' and put it after the request url: [http://bcode.bloomberg.com/sym/dwr/call/plaincall/searchMgr.search.dwr?callCount=1&windowName=&c0-scriptName=searchMgr&c0-methodName=search&c0-id=0&c0-e1=string:ibm&c0-e2=string:&c0-e3=number:100&c0-e4=number:0&c0-e5=boolean:false&c0-param0=Object_SearchCriteria:{search:reference:c0-e1,%20filter:reference:c0-e2,%20limit:reference:c0-e3&,%20start:reference:c0-e4,%20allSources:reference:c0-e5}&batchId=4&page=%2Fsym%2F&httpSessionId=&scriptSessionId=FBC68693A4E1BC08D6E0DDFBDF6D0860] but it returns throw 'allowScriptTagRemoting is false.'; //#DWR-REPLY if (window.dwr) dwr.engine.remote.handleBatchException({ name:'java.lang.SecurityException', message:'GET Disallowed' }); else if (window.parent.dwr) window.parent.dwr.engine.remote.handleBatchException({ name:'java.lang.SecurityException', message:'GET Disallowed' }); and no data.. So it looks like you have to script a post request. Looking at their restrictions and guidelines, maybe you should just get in touch and ask if there's a public API?
