Linear independence of features in Neural Network

Not sure, if this is a silly question but...suppose I'm building a NN with n features $$ x_{1}....x_{n} $$ Furthermore, suppose I strongly believe the difference of the first 2 features has meaningful impact on my output based on real world experience. My question is: Is there any downside to manually adding an additional feature column $$x_{n+1}=x_{2}-x_{1}$$ Follow up question is: is the introduction of this new feature necessary or will the original NN be "clever enough" to discover this relationship on its own.
