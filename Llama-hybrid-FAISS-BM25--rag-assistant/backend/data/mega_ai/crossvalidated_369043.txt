welcome to stack exchange. First of all note that you can use MathJax for mathematical notation on this site: https://math.meta.stackexchange.com/questions/5020/mathjax-basic-tutorial-and-quick-reference To your question: The standard error for the normal approximation is $\sqrt{\frac{pq}{n}}$ if you draw once from a $Bi(n,p)$ and average over these n draws, i.e. divide by $n$ , or this is - as you say - equivalent to drawing $n$ times from $Bi(1,p)$ and considering their mean. So yes, if I understand you correctly, we apply the normal approximation to the $Bi(n,p)$ (if n sufficiently large), because it is the sum of $n$ Bernoulli trials and we use the normal approximation if we consider a large enough sum of independent Random Variables. This is basically explained in the link that you mention: The Variance for a $Bi(25,p)$ is $25\cdot p(1-p)$ (as the variance of a Bernoulli trial is $p(1-p)$ and $Var(\sum_{i=1}^nX_i)= nVar(X_i)$ , if $X_i$ are iid). In order to get the variance of the sum of $100$ of these Random Variables you obtain $100\cdot25\cdot p(1-p)$ (using the same rule as before). If you consider the mean and not the sum of these 100 experiments you divide by $100^2$ , as ( $Var(X/n)=\frac{1}{n^2}Var(X)$ ). Taking the square root of the variance of the mean of these 100 experiments gets you $\sqrt{\frac{25\cdot p(1-p)}{100}}=\sqrt{\frac{p\cdot(1-p)}{4}}$ , which is the standard error for binomial distribution, i.e. $[25\cdot \hat{p}-\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{4}}, 25\cdot \hat{p}+\sqrt{\frac{p(1-p)}{4}}]$ contains the value $25\cdot p$ around 68% of the time, where $\hat{p}=\frac{1}{400}\sum_{i=1}^{2500}x_i$ , i.e. the mean of all the 100 binomial trials (or 2500 Bernoulli trials).
