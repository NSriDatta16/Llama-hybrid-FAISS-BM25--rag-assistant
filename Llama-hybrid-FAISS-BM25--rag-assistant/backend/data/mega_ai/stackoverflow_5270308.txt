I've seen problems with apps where IsolatedStorage is in an invalid state I am guessing that this is the problem with your app as the example code posted in Windows phone 7 config / appSettings? did not originally call Save() on the AppSettings after you Store a value (I've just edited it!) so this leaves IsolatedStorageSettings in an invalid state so the application fails to step past the static initializer of private static IsolatedStorageSettings Settings To try to fix the problem: uninstall your app - this will clear up you isolated storage add a Save() to the end of your StoreSetting() method run again
