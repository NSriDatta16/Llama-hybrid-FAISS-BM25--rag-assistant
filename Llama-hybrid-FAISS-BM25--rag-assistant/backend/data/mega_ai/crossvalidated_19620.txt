Recurrent neural networks in R

I've heard a bit about using neural networks to forecast time series , specifically recurrent neural networks . I was wondering, is there a recurrent neural network package for R? I can't seem to find one on CRAN . The closest I've come is the nnetTs function in the tsDyn package, but that just calls the nnet function from the nnet package. There's nothing special or "reccurant" about it.
