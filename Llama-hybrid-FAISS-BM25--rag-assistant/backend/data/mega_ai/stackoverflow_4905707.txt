For a java servlet you use javax.servlet.http.Cookie to create cookies. Even if the constructor accept name and value parameters that doesn't mean that those are the only parameters that you can set. A cookie object has few setters like setDomain or setMaxAge to define your cookie. (see http://download.oracle.com/javaee/5/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html ) Finally you can add those cookies to the response object. response.addCookie(c1); (see http://www.java-tips.org/java-ee-tips/java-servlet/how-to-use-cookies-in-a-servlet.html )
