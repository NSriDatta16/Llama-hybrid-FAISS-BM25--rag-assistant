I think that if the normalization only involves two parameters and you have a good size sample that will not be a problem. I would be more concerned about the transformation and the variable selection process. 10 fold cross-validation seems to be the rage today. Doesn't anybody use bootstrap 632 or 632+ for classifier error rate estimation as suggested first by Efron (1983) in JASA and followed-up later in a paper by Efron and Tibshirani with the 632+?
