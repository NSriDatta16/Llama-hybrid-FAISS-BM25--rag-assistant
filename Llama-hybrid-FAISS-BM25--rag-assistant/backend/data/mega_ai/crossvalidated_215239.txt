These are some of the statistical measures you could use: Mean Squared Error (MSE) Mean Absolute Error (MAE) Sum of Squared Error (SSE) Sum of Absolute Error (SAE) Each of these measures can give you one perspective. For instance, while MSE gives you the average errors (or average deviations of predictions from original data), MAE is better in exhibiting the extreme points. Here is one sample explanation. You can also use Supervised learning techniques: Self-Organizing Maps (SOM) to cluster your data and analyze the data in each cluster to get to know your data better. If you have access to MATLAB, with your labeled data, it is very easy to do this. You can obtain nice illustrations as well. Neural networks. With this one, MATLAB also gives you a measure of accuracy of the model and predictions in the end.
