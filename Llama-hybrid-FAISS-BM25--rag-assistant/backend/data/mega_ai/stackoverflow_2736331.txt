LazyInitializationException in Spring

I'm getting a LazyInitializationException in my Spring Application. I have the OpenEntityManagerInViewFilter configured so I have all my relations set as FetchType.LAZY and they all work. The problem is when I try to access the user which is in session via Spring Security and print LAZY information in the JSP, something like this: ${userAuth.organisation.id} and I get org.hibernate.LazyInitializationException: could not initialize proxy - no Session though I can do ${userAuth.username} without any problem I have a custom authentication provider which is just a DAO which loads users using Hibernate The weird thing is that I get the same problem when I set organisation Object to EAGER. The problem only happens when I try to access through sec:authentication. If I add the user to the model and then access to the data in the jsp it works. Why can't I access to the data stored in a Object linked to the user? Thanks
