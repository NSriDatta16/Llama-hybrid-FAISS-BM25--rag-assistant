No, but you can achieve your objective in a less fragile and SCCS-hostile manner. Have a make target run a shell script to create a .h file. Have a make variable set itself via a shell command and pass down a -D . Not all make(1) implementations support this. Have your make target run the compiler with a -D that incorporates the shell command.
