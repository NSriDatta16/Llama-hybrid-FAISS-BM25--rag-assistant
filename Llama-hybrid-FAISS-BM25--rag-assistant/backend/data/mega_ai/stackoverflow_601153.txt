Missing the 'with' keyword in C#

I was looking at the online help for the Infragistics control library today and saw some VB code that used the With keyword to set multiple properties on a tab control. It's been nearly 10 years since I've done any VB programming, and I had all but forgotten that this keyword even existed. Since I'm still relatively new to C#, I quickly went to see if it had a similar construct. Sadly, I haven't been able to find anything. Does C# have a keyword or similar construct to mimic the functionality provided by the With keyword in VB? If not, is there a technical reason why C# does not have this? EDIT: I searched for an existing entry on this before asking my question, but didn't find the one Ray referred to ( here ). To refine the question, then, is there a technical reason why C# does not have this? And Gulzar nailed it - no, there are not a technical reason why C# does not have a With keyword. It was a design decision by the language designers.
