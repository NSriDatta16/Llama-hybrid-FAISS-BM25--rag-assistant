How to play a sound during a call on iPhone

I need to make a call in my application and need to play a sound clip in the call. How i can do this? I've tried using AudioToolbox but the sound is very low in the call; please help me, thanks! EDIT: Thanks for the answers, but it's not for streaming a song; it's for streaming some recorded sentences. Can no one help me? I need to directly stream the audio like an emulation of the microphone, or I need to play a sound with high volume that can be heared in a call. Thanks for the attention.
