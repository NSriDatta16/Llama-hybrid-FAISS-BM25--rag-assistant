Something that can at least tell you if you're on the right track design-wise is JDepend . It encourages dependency on highly abstract packages (that presumably will change less than packages with code that is less abstract) and will warn you when your packages have circular dependencies. I find it to be a good reality check. There are numerous ways to use it, including as an Eclipse plugin .
