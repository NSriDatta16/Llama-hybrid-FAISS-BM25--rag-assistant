XGBoost model in Spark --> Missing value treatment

Unlike python, where missing value is handled internally by the XGBoost algorithm, While building XGBoost model in SPARK, the missing values are implicitly converted to 0.0(float?!). Is this okay ? There are real values that may be 0.0.How can we be sure this doesn't interfere with the model prediction abilities ?
