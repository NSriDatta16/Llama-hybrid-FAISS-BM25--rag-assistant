What have you tried? There's plenty of sample code for how to save/load objects: e.g. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.isolatedstorage.isolatedstoragesettings(v=VS.95).aspx http://geekswithblogs.net/MobileLOB/archive/2010/05/07/persistent-storage-in-windows-phone-7.aspx Try writing a simple test app - you'll soon get the hang of it! Only "gotcha" I would warn you about is to make sure you call Save() after setting/changing a value
