No. Since when application pool restarts all backgound activity die I suggest to think about moving user's state to your own database or external storage. Unfortunately you'll lose automatic session management benifits (sliding expiration), but if you need backgound activity it will work better - i.e. you'll be able to move your activity out of IIS process to separate process/machine if needed later.
