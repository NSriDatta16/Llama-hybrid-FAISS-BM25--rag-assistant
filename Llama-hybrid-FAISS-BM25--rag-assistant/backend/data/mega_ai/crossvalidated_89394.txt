How to interpret output of poisson.test?

Chapter 11 of Introduction to Data Science is about Poisson distributions. One example sample has 58638 observations out of 100000 with a value less than or equal to 10. > sum(rpois(100000, lambda=10) I think I can read that as "a 0.58638 probability that values observed from this distribution are 10 or less". I'm comfortable with the fact that this is close to the theoretical probability, but not exactly the same. The book says R can show us how much variation there is around these probabilities using the R function poisson.test . > poisson.test(58638, 100000) Exact Poisson test data: 58638 time base: 1e+05 number of events = 58638, time base = 1e+05, p-value The book's explanation confuses me. I've highlighted the part I don't get. For 95% of the samples that we could generate using rpois(), using a sample size of 100,000, and a desired mean of 10 , we will get a result that lies between 0.5816434 and 0.5911456 It's confusing because I didn't tell the function that the desired mean is 10. How does it know? What if my desired mean is 3, like here? > sum(rpois(100000, lambda=3) When I set lambda (the mean) to 3, clearly there are a lot more observation with a value less than 10. How is the test relevant here?
