A better way to dynamically embed forms symfony?

I've been using Symfony's form framework for a while now. But would like to know if anyone has a better approach to embedding forms dynamically. The problem arises when I embed a form (see bottom), I need to give it an array index, as Fabian explains how the sfForm object is like a multi-dimensional array in this article Advanced forms . If I want to give the user the ability to click a button and embed another form, how can I achieve the following if they click the button multiple times: ... repeated how many time user clicks a button. I can use fast javascript to copy and paste form elements in DOM. Rather than this: ... repeated how many times user clicks a button. Requires javascript method to count how many times user clicks the button, ie to set correct array index. Also requires Ajax to call a PHP function that embeds form with this array index. I would like to avoid using this method if possible. How I embed a form: $parentForm = new ParentForm($parent) $child = new child(); $child->setParent($parent); $sfForm = new sfForm(); $sfForm ->embedForm($someIndex, new ChildForm($child)); $parentForm->embedForm('child', $sfForm);
