You can get some code coverage tools to provide you with "function coverage", e.g, whether or not a function was executed. I'd insist that every function in the API was covered. Coverage on lines inside the API's implementation is a different matter. Good practices suggest shooting for 70-80% coverage based on lines or statements and total size.
