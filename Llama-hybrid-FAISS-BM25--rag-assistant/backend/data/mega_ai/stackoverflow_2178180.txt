Help with converting CSS styles from tag to tag

Need some points on how to convert a styled tag to be used on another tag. If my CSS has a particular style that works on a tag, what do I have to do so it works on a span tag? What if the CSS style works on any paragraph tag , how can I get it to work on a div tag?
