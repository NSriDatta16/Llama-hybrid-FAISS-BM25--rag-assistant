xCode Library Paths

I'm starting a new xCode project. I'm porting in some code from my last project, but I've re-ordered the directory structure, so that it makes more sense ala: Lib Package1 File1.h File1.m Package2 File2.h File2.m etc... Now my issue is that before I was using a flat file structure and using the xCode groups to organize, however that isn't ideal. Now I've re-ordered the directory structure I am referencing the folders instead of using the groups. The problem is now that none of my imports work eg: #import "Lib/Package1/File1.h" It finds the .h file fine, but I'm getting a symbol not found error when ever I reference something that is defined in the .h file. I'm not sure why the compiler can find the .h file but can't find the symbol.
