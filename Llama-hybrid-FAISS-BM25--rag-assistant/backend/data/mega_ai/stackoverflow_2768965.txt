Well, i didn't develop large projects, but from my experience you would have to introduce some minor modifications to your code, but just to refine some things. The application itself should run just fine without recompilation. As for windows forms, i found it to be extremely slow some times when working with GDi, but maybe i was just doing something wrong. However, the Mono team claims it has full support of windows forms. One more thing worth to mention. It is really hard to write a cross-platform application, which wont be harsh without using some native OS features. I think you should always consider a possibility to write some additional OS-specific modules to provide a tight integration with the underlying OS and leverage some cool stuff (like an awesome toolbar features in OSX). You should also remember, that people are used to different look&feel on different OS's
