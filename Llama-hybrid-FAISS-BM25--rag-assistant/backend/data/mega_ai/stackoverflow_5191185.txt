You do not have to use it, nor would you want to if your users have more than just a name and email address. If you use it at all, it's a starting point to add your initial roles or key users. Because there are a number of provider options that have different implications you'll likely have to do a lot of custom programming. For example, your settings for enablePasswordRetrieval , enablePasswordReset , or requiresQuestionAndAnswer would start to shape what sort of actions you would need to accommodate. A search for ASP.NET Membership paired with MVC should lead you to what will work best in your project. I've recently gone through adding and modifying the base ASP.NET MVC Account Controller actions for users to manage their account (including email verification, resetting forgotten passwords, and changing security questions/answers) and--equally important--creating a Users Controller with Actions that help administrators perform maintenance on users (assigning to roles, unlocking accounts, or resetting passwords). I would recommend looking at Web Profile Builder to gain strongly-typed access to profile data if you intend to store more information about your users (like first and last name, etc). It is a bit surprising how much is left up to the developer to implement in this particular regard.
