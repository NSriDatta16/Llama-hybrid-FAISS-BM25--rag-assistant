For 1 , get rid of all the False rows. All of the information you need to work with is contained in the True rows. At that point, you could do a chi-squared test. However, you may prefer to use ordinal logistic regression as the levels of degree of injury are ordered, and the chi-squared test does not take that fact into account. For 2 , your percentages are computed column-wise. You want them to be row-wise. If you got rid of those percentages and just had a contingency table with two columns and 6 rows, you could do another chi-squared test (or a logistic regression).
