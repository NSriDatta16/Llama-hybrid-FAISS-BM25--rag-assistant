Custom Error provides the ability to easily customize 403 and 404 error messages. With that, you could use drupal_goto() to automatically redirect users, or drupal_get_destination() to build a login link that will return the user to the page they attempted to view. For more general, login-specific functionality, you might check out LoginToboggan . The source code for both modules will also include useful examples of how to approach this problem space if you do not want the overhead or external dependency of a module.
