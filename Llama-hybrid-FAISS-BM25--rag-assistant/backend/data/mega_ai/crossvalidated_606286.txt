Seeing as you know the sentiment for each post (not just the average sentiment by user), I would suggest a random-effects model. In your case this would look like $$ y_{ij} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_j + u_j + \varepsilon_{ij} $$ where $y_{ij}$ is the sentiment for the $i$ th post by user $j$ , $x_j$ is a covariate at the individual level (you can have more than one, obviously), $u_j \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_u)$ are the random intercepts, and $\varepsilon_{ij} \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \sigma^2_\varepsilon)$ are the error terms. This sort of model is very easy to fit in Stata, which is what I assume you're using. Take a look here: https://www.stata.com/features/overview/random-effects-panel-data-estimators/
