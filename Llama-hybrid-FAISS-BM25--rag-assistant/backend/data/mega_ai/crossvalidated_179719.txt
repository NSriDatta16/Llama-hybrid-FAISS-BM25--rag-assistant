Behavior you are describing (the not declining average distance) is completely normal for hierarchical clustering, where the output quality depends on the linkage method used and, mainly, the preprocessing method applied to the data. You are not making any reference to the number of instances you have in the data, but using 200 variables could create redundancies which should be addressed before using the clustering method, a feature selection procedure could help you in getting better outputs.
