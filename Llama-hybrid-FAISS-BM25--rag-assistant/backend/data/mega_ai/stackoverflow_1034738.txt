Embedding web controls across sites - using IFrames/Javascript

I'm just looking for clarification on this. Say I have a small web form, a 'widget' if you will, that gets data, does some client side verification on it or other AJAX-y nonsense, and on clicking a button would direct to another page. If I wanted this to be an 'embeddable' component, so other people could stick this on their sites, am I limited to basically encapsulating it within an iframe? And are there any limitations on what I can and can't do in that iframe? For example, the button that would take you to another page - this would load the content in the iframe? So it would need to exist outwith the iframe? And finally, if the button the user clicked were to take them to an https page to verify credit-card details, are there any specific security no-nos that would stop this happening? EDIT: For an example of what I'm on about, think about embedding either googlemaps or multimap on a page. EDIT EDIT: Okay, I think I get it. There are Two ways. One - embed in an IFrame, but this is limited. Two - create a Javascript API, and ask the consumer to link to this. But this is a lot more complex for both the consumer and the creator. Have I got that right? Thanks Duncan
