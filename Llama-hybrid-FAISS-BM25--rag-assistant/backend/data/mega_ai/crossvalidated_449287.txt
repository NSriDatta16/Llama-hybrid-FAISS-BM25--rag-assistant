What kind of regression model to use, with multiple target variables?

With normal Machine Learning we are focusing on 1 target variable. However, I have a case where I want to see the 'pattern' of the X-values/ predictors on 5 (instead of 1) target variable(s). The data has something like 20 predictors (X variables) and of course 5 target variables. My question: I want to answer the question, what would be the optimal for all the X-values, in order to get all the Target variables 'as high as possible'. I was thinking of making 1 target variable (combining the other 5 targets, into 1. However, this was not really working). Other thoughts were an optimization model, or a 'Multi Target Regression' (although there are not a lot of examples outside). Anyone an idea what kind of model is suitable for this? Really appreciate your help! With an example (in hopefully Python), it would be amazing.
