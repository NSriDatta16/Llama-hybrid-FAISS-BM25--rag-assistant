If you are looking to do this, I would check Microsoft's site and best practices on how to do it. There is a podcast on Deep Fried Bytes that talks about how the Microsoft.com site is setup to use virtual servers and some of their practices on how they implement it. They don't seem to have performance penalties on how they run it, but I am not certain of the details (it also talks about how they use server virtualization like a real organization would and not a company with unlimited amounts of money to throw at a problem). I believe this is the podcast: http://deepfriedbytes.com/podcast/episode-8-behind-the-scenes-at-microsoft-com/
