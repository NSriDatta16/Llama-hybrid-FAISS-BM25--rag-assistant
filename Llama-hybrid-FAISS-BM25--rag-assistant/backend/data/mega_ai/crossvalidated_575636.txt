Estimate the Numbers of samples required for each variable

I am tasked to help with organizing the driving experiments for a robot. The goal is that for each Terrain Class like forest, wet-meadows, dry-meadows we will measure the time it takes the robot to move through it. As I understand, we have two important factors: 1) slope of the terrain and 2) the feature-class represented as cid in the graphic below. We have 5 slope intervals ranging from 0-5° up to 25-30°. As you can see in the graphic below, most of the area is between 15 and 25°. I now want to estimate, how many areas [m²] per class we need to drive through to get an adequate sample size for each feature and for each slope. I don't know how to start with it, my naive approach would be to cover at least 20% of each feature for each slope when planning the route. The advanced option would be to choose the sample size according to a 95% confidence interval. How would the different slope categories play into that? What would you recommend as a strategy to make sure every class and slope is covered. Is there further literature that can help me understand the problem better? X-Axis: Slope in degrees. Y-Axis: The percentage of coverage each feature for each slope has on the total area of the test side. Legend: Class-Identifier e.g., 11 = Forest, 81 = Shrubland, 431 = Paths, etc.
