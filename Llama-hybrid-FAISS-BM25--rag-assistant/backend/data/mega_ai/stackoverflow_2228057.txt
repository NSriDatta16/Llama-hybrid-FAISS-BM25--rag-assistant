Unfortunately, no one came up with a ready-to-use replacement that I can just install on my computer and host locally. So I'm sorry, but I'll have to answer this one by my own. Due to missing alternatives, I had to create my own service with the least efforts in order to create a almost-alike service (atleast for HTTP-based item storage). Here is what I did: 1) Installed nginx as a webserver together with the mogileFS and Secure Link module and. 2) Configured the mogileFS module in order to accept PUT/DELETE requets. 3) Setup some rules in order to force bucket/key directory structures. 4) Setup the Secure Link module with some rewriting rules in order to fake signed uris. 5) Setup BASIC authentication for faking authorized requests. 6) Extended my existing connector to use my own server. Due to the functional similarity, this was rather easy. I just had to change authentication and uri signing. That is not a cute solution, however it works and don't had to code much by my own.
