Cook's distance, not plotting an observation with leverage one. What is this?

I am doing some regression diagnostics in R. I use plot() function and look at the four graphs. However, when I reach Cook's distance graph, I receive a warning saying, "not plotting observations with leverage one: 2174 ". What does this mean, and how do I find the data point that causes trouble? What's annoying is that r gives me IDs for those data points (e.g. 2174; 4588, etc.), but I can't figure out what these numbers stand for. Any ideas on how to find out? This is probably "row names", so simply their number. But I can't understand why they're leverage points. It's probably because they have low values for X (they're 0s), but they have some value for Y. The point 2174 seems to have the highest Y value out of all marked data points by R.
