Does the user agent string have to be exactly as it appears in my server logs?

When using a Robots.txt file, does the user agent string have to be exactly as it appears in my server logs? For example when trying to match GoogleBot, can I just use googlebot ? Also, will a partial-match work? For example just using Google ?
