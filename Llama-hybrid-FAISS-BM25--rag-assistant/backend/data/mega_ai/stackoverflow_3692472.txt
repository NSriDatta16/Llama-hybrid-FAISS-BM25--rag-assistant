You need to actually initialise the TimerCountSeconds and DecreaseTimer members in initialise. Assuming you're control flow is: ... myObject = [[MyObject alloc] initialize]; ... [myObject touchesBegan:...] ... [myObject touchesEnded:...] ... Then when you call initialize TimerCountSeconds has not been initialised, so you're logically doing [ isValid] Which will crash. Similarly DecreaseTimer is invalid the first time you call touchesBegan. In your initialise method you will need to actually initialise everything, before you attempt to use anything. You also appear to be leaking timers ( touchesBegin invalidates the timer but does not release it)
