If you want to see what ppm packages are available, go to Kobes Search . There you'll see that ParallelUserAgent is currently only available for perl 5.8 in the repositories known to Kobes. I see a lot of test failures on Windows so I kind of doubt that it'll work there anyway, but it's a pure perl module, so all you really have to do is copy the files from the CPAN distribution to see for yourself whether it works or not.
