Organizing data to run regression

I have experience with both regression and R but am a bit puzzled with how exactly to set up this regression. I am looking at sporting events where two teams play head to head. From each of these games I have the statistics for those games for the winning team and the losing team. I want to predict the MOV based on a number of those statistics. Here is how I currently have the data set up: Year Winning_TM Winning_TM_Pts Losing_TM Losing_TM_Pts MOV ... 2011 A 45 B 32 13 2012 C 27 D 25 2 ... There is much more data but I think you can see how the data is arranged currently. My concern is what effects this will have on the model when in the future I want to predict the margin of victory for a given team? Is there a better way to organize this data so that the model meets its purpose and doesn't? Note: The model set up, in my mind, would look something like this (possibly with other statistics depending on their utility): MOV ~ Yds_Rush + Yds_Pass + SOS
