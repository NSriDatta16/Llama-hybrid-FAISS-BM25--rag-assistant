If you're not sure about how to get Thrift to generate the bindings then go with what Schildmeijer posted. Use a simple web server running php + phpcassa or any language of your choice that comes with a high level client library -- list here: High level clients . You can use some open source libraries to expose resources from Cassandra as JSON or XML then use NSURLRequests to do the work. If you go with XML then Google's GDataXML is an excellent choice of parser, if you go with JSON then json-library on Google Code is another great choice. Have fun!
