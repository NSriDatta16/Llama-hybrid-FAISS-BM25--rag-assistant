AFAIK the ONLY way of preventing a second vote is by authenticating. Obviously this is not always possible, so you have to mitigate the possibility of a single user casting a ton of votes. Throttle the voting by source IP. Use the getRemoteAddr() to allow, say... a vote per hour?... per minute? ... it will depend on how much voting you expect. Adjust the number according to experience. Plant a cookie on the response for every voting poll, which expires after the ballot closes. Make it harder to forge requests by checking and validating headers like Referer and User-Agent .
