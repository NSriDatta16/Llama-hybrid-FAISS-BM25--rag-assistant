I think I have found what I have been looking for in the paper of Rob Hyndman: "...there are nine classical and advanced statistical features describing a time seriesâ€™ global characteristics. They are: trend, seasonality, periodicity, serial correlation, skewness, kurtosis, non-linearity, self-similarity, and chaos." (Wang/Smith/Hyndman (2006),Characteristic-Based Clustering for Time Series Data)
