I am an aerospace engineer; I have been using quaternions for spacecraft attitude control and navigation for going on three decades. Here are some thoughts on your situation: Performing any kind of process that changes orientation with Euler angles is verging on impossible. Euler angles suffer from singularities - angles will instantaneously change by up to 180 degrees as other angles go through the singularity; Euler angles are virtually impossible to use for sequential rotations. Quaternions do not suffer from either of these problems There are 12 different possible Euler angle rotation sequences - XYZ, XYX, XZY, etc. There is no one "simplest" or "right" set of Euler angles. To derive a set of Euler angles, you must know which rotation sequence you are using and stick to it. I suggest you perform all storage and rotation operations with quaternions and only convert a quaternion to Euler angles when output is required. When you do this, you must define which Euler rotation sequence you are using. I have algorithms for all these operations and many more: quaternions to/from Euler angles of any rotation sequence to/from rotation matrices (direction cosine matrices), quaternion interpolation matching position, rate, etc. at end or intermediate points, rigid and flexible body dynamics and kinematics using quaternions. Please contact me if I can be of assistance at nhughes1ster@gmail.com
