If you have some document-like data (structured), I'll suggest to use DOM (document object model) and than convert it in desired format (xml, html, doc, whatever). But if you have just some application output, you can easily wrap it with html. Not necessarily within java - you can also store your program's output in plain text file and convert it in html later (add body, paragprahs, headers and other HTML elements).
