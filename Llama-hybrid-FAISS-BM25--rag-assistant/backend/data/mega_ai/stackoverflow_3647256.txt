I think this is actually a bug, as why would you not be able to get a products name? So, I've submitted it as such: http://www.magentocommerce.com/bug-tracking/issue?issue=9812 I did come up with a workaround for this, if anyone needs it: getData('sku'); $_currentproduct = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->loadByAttribute('sku', $sku); ?> getProductUrl() ?>"> htmlEscape($_currentproduct->getName()) ?> Basically youâ€™re just using the sku, which you can get straight from the product collection, to load the name separately.
