I think you can get a decent approximation by Using FlatteningPathIterator to get a polygon that approximates the blob. Dividing the path around the polygon into subpaths of nondecreasing y (that is, downward pathsâ€”imagine drawing the polygon using only downward strokes of the pencil). Walking the downward paths in concert, comparing each line segment only with line segments that at least overlap in the y dimension. This is pretty simple and avoids the O( n 2 ) performance you're worried about. For your average basic blob, like the ones in your illustration, there are only two downward paths. You can reduce the number of comparisons further by keeping the downward paths sorted horizontally as you go (a TreeSet , perhaps). Another way to compare only line segments that overlap in the y dimension is to use an interval tree .
