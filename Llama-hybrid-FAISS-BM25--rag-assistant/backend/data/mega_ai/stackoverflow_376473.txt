I would keep your aging laptop to use for testing thin client apps - who cares if it's aging how much power does it need to run Internet Explorer? My dream development system at this moment in time would look something like this: A couple of nice fast dual core processors 4 Gigs of memory A couple of Intel X25-M 180Gb Solid State Hard Disks to run my apps off. 3 x 19+" high contrast ratio monitors, these 3 I have on my desk are wicked. Ergonomic keyboard, I currently have the Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 which I quite like Wireless Laser Mouse, I currently use the Logitech MX Revolution and I love it A 2Tb SATA drive for extra storage space (just in case) Of course, I don't have any of this at home, I have an aging laptop just like you. I have part of this setup on my desk at work and I keep drooling over the other bits and pieces.
