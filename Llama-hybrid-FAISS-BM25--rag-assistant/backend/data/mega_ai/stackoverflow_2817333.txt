LaTex, align alignment characters between align blocks

I would like to align two alignment characters between two align blocks so that I can have some text in the middle of a derivation with equations maintaining the horizontal alignment. For example the following excerpt of latex using align \begin{align*} \frac{\delta \phi}{\delta x_1} = {} &\frac{9}{8}\frac{\delta_1\phi}{\delta_1x_1}-\frac{1}{8}\frac{\delta_3\phi}{\delta_3x_1} \\ & \frac{9}{8}\frac{1}{h_1}\left[\phi(x_1+h_1/2)-\phi(x_i-h_1/2)\right]-\frac{1}{8}\frac{1}{3h_1}\left[\phi(x_i+3h_1/2)-\phi(x_1-3h_1/2)\right] \end{align*} some text in the middle \begin{align*} & \frac{9}{8}\frac{1}{h_1}\left[\phi(x_1+h_1/2)-\phi(x_i-h_1/2)\right]-\frac{1}{8}\frac{1}{3h_1}\left[\phi(x_i+3h_1/2)-\phi(x_1-3h_1/2)\right] \end{align*} Ideally I would like the left of the equation in the second block to line up with that of the second equation in the first block. I could do a workaround by not having text in the middle, however, I would like this functionality. EDIT I would like to have a good amount of text between. Say three to four lines that line up as normal paragraphs. Adding text in the alignment block is the workaround I poorly alluded to.
