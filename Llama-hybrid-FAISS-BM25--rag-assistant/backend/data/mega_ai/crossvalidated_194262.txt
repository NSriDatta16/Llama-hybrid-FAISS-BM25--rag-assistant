What is the difference between sensitivity analysis and model validation?

I read both wikipedia pages of sensitivity analysis and model validation (here, only linear regression validation) but I don't manage to find a way to separate these two terms. I have the impression that the first one is more used in academia and engineering in general and the second one in "data science". One option I see is to modify the level of description of these terms: sensitivity analysis is more like a general terms to design a high level branch of methods, and model validation may be more specific and be include in sensitivity analysis. Any thought? I am more interested in the difference than in the similarities between these two notions.
