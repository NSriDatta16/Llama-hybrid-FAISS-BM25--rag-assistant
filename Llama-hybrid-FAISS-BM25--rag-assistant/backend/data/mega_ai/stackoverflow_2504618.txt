What are interesting ideas for experimenting with Artificial Neural Networks?

I'm after a list of possible neural network implementations that can be experimented with. Possibly something that could take an hour to a week to write. What other possibilities are there? Here's the list so far: Games tic-tac-toe Connect 4 Chess Go Sudoku paper/scissors/rock horse racing predictor Visual recognition Character recognition (typefaces, letters, numbers, etc) Facial recognition Audio recognition Language detection Male vs female Word recognition Language detection (natural, programming) Pathfinding "Artificial neural network driven mobile robots learn how to drive on roads in simulation." http://cig.felk.cvut.cz/projects/robo/ , http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lmPJeKRs8gE Some links to more: http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~anderson/res/project-ideas.html
