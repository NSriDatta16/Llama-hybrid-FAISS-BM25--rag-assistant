Help with Cocoa: Objects as views?

in my app I want to have a light table to sort photos. Basically it's just a huge view with lots of photos in it and you can drag the photos around. Photos can overlap, they don't fall into a grid like in iPhoto. So every photo needs to respond to mouse events. Do I make every photo into its own view? Or are views too expensive to create? I want to easily support 100+ photos or more. Photos need to be in layers as well so I can change the stacking order. Do I use CoreAnimation for this? I don't need finished source code just some pointers and general ideas. I will (try to) figure out the implementation myself. Fwiw, I target 10.5+, I use Obj-C 2.0 and garbage collection. Thanks in advance!
