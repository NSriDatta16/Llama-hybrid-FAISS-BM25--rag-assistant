jquery ui sortable('refresh') not working!

I have a sortable list I'm working with that can have elements added and removed by another script through jquery and am having an odd problem. These newly generated items appear to be draggable, but they don't actually sort unless I have them already there at page load. I've tried using sortable('refresh'), but it seems to have no effect.
