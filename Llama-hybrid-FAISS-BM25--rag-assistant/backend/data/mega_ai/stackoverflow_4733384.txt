How to get multiple controls to fire same event/command in Silverlight / XAML?

I am using Mvvm-Light Commands to route events from my Views to my ViewModels. Works great. But I think I can be more elegant. This is actually probably just a standard XAML question: I want to change this (10 buttons all with Click="keypadButton_Click" for their event handler): To 10 of these: But I don't want that much XAML. I would think there would be a way to "macroize" the Trigger so it would look something like this: Where "{Binding _SendTheEventHere_}" should be replaced with some magic incantation that I am clueless about, but I know some wizard here on stackoverflow knows :-). Make sense?
