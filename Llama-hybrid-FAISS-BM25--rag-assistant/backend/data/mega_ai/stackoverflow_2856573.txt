unobtrusive "default" text in input WITHOUT jQuery

i'm trying to write unobtrusive default/placeholder text in input (actually, relatively placed label over input , which hides on onFocus , and stays hidden if input isn't empty on onBlur ), but I don't want to use jQuery, because this is the only javascript used on page - therefore using jQuery seems a bit over the top. Please, how can I do this without jQuery? Thank you. EDIT: I know the idea ( getElementByID ), but I'm more looking into how to add it to document - preferably something you have used before. Thank you. EDIT: Thank you all, I finally went with jQuery, seeing answers :] (my example is here: http://jsbin.com/ehega/3 - it's concept, I'll probably add more eye candy. As an answer I Robert Koritnik - because of valid points... and styling ;])
