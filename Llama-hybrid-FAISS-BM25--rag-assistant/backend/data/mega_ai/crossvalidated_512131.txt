The US National Institute of Standards and Technology has a helpful introduction to many of these issues under the title Assessing Product Reliability . Although that might be considered a type of survival analysis, there are considerations not typical of clinical survival analysis--like distinguishing between "non-repairable" and "repairable" systems and modeling "repairable" systems--in ways that are related to your question. Putting that into a broader context, as in your last paragraph, involves additional disciplines. Supply-chain modeling is a major field itself. Search on that term. You might find further information under the more generic term operations research . These latter disciplines are well outside my expertise.
