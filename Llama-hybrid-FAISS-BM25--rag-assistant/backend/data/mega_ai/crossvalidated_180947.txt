Calculate MASE for time series with multiple seasonalities

What is an appropriate way to calculate the MASE accuracy measure (Link) for a time series with multiple seasonalities? For example: daily data with a strong weekly pattern and annual pattern. The naive seasonal forecast used to scale the error is only allowing one seasonal pattern m . Using m = 365 : we are not considering the weekly pattern anymore (365 is not a multiple of 7). Using m = 7 : we are not considering the annual pattern anymore. m = 364 considers the weekly pattern and most of the annual pattern. Is that thought right? Any other idea how to calculate the MASE for multiple seasonalities?
