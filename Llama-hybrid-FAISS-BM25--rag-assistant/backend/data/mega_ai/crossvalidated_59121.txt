Bootstrap is neither in-sample or out-of-sample test. Consider the bootstrap logic: 1. a statistic is computed in the original sample; 2. a resample is constructed by sampling from the sample with replacement (this sample is considered to be a possible sample from the same population) 3. the same statistic a computed 4. step 2 and 3 are repeated and the distribution of the obtained statistics is then used to construct a confidence interval Now translate this to the notion of out-of-sample testing, where you estimate a prediction model based on the original sample and then test out-of-sample. The out-of-sample sample should be any sample other than the original sample drawn from the same population. Resampling with replacement provides you with such a sample, or indeed many such samples should you so wish. Now you can use the original model estimates from your original prediction model to predict outcomes in the new resample(s). You can now compute a model-fit statistic to see if these predicted outcomes predict a similar share of the variation in the original sample and all of the resamples. Are all results comparatively similar, then overfitting is no issue. Are the results of resamples (significantly) worse than the model fit in the original sample, then you've got evidence of overfitting. When comparing different training models, you can select the model with the best (average) modelfit in the resamples. More advanced strategies involve the variance of the modelfit, but add little in my opinion. Best wishes
