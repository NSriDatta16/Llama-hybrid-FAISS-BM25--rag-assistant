In jQuery, what's the proper way to "move" an element from its parent to another element?

Using jQuery 1.4 and jQueryUI 1.8 Specifically, I'm using draggables/droppables, and when dropped, I would like to move the draggable (it's children, events, etc) from belonging to its parent element to be appended/added as a child of the drop target. I know that in the droppable drop option, I can supply the following callback: function(event, ui) { // stuff } where $(this).target will be the drop target, and ui.draggable will be the child element I would like to move - but I'm not sure the proper way to actually perform the move, preserving events, etc.
