One alternative is to use append(), addClass(), css(), attrib() and other jQuery methods to construct DOM. Chaining will make the code more elegant. This will work well, especially for small DOM trees. If you need bigger DOM trees, then it would be better to use AJAX methods to fetch them from the server. You will need to adapt your code in order to pass the dynamically generated data. Also, you may consider redesigning your html and javascript code. You may for example put the DOM tree in the html and hide it (using CSS or javascript). Then you could show it after you have added the dynamically generated data. This is much better from separation of concerns point of view.
