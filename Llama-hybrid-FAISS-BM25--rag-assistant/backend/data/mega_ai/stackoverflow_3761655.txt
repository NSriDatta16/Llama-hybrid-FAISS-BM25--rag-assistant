How do you handle timezones for data processing?

curious how people have solved this problem... I have a series of jobs that run overnight that roll up reports based on that day's data for customers. They're now asking for timezone support. One of the reports is.. you had x number of orders last night, however last night could be different depending on timezone. What is the best way to organize or process the data so timezones are taking into account to make that job easier? thanks
