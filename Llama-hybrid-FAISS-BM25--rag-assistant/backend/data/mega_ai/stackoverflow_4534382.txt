The WikiPedia pages for HTML, XML and CSS will have a ton of information, as well as links to a ton more information. So I'll just address the second part of the question... If you're doing web development, it's definitely in your best interests to learn these things, especially HTML. Sure, Visual Studio will generate stuff for you and all you have to do is drag and drop widgets onto a form. However, if you don't actually know what it's doing for you or understand how the tool works then you're seriously limiting yourself. Sometimes dragging an ASP .NET server control onto the form and setting a few properties is the best (as in quickest and easiest without significant side-effects) way to accomplish a particular task, sometimes it isn't. If you're familiar with only one tool then you can only do what that one tool is designed to do. You'll end up trying to fit other tasks into the scope of that tool, with potentially dismal results. Visual Studio has a history of generating poor HTML. It's certainly improved over the years, but it's not something on which you want to rely. You can create simpler, more efficient, and ultimately easier to support code by having a better understanding of the underlying technologies involved and putting in a little work yourself.
