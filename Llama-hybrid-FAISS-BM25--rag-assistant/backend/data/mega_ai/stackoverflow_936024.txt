One of the best courses I took was a technical writing course. It has served me well in my career. Additionally: it probably does not matter WHAT the topic is - the fact that the organization is interested in it and is paying for it and the developers want to go and do go, is a better indicator of success/improvement than any one particular topic. I also don't think it matters that much what the topic is. Dev organizations deal with so many things during a project that training and then on the job implementation/trial and error will always get you some better perspective - even if the attempts to try out/use the new stuff fail. That experience will probably help more on the subsequent projects.
