If you're getting a high reject rate it implies your proposal distribution is too wide. Are you getting fuzzy caterpillar plots (WinBugs makes these)? They are a good diagnostic of model behavior. MCMC models don't converge in the usual sense. Rather they continually sample from the uncertainty distribution, and those samples give you estimates of mean and variance-covariance of parameters.
