You are using MyISAM which is being deprecated soon. An alternative would be InnoDB. "InnoDB is a transaction-safe (ACID compliant) storage engine for MySQL that has commit, rollback, and crash-recovery capabilities to protect user data. InnoDB row-level locking (without escalation to coarser granularity locks) and Oracle-style consistent nonlocking reads increase multi-user concurrency and performance. InnoDB stores user data in clustered indexes to reduce I/O for common queries based on primary keys. To maintain data integrity, InnoDB also supports FOREIGN KEY referential-integrity constraints. You can freely mix InnoDB tables with tables from other MySQL storage engines, even within the same statement."\ http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb.html According to: http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/storage-engine/part_1.html , you should be able to switch between different engine by utilizing a simple alter command which allows you some flexibility. It also states that each table in your DB can be configured independently.
