Training in steps has any importance?

I'm trying to train a Siamese network for face Verification and eventually I came across the Contrastive Loss method for embedding vector distancing (kinda... I guess...). At the end, the model needs to yield '1' if two images has the same person in it, else '0' . I though maybe I should first train the CNN to yield correct vectors with the "Contrastive Loss", and only after training was finished, add a FC layer with 1 output, and train again with the "Binary Cross Entropy", but ( and thats the question ) Is that mandatory? or I could train the model with both losses simultainously? Does the steps on training the model has effects on the training?
