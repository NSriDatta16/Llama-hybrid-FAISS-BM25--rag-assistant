How to identify statistical significance in a difference between means of grouped survey questions

I'm looking at some survey data where the questions were on a Likert scale. For each question I get what percentage respond positive/neutral/negative. There are on the order of 30,000 survey respondents. There are also some indices associated with the survey where a number of questions (usually 5) on a similar topic are grouped together, so you have the average positive/neutral/negative response rate for the grouping. What is the appropriate test to identify statistically significant differences in these index values? To be clear, two comparisons are being made: the index of a subset (usually on the order of 1000 to 3000 respondents) versus the rest of the population the index of a subset of the population versus that same subset's index in a prior year's survey
