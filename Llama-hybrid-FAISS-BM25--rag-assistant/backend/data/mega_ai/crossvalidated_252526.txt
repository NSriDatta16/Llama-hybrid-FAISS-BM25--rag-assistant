Silhouette value after normalizing a variable and re-clustering

I have a non-normalized variable and other normalized variables and I make a clustering with k medoids (or k means). If I let the first variable non-normalized, I get better results in terms of average silhouette coefficient. If I normalize it, I get worse results. I know that if the variable doesn't get normalized then it's like to give a "weight" to the variable. I'd ask if an high average silhouette coefficient means a better clustering whether I normalize or not. Thanks.
