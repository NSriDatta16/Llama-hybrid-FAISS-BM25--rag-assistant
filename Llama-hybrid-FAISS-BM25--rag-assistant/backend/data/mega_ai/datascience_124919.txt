Cross validation and standard error

I'm performing a CV and I need to report the score with its error, but it only returns the score's average from the folds. Is there a way to either show each folder's score or find the standard error from the folds? import Orange data = in_data knn = Orange.classification.KNNLearner(n_neighbors=5) res = Orange.evaluation.testing.CrossValidation(data,[knn]) print(Orange.evaluation.scoring.CA(res),Orange.evaluation.scoring.AUC(res))
