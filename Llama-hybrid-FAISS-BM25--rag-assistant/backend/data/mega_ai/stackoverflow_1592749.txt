I m only speaking for java web app development: i think its going to be quite similar to how you might've done it in C# using ASP.NET, except you don't get the visual drag and drop GUI creation using visual studio. The basic concepts are pretty much the same. As for libraries, there are a million and one in java, and only time will help with those. But it'll help knowing the common ones, such as apache commons , google collections , spring , hibernate . It might help you get started if you start with something like Appfuse , which is a full java RAD web app framework that munges together all the above common frameworks. On the build tools side, there are ant and maven as the major players. I prefer ant over maven personally.
