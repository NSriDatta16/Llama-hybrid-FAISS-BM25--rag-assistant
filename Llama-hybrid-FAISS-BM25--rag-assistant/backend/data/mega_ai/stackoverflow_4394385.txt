Your first step is to read the following_siblings documentation: Find sibling elements which follow the current one. Like the other “sibling” methods, this weeds out text and comment nodes . Then you should use the Hpricot source to generalize how following_siblings works to get something that works like following_siblings but doesn't filter out non-container nodes: parsed = Hpricot(text) link = parsed.search('//a[@href="http://www.somelink.com/foo/bar.html"]').first link_sibs = link.parent.children what_you_want = link_sibs[link_sibs.index(link) + 1 ... link_sibs.length] puts what_you_want That's pretty much following_siblings with parent.children instead of parent.containers . Having access to the source code of the libraries you use is pretty handy and studying it is to be encouraged.
