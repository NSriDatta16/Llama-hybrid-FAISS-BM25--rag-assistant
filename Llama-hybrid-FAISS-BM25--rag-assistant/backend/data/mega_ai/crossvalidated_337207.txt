Abnormally high standard error in binary logistic regression

I did a binary logistic regression test on SPSS with a sample size of 24. The study is about the correlation of teenage pregnancy and depressive symptoms. Of the 24, 11 are pregnant teenagers. Of the 24 only 1 is positive for the presence of depressive symptoms. Both variables are recoded to nominal, so that 1 means yes and 0 means no. What could the abnormally high standard error mean? And is there any way to solve it? Hoping for kind responses. Thank you.
