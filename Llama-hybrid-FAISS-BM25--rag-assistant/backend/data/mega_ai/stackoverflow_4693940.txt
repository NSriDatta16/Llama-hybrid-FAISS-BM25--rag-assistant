data compression - machine learning for exponential distribution

Are there any machine learning algorithms, prediction models that can help me compress exponentially distributed data? I have already encoded the file using golomb codes, which definitely saves tons of space, but this is not enough -- I need compression. PAQ8L does not compress it enough. Please ask for the file if needed. Exponentially distributed -- {a,b,b,a,a,b,c,c,a,a,b,a,a,b,a,c,b,a,b,d}
