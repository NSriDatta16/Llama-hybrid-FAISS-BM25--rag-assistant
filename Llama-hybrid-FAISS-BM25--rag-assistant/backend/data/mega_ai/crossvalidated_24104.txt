I think you will usually have the first step of converting to a regular time series. You said you take the average of 90 days. Since you have data that is more frequent than that, I think it makes more sense to use the most of what you have by taking the days between each observation and dividing it by the number of items sold for that period (assuming that is what your second column is). As a disclaimer I am a total amateur, so you want to take the advice of an expert like IrishStat over the following code (for example, he said ETS is a bad model, so only treat this as a toy example), but in hopes that this saves you some time, here is some R code you can play with: library("xts") library("forecast") x = read.table(text="27/02/2012 48 17/02/2012 24 09/02/2012 16 02/02/2012 7 25/01/2012 12 16/01/2012 16 05/01/2012 16 23/12/2011 4 16/12/2011 14 09/12/2011 4 02/12/2011 2") #Convert the data into an XTS object which works with irregular time series x.xts = xts(x[,2], as.POSIXct(x[,1], format="%d/%m/%Y")) #Conver to a daily rate by taking the observed data and dividing it by #the number of days between observations daily_rate The resulting plot is:
