it's not that hard if you understand the usual dragging functions Chris Butler gave you. I use this: var start = function () { //storing original coordinates this.xSource = this.attrs.path[0][1]; this.ySource = this.attrs.path[0][2]; this.xDest = this.attrs.path[1][1]; this.yDest = this.attrs.path[1][2]; this.attr({opacity: 0.5}); }, move = function (dx, dy) { //move will be called with dx and dy var xS = this.xSource+dx; var xD = this.xDest+dx; var yS = this.ySource+dy; var yD = this.yDest+dy; this.attr({path: "M"+ xS +" "+ yS +"L"+ xD +" "+yD}); }, drag = function(){ this.node.drag(this.move,this.start,this.up); }; You can also know which sort of figure you're dragging in the functions with this.type, so that you can make these functions work for all sort of figures.
