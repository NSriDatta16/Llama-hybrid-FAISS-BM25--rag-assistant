Endianness in casting an array of two bytes into a single short

Problem: I cannot understand the number 256 (2^8) in the extract of the IBM article : On the other hand, if it's a big-endian system, the high byte is 1 and the value of x is 256. Assume each element in an array consumes 4 bites, then the processor should read somehow: 1000 0000. If it is a big endian, it is 0001 0000 because endianness does not affect bits inside bytes. [2] Contradiction to the 256 in the article!? Question: Why is the number 256_dec (=1000 0000_bin) and not 32_dec (=0001 0000_bin)? [2] Endian issues do not affect sequences that have single bytes, because "byte" is considered an atomic unit from a storage point of view.
