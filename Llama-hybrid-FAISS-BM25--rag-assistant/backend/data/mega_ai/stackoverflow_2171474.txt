Event observers can be defined in the config.xml for any module that is active in the system, they don't necessarily have to be defined in the same module. You can send data to the event observers by adding information to the event object, which is done in an array defined as the second argument to dispatchEvent. Just add more elements to the array and the event observer method can extract it from $observer->getEvent(). You are also free to define your own events by calling the same dispatchEvent method. One of the handy things about most Magento models is that they are inherited from the Mage_Core_Model_Abstract class which includes event for _load_after, _save_before, _save_after, _delete_before and _delete_after. For example, the product model has catalog_product_load_after, catalog_product_save_before, etc. Hope that gives you some more information about the possibilities of using events.
