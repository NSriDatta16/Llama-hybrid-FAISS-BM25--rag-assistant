You'll need to add a link inside the list item that contains the tab, for closing at least, that would be the "x out" button. If the user clicks that link and you have a jquery event handler for clicking on all the links of that class, it will know the index. Same for moving/dragging. The tricky part, I'm thinking, is if you add new tabs, what is the tab going to say? "Untitled"?
