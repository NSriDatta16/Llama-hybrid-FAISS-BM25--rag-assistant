Centring a flow in Shoes

Can I center the contents of a flow in Shoes? I know that a paragraph can be centred like: para 'Centred paragrpah', :align=>'center' However, this does not work with flows: flow(:align=>'center') do â€¦ end No errors are brought up, but the contents remain left justified.
