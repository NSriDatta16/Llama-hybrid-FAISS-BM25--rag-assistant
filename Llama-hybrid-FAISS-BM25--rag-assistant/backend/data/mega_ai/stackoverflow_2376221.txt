To make this easy you need to break it into two steps. Work out exactly what the POST you need for Google Docs. I'd use Firebug or similar to work this out. I'm guessing it's something like formkey , then a bunch of fields like field1 , field2 etc. Now use MSXML2 to POST the data (Ive no idea why this isnt appearing formatted as code). Set http= CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP") myURL= " http://www.somedomain.com " http.Open "POST", myURL, False http.setRequestHeader "User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)" http.send ("") ''// Not sure this additional SEND is needed.. probably not http.send("formkey=Fd0SHgwQ3Yw&field1=A&field2=B") MsgBox http.responseText
