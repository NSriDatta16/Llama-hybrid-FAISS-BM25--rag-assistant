I'm planning to record video now and then analyze it in the future once AI programs are more accurate, what resolution and FPS should I record at?

I'm going to record videos and want to future proof them for AI analysis as much as possible. I have a decent amount of storage to work with, 2.7TB. I'm hoping to make it last for at least two years. I would be recording for about 10 - 15 minutes every day. I'm trying to decide between 30FPS vs 60FP and 1080p vs 4K. I'm leaning towards 1080p at 60FPS. I would think recording at a higher resolution and FPS would be better because it would give me more data to work with and I could analyze the smaller changes. Is my thinking correct? I don't know if higher-resolution or higher framerate would be more useful in analysis. Thanks.
