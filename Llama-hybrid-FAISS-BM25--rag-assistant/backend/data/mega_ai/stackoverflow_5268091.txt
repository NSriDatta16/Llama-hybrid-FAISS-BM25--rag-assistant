How do I include everything

I've been fighting with my compiler for too long. Problems with circular includes, redefinitions, "missing ';' before *" and so on. This seems like the place to get a good answer. How do I include everything into everything else, and never have to worry about the subtleties of includes ever, ever again? What combination of #DEFINE, #pragma, #include, or whatever else do I need to do to ensure that data types in the murky depths of my project hierarchy will have no difficulty knowing what anything else is? This is not a troll post, incase such a concept is entirely unthinkable, nor is it posted in the middle of being angry. I'm simply curious as to whether or not such a possibility exists. Dealing with spaghetti includes is probably the biggest headache I have to deal with in C++, and getting rid of it would increase my workflow significantly. Cheers, Brian
