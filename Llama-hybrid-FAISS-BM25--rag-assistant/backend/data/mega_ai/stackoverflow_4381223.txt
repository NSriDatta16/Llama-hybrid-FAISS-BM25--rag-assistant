Dynamically changing jqueryui accordion event handler from "click" to "mouseover"

I have a situation where I would like to be able to drag an item from a list into a target in an accordion. However, the item that I am dragging to might be in another panel (one that isn't open). In order to facilitate this, I would like to dynamically change the accordion's event from click to mouseover once the drag starts. After the drag is complete, I'll switch back to click. This will let the user hover over the closed panel, causing it to open at which point they can drop the item. Once they're done, I'd prefer that they use a click to open the panel. Is this possible? I've tried using the setter: $( ".selector" ).accordion( "option", "event", 'mouseover' ); but it doesn't seem to actually change the event on the fly. I found some mention that this might not be supported. If not, does anyone know how I might do this?
