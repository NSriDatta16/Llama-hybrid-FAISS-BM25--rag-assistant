Its better to do supervised classification then unsupervised clustering since you have the right labels for the response. Now in supervised classification approach 1 is better than approach 2 because in approach 2 you will the reducing the already available information by combining features. Approach 3 is advised where you will create more features from the given 3 features by use of NLP processing, sentiments, tags, chunking, time taken, text length etc and then selecting the features those provide more information gain using feature selection approaches.
