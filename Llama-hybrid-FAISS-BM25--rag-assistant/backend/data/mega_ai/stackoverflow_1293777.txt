Opening a new browser page on the second monitor

Well, simple situation. Is it possible to detect if a user has a dual monitor setup from a web application? If this is possible, is it possible to open a child browser page on this second monitor, so the new window doesn't overlap the old one? Reason why I ask: I'm working on a web application and at home I have a dual-monitor system. When I go to the administration part of this site, I want it to open in a new browser, preferably on the other desktop. Of course, I could just click, then drag the new window, but doing this automatically seems more fun. :-) Don't think JavaScript has the proper functions for this. How about Java itself?
