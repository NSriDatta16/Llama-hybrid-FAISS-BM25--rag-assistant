why hyperic can't auto-discover my Jboss AppSvr?

I installed JBoss AS on xx.xx.12.48. I launched ./bin/run.sh -b xx.xx.12.48. The JMX web console indicates everything is OK. On xx.xx.12.49, I installed Hyperic (latest). I installed Hyperic agent on xx.xx.12.48 I can see both Hyperic agents, on both servers. But ther's nothing about my JBoss AS server !!! Why can't Hyperic Auto-Discover finds my JBoss server ? Is there a simple way to configure ? Thanks
