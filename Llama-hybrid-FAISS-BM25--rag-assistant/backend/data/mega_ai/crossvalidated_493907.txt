You can do one of three things: try different approaches still, like RNNs, CNNs, word vectorization... depending on your sample size and on your problem, they can be quite beneficial make an ensemble of the models you used. Simple model averaging increases generalizability and can easily improve performance in the training and validation sets as well. On the other side, ensembles are slow both to train and to utilize, so this doesn't seems to be the best fitting option pick a model, The simplest and fastest seems to be to the best choice. I don't see any other way.
