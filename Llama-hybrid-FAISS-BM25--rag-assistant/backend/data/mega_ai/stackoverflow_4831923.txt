I agree with pjv, at least for phone-size devices. It would be better to organize the widget to show one group of siblings at a time in a ListView. This could be done in a single activity that keeps track of its position in the tree. It could show a header with breadcrumbs showing the path to the parent of the items currently on display. A multi-level tree view may be appropriate for a tablet device, but a phone does not have enough real estate to support the proposed 5 levels (with everything having to be big enough for fingers). Nevertheless, if you are set on a tree view, don't look at subclassing ExpandableListView. It operates internally by packing the parent and child indices (each an int) into a single long. This internal representation makes it virtually impossible to extend beyond 2 levels.
