Discriminating for early detection of problems

I could (please) use some suggestions on how to tackle an issue that has been brought up where I work. When a new product is launched, our company tracks how many AND what type of replacement parts are used for products where we need to honor the warranty associated with the product. The data are aggregated at the weekly level, and thus, could be considered a time series. Some questions management is wondering include: How to tell if any of a product's parts are being replaced at an excessively high rate for the purposes of catching that particular lot before more of it goes out the door to distributors, etc. How to tell if the general trend of the rate of replacement may be changing over time. Management has not told me what they consider an "excessively high rate", so I am wondering what might be a plausible way to go about drawing that line in the sand. This question is intended to be more of a brainstorming kind of question. Thanks in advance to any and all who answer.
