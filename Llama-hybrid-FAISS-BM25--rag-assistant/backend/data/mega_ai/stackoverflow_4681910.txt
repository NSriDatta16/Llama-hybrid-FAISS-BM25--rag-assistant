How to modify a generator value

I want to modify a generator value in Delphi with Firebird 2.5. The Statement is: ALTER SEQUENCE GEN_NAME RESTART WITH value . What I want is that the value not to be a number but a variable or a parameter like: ALTER SEQUENCE GEN_TELAGENT_ID RESTART WITH val; where val get a different integer value I don't know yet. I hope I made myself understood. Sorry for my not so good English. Thanks for the answers.
