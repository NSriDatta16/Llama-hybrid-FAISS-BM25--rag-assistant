Compare multiple groups that have binary data with a control group

I have a dataset of 90 individuals with 12 binary variables, divided in three groups of the same size. I want to know if two if these groups have differences with the other one (the control group), which is the best way to do this? Is it correct to use PCA to do simple ANOVA?
