First of all you are not doing EFA. You are doing PCA You might want to read about the difference between EFA and PCA here http://www2.sas.com/proceedings/sugi30/203-30.pdf or here http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Factor_analysis BTW, eigenvalues are not used much in EFA - mostly for starting values and a rough guess on how many factors there are (count >1) Eigenvalues are DEFINED as the eigenvalues of the sample correlation matrix. By definition those numbers are the same, i.e., if you use 2 components PCA the first component is the same as the first component of the 1 component PCA. Incidentally 53.4% = 2.14 / 4 and 25.451% = 1.018 / 4 Also in EFA you can't say percentage of variance explained - it is different for each observed variable. Also in EFA it doesn't work that way - the first factor of 2 factor EFA is NOT the same as the first factor of the 1 factor EFA.
