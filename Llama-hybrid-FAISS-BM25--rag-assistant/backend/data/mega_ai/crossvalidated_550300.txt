Why is allEffects from effects package excluding a level/value from my my model?

I posted this on stackoverflow but it was suggested I post it here. I am running an ordinal logistic regression on data that is roughly like this: library(MASS) library(effects) df You can see that agec=3 isn't here. agec is a categorized age but I want to run it as numeric. When I do that, allEffects produces effects that don't include agec=3. Of course, if I run agec as a factor it includes it. model: cov ~ agec agec effect (probability) for High agec 1 2 4 5 6 0.2174030 0.2473099 0.3149013 0.3521847 0.3913608 agec effect (probability) for Medium agec 1 2 4 5 6 0.3352479 0.3463802 0.3565925 0.3552180 0.3495402 agec effect (probability) for Low agec 1 2 4 5 6 0.4473491 0.4063099 0.3285062 0.2925973 0.2590990 Why is this happening and what can I do to have allEffects produce effects for all values of agec? Thanks!
