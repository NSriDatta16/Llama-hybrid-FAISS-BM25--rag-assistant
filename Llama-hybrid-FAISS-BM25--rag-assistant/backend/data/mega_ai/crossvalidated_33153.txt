what would be the best friendship measure? The average of the two variables or the product? If you can provide a definition of "best", then you may have your criteria right there. If you had the luxury of conducting a leisurely experiment, you could ask your questions, compute multiple ways of summarizing the level of friendship, and see how closely it correlates with a variable of interest (such as frequency of spending time together, likelihood to be tagged in the same picture on facebook, etc.). You could also develop an idea of what the distribution of a friendship measure "should" look like: if you think that each person should on average tend to have a small number of very good friends and a large number not-so-close friends, you could look at which measure turns out the better distribution.
