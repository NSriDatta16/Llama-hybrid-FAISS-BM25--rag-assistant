First of all, what you are describing are not KPIs. KPIs are usually business metrics for the problem you are trying to solve . They do not have to do anything with the machine learning metrics. Using those terms interchangeably would be confusing for many people. If indeed you had a key performance indicator, it would be a key metric for your project, so it would be decisive by itself. Second, your definitions of underfitting and overfitting are not correct. Metrics are real-valued, so there is literally zero probability that training and test metrics would be equal. As @Estacionario noticed in their answer, test metrics would usually be worse than the training metrics because they are calculated on unseen data. We are talking about underfitting or overfitting if those differences are significant (there is no formal threshold) and/or based on other criteria. Finally, consider a more extreme case, where you have two models: the first one has 50% train and 50% test accuracy, while the other has 90% train and 80% test accuracy. Which would you choose? The consistently poor one does not sound like a great choice.
