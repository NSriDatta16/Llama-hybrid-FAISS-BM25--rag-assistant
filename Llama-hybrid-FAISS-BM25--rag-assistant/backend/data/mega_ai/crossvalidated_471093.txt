I think it originated from [1], it seems inspired by the $\chi^2$ distance as you said, but it does not have any theoretical motivation. The average between each feature is used as their expected value. Therefore, $$ D(x, y) = \sum_i \frac{(x_i - \mu_i)^2 }{\mu_i} $$ where $$ \mu_i = \frac{x_i + y_i}{2} $$ such that $$ D(x, y) = 2 \sum_i \frac{\left(x_i - \frac{x_i + y_i}{2}\right)^2}{x_i + y_i} \\ = \frac{2}{4} \sum_i \frac{(2 x_i - x_i - y_i)^2}{x_i + y_i} \\ = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i \frac{(x_i - y_i)^2}{x_i + y_i} $$ The use with the RBF kernel is seen in [2], but no explanation is given besides that D(x, y) is a metric.
