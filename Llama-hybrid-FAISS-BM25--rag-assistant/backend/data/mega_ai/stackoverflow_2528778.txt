(...) what do you do to keep everyone working as the sprint moves into its final stages? Nothing, I expect a self-organized team to find out this by themselves. And there are many options (by order of importance): Help other members of the team to finish their stories (achieving the goal of the sprint is the most important, the whole team succeed or fail at this, not individuals). Prepare a kick-ass demo. Pick up a story from the backlog that can be done-done before the end of the sprint (i.e. not always the next highest priority items but something that fit in terms of size). Repay technical debt if you have some. Document things if this make sense. Explore new things (tools, frameworks, testing techniques, etc) that may be useful for the team.
