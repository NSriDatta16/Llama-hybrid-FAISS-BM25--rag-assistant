PCA on X to capture the most variance of Y

PCA maximises the variation in $X$ . Now, suppose $X$ is causal to $Y$ . Is there then any analogous way to decompose $X$ into the principal components that cause the most variation in $Y$ . For an example, suppose linear combinations of the first 2 features $x_1$ and $x_2$ from $X$ can predict all of $Y$ . Would it be possible to dimension reduce $X$ to these only? (Apologies in advance for the somewhat unclearly posed question. Any edits in the right direction highly appreciated!)
