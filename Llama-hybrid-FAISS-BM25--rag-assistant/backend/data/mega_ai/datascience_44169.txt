What are the limitations while using XGboost algorithm?

Will XGBoost pose any problem while dealing with categorical variables with more than 2 levels. For example, occupation variable can have values like doctor, engineer, lawyer, data scientist, farmer e.t.c. If so what would be a better method to use in that case?
