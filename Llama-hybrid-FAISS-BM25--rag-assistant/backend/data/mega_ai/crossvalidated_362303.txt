It depends on what you mean with "most accurate way". With PCA you are trying to find a approximation that preserves a given amount of variance, thus it is accurate in that regard. If you are ultimately interested in classification and accuracy of predicted labels is your main concern, PCA might not be the best, because it does not consider class labels. Linear Discriminant Analysis and related algorithms might be an alternative. Other than that, many algorithms from the manifold learning domain have been modified to do dimensionality reduction for classification problems, e.g. Constrastive PCA , Supervised Laplacian Eigenmaps , Supervised Locality Preserving Projection .
