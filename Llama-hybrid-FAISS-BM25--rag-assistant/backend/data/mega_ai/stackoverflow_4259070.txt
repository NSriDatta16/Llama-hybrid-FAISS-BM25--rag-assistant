Logging App events/exceptions/messages in Enterprise Environnments

We've been having a discussion in our office as part of an upgrade of an old application from VB6 to .Net 3.5 about how best to approach logging. The old system used local log files, the path for which was contained in the registry (with a default should one not be specified). Most of us are now leaning towards using the Windows Application Event Log, however one guy raised a question which stopped us dead. What about environments like Citrix where load balancing means that one users' session might be served by different app servers at different points? We suddenly potentially have fragments of info from a session spread across several servers (or so we believe - most of us haven't had to deal with this before so we're not 100% sure) which makes it hard for the support guys to piece together the chain of events during a support call. The general consensus seems to be that we should use the MS Enterprise Library logging abilities and set up a central repository of logs for each installation. Can anyone recommend a best practice or sensible approach to application logging in multiple environments including app server farms, other than centralised logs using Enterprise Library, or are we already on the right track? Cheers
