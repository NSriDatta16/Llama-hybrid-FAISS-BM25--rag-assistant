Let us try to think from first principles for this problem. It is not clear what outcome you want to achieve by trying to predict cabin section here. I'm assuming it is purely learning to apply ML algorithms. We can hypothesize that the cabin sections assigned to a passengers would've been assigned by their class and fair paid. You can note (from the notebook link) that there are about 295 rows in the data where you have cabin section calculated. There are 7 unique values for cabin class. So you are effectively trying to fit a multi-class classifier with 7 possible output values from a data of size 295. It is unlikely to give much accuracy no matter which algorithm you choose. You might find some mild success by trying to predict it using fare paid and passenger class. Other variables in dataset (sex, age) may not be that useful for this task. Also, with so few columns and rows, using random forest etc. is overkill here (you don't have a large number of columns). tl:dr; is this is probably not a good task for machine learning.
