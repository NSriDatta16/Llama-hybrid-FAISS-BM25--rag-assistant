MouseDown and then MouseUp doesn't work

I am trying to redirect mouse inputs on my Windows 7 application to some other window. If I do this when I get WM_LBUTTONUP, it works (where MouseDown and MouseUp are SendInput functions in Win api): SetForegroundWindow( other window ); SetCursorPos( somewhere on the window ); MouseDown(); MouseUp(); SetCursorPos( back ); SetForegroundWindow( main window ); But I don't want to only do mouse releases, I want to be able to capture all mouse stuff, including movements and dragging. So this is next logical thing to do but it doesn't work: WM_LBUTTONDOWN: Do everything like before without MouseUp() WM_LBUTTONUP: Do everything like before without MouseDown() This doesn't even work for regular clicks. I can't figure out why. Can anybody help?
