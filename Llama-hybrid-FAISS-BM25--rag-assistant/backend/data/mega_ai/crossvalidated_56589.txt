Visualizing high dimensional data

I have samples of two classes which are vectors in high dimensional space and I want to plot them in 2D or 3D. I know about dimensionality reduction techniques, but I need a really simple and easy to use tool (in matlab, python or a prebuilt .exe). Also I wonder is representation in 2D going to be "meaningful"? (For example how two classes intersect or can be separable).
