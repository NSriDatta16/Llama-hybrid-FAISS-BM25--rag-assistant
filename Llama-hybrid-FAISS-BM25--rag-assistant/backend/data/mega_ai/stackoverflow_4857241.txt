First of, if your app runs on a single server (and possibly on a shared hosting), in-proc session is OK and probably the only way to go. But , if you have more than one server (web farm) or even more than one process on the same server serving your web site (web garden) in-proc will not work unless you use sticky sessions: your load balancer will need to be configured to send requests to the same server after the session is started. Do not worry about dictionary serialisation, session handling must be able to sort it out, be it state server or SQL Server. Generally, however, any reliance on an in-proc session or state limited to the process boundary is considered bad design and is highly discouraged.
