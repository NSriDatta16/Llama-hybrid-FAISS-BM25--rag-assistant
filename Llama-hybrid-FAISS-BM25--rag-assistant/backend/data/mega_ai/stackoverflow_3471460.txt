I think the problem that caused your workaround (and the upstream fix that was included in one of the v22 releases) to stop working in 23.2 is within Emacs itself. 23.1 can handle mouse clicks after column 95 using urxvt, gnu screen, putty or iTerm, but 23.2 can't. Setting everything set to latin-1 makes no difference. 23.1 has the same code in xt-mouse.el. src/lread.c and src/character.h changed, however, and at a glance I'd guess the bug is in there somewhere. As to what happens after column 223, I've got no clue. For the benefit of anyone else who's annoyed by the xt-mouse regression in 23.2 here's a modified version of xterm-mouse-event-read that works with mouse clicks up to col 222 (credit to Ryan for the >222 overflow handling which my original fix lacked). This probably won't work in 23.1 or before. (defun xterm-mouse-event-read () (let ((c (read-char))) (cond ((= c 0) #x100) ; for positions past col 222 emacs just delivers ; 0x0, best we can do is stay at eol ((= 0 (logand c (- #x100))) c) ((logand c #xff))))) ... Edit: Here's the version from Emacs 24 (bzr head). It works again in 23.2 up to col 222, but lacks the >222 overflow eol handling Ryan suggested: (defun xterm-mouse-event-read () (let ((c (read-char))) (if (> c #x3FFF80) (+ 128 (- c #x3FFF80)) c)))
