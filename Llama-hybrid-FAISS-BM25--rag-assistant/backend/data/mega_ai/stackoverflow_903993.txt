Delphi 2009, MyDAC and relational database

I have quite a problem concerning the use of relational database concepts in Delphi 2009 with MyDAC. I have a database structure that looks somehow like the following: Item id name Storage id name StorageItem id item_id storage_id place Now when I have an active dataset from "Item" how can I display all associated Storages in for example a DBGrid? By the way: Would it be better to not use "id" in every table but to alter it and use something like for example "id_item" or "id_storage"? Thank you in advance :)
