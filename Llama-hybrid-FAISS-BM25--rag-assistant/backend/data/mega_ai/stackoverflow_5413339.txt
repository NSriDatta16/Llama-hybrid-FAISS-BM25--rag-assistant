Rails 3 ActiveRecord temporary tables

How do I do the following in Rails 3? CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE average_user_total_time (SELECT SUM(time) AS time_taken FROM scores WHERE created_at >= '2010-10-10' and created_at 60 and time_taken I have tried to do something like create_table (:average_user_total_time), :temporary=> true do |t| end but not sure how to use it exactly. I need to use it within my app and not in a migration.
