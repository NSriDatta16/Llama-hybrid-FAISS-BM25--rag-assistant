Time series from a given autocorrelation

I am trying to generate a time series for $r(t)$ given the following autocorrelation function $$ \langle r(0) r(\tau)\rangle = \int_{\Omega_\mathrm{min}}^{\Omega_\mathrm{max}}dz \coth\left(\frac{z}{2\Omega_T}\right) \frac{\cos\left(\tau z\right)}{\sqrt{z^2 - \Omega^2_\mathrm{min}}\sqrt{\Omega^2_\mathrm{max} - z^2 }} $$ and zero mean. This function describes the motion of one of the masses in an infinite 1D harmonic chain with the minimum mode frequency $\Omega_\mathrm{min}$ and the maximum one $\Omega_\mathrm{max}$ at temperature $k_BT = \hbar \Omega_T$ . I tried generating the time series using both the Cholesky approach, as well as generating one step at a time using the marginal probability. I tried to speed up the latter using the Levinson-Durbin formula. The issue, however, is not the speed. If the time steps used are smaller than $2\pi / \Omega_\mathrm{max}$ , within a few time steps, the covariance matrix $\Sigma$ acquires negative eigenvalues with all the associated problems. While I do expect zero eigenvalues because of the mutual dependence of prior $r$ 's, the negative ones were a little surprising, especially that they weren't that small: $\sim -10^{-8}$ . The resources online typically address the issue of low-rank $\Sigma$ , but the rank here appear to be appropriate when I check it numerically. The physical problem is, in principle, solvable by simulating a large number of individual oscillators with amplitudes drawn from the appropriate distribution. I was hoping, however, to be able to use the explicit autocorrelation expression instead.
