There is one way you can avoid using the API key completely - use the version 3 API. The v3 API is still in 'beta' but it has the key (no pun intended) functionality that most people use for their maps and there are no keys required. Nor will there be in the future according to Google. If you can get by without features like draggable markers, then v3 will work well. I use it for my primary map page and have no problems with it.
