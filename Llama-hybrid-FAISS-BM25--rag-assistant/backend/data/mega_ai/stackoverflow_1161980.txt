The title asks one question, and the post asks another. What do you want to know? OOP is a major paradigm, and it gets major attention. If metaprogramming becomes huge, it will get more attention. Java and C# are two of the most used languages at the moment (see: SO tags by number of uses). I think it's ignorant to state either way that OOP is a great/terrible paradigm. I think your question can best be summarized by the old adage: "When the hammer is your tool, everything looks like a nail."
