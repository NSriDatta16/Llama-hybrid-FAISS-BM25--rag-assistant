Mathematically prove the data has been decorrelated

I have been using a pre whitenening technique to remove autocorrelation from my time series model which has a variable that are autocorrelating with itself over time. But I wondered how I could mathematically prove that my data is now decorrelated and if someone has any research paper that explains it or anything similar? Any help is apprecitiated
