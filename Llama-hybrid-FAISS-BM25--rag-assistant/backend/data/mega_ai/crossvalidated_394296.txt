How should I intuitively understand the KL divergence loss in variational autoencoders?

I was studying VAEs and came across the loss function that consists of the KL divergence. $$ \sum_{i=1}^n \sigma^2_i + \mu_i^2 - \log(\sigma_i) - 1 $$ I wanted to intuitively make sense of the KL divergence part of the loss function. It would be great if somebody can help me
