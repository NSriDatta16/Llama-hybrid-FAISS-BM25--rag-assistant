Using Shared Dataset in Subreport

Greetings! I am using SSRS with MS SQL Server 2008 R2, which has the new feature of supporting shared datasets. First, I created my shared dataset, and made sure that it worked correctly and had a good connection. That worked great. Second, I created a new report (Let's call it "ReportSub"), and I had it use my shared dataset. The report works great. Third, I created another report (Let's call is "ReportMain"), and I put a subreport object into the report and associated it with "ReportSub". Doesn't work. Instead, I get this error: Data retrieval failed for the subreport, 'ReportSub', located at: /ReportSub. Please check the log files for more information. Any ideas of what the problem may be? It will work if I use an embedded dataset, but I really need to use a shared dataset. Thanks,
