jQuery UI sortable and live() click problem -- need to click twice after sorting for click to register

I have a table I'm using jQuery UI's "sortable" on. In the table, I have rows consisting of a "drag handle" to grab and reorder the table, and cells with clickable items, like this: Testing 1 Testing 2 Testing 3 In my code, I make the table sortable, and also use jQuery's live() to bind a click event to the clickable items, like this: $(function() { /* Using live() because in my real code table rows are dynamically added. However, if I use click() instead, as in the commented-out code, it works fine, without any need to click twice. */ // $(".clickycell a").click(function() { $(".clickycell a").live('click', function() { alert("Successful click"); return false; }); $("#test-table tbody").sortable({ handle: "td.handle", /* Use the draggy handle to move, not the whole row */ cursor: "move" }); }); I'm using live() because rows can be dynamically added to the table in the real code. My problem is this: if I click on any of the clickable items before sorting, they work fine. After the user drags the rows to reorder them, though, I have to click twice for a click to register. After that second click, the clickable items go back to "normal", needing only one click, until the next time rows are dragged around. If I use click() rather than live() -- as in the commented-out code -- then a single-click works fine at all times, but I'd rather use live() , as I said. And I'm curious as to why it's not working. There's a live jsFiddle example here . Try dragging a row into a different position, then clicking on any of the "Testing..." links. In Firefox, at least, I need to click twice to get the "Successful click" alert. Any ideas?
