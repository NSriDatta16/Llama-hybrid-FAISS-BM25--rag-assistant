When you build an SQL query it usually contain all sort of bits and fragments, some of which come from user input. For example, if you have a "Search Book" facility in your app, then the name of the book is a string coming from the user. Smart, evil users can manipulate the inputs that they send to your app such that the SQL query built from this input will be harmful. So if you build your query like this: String q = "Select * from books where name='" + bookName + "'" Then a hacker can search for a book called "x'; delete from books where name like '%" The net result will be that the following query will be executed: Select * from books where name='x'; delete from books where name like '%' This will delete all records of the book table. The standard way to avoid this is to always use prepared statements when building queries that include user-supplied pieces.
