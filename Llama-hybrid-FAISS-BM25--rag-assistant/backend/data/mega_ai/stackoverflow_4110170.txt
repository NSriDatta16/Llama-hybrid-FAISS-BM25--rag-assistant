`auto-increment` std::map :)

Ok, the problem is pretty straightforward - I am reading words from the input stream, the words may repeat. I need to populate a map so that all the words get indices from 0 to n-1. Here is my code: map mp; string s; int n = 0; while(cin >> s) { if(mp.find(s) == mp.end()) { mp.insert(make_pair(s, n++)); } } Is this the best way to achieve what I want to achieve or are there more elegant, more STL-ish solutions? Thanks in advance
