Items put in a cache are not guaranteed to be found there. In some situations the framework might expire items from the cache, for example if it starts running low on memory. In this case it will call the onRemoveCallback you pass along when you add an item to the cache. The cache is not a reliable storage, you need to always check if the item is there before using it and if it is not perform the necessary actions to fetch it and put it back there so that future callers could find it.
