I agree with Mike's answer: You need to know how you want to use the data you're collecting. If you're trying to analyze daily market data you should try to get as much data at that frequency as you can because munging data together with different frequencies is a challenge. The same goes for weekly, monthly, etc. Having said that, you could take your weekly data and calculate a 4 wk moving average so it will line up with your monthly data, but your quarterly GDP data is going to have even fewer observations so you need to know how you want to handle that circumstance. You could fill in the dataset with current GDP data so you have 3 months of repeating GDP values. There are other techniques I guess you could use (interpolation, etc.), but ultimately it goes back to making sure you have a clear understanding of how you want to make this analysis work for you. Hope this helps.
