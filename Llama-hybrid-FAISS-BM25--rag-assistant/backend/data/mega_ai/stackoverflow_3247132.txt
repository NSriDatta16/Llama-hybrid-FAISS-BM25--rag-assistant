After some rethinking, it seems like DAO is actually not the right name for what i wanted to do. Maybe it really is a Facade, as Pascal said. I just found the Netbeans Petstore Example - a JavaEE6 sample application, see here - where they have an ItemFacade which is responsible for finding/createing/removing entities from the database. It's a Stateless Session Bean. Looks like this: @Stateless public class ItemFacade implements Serializable { @PersistenceContext(unitName = "catalogPU") private EntityManager em; public void create(Item item) { ... } public void edit(Item item) { ... } public void remove(Item item) { ... } public Item find(Object id) { ... } public List findAll() { ... } public List findRange(int maxResults, int firstResult) { ... } public int getItemCount() { ... } } So as a conclusion i don't call my DAO DAO anymore but instead just for example PersonEJB (i think "PersonFacade" could be misunderstood) and make it also @Stateless, as i think the Netbeans example can be considered as well-designed.
