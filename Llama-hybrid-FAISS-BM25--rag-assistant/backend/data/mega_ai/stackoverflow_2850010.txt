You can get a good estimate by taking the stringWidth divided by the number of characters to get the average width per character. Then you can take the clip distance to see how many characters you can fit in. Take the substring from the start to almost that distance (minus two or three for the ...) and put your ... on the end. Verify the new string doesn't clip - if it does, make some adjustments as necessary. After all if you have WWWWWWWWiiiiii, you'll probably need to adjust that. But all in all, this approach will be pretty fast.
