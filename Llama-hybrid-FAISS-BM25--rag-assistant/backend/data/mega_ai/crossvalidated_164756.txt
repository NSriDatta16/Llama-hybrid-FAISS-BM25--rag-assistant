LDA scores too big

I'm trying to do dimensionality reduction with linear discriminant analysis (LDA) in MATLAB. I'm using this code to calculate the coefficients. But I'm confused whether (and when) should I center the data. So I have 3000-dimensional features and 4000 samples, with class labels from 1 to 5. The features are histogram bins, so they are nicely normalized, i.e. each member is between 0 and 1. % data is 4000x3000 NTrain = size(data,1); % center the data : (should I ?) data_centered = bsxfun(@minus, data, mean(data,1)); % calculate the coefficients and scores : W=LDA(data_centered,labels); % I also tried W=LDA(data,labels); newData = [ones(NTrain,1) data_centered] * W'; in the end, I get a W (and newData ) matrix with very big values, in the order of 1e4 . So I'm probably doing something wrong. Should I center the data beforehand? Also what about new (test) data? I am saving W , but should I also save the training mean, so I can subtract it from test data to obtain the scores? Thanks for any help!
