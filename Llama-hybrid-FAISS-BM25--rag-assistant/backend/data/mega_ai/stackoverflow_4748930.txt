How to create a class by reading from another class (.cs) file with Powershell?

I have this POGO ( simple putter getter) class that I am trying to read in PowerShell using System; using System.Runtime.Serialization; namespace MyApp.VM { [Serializable] public class MyClassVM { public Int64 CtrId { get; set; } public string CtrName { get; set; } public string CtrPhone { get; set; } public string CtrZip { get; set; } public DateTime AddDate { get; set; } } } Here is the ps1 code that is trying to read the class from a file. function Build-Pogo { $FileDir = "D:\YourDirectoryOfPogo" $ClassName = "MyClassVM" $FileName = $FileDir + "\" + $ClassName + ".cs" # Build the class from the file $AllLines = [string]::join([environment]::newline, (Get-Content $FileName)) Add-Type -TypeDefinition $AllLines # spin thru each property for class $ClassHandle = New-Object -typeName $ClassName $ClassHandle | ForEach-Object {Write-Host $_.name -foregroundcolor cyan} } *Note the last line is placeholder for more complex logic to come later. This breaks at the Add-Type with this error message for each get/set in the file. 'MyApp.VM.MyClassVM.CtrId.get' must declare a body because it is not marked abstract or extern Any info on what I'm doing wrong will be greatly appreciated.
