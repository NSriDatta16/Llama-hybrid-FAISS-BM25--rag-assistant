Regarding this comment in the accepted answer sorting them is a pain unless you pad zeros. Here's a trick for SQL Server 2008 (From Itzik Ben-Gan in this book ) with ip_addresses as ( SELECT '131.33.2.201' AS ip_address UNION ALL SELECT '2.12.4.4' AS ip_address UNION ALL SELECT '131.33.2.202' AS ip_address UNION ALL SELECT '2.12.4.169' AS ip_address UNION ALL SELECT '131.107.2.201' AS ip_address ) select ip_address from ip_addresses ORDER BY CAST('/' + ip_address + '/' AS hierarchyid) Returns ip_address ------------- 2.12.4.4 2.12.4.169 131.33.2.201 131.33.2.202 131.107.2.201
