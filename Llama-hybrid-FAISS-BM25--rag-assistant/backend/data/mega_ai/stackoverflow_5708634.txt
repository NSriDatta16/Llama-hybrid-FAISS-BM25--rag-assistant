How can I elegantly implement version checking in Python without throwing off indentation?

I'd like to very elegantly integrate version checking in Python. I don't want a version checking routine to throw off the indentation of all of my code, however. I.e. if old_version: print 'hey, upgrade.' else: # main body of whole script In the above implementation, the main body of the whole script would need to be indented one level and that's just messy. Is there a better way?
