All of my AU-PRC values are the same, is there something wrong with my code or models?

I have been doing some training of basic models for a certain binary outcome, and most of the training has been on optimizing the AUC. But when I plot the precision recall curves, I get essentially the exact same value for each model which seems unlikely. This dataset is quite biased, about 5% positive class. attached is the code: training = read.csv("trainingdata.csv") testing= read.csv("testingdata.csv") rftraining=read.csv("RFTraining.csv") rftesting=read.csv("RFTesting.csv") svmpreds = read.csv("svmpreds.csv") GBpreds = as.data.frame(read.csv("leepreduntuned.csv")) RFpreds = read.csv("forestpreds.csv") ENPLRpreds = read.csv("enplrpreds.csv") Performance $amputation ~ GBpreds$ x + ENPLRpreds $s0 + RFpreds$ YES+svmpreds$x) #+ nntpreds[,1]) ##making AU-ROC curve for the predictions g4 GBpr $x, scores.class1 = (1-GBpreds$ x), curve = T) plot(GBpr) RFPRC $YES, scores.class1 = RFpreds$ NO, curve = T) plot(RFPRC) SVMPRC $x, scores.class1 = (1-svmpreds$ x), curve = T) plot(SVMPRC)
