Best Way to Integrate Scala Test into Existing Netbeans Java Project?

I have a stand-alone application that I wrote before I became test-infected. Its a Netbeans gui project, so I depend upon Matisse, and I don't want to change that, at least not now. I would, however, like to build the unit test coverage up, and I'd like to take this opportunity to learn some Scala. So what I would like to do is create tests in scala. I understand that this is possible because Scala Test has a junit runner. I think I could hack on the ant and eventually make it work, but I think that would be sort of a "pound until it fits" scenario. I have searched Stack Overflow, and there are similar questions, but not quite the same topic. Has anybody done this before? If so, please let me know how. Thanks!
