Artificial neural network analysis

I've designed and programmed an ANN, So now I need to do an analysis about results, I've seen some examples where they do graphics about surface error, average of true outs, and another interesting graphics so I've decided do it, I think to use Gnuplot to do this analysis, but I need some advices or things that i do with the data before plot these. I don't know if I could plot the data as I got or I've to preprocessing before. I've seen this page where are some scripts of data representation ( example ). More specifically I need to know what kind of analysis I have to do for get information about the efficiency of my network.
