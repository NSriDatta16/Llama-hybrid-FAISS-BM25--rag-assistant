I haven't had time to try it, but this paragraph looks like what you are looking for. It seems that the VBA equivalent object you are looking for is ActiveSheet.Protection. AllowEditRanges , which stores information about the areas that can be edited by users in a sheet. One thing you might want to look into as well is the UserInterfaceOnly option on ActiveSheet.Protect. You can protect a range with a password for users, but access it without password through macros.
