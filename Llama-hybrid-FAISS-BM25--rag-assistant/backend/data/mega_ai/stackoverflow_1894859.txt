You could try using the RecursiveRegexIterator . EDIT This is your example using the RecursiveRegexIterator: $filelist = array(); $iterator = new RecursiveDirectoryIterator( $this->_jrootpath ); foreach(new RecursiveRegexIterator($iterator, '/\.(html|htm|php)$/') as $file) { if ( !$file->isDir() ) { $filelist[$file->getPathname()] = $file->getMTime(); } } arsort($filelist); foreach ($filelist as $key => $val) { $resultoutput .= ' '.$key.' '.date("d-m-Y H:i:s",$val).' '; } By the way, it looks like $resultoutput is not created yet. In that case, you should create it as an empty string somewhere... EDIT2 : Oops, this does not really answer your question. For some reason I thought it was only about the recursive stuff. This is just a more elegant solution to loop over the files, but it doesn't solve your problem, sorry. You should probably combine this with one of the other answers.
