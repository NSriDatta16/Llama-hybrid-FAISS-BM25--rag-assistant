If the options naturally form groups, you could consider using HTML optgroups instead of a javascript-based solution. It makes a large set of options much more organized and manageable, while still keeping all options visible. I don't know what server-side language/framework you're using to generate your HTML, but for example in Ruby on Rails you can use grouped_options_for_select to generate optgroups automatically.
