Is it valid to average IQR values?

I am interested in quantifying the dispersion of pixel values in one image. More specifically, I want to get an average value of dispersion of the image column-wise (i.e., compute the dispersion of each column of the image and then "average" these values). Currently, I am using two different metrics: SD and IQR. Regarding the former, the proper way to do so is to average the variances of each column and then take the square root . Is there such particular consideration that should be taken into account for IQR or is it valid to just take the average of the IQR values?
