If you have logistic activation function in the output layer and you are trying to maximise the log-likelihood of observations belonging to their corresponding classes (e.g. via its negative as the cost function), then yes, each output-layer neuron can be said to be an implementation of a logistic model over its inputs (which can be outputs of the neurons from the hidden layers). In the simplest case, when you have a "network" of only one neuron with logistic activation function, and assuming you maximise the log-likelihood, then you are performing logistic regression.
