if I get you right, I think all you want to do is to estimate a whole model by using weekdays and weekends as well as holidays. For forecasting intraday time series, exponential smoothing is mostly used. This kind of data sets can contain more than seasonal patterns. In these days, e.g. public holidays, the energy demand data (I consider, for example, your univariate time series is all about demand.) can differ greatly from the regular seasonal pattern. In the literature, I have run into with many methods to overcome this problem. One of them, which I think it's a good solution, is to smooth out these values using simple averaging procedures.
