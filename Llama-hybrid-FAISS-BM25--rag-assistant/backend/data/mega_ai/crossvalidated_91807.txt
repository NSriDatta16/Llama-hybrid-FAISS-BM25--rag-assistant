Quite different questions are bundled together here. As you say you have selected a sample of 2000 randomly, that should impart good properties to the data you analyse, assuming that "random" here really does imply selection using random numbers or some equivalent device, not an arbitrary or haphazard selection. Note that random samples are not guaranteed to be representative of the population in the sense that a random sample faithfully reproduces all the properties of the population. In a strict sense, that is impossible. In any looser sense, everything depends on what you understand by "representative". Contrary to widespread belief, "representative of the population" does not have a precise statistical meaning except in the limiting and tautological sense that the population is representative of the population. See the definitive series of papers by W.H. Kruskal and F. Mosteller starting with William H. Kruskal and Frederick Mosteller. 1979. Representative sampling, I: Non-scientific literature. International Statistical Review 47: 13â€“24. Averaging over groups tends to reduce noise and often produces higher correlations. Your use of Spearman's correlation rather than Pearson's correlation makes that effect a little indirect. In general, correlations between values for groups and correlations between values for individuals often differ for this and other reasons. This has been studied under several headings, most bitingly in terms of Simpson's paradox, perhaps better called an amalgamation paradox, in view of its earlier discovery by Pearson and Yule at least. Broadly, it is hazardous to extrapolate both from group properties to individuals and vice versa. You introduce in your second question the condition "only if the number of lines of code for a given project is above the average", but nothing in your earlier text points to selection of values above such an average. Your explanation refers only to averaging by groups according to number of users, which sounds a quite different procedure.
