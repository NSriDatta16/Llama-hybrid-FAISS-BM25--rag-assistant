The autoreleased memory is released when control is returned back to the system, but only when it chooses to. If you wish to force memory to be released use "release" which works there and then. It should be noted that because of memory fragmentation that allocating and deallocating a block of memory may not seem to get you back to where you started in terms of measurable "free" memory.
