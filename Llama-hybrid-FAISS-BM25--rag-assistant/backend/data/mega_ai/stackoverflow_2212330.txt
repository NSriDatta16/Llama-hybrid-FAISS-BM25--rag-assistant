There's no way to overload functions in C, so you'll have to do two copies in any case. However, you can generalize the pushing/popping so that it operates on nodes with arbitrary data. To do it safely, you can use a tagged union like: typedef struct { enum {INT, FLOAT} type; union { int i; float f; } data; } Node; This also allows you to easily extend to other data types in the future. Or you could just go with a void* data and cast it unsafely each time you want to operate on it, arrogantly assuming that you'll always find what you want (not recommended).
