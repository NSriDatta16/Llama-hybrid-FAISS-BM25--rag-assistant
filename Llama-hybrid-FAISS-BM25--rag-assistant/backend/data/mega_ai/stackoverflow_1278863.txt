No, I don't agree with your assumptions. 1/ Stored Procedures will give at least as good, if not better, performance than LINQ-to-SQL. You won't see any performance increase by moving to LINQ-to-SQL 2/ You can get strongly typed fields using your existing stored procs. I believe you get this by using DataSets (from memory), but I am certain you will get it if you create a LINQ-to-SQL class and simply drag the Stored Procedures onto the designer. The code generator will create strongly typed and correctly named ReturnObjects for each Stored Procedure. If you have existing Stored Procs then I wouldn't bother converting them to LINQ.
