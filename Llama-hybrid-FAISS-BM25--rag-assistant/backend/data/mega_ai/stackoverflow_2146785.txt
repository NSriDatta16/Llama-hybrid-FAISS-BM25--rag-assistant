How to create a utf8 db with mysqladmin

I feel like this should be simple but i can't work out how to set the character set when making a db with "mysqladmin create". I thought this would work mysqladmin -u root db_name --character-set=utf8 leveraging this bit of the mysqladmin --help text: -O, --set-variable=name Change the value of a variable. Please note that this option is deprecated; you can set variables directly with --variable-name=value. i also tried this mysqladmin -u root create db_name --default-character-set=utf8 In both cases, the db was created without complaint, but i don't think it's worked: mysql> SHOW VARIABLES like '%character%'; +--------------------------+----------------------------+ | Variable_name | Value | +--------------------------+----------------------------+ | character_set_client | latin1 | | character_set_connection | latin1 | | character_set_database | latin1 | | character_set_filesystem | binary | | character_set_results | latin1 | | character_set_server | latin1 | | character_set_system | utf8 | | character_sets_dir | /usr/share/mysql/charsets/ | +--------------------------+----------------------------+ I can see that character_set_system is utf8, but should all of the latin1's above be showing utf8? Grateful for any advice - max
