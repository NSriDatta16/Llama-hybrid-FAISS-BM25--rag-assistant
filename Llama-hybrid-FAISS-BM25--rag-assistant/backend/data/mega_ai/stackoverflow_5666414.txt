Android: Get MotionEvent within onListItemClick

I have a ListActivity and I want react to onListItemClick(ListView l, View v, int position, long id) . But I also want to know whether the user clicked on the left or the right side of the screen. Is there any changes I can get the MotionEvent from within the onListItemclicked-method. I have a ListView. In every line there is a Name on the left and a average-vote on the right. When the user clicks in a row on the left I want to load an Activity that shows information about the name. When the user clicks on the right side of a row I want to load an Activity that lets the user vote on the name. I would like to use onListItemClick(ListView l, View v, int position, long id) for getting the row I'm in as it is so easy. But how can I know whether the user clicked on the left or the right. Can I ask some object for the currently processed MotionEvent? Thanks!
