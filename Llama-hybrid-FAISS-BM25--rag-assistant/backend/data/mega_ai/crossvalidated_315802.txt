Flat or diffuse priors in bayesian estimation

This should be straightforward. I come from a frequentist background and I'm trying to understand bayesian logic. If I use a flat prior for my parameter to allow "the data to speak", what's exactly the benefit of bayesian over frequentist? As I understand it, I'm not allowing any shrinkage so I'm not really using any prior judgement. Obviously I'm missing something, can anyone help?
