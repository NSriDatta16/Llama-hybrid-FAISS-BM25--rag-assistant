i've never used ApplicationDomain.currentDomain.hasDefinition(className) , instead I've been using the try catch way of doing this, but looks like this is the better way of doing this. so thanks for that. anyway, I've come across (i think) this same issue before. The problem is that the compiler doesn't compile all your my.factory.*; assets. What I have done is created a dummy instance of each object I will require. privete function uncalledFunction():void{ var s_01:Block; var s_02:Triangle; var s_03:Pineapple; } This "tricking it" has worked for me, but I'm interested to see if there are any more elegant solutions.
