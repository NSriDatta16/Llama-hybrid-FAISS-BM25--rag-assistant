Select Statement to show missing records (Easy Question)

I need some T-SQL that will show missing records. Here is some sample data: Emp 1 01/01/2010 02/01/2010 04/01/2010 06/01/2010 Emp 2 02/01/2010 04/01/2010 05/01/2010 etc... I need to know Emp 1 is missing 03/01/2010 05/01/2010 Emp 2 is missing 01/01/2010 03/01/2010 06/01/2010 The range to check will start with todays date and go back 6 months. In this example, lets say today's date is 06/12/2010 so the range is going to be 01/01/2010 thru 06/01/2010. The day is always going to be the 1st in the data.
