A problem here is that you can't really tell from the data where the "last" entry is unless there is more detail as to how the old entries are deleted. If I understand correctly, you are wrapping around at the end of the sequence, which means you must be deleting some of your old data to make space. However if the data isn't deleted in a perfectly uniform manner, you'll end up with fragments, like below: ABCD HIJKL NOPQRS WXYZ You'll notice that there is no obvious next value...D could be the last value created, but it might also be L or S. At best you could look for the first or last missing element (use a stored procedure to perform a x+1 check just like you would to find a missing element in an integer sequence), but it's not going to provide any special result for rolled-over lists.
