Can I infer causality group of correlated random variables?

I have a group of random variables (vectors of numbers) that are highly correlated $(corr>0.9)$ . I wonder if I can infer which of these variables is the dominant one: the one that causes the other variables to behave similarly. My first thought is to measure the average correlation of each variable to the other variables. And the variable with the largest average correlation will be assumed to cause the other variables. Does that make sense? Is there another way to find out causality in this case?
