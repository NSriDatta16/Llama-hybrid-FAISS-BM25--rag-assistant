This problem can certainly be easily solved using convolutional neural networks. Actually, this is what they are pretty good at. Few possible reasons why your network does not work come to my mind: Try using weighted loss binomial cross entropy function. Segmentation learning may easily fail when one class occupies larger portions of the image, compared to the other one. Alternatively, try using IoU or Dice coefficient as loss function. 150 images is pretty small dataset. Make sure you use at least a pre-trained network, and even then consider getting more training data. Also, make sure you use data augmentation: It is a cheap way to get a lot more data.
