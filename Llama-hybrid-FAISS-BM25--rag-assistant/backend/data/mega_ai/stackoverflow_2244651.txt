Javascript event handling for Google Maps

I am using google maps + javascript + php in my application. I want to know two things: In google maps, does moveend event ALWAYS gets fired AFTER zoomend/dragend (whichever of two) event occurs. When I click zoom icon on google map or scroll the mouse wheel to zoom, the zoomend event gets fired more than once. If I zoom in one step using + icon on map, the zoomend event gets fired twice or sometimes more. any possible loophole. And so want to know how to stop further event propogation in javascript . (remember I need not use clearListeners as it will forever ignore event handler which is undesirable). Thank you.
