A usual way to approach the question would be to not only compute the ratio but also the width of the confidence interval: > john.and.mary john.and.mary $conf.int [1] 0.7081573 0.8733444 > > john.and.ryan john.and.ryan$ conf.int [1] 0.3587654 0.9957893 That way it is very clear how much we know about both pairs' agreement. As for your goal, maybe we can reformulate things: You appear to start off with some assumption of two legislators voting differently (or maybe as a start 50/50?) and then from vote to cote you want to gain more confidence in them voting similarly. In that case, it becomes a Bayesian question. You can and have to formulate a prior indicating, how strong you want your initial belief (maybe 50/50) to be and than compute Bayes probabilities: ( beta distribution being conjugate we use that) prior The mode of each curve might make a suitable agreement/disagreement measure. Off course you will have to decide whether 50/50 votes is a natural starting point. Maybe 40% of the votes are not even necessary as they are not really choices but everyone has the same opinion so the natural point of "just 50% agreement in votes where your individual opinion counts" is 70%? However, the point is that consensual votes draw the mode in direction of the mode and dissenting ones draw the mode away from the prior mode and 8 out of 10 has less of an influence the 80 out of 100.
