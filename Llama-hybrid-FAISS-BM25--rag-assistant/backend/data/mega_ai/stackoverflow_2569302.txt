First of all, you should modify your code so that each thumbnail has an easy to find 'class'. Assuming you have .. your html should look like .. Second you should make sure that you have an identifiable pattern between all you thumbnails and their big image counterpart. In your code we have 0001.jpg p_0002.jpg _img/p_0003.jpg 0004.jpg what is your organization for your files ? Let's imagine for now that the thumbnails have the same src as the bug images The jQuery code would be shrinked to : $('.thumb').mouseover(function(){ var thumb_src = $(this).attr('src'); // ==> add code here to transform thumb_src into the big_img src $('#big_img').fadeOut('slow', function(){ $('#big_img').attr('src', thumb_src); $('#big_img').fadeIn('slow'); }); }); This code should work and just waits for the algorithm that transforms the src of the thumb into the src of the big image I hope this will help you Jerome Wagner
