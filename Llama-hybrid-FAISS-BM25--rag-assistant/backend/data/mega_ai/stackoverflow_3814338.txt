The noscript tag is for user agents that can't execute script. Since the Yahoo! spider is one of those agents, I would guess (but can't be certain) that it respects the content of the noscript tag and therefore the HTTP-refresh directive contained within. The result is that it thinks your site lives at http://www.skuffen.se/aktivera_javascript.html , and displays that content in search results. To fix the issue I would suggest either: Use progressive enhancement to ensure the basic content is available without Javascript, and layer advanced features on top. User agents without Javascript won't know any different, and those with will get a richer experience. Simply use the noscript tag as a warning rather than a full redirect to another page, see How to check browser's JavaScript is enabled or not.
