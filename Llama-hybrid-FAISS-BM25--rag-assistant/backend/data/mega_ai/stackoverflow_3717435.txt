Getting the value and text from a selectbox in ColdFusion

I have several values in a select box. Is it possible to get both the value and the text between the tags when the form is submitted? Highland Inverclyde Alternatively I suppose I have to store the names in a table or array for retrieval but would be much easier if I could just insert both in the table when the form is submitted.
