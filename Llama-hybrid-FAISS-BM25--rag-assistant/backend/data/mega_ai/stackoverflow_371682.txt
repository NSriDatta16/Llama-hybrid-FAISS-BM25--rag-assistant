Is there an acceptable Linux targeted GUI client for git-svn?

My employer uses subversion for version-control, and this is unlikely to change. I'm interested in learning more about git, and using git-svn to interface with my employer's subversion repositories. My question is: if I were to begin using git-svn, would I need to do some or all of my version control work from the command-line? Or is there a (linux) GUI client that can perform all the git-svn-related tasks that I will need? Update: Based on the answers so far, there doesn't appear to be a GUI client for git-svn. However, I would like to call attention to this feature request for the Giggle GUI client as proof that there is some interest in a feature like this. Hopefully a positive answer to this question can be added sometime in the coming months. (In fact, I think that in the near future, the best way to interact with subversion might be to use a GUI client for git!) Update 2: The recently released 2.1 version of SmartGit does fully support Git/SVN integration. This proves that there is at least one GUI client allowing Git and SVN to be used together. There may be more.
