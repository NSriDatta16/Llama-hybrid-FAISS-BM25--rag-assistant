nil Path when searching for Data model resource

I am following Apples Core Data Tutoriol but implementing it into my own Project, this means I've not started by creating a Project using Core Storage Data. So I've been copying and pasting quite a lot of the stuff that should of been automatically made for me, and I have run into a problem. I am getting this error: * Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'NSInvalidArgumentException', reason: '* -[NSURL initFileURLWithPath:]: nil string parameter' Which happens in this function: - (NSManagedObjectModel *)managedObjectModel { if (managedObjectModel_ != nil) { return managedObjectModel_; } NSString *modelPath = [[NSBundle mainBundle] pathForResource:@"Assignments" ofType:@"momd"]; NSURL *modelURL = [NSURL fileURLWithPath:modelPath]; managedObjectModel_ = [[NSManagedObjectModel alloc] initWithContentsOfURL:modelURL]; return managedObjectModel_; } I have my data model in the Resources Group and its named "Assignments.xcdatamodel" so I'm stuck on what the problem is. I am thinking in some configuration file I need to change something, or perhaps its just a simple path mistake? Any help is much appreciated.
