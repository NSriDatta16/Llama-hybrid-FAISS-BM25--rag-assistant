AJAX Autosave functionality

What's the best javascript library, or plugin or extension to a library, that has implemented autosaving functionality? The specific need is to be able to 'save' a data grid. Think gmail and Google Documents' autosave. I don't want to reinvent the wheel if its already been invented. I'm looking for an existing implementation of the magical autoSave() function. Auto-Saving:pushing to server code that saves to persistent storage, usually a DB. The server code framework is outside the scope of this question. Note that I'm not looking for an Ajax library, but a library/framework a level higher: interacts with the form itself. daemach introduced an implementation on top of jQuery @ http://daemach.blogspot.de/2007/03/autosave-jquery-plugin.html [script host down]. I'm not convinced it meets the lightweight and well engineered criteria though. Criteria stable, lightweight, well engineered saves onChange and/or onBlur saves no more frequently then a given number of milliseconds handles multiple updates happening at the same time doesn't save if no change has occurred since last save saves to different urls per input class
