What is a safe way to pass an array of arrays to a DLL in C#?

I have an array of arrays that I want to pass into a DLL. I am running into the error "There is no marshaling support for nested arrays." I can pass a single array in fine but if I stack them up it fails. I need/want a "safe" way of passing in the array of arrays. private static extern int PrintStuff(string[][] someStringsInGroups, int numberOfGroups, int[] lengthSetsInGroups); EDIT: I am also willing, with enough discouragement and anguish, to accept a solution involving marshaling.
