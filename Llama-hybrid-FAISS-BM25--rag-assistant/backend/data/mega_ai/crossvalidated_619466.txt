A hierarchical model with conjugate hyperprior

I have a modeling problem that I am trying to formulate in a Bayesian manner to do inference. Basically, I have a prior where the variance is unknown, and we want to treat it as uncertain (though with a prior), in addition to an unknown variance for the likelihood term. I have now understood that this is then a hierarchical model (I'm new), where the prior variance is the second level of hierarchy (correct me if I'm wrong). The model parameters are denoted as $\theta$ , the likelihood variance is denoted as $\sigma_1^2$ , while the prior variance is denoted as $\sigma_2^2$ . Therefore, applying the relevant independences, I believe that the following is an accurate description of the problem: $$p(\theta, \sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2 | y) \propto p(y| \theta, \sigma_1^2) p(\theta | \sigma_2^2) p(\sigma_2^2) p(\sigma_1^2)$$ where the last three terms make up the prior $p(\theta, \sigma_1^2, \sigma_2^2)$ . I would like to define a simple version of this problem where we can work in closed form, i.e. have a prior conjugate to the likelihood, though this seems difficult (I have made some attempts with multinormal-inverse-wishart - i.e. assuming an inverse gamma prior distribution for the variances and a normal for $\theta|\sigma_2^2$ ) - even though wikipedia mentions conjugate hyperpriors , the references therein have not helped too much with this part. Example of this simple form: linear regression w/ prior: Likelihood stems from: $y|\mu, \sigma^2 \sim N_n(X\mu, \sigma_1^2I_n)$ , priors: $\mu | \sigma_2^2 \sim N(\mu_B, \sigma_2^2 P)$ where $P, X$ and $\mu_B$ are known, and $\sigma_1^2 \sim IG(a_1, b_1)$ , $\sigma_2^2 \sim IG(a_2, b_2)$ with some specified hyperparameters $a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2$ . I am starting to suspect that I actually can not estimate both $\sigma_1^2$ and $\sigma_2^2$ , but I can hopefully estimate their ratio, i.e. estimate an $\alpha = \sigma_1^2 / \sigma_2^2$ . I suspect that the example above has to be edited (simplified). So my question is, Is the prior in my example conjugate? Does there exist a slightly different conjugate hyperprior for this scenario (estimating both the variances)? Perhaps elsewhere in the exponential family? Or is there a contradiction hidden here? If not, can we make it work with estimating the ratio $\alpha$ ? How? I realize that if we know $\alpha$ then it definitely works with NIW. Possible to use empirical Bayes to estimate $\alpha$ ? Greatful for any pointers in clarifying this.
