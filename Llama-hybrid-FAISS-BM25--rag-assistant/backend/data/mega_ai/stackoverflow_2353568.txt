All Python objects in the CPython implementation go on the heap. You can read in detail how Python's memory management works here in the documentation: Memory management in Python involves a private heap containing all Python objects and data structures. The management of this private heap is ensured internally by the Python memory manager. The Python memory manager has different components which deal with various dynamic storage management aspects, like sharing, segmentation, preallocation or caching. Note that Python itself is just a language, and says nothing about how internals like memory management should work; this is a detail left to implementers.
