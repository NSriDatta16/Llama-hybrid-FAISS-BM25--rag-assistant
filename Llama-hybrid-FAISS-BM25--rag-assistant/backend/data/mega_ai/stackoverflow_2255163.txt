Is there a benefit to embedding ActionScript in MXML when developing Flex apps?

I always thought that separating the UI from the logic is the way to go like the use of class files in Flash CS3/CS4 or MVC in web frameworks but recently there are plenty of examples and posts using ActionScript embedded in MXML. Is there a benefit to doing this? Am I missing something.
