Is there a reason you can't support RTFD for documents with images, like TextEdit does? If that really isn't an option, ask your attributed string whether it contains attachments . That's what embedded images are: attachments. Also, you shouldn't use your views as storage classes. The document itself should own the text and expose it in a property, and you should bind the text view's value to that property.
