I had a similar issue. This is how I implemented it: ids = @active_friendships.map { |x| x.user_id } ids = ids.join(",") @posts = Post.all(:conditions => ["posts.user_id in (#{ids})"]).order("created_at DESC") This creates an array of all user IDs from @active_friendships and then joins them into a string with a comma as a separator. Then I simply passed this to the :conditions parameter. It's not as elegant as I like but it works. Hope this helps.
