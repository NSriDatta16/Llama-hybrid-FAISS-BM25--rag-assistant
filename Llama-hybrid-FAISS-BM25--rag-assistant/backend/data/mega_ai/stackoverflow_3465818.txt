I don't know of any implementations and I doubt any exists. Although Visual Studio has the _controlfp() function and a number of related preprocessor pragma's ( float_control() , fenv_access() , fp_contract() , I don't think you can use them to create a conforming fenv.h implementation. Sad as it is, Visual Studio is not a C99 compiler, and probably never will be.
