I know I'm bit late here, but yes there is a package for anomaly detection along with outlier combination-frameworks. The package is in Python and its name is pyod . It is published in JMLR. It has multiple algorithms for following individual approaches: Linear Models for Outlier Detection ( PCA,vMCD,vOne-Class, and SVM ) Proximity-Based Outlier Detection Models ( LOF, CBLOF, HBOS, KNN, AverageKNN, and MedianKNN ) Probabilistic Models for Outlier Detection ( ABOD and FastABOD ) Outlier Ensembles and Combination Frameworks( IsolationForest and FeatureBagging ) Neural Networks and Deep Learning Models ( Auto-encoder with fully connected Neural Network ) Finally, if you're looking specifically for time-series per se, then this github link will be useful. It has the following list packages for timeseries outlier detection: datastream.io skyline banpei AnomalyDetection
