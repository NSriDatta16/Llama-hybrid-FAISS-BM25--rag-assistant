There are many tests of normality. One usually focuses on the null hypothesis , namely, "$H_0: F=Normal$". However, little attention is paid to the alternative hypothesis : "against what"? Typically, tests that consider any other distribution as the alternative hypothesis have low power when compared against tests with the right alternative hypothesis (see, for instance, 1 and 2 ). There is an interesting R package with the implementation of several nonparametric normality tests ('nortest', http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/nortest/index.html ). As mentioned in the papers above, the likelihood ratio test, with appropriate alternative hypothesis, is more powerful than these tests. The idea mentioned by @Glen_b about comparing your sample against random samples from your (fitted) model is mentioned in my second reference. They are called "QQ-Envelopes" or "QQ-Fans". This implicitly requires having a model to generate the data from and, consequently, an alternative hypothesis.
