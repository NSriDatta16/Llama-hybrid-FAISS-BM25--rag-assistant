How do I compute/estimate the variance of sequential data?

Say I have a (infinite) sequences like 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 3 ... I want to estimate their mean and variance of the sequence at time $t$ . But I won't have enough storage to keep all the data seen previously. I know I can compute the mean by only keeping the sum of the sequence by far, then divide through by time $t$ . But how can I compute/estimate the variance (using a constant amount of storage)? Is there any trick/model for this?
