Is a neural network able to learn to map a completely different feature vector to the same class

Is a neural network (for example a MLPClassifier in Python) able to learn to map a completely (or very) different input feature set to the same output class? Or is it better to work in this case with more than one output class and map these recognized output classes afterwards to the same class manually?
