Joint Entropy of two time series

I have two time series of same length like following: X=[ 1.1833 1.1467 1.1767 1.1833 1.1000 1.2367 1.1633 1.2100 1.1200 1.1800 ] and Y=[ 1.2067 1.1800 1.1400 1.1900 1.1467 1.1467 1.2167 1.1967 1.1633 1.1300 ] I want to calculate Joint Entropy of X and Y. I know the formula for H(x,y), but I am facing problem while calculating Joint probability.
