How can we exclude some positions in list item while dropping objects in the list using Jquery

In Jquery I want small div tag boxes to be added in the list item. But at that some positions in the list item should be disabled. e.g. if i have 5 items, then I can drag and drop them in the list but excluding the 2nd position in the list.
