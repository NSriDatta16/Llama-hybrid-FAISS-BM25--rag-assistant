Plot multiple lines in transparent gray such that overlapping parts are darker

Unfortunately I cannot remember where I saw it, so I cannot provide a picture of how the plot should look like. I can just describe it: Do you know a way in MATLAB or R to plot multiple time series in transparent gray, such that overlapping parts are darker? The more lines overlap, the closer the respective part should go to black.
