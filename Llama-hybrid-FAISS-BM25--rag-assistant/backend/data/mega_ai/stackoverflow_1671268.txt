Are you planning to use the Telerik MVC Extensions when they become available? If so, then their script combiner seems like a natural choice, as their widgets integrate with it... If you're going to use script and css resources from multiple sources, then how about a good old-fashioned build script in your build environment of choice? It is generally easy to set up a build tool to merge text files and run external compressors. Using a build tool is a natural fit for continuous integration and one-step deploy. And you can easily do static file serving from a separate cookie-less domain for maximum download speed and minimal server overhead. And it will make it easy to add a CDN later on, if needed. (AFAIK Teleriks solution can link to a file already available on a CDN, but cannot minify a local file and upload it to a CDN.) I'm particularly interested in YSlow scores (before and after) and/or compression statistics/performances. Don't worry too much over a few percentage differences in achieved compression, or a single HTTP header that isn't strictly needed. If you just combine files where possible, minify whitespace, enable HTTP compression and set proper caching headers; then you're far ahead of the average website out there... If you prefer to keep minification inside MVC, then it boils down to maturity of the library IMHO. I don't know which one should be the top pick right now. But have a look at IncludeCombiner too; it is part of MVCContrib now , and as such will get a good deal of exposure in the future.
