Statistical aggregations for numerical features

Can someone explain why in a lot of machine learning competitions, many participants perform some statistical aggregations like mean and median aggregation for numerical features? How can this improve the performance of the machine learning model ? and how to implement these statistical aggregations? Example : # Also we created statistical 'max_mean' and 'range' features which noticeably improved score : def new_features(df): for col in agg_stat_columns: df[col+'_range'] = df[col+'_max'] - df[col+'_min'] df[col+'_max_mean'] = df[col+'_max']/df[col+'_mean'] df[col +'_median'] = df[col].median() return df thanks ,
