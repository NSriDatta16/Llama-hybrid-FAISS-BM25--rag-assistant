Magento: how to prefill values of a product's dropdown attribute

I'm building a Magento shop for a customer and would like to add an attribute to all products that functions as a dropdown list. Like the 'Manufacturer' attribute. However, instead of manually entering the list of values for the attribute I'd like the values to be populated from an external site. So, every time you create a new product or edit an existing one, the dropdown is populated with the up-to-date list of values that has been retrieved from a remote site. The list should not be fetched just once during creation of the attribute, but every time a product is created or edited. For example, assume you can get a list of all Manufacturers via curl from a remote site. The names in this list are occasionally modified or added, however the id's stay the same so they should be used behind the scenes. How would you prefill the values of the manufacturer's dropdown? I know how to create a basic custom extension, but extending the adminhtml backend is new stuff for me. Any help is appreciated.
