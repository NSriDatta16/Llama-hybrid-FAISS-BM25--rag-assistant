The &block is a way of sending a piece of Ruby code in to a method and then evaluating that code in the scope of that method. In your example code above it means a partial named cart will be rendered in a div. I think the term closure is used for this in computer science. So in your example the &block is: "cart", :object => @cart) %> Some good reading and an explanation of blocks, procs and lamdas can be found at Robert Sosinski's blog .
