Are you attempting to sum each of the values when you merge the lists? If so, try something like this: List list1 = new List (); List list2 = new List (); List result = list1.Union(list2).GroupBy(x => x.NameText).Select(x => new Name { NameText = x.Key, Gender = new Gender { FemaleCumulativeFrequency = x.Sum(y => y.Gender.FemaleCumulativeFrequency), FemaleFrequency = x.Sum(y => y.Gender.FemaleFrequency), MaleCumulativeFrequency = x.Sum(y => y.Gender.MaleCumulativeFrequency), MaleFrequency = x.Sum(y => y.Gender.MaleFrequency) } }).ToList(); What this does is the following: Unions the lists, creating an IEnumerable that contains the contents of both lists. Groups the lists by the NameText property, so if there are duplicate Names with the same NameText, they'll show up in the same group. Selects a set of new Name objects, with each grouped Name's properties summed... you can also use Average if that makes more sense. Converts the entire query to a List by calling the "ToList()" method. Edit: Or, as you've said below, you simply want to merge the two lists... do this: List allNames = femaleNames.Union(maleNames).ToList();
