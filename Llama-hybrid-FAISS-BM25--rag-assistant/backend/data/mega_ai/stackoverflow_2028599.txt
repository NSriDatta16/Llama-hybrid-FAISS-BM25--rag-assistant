Click anywhere to focus in CKEditor

In FireFox, I can click anywhere in CKEditor (350px x 250px) to place focus on a single paragraph of text located at the top of the editor. However, in IE6 (I know, but our client insists) I must click directly atop the paragraph to focus the cursor and subsequently edit the text. CKEditor creates the following: ... some text to edit I suspect this is an IE6 problem; any ideas??? EDIT: Apparently a known problem.
