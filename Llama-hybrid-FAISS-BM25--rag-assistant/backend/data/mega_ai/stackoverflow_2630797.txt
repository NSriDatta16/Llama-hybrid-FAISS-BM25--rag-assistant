We'd need to see a bit more of the code here, and what process you're using to convert JavaScript in an XSL document to JavaScript in an HTML page for execution. Whilst &lt; escaping and a CDATA section are both valid ways to include out-of-band characters in an XML file, when you get to the browser side you're probably handling the page as HTML rather than native-XML, at which point the rules are different, and care is required with your HTML-generation to ensure that the output from the XSL transform is acceptable to browsers. See if it really is the causing the trouble rather than the elided ‘Business Logic’, by avoiding it completely. eg. replace it with something like 100>cnt . (In any case, in general you want to keep scripting logic out of the body of an HTML page. It's better off in an external script, where you don't have to worry about the rules for embedding it in another markup language.)
