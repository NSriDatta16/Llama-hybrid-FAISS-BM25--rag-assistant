I began to use datatables, but it became very slow to load and sort a few hundreds of local items. So i tried jqgrid and it runs fine with thousands of local loaded items. So jqgrid has better performance. But sometimes i need to work with dozens of thousands of local items, and jqgrid becomes slow too. I know these plugins are designed to work with client/server architeture, so i am evaluating to change the design of my application.
