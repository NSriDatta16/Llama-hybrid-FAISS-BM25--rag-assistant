Which Database Model?

I've primarily implemented relational DBMS, but I don't think it is suited to the following...I have set of up to 10^4 of relatively complex 'objects' that are composed of 'parts' numbering up to 10^2. The parts are assembled into 'assemblies'. Objects have operations performed on them to establish patterns among both parts and assemblies and are compared with patterns present in other objects in the database. Using RDBMS, I could simply aggregate the 'parts' into Table B, which have very little out of context use (unlike an item number on an invoice for example) and link them to their parent 'objects' in Table 'A' or to 'assemblies' in Table C. However, I would have to run a SQL SELECT on this entire table just to 'collate' the objects, which are really just a serial subset within Table 'B'. Alternatively, these could all be in one table with a ParentID field; the absence of which indicates 'object', not 'assembly' or 'part'. I'm thinking VIEWS could be set up for each object to 'index' the table as it were, however. I don't know if it feasible or best practice to use 10,000 views! Is there another model I should learn that may organize the data in a more conducive way? The data would be a set of heirarchal objects composed of 'assemblies' of other 'assemblies' or atomic 'parts'. Can someone point me in the right direction?
