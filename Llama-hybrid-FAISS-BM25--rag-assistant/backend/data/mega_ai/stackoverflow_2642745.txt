JavaScript replace text with images problem

I'm extremely new to JS and have this code that I'm trying to tweak. WHen I was adding the array, I had tested it with only a couple of items and it was working fine, now it just doesn't work, and I can't figure out what is wrong with it!! Basically, I'm trying to change every instance of a card type with an image on a webpage Here's the code: window.onload = function(){ var cardname = new Array(); cardname[0] = "Ace of Hearts^ "; cardname[1] = "2 of Hearts^ "; cardname[2] = "3 of Hearts^ "; cardname[3] = "4 of Hearts^ "; cardname[4] = "5 of Hearts^ "; cardname[5] = "6 of Hearts^ "; cardname[6] = "7 of Hearts^ "; cardname[7] = "8 of Hearts^ "; cardname[8] = "9 of Hearts^ "; cardname[9] = "10 of Hearts^ "; cardname[10] = "Jack of Hearts^ "; cardname[11] = "Queen of Hearts^ "; cardname[12] = "King of Hearts^ "; cardname[13] = "Ace of Spades^ "; cardname[14] = "2 of Spades^ "; cardname[15] = "3 of Spades^ "; cardname[16] = "4 of Spades^ "; cardname[17] = "5 of Spades^ "; cardname[18] = "6 of Spades^ "; cardname[19] = "7 of Spades^ "; cardname[20] = "8 of Spades^ "; cardname[21] = "9 of Spades^ "; cardname[22] = "10 of Spades^ "; cardname[23] = "Jack of Spades^ "; cardname[24] = "Queen of Spades^ "; cardname[25] = "King of Spades^ "; cardname[26] = "Ace of Clubs^ "; cardname[27] = "2 of Clubs^ "; cardname[28] = "3 of Clubs^ "; cardname[29] = "4 of Clubs^ "; cardname[30] = "5 of Clubs^ "; cardname[31] = "6 of Clubs^ "; cardname[32] = "7 of Clubs^ "; cardname[33] = "8 of Clubs^ "; cardname[34] = "9 of Clubs^ "; cardname[35] = "10 of Clubs^ "; cardname[36] = "Jack of Clubs^ "; cardname[37] = "Queen of Clubs^ "; cardname[38] = "King of Clubs^ "; cardname[39] = "Ace of Diamonds^ "; cardname[40] = "2 of Diamonds^ "; cardname[41] = "3 of Diamonds^ "; cardname[42] = "4 of Diamonds^ "; cardname[43] = "5 of Diamonds^ "; cardname[44] = "6 of Diamonds^ "; cardname[45] = "7 of Diamonds^ "; cardname[46] = "8 of Diamonds^ "; cardname[47] = "9 of Diamonds^ "; cardname[48] = "10 of Diamonds^ "; cardname[49] = "Jack of Diamonds^ "; cardname[50] = "Queen of Diamonds^ "; cardname[51] = "King of Diamonds^ "; var j, k, findit, part, page, repl; var page = document.body.innerHTML; for(var i=0; i =0){ var j = page.indexOf(findit); var k = findit.length; page = page.substr(0,j) + repl + page.substr(j+k); } } document.body.innerHTML = page; } any help would be appreciated to figure out why this code is not working! Final Code Below (after all the help I got from Guffa) /* Developed by Robert Nyman, http://www.robertnyman.com Code/licensing: http://code.google.com/p/getelementsbyclassname/ */ window.onload=function(){ var getElementsByClassName = function (className, tag, elm){ if (document.getElementsByClassName) { getElementsByClassName = function (className, tag, elm) { elm = elm || document; var elements = elm.getElementsByClassName(className), nodeName = (tag)? new RegExp("\\b" + tag + "\\b", "i") : null, returnElements = [], current; for(var i=0, il=elements.length; i '; } ); elements[i].innerHTML = html; } */ for (var i=0; i '; } }
