Calculate Naive Baysian classifier

I'm preparing Dell EMC Associate data science certificate. The following is one of the mock questions and I'm having problem to calculate it by hand and need help. The correct answer is $Y=1$, $probability = 4/54$ and $Y=0$, $probability = 1/54$ However, I'm not able to get correct answer. Consider the training data set shown in above table. What are the classifications ($Y=0$ or $Y=1$), and the probabilities of the classifications for the tuple $X (0,0,1)$ using Naive Bayesian classifier? Calculations: $$ P(Y=1)P(X_1=0|Y=1)P(X_2=0|Y=1)P(X_3=1|Y=1) \\ P(Y=0)P(X_1=0|Y=0)P(X_2=0|Y=0)P(X_3=1|Y=0) $$ \begin{align} P(Y=1) &= 9/18 \\ P(Y=0) &= 9/18 \\ P(X_1=0|Y=1) &= 2/9 \\ P(X_2=0|Y=1) &= 1/9 \\ P(X_3=1|Y=1) &= 2/9 \end{align} But, $$\frac 2 9 \times \frac 1 9 \times \frac 2 9 \times \frac 9 {18} \ne \frac 5 {54}$$
