@This Mat - I disagree with your approach. I would assign spacing on elements in a semantic fashion, and use contextual selectors to define behavior for that collection of elements. .content p { /* obviously choose a more elegant name */ margin-bottom: 10px; } Naming classes after their behavior instead of their content is kind of a slippery slope, and muddies up the semantic nature of your HTML. For example, what if in one area of your page, all elements with class .top10 suddenly needed 20 pixels instead? Instead of changing a single rule, you would have to create a new class name, and change it on all the elements you wanted to affect. To answer the original question, it depends entirely on how you want elements to stack. Do you want extra space at the top or the bottom?
