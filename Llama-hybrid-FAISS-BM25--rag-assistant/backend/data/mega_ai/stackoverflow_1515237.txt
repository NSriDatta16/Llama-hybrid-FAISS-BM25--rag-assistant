do.call on lists is very elegant, and fast. In fact do.call(rbind, my.list) once saved my ass when I needed to combine a huge list. It was by far the fastest solution. To solve your problem, maybe something like: do.call(rbind, lapply(foo, unlist)) > result.2 result.2 a b [1,] 1 2 [2,] 11 22 [3,] 111 222 > result.2[, 'a'] [1] 1 11 111 >
