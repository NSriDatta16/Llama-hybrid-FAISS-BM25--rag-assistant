ADR (Address Operator) description in TwinCAT's help says: Attention : After an Online Change there might be changes concerning the data on certain addresses. Please regard this in case of using pointers on addresses. It looks to me like pointers cannot be stored permanently if someone pretends to use online modification of the program. Otherwise if pointers are stored (for example as a binding between some data structures) online change should be avoided.
