Python: determine if all items of a list are the same item

In some of my code I put a series of objects in a list and I build an additional list out of their attributes, which is a string. I need to determine if all the items in this second list have the exact same value, without knowing beforehand which value it is, and return a bool so that I can do different things in my code depending on the result. I can't know the names of the properties beforehand, that is why I'm trying to make something as generic as possible. To make the example clear, an ideal function, called "all_same" would work like this: >>> property_list = ["one", "one", "one"] >>> all_same(property_list) True >>> property_list = ["one", "one", "two"] >>> all_same(property_list) False I was thinking of making a list of unique elements and then check if its length is 1, but I'm not sure if it's the most elegant solution out there.
