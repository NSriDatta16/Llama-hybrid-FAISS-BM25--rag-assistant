JPA support for XML datatype columns

For a new project we are starting (which uses JPA 2 on top of Hibernate 3) we need to be able to store XML documents and then query on their content and structure at a later date. The databases we would like to support are DB2, Oracle and SQLServer. I know all three DB vendors support native XML querying (using SQL and XQuery like statements) but is there any direct support within Hibernate for this? In other words, can I write one set of hibernate data access code which queries all 3 database types agnostically using a built-in feature of Hibernate/JPA or would I need to code specific queries for each DB type? I appreciate that I could define the column as a @Lob column and then read all the records, parse and inspect but I was hoping to leverage the power of the DB engine rather than having to do it myself. For reference we would only ever be using one DB flavour at a time, it's just that we want to be able to support all 3 should we need to. Thanks Steve
