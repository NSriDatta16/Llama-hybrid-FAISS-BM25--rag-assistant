Adding/complementing the other answers, BERT gives the possibility to access/obtain the embeddings of the fed input (which wasn't and still isn't the case of some other models). The embeddings are often interpreted as the "perception" of the model. They are very useful in multiple research studies, and you may find many that are reasoning on the embeddings distances between different text inputs (e.g. the cosine distance) to detect or measure an aspect related to the fed text or the model itself. e.g. given the following sentences, A = "the man earns 10 dollars", B = "the woman earns 10 dollars", C = "the man is broke" and D = "the woman is broke" when fed to a financial language model, we expect that the embeddings of A and B are close, similarly those of C and D, indicating that the attention is focused on what is earned by each individual and not its gender. Otherwise, if for instance B and D are very close, or B is closer to C and D than A is close to C and D, we may think of a gender bias of the model... Although introduced very recently, we're seeing much research using LLaMa 2. However, some say that its embeddings can be "meaningless" (I don't agree with that and you can read more on this topic here https://stackoverflow.com/a/77441536/3014036 )... GPT gives access to its embeddings but it's slow and expensive, so you can imagine that anybody making a large-scale study would use BERT instead... Overall, I agree with the main reason given in the accepted answer; BERT is lightweight while LLaMa and GPT are both very expensive and way slower than BERT...
