I have used tesseract for similar tasks. I can give you few recommendation. You can choose the best that works for you. Extract the parameter values by finding the exact locations they appear. If the parameters always appear in the same place you can find those coordinates and extract parameters from there. You can get the location information by getting the TSV output produced by Tesseract while performing OCR. Looking at the line / block / paragraph numbers produced by tesseract for each text Since the values and parameter pairs are separated by lines or to separate sections, I think tesseract will do a reasonable job in giving your parameters either different line numbers or block/paragraph numbers. You can get this information if you get the TSV output from Tesseract using the create_tsv=1 configuration I believe. Using regex to match parameters It seems that your parameters are pretty consistent (i.e. either categorical ON/OFF or a number). In that case what you can do is, while reading the output from tesseract, match the description in front of the value. For example, as soon as you encounter AHU ON/OFF STATUS text, look for the word either on or off . And you can use these in combination to make the results even more accurate. Hope these suggestions help.
