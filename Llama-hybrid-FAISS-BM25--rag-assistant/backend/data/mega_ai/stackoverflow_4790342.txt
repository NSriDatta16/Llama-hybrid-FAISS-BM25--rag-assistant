First, put the processNumber function inside of memStorage class. You'll probably want to convert the 'number' variable as an instance variable along with storedNum1 and storedNum2. And third, create a main() function inside of the class and then make an instance of memStorage class and call the processNumber() function. And fourth, the constructor MUST be the exact same name as the class name. Change it to 'memStorage'. Also mem1 and mem2 functions doesnt store anything to the instance variable. Once the function exits, the 'num1' and 'num2' variable will vanish. Replace 'num1' and 'num2' to storedNum1 or storedNum2. You'll need to study and understand the object oriented paradigm concept.
