Linear Regression In the presence of second equation

I have two time series $X(t)$ , and $Y(t)$ , both are i.i.d. I run the following linear regression model: $Y(t) = \alpha + \beta Z(t)$ , where $Z(t) = X(t) + X(t-1) + X(t-2)$ ; The t-statistic of $\beta$ by regressing $Y(.)$ on $Z(.)$ is 2.5. Is this value correct? If not, how do I obtain the correct value? Do you have any reading recommendations for this topic?
