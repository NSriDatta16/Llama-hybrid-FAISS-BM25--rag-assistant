Instead of INPUT# you could use LINE INPUT#, this will read the whole line. Determing how many lines there are would be difficult because you're line length is variable. You could however make a educated guess by using : Lines=LOF(Filehandle)/AvarageLineLength And you can dynamically resize your array by using REDIM PRESERVE Using Fileobject will only add overhead and dependencies to your program. The same goes for the Jet driver. It's not that hard to write a string splitting function ? Search on this site.
