Is there any particular reason why you use lme and not lmer ? The latter is more recent and better in many situations. You are correct in your interpretation of the intercept. To avoid confusion I will refer to this as the global intercept, since your model also has random intercepts. To be slightly more formal about it, the global intercept is the mean value of Delta when the numerical covariates are zero and the categorical covariates are at their reference level(s), in your case when Treatment is 1, for the "average" group (ID). However, each group has it's own intercept, which will be an offset from the global intercept. The estimate for Treatment2 is the difference in the mean of Delta when treatment is 2, compared to when it is 1, for observations within the same group and holding the other covariates constant. Likewise for Treatment3. If you want to compare Treatment2 with Treatment3 then you could recode your data with either of those as the reference level instead, using the relevel function. This is a linear model, so, since the estimate for Date is negative this means there is a linear association between Delta and Date , where the estimate for Date is the slope. Note that in the presence of an interaction, the main effects of the variables do not have the usual interpretation. For numerical variables, the main effect is the association of that variable with the outcome when the other variable is zero. With numerical variables this often makes no sense (when zero is not a plausible and/or when zero falls far outside the observed range), so centering the data makes interpretation more sensible. In your case, the estimate for the interaction is several orders of magnitude smaller than the main effects and not significant at the 0.05 level, so you could consider removing it. Your statement "Delta is significantly affected by Light and Date" I would alter to "There is a statistically significant linear association between Delta and both Light and Date" and quote the confidence intervals for each estimate. Try to avoid causal language such as "Y is affected by X". If you have a research hypothesis that such a causal effect exists then you can say that your model supports this hypothesis. If you think there might be nonlinear associations, then you could investigate this by including higher order terms, such as Date^2 and Date^3 in addition to the linear term. Plotting the data before modelling it is good practice and often informs possibly non-linearities. You should also check the model assumptions, particularly that the residuals and random intercepts are plausibly normally distributed, homoscedastic, and without autocorrelation.
