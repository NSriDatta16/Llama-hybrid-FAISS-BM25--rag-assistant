How to use a tuned Random Forest Regressor (post validation and testing) to forecast the future values for a univariate time series?

I have a three-year univariate time series dataset with weekly data entries. I have split the series into a training set (2 years of data) and a testing set (data from the final year). I have trained and optimised a random forest regressor model. Please note that I have used lags during the model. I now want to forecast six months into the future, but I am confused about how that would be possible. Please answer the above question keeping in mind that I do not have the option to use FBProphet etc., as of now.
