Consequences of choosing the wrong GLM response distribution

In Chapter 10 of McElreath's Statistical Rethinking (2nd edition), he argues that the response distribution for a GLM should be chosen to maximize entropy given a set of constraints on the response variable (positive, discrete, bounded etc). From page 312 when the outcome variable is either discrete or bounded, a Gaussian likelihood is not the most powerful choice. Consider for example a count outcome, such as the number of blue marbles pulled from a bag. Such a variable is constrained to be zero or a positive integer. Using a Gaussian model with such a variable won't result in a terrifying explosion. But it can't be trusted to do much more than estimate the average count. It certainty can't be trusted to produce sensible predictions. The consequences of the wrong distribution for predictions makes intuitive sense. We don't want a distribution that will predict values that cannot possibly occur. While a misspecified response distribution can cause problems with prediction, are there problems with inferences made from a model with a misspecified response distribution? Specifically I have two questions about inferences made from a GLM with a incorrect response distribution: Will parameter estimates be biased? Will p-values for the parameters be overconfident or too conservative?
