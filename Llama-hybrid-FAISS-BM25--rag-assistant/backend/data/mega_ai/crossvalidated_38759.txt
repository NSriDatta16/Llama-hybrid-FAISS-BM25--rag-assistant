Systematic vs. statistical error

I'm currently working with some measurements of the following form: Three test subjects, three trials per test subject, three measurement points per trial: At each measurement point within each trial, I have time measurements and velocity measurements, each with associated +/- errors. I then compute velocity from these measurements and propagate my error. Next, I take the average of the three measurement points per subject subject, propagating my error, to find the average velocity per trial. Finally, I average the three trials, leaving me with a value and propagated error per test subject. I also calculate the standard error of the mean on this average. Now I have two error values, one +/i and one standard error. I'd like to do more calculations with these average velocity measurements. Is there a generally accepted method to determine which error I should use in these future calculations? Please let me know if there are any questions regarding my experimental setup. In a nutshell, I'd like to know a way to compare systematic versus statistical error and determine which to propagate. Many thanks for all of your help! Cheers.
