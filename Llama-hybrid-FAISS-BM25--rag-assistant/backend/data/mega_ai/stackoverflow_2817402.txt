Is enough to change the meta-data and title on my html files, and wait few weeks to let google update the results ? (how long does it take on average ?) Basically yes. The time you'll have to wait varies very much from site to site, depending on Page Rank, visitor frequency and other factors. Stack Overflow results are indexed within minutes; smaller sites within days or weeks. It may also be worth signing up with the Google Webmaster Tools to find out how "visible" your site is to the Google bot and when it last dropped by.
