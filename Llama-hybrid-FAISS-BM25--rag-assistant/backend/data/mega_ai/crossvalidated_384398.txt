criteria for percent error?

I have 2 arrays. The first array is system rating {69.73, 56.93, 68.64, 65.58, 70.36, 67.44, 56.34, 75.03, 51.58, 65.7} The second array is human rating {64.8, 74.8, 87.6, 77.55, 71.95, 58.35, 62.55, 62.25, 66.2, 66.1} I use the following percent error formula from http://www2.phy.ilstu.edu/~wenning/slh/Percent%20Difference%20Error.pdf $\text{percentError} = |\text{AcceptedValue} - \text{Experiment}| / |\text{Accepted Value}| * 100$ . The value 69.73 compared to 64.8, 56.93 compared to 74.8 and so on. Then, error values = 7.6, 23.8, 21.6, 15.4, 2.20, 15.57, 9.92, 20.5, 22.08, 0.605. And this error value if on average produces 13.95. I want to ask, what are the criteria for the error value? Is it bad, moderate or strong criteria? Thanks in advance
