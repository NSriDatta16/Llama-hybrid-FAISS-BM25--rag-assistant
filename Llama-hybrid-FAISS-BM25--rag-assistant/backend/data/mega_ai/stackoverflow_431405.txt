Well... really since you can't measure you just have to guess. You ever installed windows and the progress bar is very slow to move but then all of a sudden it jumps a great deal? A couple ideas. If you have only one SQL query then you could slowly move the progress bar over time (like 0.5% per second?). Then if the the query hasn't finished by the time it hits 90% stop it. Then don't let it finish until it is done. If it finishes early (while the slow climb is going on) just jump to 100%. Another idea is to run the query many times over to figure out an average time. Use this to do the same thing I mentioned in the last paragraph, but with the average time you can probably make the increments match better with the real progress. Good luck!
