The LIML has somehow disapeared from recent econometrics textbooks. You will need to look in older textbooks, such as Amemiya (1985) or Davidson and Mackinnon (1993), the latter providing the best coverage of the derivation of the LIML (as far as I know). Given that Davidson and Mackinnon's derivation of the LIML takes not less than 5 pages, it makes little sense to reproduce these here, just be ready to derive a (concentrated) maximum likelihood, use inverse of partitioned matrices and minimise quadratic forms :-) EDIT The older you go, the better it becomes: Theil (1971)'s textbook contains also a detailed treatment of the derivation of the LIML (p. 679-686).
