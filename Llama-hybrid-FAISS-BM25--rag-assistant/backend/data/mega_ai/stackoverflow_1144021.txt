You can't use const references in a copy constructor or assignment operator that involves an auto_ptr<> . Remove the const. In other words, use declarations like foo(foo & rhs); foo & operator=(foo & rhs); These forms are explicitly mentioned in the Standard, primarily in section 12.8. They should be usable in any standard-conforming implementation. In fact, paragraphs 5 and 10 of 12.8 says that the implicitly defined copy constructor and assignment operator (respectively) will take a non-const reference if any of the members require it.
