ARIMA Intervention Transfer Function - How to Visualize the Effect

I have a monthly time series with an intervention and I would like to quantify the effect of this intervention on the outcome. I realize the series is rather short and the effect is not yet concluded. The Data cds The methodology 1) The pre-intervention series (up until October 2013) was used with the auto.arima function. The model suggested was ARIMA(1,0,0) with non-zero mean. The ACF plot looked good. pre 2) Given the plot of the full series, the pulse response was chosen below, with T = Oct 2013, which according to cryer and chan can be fit as follows with the arimax function: mod.arimax The residuals from this appeared OK: The plot of fitted and actuals: plot(fitted(mod.arimax), col="red", type="b") lines(window(log(cds), start=c(2012, 02)), type="b") The Questions 1) Is this methodology correct for intervention analysis? 2) Can I look at estimate/SE for the components of the transfer function and say that the effect of the intervention was significant? 3) How can one visualize the transfer function effect (plot it?) 4) Is there a way to estimate how much the intervention increased the output after 'x' months? I guess for this (and maybe #3) I am asking how to work with an equation of the model - if this were simple linear regression with dummy variables (for example) I could run scenarios with and without the intervention and measure the impact - but I am just unsure how to work this this type of model. ADD Per request, here are the residuals from the two parametrizations. First from the fit: fit Then, from this fit mod.arimax
