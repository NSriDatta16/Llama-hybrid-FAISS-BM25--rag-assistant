It will drag multiple rows for sure. I am sure you are doing same mistake as i did. I believe all your code are fine. To drag multiple row click on one row press shift or ctrl to select multiple but "Note here: If you release your mouse click here before drag it will forget what are the multiple items it has selected", so just drag without leaving mouse on your last selected item.(So, I think it works that way without doing anything) However I am also searching for someway to make it work like drag and drop as in desktop. ;-)
