How can logistic regression maximize AUC?

$AUC$ is the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. It's said that a loss function set to $1-AUC$ can be minimized by maximizing $AUC$ . How does this tie into logit (logistic) regression, if at all, and does logit regression maximize $AUC$ directly/indirectly somehow? described mathematically for both the discrete-class and probability-based logit regression would be nice. Also, what is a rank loss function?
