I was asked to re-post this answer here from my comment at http://doingbayesiandataanalysis.blogspot.com/2012/01/complete-example-of-right-censoring-in.html The specifics of this answer relate to the model in that comment, but the concepts apply to the topic here. The core of the JAGS model for censored data is this: isCensored[i] ~ dinterval( y[i] , censorLimitVec[i] ) y[i] ~ dnorm( mu , tau ) The key to understanding what JAGS is doing is that JAGS automatically imputes a random value for any variable that is not specified as a constant in the data. Thus, when y[i] is NA (i.e., a missing value, not a constant), then JAGS imputes a random value for it. But what value should it generate? The second line of the model, above, says that y[i] should be randomly generated from a normal distribution with mean mu and precision tau. But the first line of the model, above, puts another constraint on the randomly generated value of y[i] . That line says that whatever value of y[i] is randomly generated, it must fall on the side of censorLimitVec[i] dictated by the value of isCensored[i] . To understand this part, let's unpack the dinterval() distribution. Suppose that censorLimitVec has 3 values in it, not just 1: censorLimitVec = c(10,20,30) Then randomly generated values from dinterval(y,c(10,20,30)) will be either 0, 1, 2, or 3 depending on whether $y dinterval(y,c(10,20,30)) has output of $1$ with 100% probability. The trick is this: We instead specify the output of dinterval , and impute a random value of y that could produce it. Thus, if we say 1 ~ dinterval(y,c(10,20,30)) then y is imputed as a random value between 10 and 20. Putting the two model statements together, 1 ~ dinterval( y , censorLimit ) y ~ dnorm( mu , tau ) means that y comes from a normal density and y must fall above the censorLimit . Hope that helps!!
