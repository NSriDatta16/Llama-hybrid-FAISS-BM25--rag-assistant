This php code going to be included always, on the server side (regardless of the browser). As far as I know conditional comments work on client side and browser doesn't have to respect them (I don't rememeber the details but I read somewhere that browser can do whatever it wants with HTML comments, even cut them out completely so people who put javascript into can be surprised). If you want to decide whether to include file or not, use some browser detection: $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] or get_browser() would be a good place to start.
