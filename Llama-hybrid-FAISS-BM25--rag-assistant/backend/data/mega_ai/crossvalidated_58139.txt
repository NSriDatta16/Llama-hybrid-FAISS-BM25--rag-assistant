You could do, providing the denominator of each proportion is about the same (or you'd be treating $\frac{1}{2}$ as equivalent to $\frac{500}{1000}$). And it would probably be a good idea to use a variance-stabilizing transformation: for proportion $p$ the angular transformation gives a response $y=\arcsin\sqrt{p}$. But all that's a bodge & not much less effort than doing it properly with a generalized linear model: look up log-linear models for contingency tables or logistic regression.
