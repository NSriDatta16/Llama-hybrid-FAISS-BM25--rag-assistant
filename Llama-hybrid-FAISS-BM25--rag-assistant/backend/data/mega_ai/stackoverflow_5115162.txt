I think you should consider organizational changes: mentoring, training, code reviews. The tools can only help you if you're using them in good faith with a base understanding of the goals. If one of these is missing they won't help you. Humans are just to intelligent to do dump things or work around metrics. I think your assessment is not correct that "they" are on board if they can't write a single useful test. Automatic tools are simply not the correct tools at this stage. You can't learn by being told by a program what to do next.
