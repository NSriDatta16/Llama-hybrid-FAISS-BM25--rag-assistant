At the bottom of your model summary, if you look carefully, you will see the dreaded warning from R: boundary (singular) fit: see ?isSingular As explained by Robert Long at Dealing with singular fit in mixed models : "When you obtain a singular fit, this is often indicating that the model is overfitted â€“ that is, the random effects structure is too complex to be supported by the data, which naturally leads to the advice to remove the most complex part of the random effects structure (usually random slopes). The benefit of this approach is that it leads to a more parsimonious model that is not over-fitted." Thus, your model needs some refining before you reach the interpretation stage. For example, the variance for the random effect of list seems really, really small - do you really need to include a random effect for list in your model? Assuming for pedagogical purposes your current model is sensible (though we know it's not due to the singular fit warning!), Roland already explained in his comments that R uses dummy coding to encode the effects of categorical variables in a mixed effects model such as yours. In your case, this means that R will include two dummy variables for group in your model (since group has 3 categories) and one dummy variable for condition (since condition has 2 categories). In general, if you have a variable with k categories, R will capture its effect on the response variable by including k-1 dummy variables in the model in lieu of that variable. How does R create the k-1 dummy variables for a categorical variable with k categories? It orders the k categories by name in alphabetical order and sets aside the first category as the reference category against which all others will be compared. Then, it defines k-1 dummy variables for the remaining non-reference categories and includes them in the model. You can see this in action for your group variable. This variable has 3 categories: EN, HS and SB. R arranges these categories in alphabetical order (i.e., EN, HS and SB) and sets aside the first category, EN, as the reference category against the HS and SB categories will be compared. It then defines the following two dummy variables for the non-reference categories: groupHS = 1 if group = HS = 0 else (i.e., if group is either EN or SB) groupSB = 1 if group = SB = 0 else (i.e., if group is either EN or HS) You know R does all of this behind the scenes since the model summary shows the dummy variables in questions under the portion corresponding to the fixed effects. Note that these dummy variables are NOT added to your dataset. For your other categorical predictor variable, with categories EN-GJT-R-GAP and EN-GJT-R-RES, the dummy variable is defined as: conditionEN-GJT-R-RES = 1 if condition = EN-GJT-R-RES = 0 else If you adopt a conditional interpretation for the intercept term in your model, then the intercept represents the expected value of the response variable when group = EN and condition = EN-GJT-R-GAP for the typical subject, typical token_set and typical list.
