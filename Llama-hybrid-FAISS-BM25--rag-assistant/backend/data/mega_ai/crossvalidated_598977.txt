If we have (as in your example) within a particular year (2006) 41 rainy days and 156.3 cm of total rain, the average is indeed 3.81cm per rainy day. That said, your intuition is correct, this is not the whole story. It makes sense to also have the average rainfall per trial day, i.e. 2.27 cm per trial day. These two statistics help us capture different aspects of the rainfall's impact. The first one gives us an idea of how much it rained "overall" and the second indicator of how "strong" (temporally localised) the rainfall was. For example, in a 20-day period if it rains every second day by 3cm that that means we have 30/20 = 1.5 cm of average rain per day and 30/10 = 3 cm per rainy day. For the same plant and period if we had only 2 days of 15 cm rainfall each, we would still have 30/20=1.5 cm of average rain per day but 30/2=15 cm per rainy day, which obviously will have a much different impact on the plant's well-being. So in effect, neither you nor your collaborators were "right" or "wrong", just aimed to capture different aspects of the rainfall's pattern.
