Should I tune random forest for feature selection?

I am working on a classification task. To assess which variable to keep for future modeling, I want to use RF to pick only the most import variable in explaining the binary outcome. Do the Hyper-parameters of the RF have an influence on variable importance? Should I tune the RF before assessing the importance of the variables? N.B. The model I want to train after having selected the features will not necessarily be RF.
