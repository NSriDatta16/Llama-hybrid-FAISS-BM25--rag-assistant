Is there a way that I can auto redirect people to a different page based on their state?

I am new to this and have been playing around, I was wondering if I could auto redirect people from the landing page to a page that would have information about their state. Like url.com/ to url.com/michigan.htm The current code that I've found if(typeof(sGeobytesLocationCode)=="undefined" ||typeof(sGeobytesCode)=="undefined" ||typeof(sGeobytesInternet)=="undefined") { // Something has gone wrong with the variables, so set them to some default value, // maybe set a error flag to check for later on. var sGeobytesLocationCode="unknown"; var sGeobytesCode="unknown"; var sGeobytesInternet="unknown"; } if(sGeobytesCode=="MI") { // Visitors from Michigan would go here window.open("http://www.url.com/michigan.htm" , "_self"); }else if(sGeobytesInternet=="US") { // Visitors from The United States would go here window.open("http://www.url.com/selectstate.htm"); } I'm note sure what I need to do to add more states to this code, I'm sure its supper easy but like I said I am new to this Thanks
