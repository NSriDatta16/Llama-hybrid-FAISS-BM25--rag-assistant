You may want to try linear discriminant analysis (LDA). The basic idea of LDA is to project your data in a space where the variance within classes is minimum and the one between classes is maximum. Unlike PCA, LDA uses the labels to reduce the dimensionality. Indeed, discovering the direction that maximizes the variance with PCA does not mean projecting in this direction will help you to classify. Take the example of classification of pictures. The variance of the average light may vary a lot between your images, yet that feature might not help you that much depending on your goal. See this post on how to do it with R.
