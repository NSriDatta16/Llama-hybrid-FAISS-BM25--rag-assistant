You can convert the IP adress to an integer using ip2long or the corresponding mysql function. Then I suggest a table with MyIsam storage engine and a hash index. If you wan't to be ready for ipv6 you can stoer binary data. If possible you can also do this in memory tables or apc cache (when you don't need the ip adresses to be stored forever and they can be lost on a server restart).
