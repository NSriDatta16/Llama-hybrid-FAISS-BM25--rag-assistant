How can I return home from an a Rails Kiosk Error page without an adress bar or keyboard

Im hosting a rails app on heroku. It runs on the client on a touchscreen with Google Chrome in Kiosk mode, so no browser chrome or keyboard. The login/home page is different for every kiosk. Error pages are static assets, so I'll have to do this with Javascript. If there is an error I want to display a button that will let the user get back to the home page. I can't just use a back button script b/c of the potential for multiple errors. I thought about using localstorage to store a reference to the home page, but the error pages are served from a different domain so they wont have access. Any ideas? Edit: This works in Firefox onClick="window.home();" If I set the browser's home page to that particular kiosk. But apparently isn't supported in Chrome. Is there any way to store some kind of variable that any domain can access on a per browser/kiosk basis.
