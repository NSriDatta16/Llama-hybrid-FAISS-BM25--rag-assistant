What precisely does it mean to borrow information?

I often people them talk about information borrowing or information sharing in Bayesian hierarchical models. I can't seem to get a straight answer about what this actually means and if it is unique to Bayesian hierarchical models. I sort of get the idea: some levels in your hierarchy share a common parameter. I have no idea how this translates to "information borrowing" though. Is "information borrowing"/ "information sharing" a buzz word people like to throw out? Is there an example with closed form posteriors that illustrates this sharing phenomenon? Is this unique to a Bayesian analysis? Generally, when I see examples of "information borrowing" they are just mixed models. Maybe I learned this models in an old fashioned way, but I don't see any sharing. I am not interested in starting a philosophical debate about methods. I am just curious about the use of this term.
