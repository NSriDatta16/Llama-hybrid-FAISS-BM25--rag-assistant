Algorithms to generate a rating system based on history

I am a beginner in data science. I have a data set of drivers that has the following attributes available- Time stamp Speed Acceleration GPS co-ordinates I need to build a driver rating system to rate drivers on a scale of 1-100 on parameter of speeding. The data set has the data from many drivers and also their past data. Which is the best algorithm that I can use in this situation?
