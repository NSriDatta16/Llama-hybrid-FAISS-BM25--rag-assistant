Worked in a place where they normalized too much. They removed the 'state' column from a mailing address table. In place of a 2 byte state column they put an integer foreign key field linking to a state table. In summary: They replaced a 2 byte state column with a 4 byte column in the address table. Now every row takes 2 more bytes of storage. They added a state table with a 4 byte primary key column and a 2 byte state column. Takes up more space to store this table. The database keeps an btree index of the keys in the state table. Takes up more space. The sql to retrieve addresses is harder to write. The sql to retrieve addresses is slower than the original. Sure, this naively removes duplicated unchanging data. The result is that it uses more disk space, is harder to use, and is slower to use. You definitely can normalize too much.
