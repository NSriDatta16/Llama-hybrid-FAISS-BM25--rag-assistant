Input, output and text in one Mathematica cell?

I'd like to be able to mix text and computation. Something like this: blah blah blah ... blah blah ... The average mass is (m1 + m2 + m3)/3 = 23.4 g ... blah blah blah blah blah ... Where the "(m1... )/3" is the input, and the "23.4" is the output. Right now I only know how to show input in one cell, and the output in another cell below it. Is this possible? Update: I want to include these bits of computation in the midst of larger blocks of writing, so I'm not sure how to use a Print statement as Koantig suggested, because it seems I'd have to concatenate an entire paragraph/cell worth of strings and styles. thanks, Rob
