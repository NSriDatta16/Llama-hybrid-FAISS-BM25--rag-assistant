The URL length limit includes all parts of the URL, including host, user info, path, fragment and query parameters. The limit is applied to any request (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE and so on). It's an actual WinInet limitation, not an IE address bar limitation, so it applies to AJAX requests as well. If you need to send long data to the server, you should consider doing a POST with the data in the body of the request.
