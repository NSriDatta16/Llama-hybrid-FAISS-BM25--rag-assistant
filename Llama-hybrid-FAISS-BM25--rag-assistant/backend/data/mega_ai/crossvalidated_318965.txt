Why will the validation set error underestimate the generalisation error?

In my book about machine learning the concept of a validation set is introduced. It's a subset of the training set that is used to "train" the hyperparameters. More specifically, the validation set is used to estimate the generalisation error during or after training, allowing the hyperparameters to be updated accordingly. The book states that since the validation set is used to train the hyperparameters, the validation set will underestimate the generalisation error. Question: Why? I understand that this is true most of the time, but why would it be true in general? Thanks in advance!
