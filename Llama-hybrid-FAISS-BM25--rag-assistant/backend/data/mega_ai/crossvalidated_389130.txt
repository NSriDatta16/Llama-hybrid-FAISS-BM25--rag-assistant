Equivalent Kernel - Bishop Chapter 3

I've been struggling to understand the Equivalent Kernel in Bishop's Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning book. Can somebody explain the following Figure (3.10) from chapter 3.3.3? (image taken from online slides ) The caption reads: The equivalent kernel $k(x, x')$ for the Gaussian basis functions in Figure 3.1, shown as a plot of $x$ versus $x'$ , together with three slices through this matrix corresponding to three different values of $x$ . The data set used to generate this kernel comprised 200 values of $x$ equally spaced over the interval $(âˆ’1, 1)$ . I don't understand what he's trying to show in the plot, and I have no idea what the image in the right side is supposed to mean - I didn't see explanation about the right image at all...
