Generally speaking Kmeans algorithm can work for any dimensions just make sure that you when calculating the distance you take into account all the N features. You can still use euclidean distance as a similarity measure have a look at the n dimensional equation http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance . In order to visualize the result I would advise using Principle Component Analysis for dimensionality reduction the best results (accuracy) are from performing PCA after clustering thus you do not loose any information although you can pre process it with PCA to a smaller set dimension and cluster the data, that clustering will take less time to complete as they are less dimensions to process in the distance function. Also if you plan on pre processing it then not that much inofrmation is lost as most of it is in the first derived component. Their should be libraries in R to perfrom PCA. https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-patched/library/stats/html/princomp.html
