How does Python Scikit Learn handle linear separation problem in logistic regression?

There are already posts about warnings from R dealing with logistic regression and linear separation such as this one . I just wanna make sure if in Python Scikit Learn this problem is all solved by the L1/L2 regularization part in the optimization function. In other words, it's safe to say users will not get any infinite MLE estimates warnings from sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression ?
