Will the application notice? Probably not. Will it cause problems? Only when things go wrong. MyISAM is not a transactional storage engine. If you change the data in a MyISAM table while inside of a transaction, then have to roll back changes, the changes in that table won't be rolled back. It's been a while since I tried to break it horribly, but I'm willing to wager that MySQL won't even issue a warning when this happens. This will lead to data consistency issues. You should seriously consider external search software instead of a fulltext index, like ElasticSearch (integrates at the application level), or Sphinx (integrates at the MySQL level, though if you're using RDS instead of MySQL directly, I don't think you'll be able to use it).
