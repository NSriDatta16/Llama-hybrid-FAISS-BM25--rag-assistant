Work-around; Had the same problem with a document library - to work-around I dragged the standard control part onto the page and made it non-visible (the doclibrary plugin ) Make sure that in this hidden control's view the "Name (linked to document with edit menu)" field is in the view. That field will cause the creation of a ctx to support the edit drop-down.
