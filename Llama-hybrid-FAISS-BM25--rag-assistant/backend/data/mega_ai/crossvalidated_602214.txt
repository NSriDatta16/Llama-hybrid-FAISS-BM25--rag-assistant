Metropolis Hastings Algorithms: How to measure the performance of algorithms? (Multidimensional)

I am working on a project and I am trying to measure the performance and compare two MCMC algorithms. The one is Random-Walk MH and the second one is PCN. I thought of maybe comparing the mean absolute difference between the inferred and actual variable, which I did. Also, I am not sure whether the acceptance rate is a goo metric. Do you have any suggestions? Online I could only find for 1D comparison such as the Trace plots and ACF. Thank you!
