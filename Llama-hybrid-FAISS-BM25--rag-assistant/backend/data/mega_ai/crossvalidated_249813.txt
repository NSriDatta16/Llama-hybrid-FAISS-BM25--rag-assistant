To test for salesman within a group I would for each characteristic (# of cust, #of sales ,revenue) construct an ARIMA model that might include trends/level shifts,seasonal structure) while identifying potential anomalies. I would do this for each salesman in the group. I would then determine a common model by examining each of the models for similar structure. I would then estimate this model for each of the salesman separately and for the group as a whole. I would then construct an F test to test the hypothesis of a common set of parameters across salesman by pooling the error sos from each salesman vis-a-vis the error sos for the group composite series in the standard way. If you have K groups with say Nk salesman in each group , then I would use the suggested procedure at that level rather than at the salesman within a group example I presented in the first paragraph..
