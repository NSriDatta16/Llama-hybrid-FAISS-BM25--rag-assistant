Precision vs Recall acceptable Limits

I have few queries on Precision and Recall in Classification of machine learning. While I was reading, I found that high Precision will result low recall and vice versa. However if someone ask how much % of Precision is acceptable, answer could be? Is recall should/Can be greater than Precision? Or Precision should/can be greater than recall? To be consider Precision , should it be? 95% or if we consider recall should it be > 95%. In my results of test, I got 100% in recall, can recall or Precision be greater than 100?
