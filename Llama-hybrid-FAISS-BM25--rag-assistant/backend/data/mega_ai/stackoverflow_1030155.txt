for everyone's information, muhuk's solution fails under python2.6 as it raises an exception stating 'object.__ init __()' accepts no argument... edit: ho! apparently it might've been me misusing the the mixin... I didnt pay attention and declared it as the last parent and because of that the call to init ended up in the object parent rather than the next parent as it noramlly would with diamond diagram inheritance! so please disregard my comment :)
