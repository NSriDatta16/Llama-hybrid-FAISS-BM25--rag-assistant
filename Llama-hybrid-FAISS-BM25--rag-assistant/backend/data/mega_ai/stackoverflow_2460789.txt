Mark assembly App_licenses.dll with AssemblyVersion (FxCop CA1016 rule)

I'm trying to fulfil FxCop's rules in my web site. Since I use some Infragistics controls I have a licenses.licx file that turns into a "app_licenses.dll" assembly after publication. The problem is that this app_licenses.dll assembly does not comply with rule CA1016 (MarkAssembliesWithAssemblyVersion), and I should add an AssemblyVersion attribute to 'App_Licenses.dll'. I found I can add an AssemblyInfo file to my web site and then reference it from the web.config file as following: AssemblyInfo.cs contains: using System; using System.Reflection; using System.Runtime.InteropServices; using System.Resources; [assembly: AssemblyVersion("1.0.0.0")] [assembly: AssemblyFileVersion("1.0.0.0")] [assembly: NeutralResourcesLanguageAttribute("es-ES")] NeutralResourcesLanguageAttribute worked for another auto-generated dll in the web site (app_GlobalResources.dll) for another FxCop rule, but app_licenses.dll seems to ignore the assembly info and still pops up the same CA1016 error. Any help would be much appreciated.
