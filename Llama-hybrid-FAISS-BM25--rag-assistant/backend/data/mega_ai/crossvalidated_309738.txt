What are the possible reasons why Knn works much better than SVM?

So, I have my training data and my test data and the problem is that using KNN it works very good (in fact works almost perfectly) but using SVM or some CART Models works very bad. So, I'd like to know some possible reasons why this is happening. I think that the code that I'm using it is well implemented. This is a problem of classification for more than $2$ classes.
