If you look up caseInsensitiveCompare: in the docs you'll see that it returns an NSComparisonResult rather than a BOOL. Look that up in the docs and you'll see that you probably want it to be NSOrderedSame. So if ([myString1 caseInsensitiveCompare:myString2] == NSOrderedSame) should do the trick. Or just compare the lowercase strings like Robert suggested.
