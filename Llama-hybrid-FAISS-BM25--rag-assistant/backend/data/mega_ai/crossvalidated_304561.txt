Are weights updated differently in a regression network vs. a classification network?

Are the weight of a neural network updated differently due to back propagation for a classification network vs. a regression network, if so how?.. My concern comes due to the both network uses different cost function, hence the update must be different as well. I am under the intuition that log regression often are used for classification, and linear regression is used for normal neural network for regression problems.. Hence must the update of the weight also be different.. If the statement is correct? how does one in a classification process update the weights differently?..
