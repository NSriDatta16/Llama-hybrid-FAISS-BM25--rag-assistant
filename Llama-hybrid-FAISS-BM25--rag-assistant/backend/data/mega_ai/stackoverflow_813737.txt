Profiling u-Boot/Kernel boot sequence

I am profiling the booting process of power PC board, what is the simplest way to profile the booting sequence ? My first idea is to modify the u-boot/kernel code add printf/printk (using realtime device as reference) and print them on the console. However just printing them on the console may affect the time. Any thoughts? Regards, Robert.
