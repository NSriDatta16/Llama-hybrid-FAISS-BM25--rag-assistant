The eigendecomposition of a correlation matrix is one way to perform PCA. This kind of PCA carries the assumption that each variable contributes exactly one unit of variance to the total variance of the data. So if there are $p$ variables, the eigenvalues will apportion $p$ total units of variance of the data. Total variance is thus an abstract concept, unrelated to the variances of the observed variables, unless they all happen to be standardized. (Note: standardization does not affect the eigenvalues here.) By contrast, the eigendecomposition of a covariance matrix ($\mathbf{\Sigma}$) is another way to perform PCA. The assumption here is that each variable contributes its actual variance (i.e. $s^{2}$) to total variance, and the eigenvalues of such a PCA apportion $\text{trace}(\mathbf{\Sigma})$ total units of variance. Standardization and other transformations of the data will affect the eigenvalues here.
