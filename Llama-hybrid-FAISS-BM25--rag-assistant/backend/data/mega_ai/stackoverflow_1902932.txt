Firefox Tab Tearing kills my NPPlugin

I have an NPAPI Plugin that runs in Firefox, but any time that the tab is "torn off" (by dragging the tab into space so a new window is formed), the plugin is destroyed and recreated. The problem is that the plugin needs to be initialized with information from an Ajax call, and I cannot find any way in Javascript to detect this, so the plugin is not getting the necessary initialization information. So, any ideas as to how to detect this event and/or make the plugin not be destroyed/recreated when the tab is torn off?
