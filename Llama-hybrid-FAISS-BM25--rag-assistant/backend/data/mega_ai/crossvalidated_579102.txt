You could model this with probit or logistic regression. Then you model the probability $$\mathbb{P}(Y_i = y) = \begin{cases} p & \qquad \text{if $y=1$}\\ 1-p & \qquad \text{if $y=0$} \end{cases}$$ This $p = \mathbb{P}(Y_i = 1)$ is equivalent to the probability $\mathbb{P}(T_i . That is, the probability of observing $Y_i = 1$ is equal to the cumulative distribution function of $T_i$ in the point $X_i$ . When $T_i$ is normal distributed then you have a probit model. When $T_i$ follows a logistic distribution then you have a logistic model. (Personally I feel that a probit model is more natural here, and logistic regression is more appropriate in classification problems)
