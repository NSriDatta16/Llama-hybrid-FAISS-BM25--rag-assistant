Can we use pca for supervise classification?

My questions are: Can we use "pca feature selection" for supervised classification? What will happen to labels when we use dimension reduction? If I understand it right when we use pca for feature extraction after do it we have old features but in new dimension then can we say these are the new features or mixed features? Is "feature extraction" different with "feature selection" in pca? I mean they are two things to do with different ways. How can select effective features with pca? There is a lots of references on the internet but I couldn't find any MATLAB sample code or video (on youtube) about pca feature selection, I mean not in theory, I'm looking for sample code in any language(Paython, Matlab,etc).
