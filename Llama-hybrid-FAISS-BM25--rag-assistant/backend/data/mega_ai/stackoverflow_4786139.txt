You have a few options, if I understand correctly: 1) When scroll stops, just change the text size of the current TextView, don't use two... 2) Keep both TextViews (in ScrollViews), but keep one View.GONE at all times. Scroll on one, then when you want to switch, you can call scrollTo() on the inactive one, and switch it to View.VISIBLE (and the inactive one is GONE). 3) Similar to the above, but use 2 TextViews per paragraph, it should prevent you from doing a scrollTo() which could get tricky with different size fonts.
