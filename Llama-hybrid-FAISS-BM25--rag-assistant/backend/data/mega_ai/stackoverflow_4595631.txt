Here is another idea that will save lots of trouble although it's not very elegant. Have the page method return two strings (i.e. array with two string items) - the first string will be the ID of image element and the second will be the desired source. Then the callback function will become: function (response) { document.getElementById(response[0]).src = response[1]; }
