If it is a one shot kind of deal, you could just format the excel file a little, import that into and access database and then push that back to any database you want. If you must do it in .net, you can open a excel file through ODBC using SQL...It is a little fragile, but I've used it with success in the past. Use something like this for a connection string in excel : Provider=Microsoft.Jet.OLEDB.4.0;Data Source=C:\MyExcel.xls;Extended Properties="Excel 8.0;HDR=Yes;IMEX=1"; The worksheet and named section are the table names..HDR=Yes mean that the first row contains the name of the fields. I'll admit it is a little odd. :)
