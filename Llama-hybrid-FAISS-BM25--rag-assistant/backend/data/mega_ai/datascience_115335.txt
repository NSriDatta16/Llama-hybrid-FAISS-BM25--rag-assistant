Is your data very sparse? Usually, the log function is very useful to reduce data variability. On the other hand, do you apply an inverted log to check if the final result is correct? Very often, log results seem better because the data is easier to organize, but if we apply an inverted log to find the real value, the results might be wrong. The wrong result on raw data could be due to a wrong train/test split, potentially without randomness. I don't know what machines you are using, but generally speaking, machines depends on sensors that are not calibrated exactly the same and those calibration issues could explain some wrong results. Best practices suggest to learn on variations (i.e. +0.3 or -2.8) instead of raw values because you don't have some calibration biases. Have you tried this option? Example: Raw values: 32.5 35.3 32.2 25.6 Variations: 0. +3.2 -3.1 -6.6
