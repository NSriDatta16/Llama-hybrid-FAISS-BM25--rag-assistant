Logistic Regression Interaction Term

I am trying to get my head around interaction terms. Suppose if I fit a model and try to predict pass or fail for state exams. The independent terms are: rank of school, results in midterm and over GPA score. Would I be right to say I believe that there could be a interaction term between rank of school and GPA score? If what i am saying is true, how would I test that the new model with the interaction term was better than the old model?
