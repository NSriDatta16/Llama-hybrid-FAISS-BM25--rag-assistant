You can take a look at our Synopse SQLite3 Framework , which was just updated to version 1.11. It serves the data in pure JSON , ready to be used in any AJAX application. You can also easily create Services, more precisely Client-Server JSON RESTful Services . In this case, you can even not use SQLite3 for your data storage. This framework is pure Open Source, compiles/run/is tested for Delphi 6 up to XE, is Unicode ready for all versions of Delphi (it uses UTF-8 internally). By using this framework, you could be able to create easily also Delphi clients, using JSON data from the same server . There is no internal User session handling yet. Because there are several way of implementing them, and, since our framework is RESTful, it's therefore stateless: no session is needed. If you need it, I could easily add HTTP sessions using Cookies. What about the User authentication you are expecting?
