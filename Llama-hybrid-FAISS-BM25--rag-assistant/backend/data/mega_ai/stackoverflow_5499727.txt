I'm still pretty new to BDD and Specflow too. We've been using it to establish behaviour and code out the controllers, which in turn drive out the views. I don't have a code example in front of me, but I'll try to find something to post later. Cheers! edit - BTW, if you're looking for a good book on using Cucumber (it uses the same language as Specflow - Gherkin? I'm still getting all the pieces straight), I can highly recommend The RSpec Book from Pragmatic Programmers. The code is Ruby based, but there are some higher level chapters on project definition and running. Well worth the price.
