Does it make sense to use criteria from PCA to select the numbers of factors in a factor analysis?

Looking at both the practice of colleagues and also the practices instantiated in popular programs (e.g. SPSS, and commonly used syntax for SPSS ), it seems common to use criteria based on a PCA to select the number of factors in a factor analysis. I am not just talking here about the Kaiser-Guttman rule and scree plots but also better-regarded methods such parallel analysis, and the MAP test. Would it not make more sense to conduct parallel analysis and the MAP test on factors, if the goal is to select the number of factors? Is this a major problem, or is it basically OK to use the criteria from PCA as part of a guide to selecting the number of factors?
