What version of xdebug are you using? php --ri xdebug will tell you that version (amongst everything else) PHP_CodeCoverage 1.0.2 (which is used by PHPUnit to collect code coverage information) has this bit of source code if (version_compare(phpversion('xdebug'), '2.2.0-dev', '>=') && !ini_get('xdebug.coverage_enable')) { die("You need to set xdebug.coverage_enable=On in your php.ini.\n"); } Based on this logic you would get this error only if you have installed xdebug 2.2.0-dev. Which, in my opinion should not be used before it is stable. xdebug 2.1.0 is stable and works well enough. If you however are not running 2.2.0-dev, then this starts to look like a bug, and you need to give more information about what versions of everything relevant you are using. Update - it looks like this was an actual bug in PHP_CodeCoverage that was fixed in 1.0.2 3 days ago. You probably had an older version. Upgrade, and it should be fine now.
