I solved my problem with below query CREATE PROCEDURE uspGetSubSource ( @ORGID INT) AS DECLARE @RAOID INT SET @RAOID = (SELECT RAOID FROM tblOrganisation WHERE ORGID = @ORGID) IF @RAOID IS NOT NULL BEGIN SELECT tblOrganisation.ORGID, tblOrganisation.NAME as SUBSOURCENAME FROM tblOrganisation LEFT OUTER JOIN tblSubGroup ON tblOrganisation.SubGroupID = tblSubGroup.SubGroupID WHERE tblSubGroup.RAOID = @RAOID END Cheers!!
