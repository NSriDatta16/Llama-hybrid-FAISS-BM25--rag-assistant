Mediation analysis with 5 Independent variables in R

I am new to the mediation analysis and i am trying to find my way... So, I have the following dataset: X's : 5 independent variables (D, E, F, G, H), where H is the sum of the other 4 (probably not very wise to be in the analysis, and also the models produces an error whrn i include it, and so i left it out ), continuous M's : 1 mediator (B), continuous Y : 1 response (I), continuous Z : 1 covariate (not in the output yet), continuous I also have some missing values for some of them (around 6-7%). So, i have first to use MICE to input and then run the mediation analysis. But, as i found out it is not straightforward to combine them, so i used this example here . They use the lavaan package in R. The output i got, is the following : Can somebody please help me interpret this output here ? I am very confused with the several predictors in the model and i don't know how to assess mediation or not...And even if it is appropriate to add all these variables in a model like this.. And finally, if you know something more elegant about the combination of MICE and mediation analysis... Thanks
