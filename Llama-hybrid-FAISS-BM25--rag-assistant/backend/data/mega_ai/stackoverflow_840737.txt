Using an enum is more restrictive, which means that it is less likely that the user will try to use your factory with an unsupported type. I find that it's good to do everything possible when defining an API to discourage usage patterns that will cause exceptions to be thrown. Allowing "Type" in this case opens up millions of ways to call your function that will result in: throw new Exception("Invalid type"); Using an enum would eliminate this. The only way an enum would throw would be if the user did something noticably wrong.
