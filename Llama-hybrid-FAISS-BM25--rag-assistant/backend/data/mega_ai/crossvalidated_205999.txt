How to visualize data averaged over ranks?

I have data from twelve experiments, with seven days and five animals on each. Based on the seven day mean of each animal's data, it is a assigned a rank from 1 to 5. I would like to combine the data from all experiments, so I could visualize the time progression of the rank 1 data, rank 2 data, etc. It's easy to just take the mean of the data for all animals from each rank. The problem is that it might be misleading - even if the data were random, a winner will still emerge and taking the mean of all winners will 'smooth' the curve so to speak, resulting in a specious appearance of a hierarchy. Is there a way to combine such data without misleading, and without simply overlaying the plots?
