Simple answer to this in my opinion is the fact that you cannot use that column as an index key, if you require any indexing you are basically forced to use fulltext... this is with regards to using a varchar(max) column. In any case 'right-sizing' columns makes a lot of sense whenever you [may] want to apply any indexing; updating variable length columns may be a costly maneuver as these are not done in place and can/will cause some amount of fragmentation. All with regard to MS SQ-Server.
