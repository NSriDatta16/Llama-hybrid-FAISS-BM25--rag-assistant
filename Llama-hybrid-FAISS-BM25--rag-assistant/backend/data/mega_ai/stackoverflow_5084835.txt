The first toolset I would look to for solving such a task would be to try using Git + WebDAV on Apache. With authentication and access logs, that may provide you the information you're looking for. That failing, you may be in the position to write a custom Git server. As Git was designed to be decentralized, and clients can operate without ever talking to your chosen server, I believe the functionality for tracking retrievals isn't part of the core.
