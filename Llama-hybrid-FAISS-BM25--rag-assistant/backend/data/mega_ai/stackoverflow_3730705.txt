Have the WWW server copy the file to the media server, and run a continuous process there that converts them, and then informs the web server somehow. Here's an example using a database for state communication: Web server receives upload Web server copies file to one of the media servers and creates a database entry with the state "NEW", and assigns it to the media server The media server in question notices the new entry while polling the database every 10 seconds or so The media server converts the video and updates the database entry to "PROCESSED" state Video is now visible on the website. The assignment could either be handled by handing the files over to the media servers in round-robin fashion, or you could even make them report their current workload so that the least busy server can be used. (Also you have SSD storage for videos? I want some of that...)
