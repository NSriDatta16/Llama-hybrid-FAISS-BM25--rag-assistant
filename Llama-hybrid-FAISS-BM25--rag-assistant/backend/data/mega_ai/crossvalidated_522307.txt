I've found a solution that I consider relatively acceptable, so I'll share it here. Isolate the chunk of data that needs to be smoothed (you don't want to touch the count of 0, 1, 2, etc. for instance as these are probably pretty accurate). Then replace each count $n_i$ by the average of the counts, say, $n_{i-2}, n_{i-1}, n_{i}, n_{i+1}, n_{i+2}$ . This has the property of spreading the bumps around \underline{while keeping constant the total count}. If you want to spread more (e.g. if the people answered only multiples of 10) then pick more neighbours of $n_i$ (e.g. the $9$ nearest neighbours instead of just $5$ ).
