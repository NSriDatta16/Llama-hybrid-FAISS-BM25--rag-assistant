To use persistent store or file for db storage? It depends on several things: data amount (if it's > 1 mb, better use filesystem and several files) security (if you need encryption, use persistent store) performance (persistent store will slowdown memory performance, but filesystem io will hit processor performance no metter how large file size is) framework limitation (ex. you can't open xml file > about 1.7 mb using kXML) See also: Blackberry - application settings save/load J2ME/Blackberry - how to read/write text file?
