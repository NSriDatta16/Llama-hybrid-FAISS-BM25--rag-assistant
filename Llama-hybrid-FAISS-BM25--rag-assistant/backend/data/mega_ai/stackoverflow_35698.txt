"Multi-agent computing" in simple terms

I've encountered the term "multi-agent computing" as of late, and I don't quite get what it is. I've read a book about it, but that didn't answer the fundamental question of what an agent was. Does someone out there have a pointer to some reference which is clear and concise and answers the question without a load of bullshit/marketing speak? I want to know if this is something I should familiarise myself, or whether it's some crap I can probably ignore, because I honestly can't tell.
