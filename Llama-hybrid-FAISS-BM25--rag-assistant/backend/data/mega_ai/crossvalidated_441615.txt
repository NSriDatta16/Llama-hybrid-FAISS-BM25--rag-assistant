Along w/ @RobertLong's comment, I think ID is what you want to be your random intercept as long as that variable has 85 values (corresponding to each of the 85 participants). Rater takes on two values, it seems, and this would not make sense as a random intercept to me, nor would it make sense to allow the effect of rater on the outcome to vary across individuals (lmer syntax for that would be lmer(score ~ X + age + (rater | ID) ). I think you probably want a model that has rater interacting with each of your predictors w/ a random intercept for ID: lmer(score ~ X*sex*rater + age*rater + (1 | ID)) . This model allows the effect of X on score to vary by sex and by rater and then allows the effect of age to vary by rater (parent or child). If you have missing data, I would suggest using an imputation procedure to recover it. I personally like Craig Enders' Blimp multilevel imputation software and the routines programmed into it, which are ideal for imputing interactions and random slopes, the latter of which you do not have. See http://www.appliedmissingdata.com/multilevel-imputation.html .
