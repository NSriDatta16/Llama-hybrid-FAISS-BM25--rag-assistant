Small correction to Colin's post: the CRAN package RDieHarder is an interface to DieHarder , the Diehard rewrite / extension / overhaul done by Robert G. Brown (who kindly lists me as a coauthor based on my RDieHarder wrappers) with recent contribution by David Bauer. Among other things, DieHarder includes the NIST battery of tests mentioned in Mark's post as well as some new ones. This is ongoing research and has been for a while. I gave a talk at useR! 2007 about RDieHarder which you can get from here .
