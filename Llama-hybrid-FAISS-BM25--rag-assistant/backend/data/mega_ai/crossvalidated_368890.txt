A discrete distribution with finite support can only have a finite number of possible realizations. For example, the distribution associated with a coin toss experiment is discrete with finite support as you can only observe one of two values: 'Heads' or 'Tails'. A discrete distribution with infinite support can have an infinite number of possible realizations. For example, the distribution associated with the number of customers who arrive at a bank between 9 am - 9:30 am is discrete with infinite support as you can potentially observe many values: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... Note: In the second paragraph, we ignore the reality of a finite population on Earth.
