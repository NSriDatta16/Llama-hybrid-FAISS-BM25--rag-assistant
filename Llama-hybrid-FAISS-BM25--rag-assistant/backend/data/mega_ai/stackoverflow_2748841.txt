You are probably experiencing a difference between the readability of the specifications of the two languages because they were written by different groups of people, and discuss languages which employ different object paradigms. The JavaScript specification was written by a committee after the language had evolved organically after several years. The C# specification was written by a small group of corporate engineers while the language was growing in a controlled manner. C# is class-centric OOP and JavaScript is prototype-centric. It is possible that if you are not as familiar with one as you are with the other, then some material may be difficult to understand at first, especially when it gets into implementation details. That doesn't necessarily indicate a problem with the clarity and readability of a specification.
