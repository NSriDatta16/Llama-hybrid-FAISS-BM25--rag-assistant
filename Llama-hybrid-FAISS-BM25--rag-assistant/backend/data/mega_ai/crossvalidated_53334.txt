Use Bayesian hierarchical model to predict new data points

I have a data set $(n_i,y_i),i=0,...,10$. I modeled it as a Bayesian hierarchical beta-binomial model. $y_i∼Binomial(n_i,p_i)$ and $p_i∼Beta(\alpha,\beta)$. I have used MCMC to estimate $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (use the median as the estimated value). Given a new $(n_j, y_j)$, I want to judge if it comes from the same model as the training set $(i=0,...,10)$, namely $p_j$ is significantly greater than $\theta$ (shrinkage $p_i$ from all group). How can I use the estimated $\alpha$ and $\beta$ to compute it?
