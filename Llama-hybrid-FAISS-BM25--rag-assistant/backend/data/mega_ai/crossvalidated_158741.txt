Your approach goes in the line of the popular histogram of gradients approach. See here and the corresponding Wikipedia entry. Now unless you have some already labelled data, training such a system is quite laborious. If possible, I would start by using some available implementation to experiment with, like the one offered by scikit-image . There are some other features, like Linear Binary Pattern , but they're not as powerful as HOG. See in the module corresponding of scikit-image for a list of features and their implementations. As for CNN, you should not need to extract any features. The system learns the features automatically. That is one of the nice properties of deep architectures. A huge number of papers show that these systems learn some edge oriented filters features (in the same line as the idea you are considering). Note that these features do not consider color. That may be an interesting feature for you to consider. Or extract the features for each of the color channels. Hope this helps.
