Publisher/Subscriber in LINQ?

Problem: IEnumerable feed = GetFeed(); var average1 = feed.MovingAverage(10); var average2 = feed.MovingAverage(20); var zipped = average1.Zip(average2, (x,y) => Tuple.Create(x,y)); When I iterate through "zipped", GetFeed().GetEnumerator() gets called twice and creates all sorts of synchronization issues. Is there a LINQ operator that can be used to broadcast values from single producer to multiple consumers? I know about Memoize, but in my case I can't predict buffer size to keep slow and fast consumers "happy". I am thinking about writing my own operator that would keep separate queues for each consumer, but wanted to check if there is an existing solution.
