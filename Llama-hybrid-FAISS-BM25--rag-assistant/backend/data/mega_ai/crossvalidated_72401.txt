Why odds ratios look strange on transformed variables Transformations change the metric of the variable. Odds ratios are the predicted difference in odds for a one unit increase on the IV holding all other IVs constant. The meaning of one unit will be very different after a square root transformation. For example, if you had a 1 to 100 raw scale, then after transformation, the difference between 16 and 25 on the raw scale would be the same as the difference between 4 and 5 on the square root transformed scale. Thus, it's not surprising that your odds ratios became a lot larger after square root transformation. If you want to examine the effect of the transformation in a scaling-neutral way, you could standardise your IVs (i.e., make them z-scores). Thus, you could compare the odds ratio of a z-score of the raw variable to a z-score of the transformed variable. This will allow you to isolate the effect of changing the relative distance between categories. Whether to transform non-normal predictors in logistic regression Normality of predictors is not an assumption of logistic regression, or linear regression for that matter. See @whuber's answer here for more details . That said, you may find one scaling of your IVs more predictive or interpretable. I'd use criteria like that to decide whether you want to transform a predictor variable.
