A way to answer your question (I want to be able to say if the shallow site is warmer than the deep one or not.) would be to work on the difference between the two time series SiteB - SiteA (A=deep, B= shallow). Both time series are stationary. So the means of the time series are not time-dependent. Both time series can be well represented by a simple AR(1) model. From your data, I found this ARMA model for the time series SiteB - SiteA: arima(dTMP_BmA, order = c(2,0,1)) Call: arima(x = dTMP_BmA, order = c(2, 0, 1)) Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 intercept 1.2600 -0.5131 -0.7269 0.7458 s.e. 0.1694 0.0973 0.1769 0.0553 sigma^2 estimated as 0.2353: log likelihood = -65.62, aic = 139.24 The plot of the autocorrelations of the residuals shows no anomaly. The "intercept" parameter (0.7458) is in fact the estimated mean of the time series siteB - SiteA, with a standard error of 0.0553. From this result, we can conclude that there is a significant difference between the mean of SiteB and the mean of SiteA.
