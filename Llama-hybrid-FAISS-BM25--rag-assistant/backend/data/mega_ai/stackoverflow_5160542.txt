Considering the method accepts a ProgressChangedEventHandler and a RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler , I'd wager you use delegates of these types and pass them to the method; then it will call them at the appropriate points. For example, the following methods match the signatures of these delegate types: ' Matches ProgressChangedEventHandler ' Sub OnProgressChanged(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As ProgressChangedEventArgs) ' Do something. ' End Sub ' Matches RunWorkerCompletedEventHandler ' Sub OnRunWorkerCompleted(ByVal sender As Object, ByVal e As RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs) ' Do someting. ' End Sub Given the above methods, you could pass them to ProgAnalysis like this: ProgAnalysis("fileName", _ AddressOf OnProgressChanged, _ AddressOf OnRunWorkerCompleted)
