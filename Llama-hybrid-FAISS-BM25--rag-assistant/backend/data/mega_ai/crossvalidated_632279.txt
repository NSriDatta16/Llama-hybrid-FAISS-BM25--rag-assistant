Is it fair to say: "All Time Series data have some autocorrelation”? NO Here is an algorithm to produce a time series that lacks autocorrelation. At $t=1$ , draw a point from a distribution, such as x1 in R or x1 = np.random.normal(0, 1, 1) in Python. Do it again at $t=2$ . Do it again at $t=3$ . …and so on for the duration of the time series… If you follow this algorithm, you wind up with independent draws from the distribution across the time periods, so zero autocorrelation. However, this is still a time series.
