A few points: In linear models with an identity link function, both linear mixed models and GEEs give coefficients that have the same interpretation. Namely, an interpretation for groups of subjects. Say for example that you want to interpret the coefficient for the sex covariate. Then, the interpretation of this coefficient is the difference in the average outcome between the group of males and the group of females. In models with a nonlinear link function there is a difference between the interpretation of the coefficients from the two approaches. In this case, mixed models give coefficients with a subject-specific interpretation. Continuing on the same example as above, and say for a dichotomous outcome for which you have fitted a mixed effects logistic regression, the interpretation of the coefficients for sex is the difference in the log odds if a particular subject changed sex. On the contrary, the GEEs will give you the difference in the log odds between the groups of males and females (as in the linear case). Because of this more strange interpretation with nonlinear link function, mixed models have been criticized that are less useful for non-normal data. Nonetheless, there are approaches to solve this issue in mixed models. One recent one is implemented in the marginal_coefs() function of the GLMMadaptive package in R. Check also this answer .
