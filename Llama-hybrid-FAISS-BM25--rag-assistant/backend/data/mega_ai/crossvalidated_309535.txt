Interpreting the sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ as the posterior distribution of $\mu$

Suppose we wanted to do inference on the mean $\mu$ of some population for which the variance is known. The conventional frequentist approach is as follows. Given a random sample $X_1, \dots, X_n$ with $\text{E}(X_i) = \mu$ and $\text{Var}(X_i) = \sigma^2$, the CLT tells us that $$\frac{\bar{X} - \mu}{\sigma / \sqrt{n}}$$ converges in distribution to a standard normal. We can then use this fact to construct confidence intervals or compute p-values using actual data $x_1, \dots, x_n$ collected from the population, provided $n$ is large enough. Here's my question: Is there a Bayesian reformulation of this problem that allows us to essentially treat the above sampling distribution of $\bar{X}$ as a posterior distribution on $\mu$? In other words, is there a case in which $$ \mu \sim N(\bar{x}, \sigma^2/n) $$ is actually a valid conclusion?
