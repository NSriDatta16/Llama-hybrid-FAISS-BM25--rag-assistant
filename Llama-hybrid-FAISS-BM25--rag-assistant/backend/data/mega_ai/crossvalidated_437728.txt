You need a method to estimate the conditional distribution $p(y|x)$ . For example, bayesian interpretation of linear regression can calculate $p(y=3|x),p(y=-2|x)$ etc. Note that this is not a probability but a density value if $y$ is continuous. In general, Bayesian perspectives reinterpret most ML methods and calculate $p(y|x)$ . Similarly, some methods such as logistic regression or softmax layer in a neural net aim to estimate $p(y|x)$ .
