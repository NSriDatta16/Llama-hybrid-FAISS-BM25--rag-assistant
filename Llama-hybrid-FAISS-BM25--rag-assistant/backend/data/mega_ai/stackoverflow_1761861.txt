Thanks for all ideas. They were really helpful. As far as I understand there is not a certain list of patterns like the Design Patterns when it comes to fixing bugs. Maybe after some point everybody has his own way. One of the approaches I use is, if the process looks complicated, to sit and try to see if I can do some re-factoring the code. This gives me a chance to refresh my mind on the code's behavior, to have better understanding and to make it maybe even more maintainable. Extract method is my favorite to have readable logical units. One of my favorite thing is, if a value of a property is changed in an unexpected way, I put a break-point on the setter of that property. I do not know if it is possible to do it with implicit property decelerations (bool myProperty {get; set;}). Maybe it would be better to start with having a BUG catalog showing all the types of bugs categorized with descriptions. thanks, burak ozdogan
