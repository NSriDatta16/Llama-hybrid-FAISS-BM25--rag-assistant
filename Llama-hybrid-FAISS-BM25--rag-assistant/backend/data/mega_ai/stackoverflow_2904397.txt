Peganza Pascal Analyzer can do the work. I haven't worked with it much, but a former dev here wrote a system that uses PAL to do the analysis, then dumped the results into a database, and then there's a browser app that lets you enter a unit name and it returns the list of units affected, whether they would need to be rebuilt if the unit changed, or if the interface changed. We use lots of BPLs so you can sometimes change a unit and you don't have to re-build other binaries that use your unit, unless the interface changed. This saves us lots of work (hundreds of BPLs and EXEs). Chris
