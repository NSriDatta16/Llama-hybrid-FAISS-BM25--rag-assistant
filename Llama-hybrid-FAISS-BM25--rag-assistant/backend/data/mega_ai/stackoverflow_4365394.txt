multi line dotted or dashed text-underline

Because CSS text underline only allows a solid line and its position is right at the bottom of strings, I'm using border-bottom plus a little padding to achieve dotted or dashed text underline. h2{border-bottom:1px dotted #999; padding-bottom:5px;} now, the problem is, when the heading (or paragraph, or whatever element) text takes 2 lines or more, the dotted underline simply does what every border does, which is stay on the bottom of the block element. If I use text-underline style, the underline stays with the text, but text-underline only supports a solid line, and as far as I know, no padding. So how do I display multi line texts with dotted or dashed underline ? Thanks
