Multinomial logistic regression power analysis

I am looking to conduct a power analysis for a multinomial logistic regression. Categorical outcome variable (3-response measures) and two continuous predictor variables (and an interaction of them both). I also have 7 covariates (gender, age, ethnicity, education, employment status, political orientation, household income). Can anyone advise me as to how I should run a power analysis? I have 151 participants (I'd imagine the study will be quite underpowered given the number of variables). Any help appreciated! Thanks!
