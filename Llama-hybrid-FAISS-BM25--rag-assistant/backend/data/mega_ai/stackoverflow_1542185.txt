Can you do all the copying in one AppDomain when you start up - an AppDomain which doesn't use any settings - and then start the real application in a new AppDomain ? Heck, as an alternative would it be possible to have separate processes for this? One bootstrap process would just make sure the right configuration is in place, then start up the real application. In both of these solutions you would do everything you need before you really use any settings, which should keep things simpler. Note that static initialization can be controlled to some extent by the presence or absence of a static constructor - see my article on beforefieldinit for more details. I wouldn't recommend using this to fix your current system though - it'll end up being quite fragile when it comes to maintaining the code.
