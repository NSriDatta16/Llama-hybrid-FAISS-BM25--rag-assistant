Let's look at one week, assuming 8 hours of business each day of the week. Then the number of customers on Monday will have a Poisson distribution with $\lambda_1 = 64$ customers. Similarly, Tuesday through Saturday will have $\lambda_i = 64$ per day. The sum of two Poisson random variables is Poisson, where the rates add. So the total customers Monday through Saturday will be Poisson with rate 384, and the total customers per week will be Poisson with rate $384+24 = 408.$ That is $T \sim \mathsf{Pois}(\lambda = 408)$ and $E(T) = Var(T) = 408.$ However, the average per hour will not be Poisson because the average can take non-integer values. The average per hour will be a non-Poisson random variable $A$ with $$E(A) = E\left(\frac{1}{56}T\right) = \frac{1}{56}E(T)= \frac{408}{56} = 7.2857,$$ $$Var(A) = Var\left(\frac{1}{56}T\right) = \frac{1}{56^2}Var(T)= \frac{408}{56^2}$$ The random variable $A,$ although not Poisson, is approximately normal, so you can find approximate probabilities that $A$ lies in various intervals. The problem for six months can be solved similarly. Addendum: Here is a simulation for the weekly version of the problem discussed above; the normal approximation will be better for 6 months. set.seed(2020) t = replicate(10^6, sum(rpois(6, 64)) +rpois(1,24)) mean(t); var(t) [1] 408.0416 # aprx E(T) = 408 [1] 408.9242 # aprx Var(T) = 408 a = t/56 mean(a); var(a) [1] 7.286458 [1] 0.1303967 hist(a, prob=T, br=20, col="skyblue2") curve(dnorm(x, mean(a), sd(a)), add=T, col="red")
