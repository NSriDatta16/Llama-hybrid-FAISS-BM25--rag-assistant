There are many methods that can be employed to increase your score on a Kaggle competition. Here are a few examples: Advanced classification techniques: Using advanced classification techniques such as weighted average ensemble, stacked generalization ensemble, and power average ensemble can help improve your model's performance. Data augmentation: Techniques such as random rotation, hue adjustments, saturation adjustments, contrast adjustments, brightness adjustments, cropping, and more can help improve your model's accuracy when dealing with image data. Text augmentation: When dealing with text data, techniques such as exchanging words with synonyms, noising in RNN, and translating to other languages and back can help augment your training data and improve your model's performance. External datasets: Using external datasets that contain variables that influence the predicate variable can help increase the performance of your model pre-processing. I have even seen that in some cases, especially at the beginning of the site, teams took advantage of finding data leakage. For example, identifying customer's id that may potentially be linked to temporal patterns and thus model's prediction This discussion may give you a fine summary of most of the techniques I mentioned above. I hope it helps.
