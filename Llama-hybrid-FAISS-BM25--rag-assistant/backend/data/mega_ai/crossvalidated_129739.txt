Skewed Distributions for Logistic Regression

I have been developing a logistic regression model based on retrospective data from a national trauma database of head injury in the UK. The key outcome is 30 day mortality (denoted as Outcome30 measure). Other measures across the whole database with published evidence of significant effect on outcome in previous studies include: Yeardecimal - Date of procedure = 1994.0-2013.99 inctoCran - Time from head injury to craniotomy in minutes = 0-2880 (After 2880 minutes is defined as a separate diagnosis) ISS - Injury Severity Score = 1-75 Age - Age of patient = 16.0-101.5 GCS - Glasgow Coma Scale = 3-15 Sex - Gender of patient = Male or Female rcteyemi - Pupil reactivity (1 = neither, 2 = one, 3 = both) neuroFirst2 - Location of admission (Neurosurgical unit or not) Other - other traums (0 - No, 1 - Yes) othopYN - Other operation required LOS - Length of stay in days LOSCC - Length of stay in critical care in days When I conduct univariate analysis of the variables, I have conducted a logistic regression for each continuous variable. I am unable to model Yeardecimal however, with the following result: > rcs.ASDH However, the restricted cubic spline works: > rcs.ASDH > rcs.ASDH Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = Survive ~ rcs(Yeardecimal), data = ASDH_Paper1.1) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim.

I am nervous about using a mode complicated model if I am unable to model with a simpler approach. I am currently using restricted cubic splines to model Age, ISS and Yeardecimal. Would anyone recommend any alternative approach?
