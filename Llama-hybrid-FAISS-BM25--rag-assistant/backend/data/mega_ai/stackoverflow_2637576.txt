I just came up with this, it seems to work in all modern browsers, I just tested it then on (IE8/compatibility, Chrome, Safari, Moz) HTML CSS #my_image{ background-image:url('images/my_image.png'); width:100px; height:100px;} Pro's: image alt text is best-practice for accessibility/seo no extra HTML markup, and the css is pretty minimal too gets around the css on/images off issue where "text-indent" techniques still hide text for low bandwidth users The biggest disadvantage that I can think of is the css off/images on situation, because you'll only send a transparent gif. It might be possible to write a little javascript to help out with this, replacing all the image sources with their background-image css properties. But this would only work if the browsers still attaches css properties to elements and then ignores them. I don't know if this is the case or not, I'll have to test it out. You'd also want to develop a javascript-based test to see if css is being applied to the page (maybe check the position of some test element). btw, I'd like to know, who uses images without stylesheets? some kind of mobile phone or something? edit: Based on comment below... inline styles hrm... maybe I should just make a php helper function like to generate some code like this: HTML my text then just attach some CSS in the stylesheet #image_id{width:*image width*;height:*image height*} .alt_text{position:absolute;top:0px;left:0px} .image{display:block;background-position:left top} .image p{position:absolute;left:-9999em} it's an older technique that I'm using, not sure where I found it though. It works with CSS on/images off, CSS off/images on, CSS on/images on. If a user with CSS off/images off visits, they'll see doubled up text. If a search engine spider visits, they'll see alt text and regular text, an intelligent spider could easily identify this for what it is, an innocent image replacement technique. So, this technique is worst for screen readers, since alt text is read, but these users should be able to skip to the next paragraph, which is why I stuck around "my text". Everyone else with both CSS and images turned off is some kind of bot, right?
