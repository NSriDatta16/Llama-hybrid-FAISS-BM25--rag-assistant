What this is telling you is that the relationship between your predictor and outcome is exponential (or at least is more close to exponential than it is linear). I find this most easy to explain with an example. In epidemiology, dose-response curves describe the likelihood of an effect based upon the dose of a chemical (or bacteria, or whatever) that an organism ingests. Say if we gave a mouse some poison, we could measure what dose of poison it takes to start killing more mice. (See picture). This relationship is usually similar to the horrible picture I just drew. If you modeled this relationship linearly, it would be impossible to draw a logistic regression curve that makes sense. Furthermore, it is not a coincidence that the t-test had the same p-value; they are identical tests with regard to the null. The difference is that the logistic regression can tell you the probability of your outcome given a level of your predictor, whereas a t-test cannot.
