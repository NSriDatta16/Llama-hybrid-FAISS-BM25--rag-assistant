Forecast 5-7 Day Sales

I have daily sales data between 2013-02-18 to 2017-02-12 that has only 4 days of data missing (all the Xmases on the 25th of each year). These holidays have a sale volume of zero. My purpose is to understand how to staff my store for the upcoming week by short-term predicting my sales for the next 5-7 days worth of data. I start by setting up this data as a time series: ts and then an initial analysis through a decomposition: This seems to show I have a declining sales trend, but there is some seasonality, if I'm not mistaken. So, to start my forecast implementation, I fit an arima model for the first two years worth of data by doing: #Updated to use Chris Haug's suggestion of the window function wts This model doesn't seem right to me, because it does not include any seasonality. I know I have enough data. Rob Hyndman's blog said to try using ets which also showed no seasonality. What am I not understanding about this data series or the forecasting methodology? UPDATE 07-31-2017 At @ChrisHaug 's suggestion, I leveraged a tbats model for my data. # forecast using tbats y Particular characteristics of this model that seem pertinent to me are seasonal parameters (which correspond), though I'm not sure how to interpret the F-terms. The ARMA model is a surprise to me as I would've atleast expected AR of 1 or higher. TBATS(1, {0,0}, 0.997, { , }) ... ... Sigma: 2748.952 AIC: 16490.93 ## ignore, as next line is reference interpretation for myself follows # TBATS({box-cox param}, {ARMA(p,q)}, {damping}, ) Additionally, I've added the auto-correlation plots for the first 365 days of data. I see high correlation on the 7th lag which seems to be expressed by weekly seasonality. I'm continuing to read through Dr. Hyndman's paper but I'm open to more ideas on tuning this model.
