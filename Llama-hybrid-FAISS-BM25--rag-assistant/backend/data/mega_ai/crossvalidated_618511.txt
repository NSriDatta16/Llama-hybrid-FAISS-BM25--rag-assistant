Asymptotic distribution of $n^r \frac{U_{(1)}}{U_{(n)}}$: figuring possible $r>0$

Consider the i.i.d. sample $U_1, U_2 \cdots, U_n$ from the uniform distribution $U(0, 1)$ . I should find a possible values of $r>0$ to have an asymptotic distribution of $$ n^r \frac{U_{(1)}}{U_{(n)}}$$ It is possible to get through with its CDF, and I know how to get it from the joint PDF of order statistics: the CDF of $U_{(1)}/U_{(n)}$ is obtained by $$ F_{U_{(1)}/U_{(n)}} (x) = 1-(1-x)^{n-1}, \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ 0 However, what I indeed want it from here is the new approach. Because ths calculation of CDF is a bit tedious and tells nothing about the hidden meaning, I tried some different methods. It is proven that $$ (nU_{(1)}, n(1-U_{(n)}))^T \overset{d}{\to} (Y_1, Y_2)^T$$ where $Y_1$ and $Y_2$ are independent standard exponential distribution, i.e., $Exp(1)$ . Also for a continuous function $g$ , $$ X_n \overset{d}{\to} X \implies g(X_n)\overset{d}{\to} g(X) $$ and hence tried to apply $g(x, y)=x/y$ but did not go well. Is this the right method ? Are there other elegant methods?
