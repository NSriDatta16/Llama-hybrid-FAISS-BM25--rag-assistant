Optimal Shrinkage with g-prior: estimate alpha to minimize MSE

In one of the slides from my class related to bayesian linear regression, I have the following scenario. Under g-prior, the shrinkage estimator induced by the prior is $$\hat{\beta_{\alpha}} = \alpha\hat{\beta}$$ now it states that the value of $\alpha$ that minimizes the mean squared error (conditioned on $\beta$ and $\sigma^2$) for this estimator is $$\alpha^* = \frac{1}{\frac{\sigma^2tr((X'X)^{-1})}{\beta'\beta}+1}$$ It also says that the proof uses the result: if $Z$ is a random vector with mean $\mu$ and covariance $\Sigma$ then with matrix $\Delta$ $$E[Z'\Delta Z] = tr(\Delta\Sigma) + \mu'\Delta\mu$$ Could anyone help deriving this $\alpha^*$? I am approaching by trying to differentiate $E[\| Y - X\hat{\beta_{\alpha}}\|^2 | \beta, \sigma^2]$ not really going anywhere.
