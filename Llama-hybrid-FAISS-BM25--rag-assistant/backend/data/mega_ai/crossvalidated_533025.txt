dimensionality reduction for specific character data (not a text)

I am not an expert in this field, so my question may be stupid, so I apologize in advance. I'm looking for a way to reduce the dimension for my data, it can be PCA or something else, the main thing is that it works, and it is important that it be possible to predict new data here is the code to generate data similar to mine set.seed(123) m "," This is how my data looks like head(m) [,1] [,2] [1,] "O[19] 99" "G[10]>164 & N[17]==103" [3,] "L[15] 155 & F[2]>69" [4,] "M[18]>91 & Y[6]>41 & O[16] 165 & H[19] I will be glad for any help
