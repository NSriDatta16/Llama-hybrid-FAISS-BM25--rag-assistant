PHP sessions not working in server

I am designing a website in php.After completing it i uploaded the things in server. The page was working fine in localhost. But after uploading, the page is not even loading. At the top of every page i included a page called startsession.php. the contents of this page is as follows: session_start(); header("Pragma: no-cache"); header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); header("Expires: Sat, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); If I remove the session_start, it is working fine. The details of error is as follows: Page in which Error Occured---Unknown Line no in which error occured---0 Details Of the Error---Unknown(): open(/tmp/sess_723d94fdc8ae3569b1a641fd8799ece9, O_RDWR) failed: No such file or directory (2) Error Code---2. Please help me
