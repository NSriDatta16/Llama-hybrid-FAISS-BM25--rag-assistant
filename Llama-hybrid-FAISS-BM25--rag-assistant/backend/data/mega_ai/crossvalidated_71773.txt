Maybe I misunderstood your question, but I think you want Dynamic time warping (DTW). DTW allows you to match similar or equivalent segments in time series that have different sampling rate. Therefore, DTW is the preferred alternative to good old euclidean distance. The following image shows you the intuition behind how DTW works. You can see it is extremely flexible and fortunately and there are really fast implementations available.
