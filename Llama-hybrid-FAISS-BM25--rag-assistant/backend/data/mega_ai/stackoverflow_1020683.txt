This is probably what you want: http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_KDE My experience: I like xmonad but wanted to live in the magical land of gnome I followed http://haskell.org/haskellwiki/Xmonad/Using_xmonad_in_Gnome which just worked. IIRC all I need to do (on ubuntu) was to *install xmonad *create .gnomerc *put WINDOW_MANAGER=xmonad *put import XMonad.Config.Gnome in my .xmonad I get all the magic of gnome in a tiling organized way
