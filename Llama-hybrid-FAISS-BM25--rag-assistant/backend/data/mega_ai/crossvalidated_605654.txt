History of the quote Probably the quote is not originally by Thomas Cover. It occurred in a textbook from 1994 (and later editions) from Simon Haykin ( Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Foundation ) in section 5.2 Cover's theorem on the separability of patterns. Haykin used the typesetting of a quote, but was more like paraphrasing: The underlying justification is found in Coverâ€™s theorem on the separability of patterns, which, in qualitative terms, may be stated as follows (Cover, 1965): A complex pattern-classification problem, cast in a high-dimensional space nonlinearly, is more likely to be linearly separable than in a low-dimensional space, provided that the space is not densely populated It may have been copied from there into other works. It is amazing that at some point it got changed into an actual quote and many articles simply copy it as being a quote. This proves once again that many people are actually not checking their original sources and are just copying others. Relationship with Cover's article It seems to be a bit unclear what Cover's theorem exactly is. The first theorem in the paper, which Cover calls the Function-Counting Theorem is about linear separability of points n points in d-dimensional space. In section III of the paper extensions are made to non-linear separability by viewing points in m-dimensional space being mapped to d-dimensional space. The particular quote might refer to that section of the paper and equation 19 In general, for $r$ th-order polynomial separating surfaces, the number $L_m(r)$ of separable truth functions of $m$ variables is bounded above by $$L_m(r) \leq C\left(2m ,{m+r \choose m} \right)$$ So the more $m$ variables (which means casting into a higher dimensional space), the easier it becomes to separate the points.
