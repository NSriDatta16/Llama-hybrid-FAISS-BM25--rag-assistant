XGBoost multivariate time series 3 periods prediction

I've read a lot about using xgboost to forecast time series, but I feel like I've completly lost my mind and can't understand something very basic. Would like just a confirmation if my reasoning is correct. I've got time series data to predict Sales (Y) monthly and to do so I want to use variables like: number of work days inflation Number of orders So data looks like this: I need to predict for September, 9 month. I don't have HICP, Orders etc. for September so I have to lag these features, right? So I will be using HICP and number of orders from previous month and dataframe would look like this: After I have df like this I train my model on all data without last row and I use last row as an input to prediction. Let's say I get 7000 as prediction for September. Now if I want to predict 2 periods forward, can I move my input variables 2 months back and use number of Orders from previous month to make prediction on October? After I got prediction for September, I can append it to the data and use it as an input to the model, shift data variables (HICP and orders) once again so it will be -2, train it again with prediction from September and make prediction on next period? My dataframe now looks like that and again last row will be an input to prediction. Is that correct approach and I'm doing everything alright? I know asking this might seem foolish, but I feel like everyone focus on evaluating the data with past variables and never really spend much time on preparing real forecasts.
