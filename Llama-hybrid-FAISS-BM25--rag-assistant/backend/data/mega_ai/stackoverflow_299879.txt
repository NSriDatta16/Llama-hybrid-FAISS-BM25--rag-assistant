Agile - User Story Definitions

I'm writing a small app for my friend's business, and thought I'd take the opportunity to brush up on some Agile Project Management training I did at the start of the year. I (and I think, my current organisation!) have always struggled with gathering requirements in the form of User Stories, which take the form: As a [User Type] I want [feature] so that [some benefit] I'm always tempted to miss out the beginning and end, and just leave the feature - but this then just becomes requirements gathering the old way! But I don't want to just make it fit, so that I can say 'I'm doing Agile'.... for example, if I know that the user is to be presented with a list of items, then the reason is self-evident, is it not? e.g. As a [Store Manager] I want [to see a list of Stock Items] so that ... ? Is it normal practice to leave out the [so that] clause?
