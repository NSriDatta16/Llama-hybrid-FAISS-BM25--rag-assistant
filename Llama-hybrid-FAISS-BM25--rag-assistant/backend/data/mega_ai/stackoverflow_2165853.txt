Set cookies to already voted users and disallow to vote for some time. Beside cookies protection add ip address protection. Single ip address can vote only one time per some period of time. Good alternative for ip protection is protection by combined scheme (ip+user_agent+...). Ask users to enter captcha when they're doing actions too fast.
