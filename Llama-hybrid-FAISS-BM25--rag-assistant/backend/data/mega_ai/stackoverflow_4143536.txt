Page displays random symbols instead of error message on Firefox

Randomly, on a few projects, some pages display random symbols instead of an error message. Like this one : �������� I�%&/m�{J�J��t�� $@�����iG#)�*��eVe]f@�흼 ��{���{��;�N'���?\fdl��J�ɞ!���?~|?"��Ey�')=��y6����h�����Ųi��- �ez����7i޴i�L���,�4�̧i���Ίe��Ͼ|uz����:�}� ��U{���������΋��~�ȗu.-�����l>F'�����Y�l��$k�tF���� ��{�� ��[����'U���|6J�lR��b6��юG�k�^,ӏ��߿�} |N��>�Ey�裟�k ��!z���Ѳ�Y)5��G��A�8$D��Ѥ̦oI��]�P �"�/��v[����W�~���m`N�rvk���Mqz3���wV� It happens quite randomly, and seems to be caused by different factors. Here, it's on a file upload. We use SharpZipLib on this page, but the codepath shouldn't use it. Does anyone knows why this happens, and how to prevent it ? EDIT : it only happens on Firefox. IE(8) displays the error message correctly. EDIT 2 : it seems to happen quite randomly, only on some pages/sites. The same page on another IIS site works well. It seems to do this only on IIS7 ; I have no reports of those on IIS6, and I haven't encountered it on my dev machine. EDIT 3 : it looks like it happens only when the page crashes. EDIT 4 : Ok, so, it happens only on IIS7, and only when I get an error 500. I think it might be the IIS error pages that have a problem. How can I try to change them ? Firebug gives me those headers : Response Cache-Control private Content-Type text/html; charset=utf-8 Server Microsoft-IIS/7.0 X-AspNet-Version 2.0.50727 X-Powered-By ASP.NET Date Mon, 04 Apr 2011 10:31:24 GMT Content-Length 2284 Request Host xxxx User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; fr; rv:1.9.2.16) Gecko/20110319 Firefox/3.6.16 ( .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET4.0E) Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9, / ;q=0.8 Accept-Language fr,fr-fr;q=0.8,en-us;q=0.5,en;q=0.3 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 115 Connection keep-alive Referer xxxxx Cookie xxxxxx Is there any way for me to say "on this page, I don't accept gzip compression at all" ?
