Using a SVM to classify audio data

If I had 1000 audio files where three people are independently saying an animal at the same time, there can be 9 independent labels of animals. What features should I select from the audio file, and how should I normalize them to build the most accurate SVM to classify the audio files? For reference, I am doing this project in Python,so specific code examples and libraries would be very helpful. Thanks! -Joe
