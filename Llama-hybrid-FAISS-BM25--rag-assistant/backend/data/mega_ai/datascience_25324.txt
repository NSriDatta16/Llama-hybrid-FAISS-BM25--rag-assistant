Text Mining from Images

I want to do the following project and I think the best way is using tensorflow/keras: I have photos as images from a list with prices of products and I need classify these text objects from the images such that i identify the product name and the price. So I think it is different from normal Image classification since my objects are text objects? First, I thought it is like object detection in images but I think i need more to take these texts to another neural network?
