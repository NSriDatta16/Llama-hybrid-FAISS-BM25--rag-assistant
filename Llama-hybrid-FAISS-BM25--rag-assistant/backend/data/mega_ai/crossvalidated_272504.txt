The usual approach would be not consider the unranked options as all tied for last place. So if you have six options and only the top three are ranked the remaining three are tied for last. What you do next depends on your preferences for dealing with ties. One way would be to assign the average of the tied ranks so giving $\frac{4+5+6}{3} = 5$ for each of them. Another way is to break the ties at random.
