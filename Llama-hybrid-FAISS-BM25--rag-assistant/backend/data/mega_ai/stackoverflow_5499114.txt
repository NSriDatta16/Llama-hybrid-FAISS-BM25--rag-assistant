Invoking activity when SlidingDrawer is dragged

I need to make an application with an activity consisting of a GridView and SlidingDrawer . I have done that, but now my problem is that I need to bring an activity for half of the screen whenever the SlidingDrawer is dragged and the other half will be my previous activity and when I drag back the SlidingDrawer then the Activity should be closed. Is this possible to handle both the activities in the screen without any conflict and if possible how should I design those activities?
