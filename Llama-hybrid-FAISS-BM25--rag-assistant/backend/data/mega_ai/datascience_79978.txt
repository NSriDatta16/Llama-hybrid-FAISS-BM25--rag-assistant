Try working with MNIST dataset if you are new to neural networks. Also, converting sigmoid function outputs probabilities which you can convert to class labels using argmax function. For ex: If you have 2 classes to classify then your network will output probability for true class using sigmoid which you can convert to labels as 0/1 using argmax. Hope it helps!
