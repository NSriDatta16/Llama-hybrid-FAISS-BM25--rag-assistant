penalised logistic regression with brglm - warnings

I've built a logistic model to predict a binary response. I've got four categorical predictors. One of them (posicion) has 6 levels, 3 of which occur not too frequently and are ALWAYS (by definition) associated to one of the response values. Data size is 1690. I reckon I'm dealing with a problem of separation. As you can see below those levels yield huge coefficients and standard errors. Call: glm(formula = transitividad ~ posicion + destinatario + hablante + nse + posicion:destinatario + posicion:hablante, family = binomial(logit), data = df) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.4983 -0.9403 0.3624 0.6893 1.6018 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.57275 0.13782 -4.156 3.24e-05 *** posicionV-FNA 3.64830 0.32424 11.252 I've tried using the ‘brglm’ package but, although coefficients got lower I get some warnings I don not know how to interpret (see below). I have ruled out ridge or lasso regression because they do not provide p values, SE or CI. I'd like to know whether it's ok to follow this path or I'm completely wrong. non-integer #successes in a binomial glm! brglmFit: algorithm did not converge brglmFit: fitted probabilities numerically 0 or 1 occurred Call: glm(formula = transitividad ~ posicion + destinatario + hablante + nse + posicion:destinatario + posicion:hablante, family = binomial(logit), data = df, method = "brglmFit", type = "AS_mean") Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.4798 -0.9426 0.3697 0.6946 1.5983 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
