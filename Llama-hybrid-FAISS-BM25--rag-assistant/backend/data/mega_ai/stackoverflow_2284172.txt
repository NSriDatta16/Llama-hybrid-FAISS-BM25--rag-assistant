The required size of your training set depends on the sparseness of the feature space. As far as I can see, you are not discussing what image features you have chose to use. Before you can train, you need to to convert each image into a vector of numbers (features) that describe the image, hopefully capturing the aspects that you care about. Oh, and unless you are reimplementing SVM for sport, I'd recomment just using libsvm ,
