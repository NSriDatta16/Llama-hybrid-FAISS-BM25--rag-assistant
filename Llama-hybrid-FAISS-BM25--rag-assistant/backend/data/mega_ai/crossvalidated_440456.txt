Hierarchical model for A/B experiment?

I'm new to Bayesian statistics. I have a metric that has a very non-parametric distribution, which would make it very difficult to use in an A/B experiment. However, it can be broken up into multiple levels of distributions like so: $$ broken = bernoulli(n, p) \\ qualify = bernoulli(n, p) \\ metric \sim lognormal(\mu, \sigma \: | \: broken=0, \: qualify=1) \: + \\ lognormal(\mu, \sigma \: | \: broken=0, \: qualify=0) + \\lognormal(\mu, \sigma \: | \: broken=1) $$ Is this considered a Bayesian Hierarchical Model? And if I ran an A/B experiment, took the test parameters found for those distributions, and simulated the metric through the model, would that be considered a correct / viable method?
