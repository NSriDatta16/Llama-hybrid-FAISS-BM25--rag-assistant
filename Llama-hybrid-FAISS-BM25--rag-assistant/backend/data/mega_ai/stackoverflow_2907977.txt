Mipmapping will compensate for scene scale in addition to perspective distance. The vertex shader outputs (which the driver will still create even if you aren't using your own shader) specify the screenspace coordinates of each vertex and the texture coordinates of those vertices. The GPU will decide which mip level to use based on the texel-to-pixel ratio of the fragments that will be generated. Are you setting GL_LINEAR_MIPMAP_LINEAR when you render your tiles as well? It only matters when you render things, not when you create/load the texture. Your bracketing glEnable/glDisable calls may need to be moved too, depending on what state you are actually passing in there.
