How to iterate with Selenium RC over XPath results directly?

I'm currently resorting to first doing a get_xpath_count, and then creating a loop incrementing an index variable, which in turn I inject back into the original xpath to select the nth result... very awkward no doubt. Is there some simple, direct, elegant way to iterate directly over the xpath results? Thanks!
