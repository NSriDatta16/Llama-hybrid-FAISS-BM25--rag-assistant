Web based chat in asp.net , using ajax timers , will it perform for large number of users

as all we know that we can create very simple chat using ajax timer & web service , it runs well for few users . i want to leaverage same idea for site where 5000+ users will be there in chat room , messages are stored in queue hold in memory * dispatched as user request that is through java script timers calling page method or service , how well it will perform ? i know GTalk implements XMPP protocol(jabber) for the web chat seems it will be difficult to got XMPP way ? Any guidence ?
