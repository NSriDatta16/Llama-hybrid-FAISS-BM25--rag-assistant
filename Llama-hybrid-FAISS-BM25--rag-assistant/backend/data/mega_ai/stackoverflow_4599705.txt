How to store numeric values in Zend_Config without loosing its type?

I decided to move some application settings from database to file system to be accessible via Zend_Config. However I run in to one annoying thing, Zend_Config recognise all values as string ignoring data type. Is there any magic way to parse config file keeping original types like float, integer, string and what would be best storage for it INI, XML, YAML or JSON?
