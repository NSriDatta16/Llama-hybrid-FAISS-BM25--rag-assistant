public bool SomeFunction() { try { //somecode return true; } catch(Exception ex) { MessageBox.Show(ex.message); } return false; } Personally I put the return statement at the bottom of the method instead of in the catch-block. But both are fine. It's all about readability (subjective) and guidelines in your organization.
