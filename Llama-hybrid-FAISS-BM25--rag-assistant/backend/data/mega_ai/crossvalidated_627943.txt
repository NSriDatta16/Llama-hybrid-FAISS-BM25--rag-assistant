To expand on Henry's comment above, what you are interested in here is the probability that you make at least one shot. Even if you stopped after the shot you make, we know you have 10 trials available so this is the probability that you would get the money. We actually don't need to worry about whether you keep playing or not after you win, cause if you do or don't it doesn't change the amount of money you win. Using a binomial distribution we can calculate this probability as $$P(X \geq 1; p, n =10) = 1 - P(X $$= 1 - (1-p)^{10}.$$ You calculated that correctly using scipy . The solution to the breakeven point is then the solution to the equation $$\$250\mathrm{K} = \left(\text{that probability}\right)\left(\$10\mathrm{M}\right) + \left(1 - \text{that probability}\right)\left(\$0\right).$$ The RHS here is the expected value of the money you would win from your basketball shots. So, we get that $$\frac{$250\mathrm{K}}{\$10\mathrm{M}} = 1 - (1 - p)^{10}$$ and the solution is then $$1 - \left(1 - \frac{$250\mathrm{K}}{\$10\mathrm{M}}\right)^{\frac{1}{10}} \approx 0.002529,$$ or about a $.25\%$ chance of making the shot, as Henry noted in his comment. So if your personal prior on $p$ is better than that, you expect (in a long-run average over infinitely many trials) to make more money by playing the game than walking away. Of course to decide which is "better" we then have to think about things like risk aversion and whether a guaranteed amount of money is better than any random amount. But $.25\%$ seems about right for my personal prior so I would probably take the money and walk :).
