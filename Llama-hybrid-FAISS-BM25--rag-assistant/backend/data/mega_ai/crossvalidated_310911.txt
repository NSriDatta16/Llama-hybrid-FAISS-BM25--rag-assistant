What if we don't make majority votes on OOB samples?

Let's say I am a software engineer, and I implemented a random forest classifier. Now, I have trained the classifier and I want to make prediction on an observation. The majority votes are supposed to be based on OOB samples. Instead, I used all samples. In math, what's the negative effects? Does this really make a difference in real world?
