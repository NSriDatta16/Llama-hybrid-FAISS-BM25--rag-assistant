A fairly standard solution is to use local files as storage. Code running as a Firefox extension has sufficient privileges to read and write local files. The MDC File I/O code snippets page is a very good starting point for understanding and implementing this in your extension. It also shows you how to find your extension's directory and illustrates the mechanism for creating temporary files . These approaches should give you the tools you need to do what you're after. Let us know if you need further questions.
