ich will require millions of gallons of water daily and 150 megawatts of electricity. The city also provided financial incentives to the company, understanding how the presence of the supercomputer could turn Memphis into a tech hub. The ability of the Greater Memphis Chamber to expedite approvals and negotiations also allowed for the project's quick initiation, which was deeply important to Musk and the xAI team. Environmental impact At the site of Colossus in South Memphis, xAI applied to temporarily set up more than one dozen gas turbines, which would steadily burn methane gas. However, according to advocacy groups, aerial imagery in April 2025 showed 35 gas turbines had been set up. These turbines have been estimated to generate about "72 megawatts, which is approximately 3% of the (TVA) power grid". According to the Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), the higher number of gas turbines and the subsequent emissions requires xAI to have a 'major source permit', however, the emissions from the turbines are similar to the nearby large gas-powered utility plants. In Memphis, xAI was able to sidestep some environmental rules in the construction of Colossus, such as operating without permits for the on-site methane gas turbines because they are "portable". The Shelby County Health department told NPR that "it only regulates gas-burning generators if they're in the same location for more than 364 days. In the neighborhood of South Memphis, poor air quality has given residents elevated asthma rates and lower life expectancy. A ProPublica report found that the cancer risk for those living in this area already have four times the risk of cancer than what the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) considers to be an acceptable risk. Along with high electricity needs, the expected water demand is over five million gallons of water per day in "... an area where arsenic pollution threatens the drinking water supply." This is reported by the non-profit Protect Our Aquifer, a community organization founded to protect the drinking water in Memphis. While xAI has stated they plan to work with MLGW on a wastewater treatment facility and the installation of 50 megawatts of large battery storage facilities, there are currently no concrete plans in place aside from a one-page factsheet shared by MLGW. Community response The plan to build Colossus in Memphis was kept secret from residents, City Council members, and environmental agencies in Memphis . Many did not find out about the project until the day before, or the day of as they watched the announcement on the local news. Keshaun Pearson, president of Memphis Community Against Pollution stated that there is a historical lack of transparency and communication surrounding environmental issues in Memphis. Some community members in Memphis have expressed concern about the potential for additional air and water pollution caused by the supercomputer. In a letter to the Shelby County Health Department, the Southern Environmental Law Center stated the emissions from the turbines make the facility "...likely the largest industrial emitter of NOx in Memphis..." This is due to data supplied by the manufacturer showing that "...xAI emits between 1,200 and 2,000 tons of smog-forming nitrogen oxides (NOx)..." At a public Shelby County Commissioner's hearing on April 9, 2025, residents living near the site of Colossus voiced complaints about air quality noting that they have chronic respiratory issues related to living in a polluted section of Memphis. One woman said she smells "everything but the right thing and the right thing is the clean air." Other residents voiced frustration that Brent Mayo, the senior xAI official responsible for building out xAI's infrastructure, did not show up to the meeting to discuss concerns with the community. Keshaun Pearson also stated that "We're getting more and more days a year where it is unhealthy for us to go outside." People living near the site of Colossus have
