How to use live data to improve a existing model?

I am using logistic regression to train a model to predict 'click/non-click' using ['browser info', 'publisher info', , 'location', 'time', 'day']. I wanted to know the ways in which I can use the new live data to improve the improve the already trained model. Does a solution exist which takes into account - change in feature set?
