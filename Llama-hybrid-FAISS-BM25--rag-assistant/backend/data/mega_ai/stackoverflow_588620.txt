The difference between these three (and many other) tags is their semantic meaning. The HTML standard includes both tags with specific semantic meanings ( for paragraphs, for emphasized text, etc.) and tags without semantic meaning. The latter are and , which are used to identify block- or inline-level content which needs to be identified (using, say a class= or id= attribute), but for which a semantically-specific tag does not exist. For example, one may write Hi, my name is John Doe . â€” indicating that it's a paragraph (which the browser already has an idea how to handle) and that part of it's content is a name (which means absolutely nothing to the browser unless CSS or JavaScript uses it). These tags are therefore incredibly useful both in adding additional information to an HTML document which doesn't fit within the semantic tags supplied by the standard (see the hCard specification for an excellent example) and for applying visual (CSS) or functional (JavaScript) structure to a document without altering its semantics.
