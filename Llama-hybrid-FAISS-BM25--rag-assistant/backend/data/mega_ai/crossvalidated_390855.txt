Averaging coefficients obtained from linear models of infinite subset in regression

If we estimate coefficients for a linear model by repeating experiments infinite number of times (Which means collecting samples or datasets infinite number of times and fitting a linear model for each such sample or dataset) and calculate the average values of the coefficients obtained from the linear models of these experiments for each variable, what can be said of these average values? Will they be more or less or equal to true value of coefficients
