It is important to distinguish between data generating process and mathematical relationship . It may be possible that there is a mapping (and possibly non-unique), $\hat{X}(t) = f(t)$ $\rightarrow$ $\hat{X}_i = f(X_{i-1},X_{i-2},...)$ . However, this does not mean that both can be considered as same data generating process. When we model a time series (or a process) by $\hat{X}_i = f(X_{i-1},X_{i-2},...)$ , we assume that each new observation by design is generated by this process. In polynomial modeling the innovations from previous periods play no role in influencing the realized value of current period. In dependence structure modeling, innovations from previous periods are directly part of current observation . So you see, there is a very significant difference in data generation process. On the other hand, there may be a mathematical relationship that can give a non-unique mapping. Consider this: $\hat{X}(t) = a_0+a_1t+a_2t^2$ $\implies \hat{X}(t-1) = a_0+a_1(t-1)+a_2(t-1)^2$ $\implies \hat{X}(t-1) = \hat{X}(t)-a_1+a_2-2a_2t$ $\implies \Delta\hat{X}(t) \equiv \hat{X}(t)-\hat{X}(t-1) = a_1-a_2+2a_2t$ $\implies \Delta\hat{X}(t)-\Delta\hat{X}(t-1)=2a_2$ Therefore, $\hat{X}(t)=2\hat{X}(t-1)-\hat{X}(t-2)+2a_2$ So, from $\hat{X}(t) = f(t)$ , we have found $\hat{X}_i = f(X_{i-1},X_{i-2})$ . What's fishy in this? We have actually found $\hat{X}_i = f(\hat{X}_{i-1},\hat{X}_{i-2})$ . But interestingly, we can still model $\hat{X}(t) = a_0+a_1t+a_2t^2$ by $X(t)=2X(t-1)-X(t-2)+\epsilon_t$ . Just the innovations will be completely different now. Further, the latter relationship is will hold irrespective of the value of $a_0$ and $a_1$ . So the relationship will not be unique.
