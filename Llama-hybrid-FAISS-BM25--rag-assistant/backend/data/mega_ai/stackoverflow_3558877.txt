I've checked the hudson support for xunit testing frameworks a short summary is included below: MBUnit/Gallio : There is a plugin but the development doesn't seems to be too active nor the community that use it. For example there is only one issue added. It was reported in reported in April and isn't touched yet (August). (Gallio team supports the plugin for CC.Net, their response time looks much better) MSTest: Has the same problem. Has only two issues in the issue tracking system and an average response delay is 6 months. (It looks like CC.Net has native support for mstest but requires some configuration) nUnit: The support for nunit in hudson seems to be quite good. The dev team is much more responsive and it also has more bugs reported (8 currently). So I think I'm going to give the CC.Net a try.
