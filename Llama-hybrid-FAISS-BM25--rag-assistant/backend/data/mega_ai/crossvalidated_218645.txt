Logistic regression and latent data

Assume a simple logistic regression model: given binary data $y_1,\ldots,y_N$ where for each $1 \leq i \leq N$ the outcome of $y_i$ depends on one variable. The succes probability is $p_i = \mathbb{P}(y_i = 1|x_i)$ is then modeled as a function of $x_i$ by the following relation $$\ln\left(\frac{p_i}{1-p_i}\right) = \beta_0+\beta_1 x_i $$ In some cases, they use latent variables $Z$ by defining $Z_i \geq 0 \Leftrightarrow y_i = 1$ and $Z_i
