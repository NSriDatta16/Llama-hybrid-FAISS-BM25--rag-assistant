You're on the right track but you're getting hung up by the C compiler, which is a little archaic. The compiler is choking because the definition of the protocol is not available at the time you use it. @protocol DragDropImageViewDelegate must be defined before you can use id as a type. You can move the @protocol definition before the usage (i.e. before your @interface), or add a @protocol DragDropImageViewDelegate; before the @interface (a forward declaration) and leave the @protocol declaration where it is.
