The correct way to implement this in Google Analytics is to configure the trackers so that they work cross-domain. This will allow you to see all the information about where the converting visits originally came from and their path to purchase. If you don’t use cross-domain tracking or you have it improperly configured, you’ll end up with meaningless data that shows self-referrers in the visit reports and a lack of proper attribution towards your conversion points. As a visitor moves from your primary domain to the other, they will start a brand new session in Google Analytics. ... If a visitor clicks an ad or performs and organic search and ends up viewing a page on the www.3rdpartycheckout.com after viewing pages on www.primarydomain.com, you lose ALL data about how that user arrived and the complete picture of what they did. If they end up converting, you will only know that they came from www.primarydomain.com (which is not helpful at all). http://www.blastam.com/blog/index.php/2011/02/google-analytics-cross-domain-tracking/
