Magento 1.4.2 - Adding an action filter to a block in CMS

I have the following: Featured Products {{block type="catalog/product_list" category_id="41" template="catalog/product/list.phtml"}} ...and I want to add an action method to it: 4 ...but either I cannot add the action method here in the CMS or I am not formatting it correctly, can anyone help? Thanks Paul
