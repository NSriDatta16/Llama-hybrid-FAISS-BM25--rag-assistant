Testing using dataUsingEncoding: indicates NSUnicodeStringEncoding is little-endian UTF-16 preceded with a byte order mark (on both the simulator and a real device) and Apple's String Programming Guide for Cocoa says "NSString objects are conceptually UTF-16 with platform endianness", so I'd think it's reasonable to assume UTF-16 is used internally. (the same guide goes on to say "That doesnâ€™t necessarily imply anything about their internal storage mechanism", so they're fully reserving the right to change this in future)
