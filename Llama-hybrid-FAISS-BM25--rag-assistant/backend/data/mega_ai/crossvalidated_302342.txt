Neutral item- Likert Scale

I have already collected data using a Likert Scale 1: strongly disagree; 2: Disagree; 3: Neutral; 4: Agree; 5: Strongly Agree. I later understood that "neutral" option should have been avoided in questionnaire scales. But for now, how do I treat the data from the "neutral" option? I transformed the neutral data from 3 to 0, thinking that 3 would inflate my average of all my five items in the questionnaire. However, by transforming it from 3 to zero, and then averaging the five items, it is deflating my average value. Do I treat this neutral as missing data, instead of zero? In that case, I will not count the items of the questionnaire that has neutral in my excel sheet. For example, 4+ 4+ 0+ 2+ 0+ 2+ 4+ 0+ 5+ 4+ 0+ 4+ 4+ 5=total/14= 2.71 Ave (zero is included); and by treating it as a missing data (excluding the zero), 4 +4 +2 + 2 +4 +5 +4 + 4 +4 + 5=total/10= Ave 3.8 Kindly advise.
