Looking for a good source for learning ASP.NET MVC

I've been working with ASP.NET MVC for the last few weeks, learning as I go, from tutorials and mostly trial and error. I'm sorta groping in the dark, since I have no other experience with MVC frameworks and I'm just moving ahead blindly trying to figure things out as I move along. So, I'm looking for better, more organized source to learn the platform and its features, and in general, the MVC structure and how the framework implements it, but no books on the subject have been released yet, and are all due in a few months at best. Does anyone know of any good, thorough resources from which I can expand my knowledge about the ASP.NET MVC framework?
