Per sklearn docs the answer is NO: Will you add GPU support? No, or at least not in the near future. The main reason is that GPU support will introduce many software dependencies and introduce platform specific issues. scikit-learn is designed to be easy to install on a wide variety of platforms. Outside of neural networks, GPUs donâ€™t play a large role in machine learning today, and much larger gains in speed can often be achieved by a careful choice of algorithms. However, xgboost , LightGBM or Catboost do support GPU (although it sometimes is hard to get the GPU runnig at least from what I tried). When using sklearn, a relatively fast way to train sklearn.ensemble.HistGradientBoostingClassifier . It is way faster than the "normal" GradientBoostingClassifier .
