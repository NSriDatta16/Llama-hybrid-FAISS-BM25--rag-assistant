There is a recent title by Henderson/Parmeter: Applied Nonparametric Econometrics . As the name suggests, its focus is more applied than that of Li and Racine, although it does devote quite some attention to theoretical underpinnings, too. Compared to the titles mentioned by @Dimitriy, it (unsurprisingly given its more recent date) surveys many of the recent developments in for example the area of nonparametric instrumental variables or panel data estimation. What I additionally like a lot (probably in line with many CVers) is its usage of R as well as...cross-validation ;-).
