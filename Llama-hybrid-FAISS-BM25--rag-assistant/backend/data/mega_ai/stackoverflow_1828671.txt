Origin of "map" in Computer Science

In computer science, there are two definitions of the word map. The first is as an associative array, a type of container that maps values of one type to values of another type. An example of this is the STL map . The second definition is from functional programming, in which map is a function that takes a list and a function, applies the function to all elements of the list in order, and returns a list of results. What are the origins of the different definitions of map? I'm guessing that the second definition might have come from the mapcar function from McCarthy LISP , but I'm not sure if that was derived from another useful. The first definition makes intuitive sense to me, but I'm not sure where it came from.
