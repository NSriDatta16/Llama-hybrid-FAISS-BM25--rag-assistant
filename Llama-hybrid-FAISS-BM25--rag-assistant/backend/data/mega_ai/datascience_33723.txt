When trying to classify fraud/malware/etc, don't score your model based only on Accuracy ... and always check for imbalanced data. The reason is the Accuracy paradox - wikipedia | Towards Data Science Check out this Github code - it's very much suitable for begginers... The problem with your model is that it's almost always classifying the software as "not malware", and due to the very small number of "malware" it gets high accuracy. Good Luck :)
