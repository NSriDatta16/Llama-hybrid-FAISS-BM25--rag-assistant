Is Application Object created and destroyed on every Request?

In PHP there are many Frameworks and all of them have the Concept of Front Controller or Entry Script or Application. Basically all of them mean that on a Http Request by a Browser , an Application Instance is created ( Like in Zend Framework , Instance of Zend_Application and Yii::createWebApplication in Yii) and each Application Instance further initializes different Components ( Nested Property Objects ) like Controller Object , DB Object , View Object (mostly Child Property Object of Controller Object) , Request and Response Objects etc. I hope it is clear till now . It must be the same in every MVC Framework :) No matter what Language What I was curious to know about that Is this Application Instance created ( along-with its nested child objects ) every Time a User Clicks on a Browser Button or Link and makes a HTTP Request or AJAX Request ? I think in Java Application Instance is persistent throughout Requests , maybe I am wrong :) Is it persistent in PHP , What are the Limitations if not ? Thanks for your Attention
