Using which database technology could I persist objects? (Something that does NOT require me to take care of mapping objects to tables and back)?

I need to use an object oriented data repository for a project. It's going to be something between a wiki and a CMS. I'm not an expert in the field of persistence yet. I suppose Hibernate and Jackrabbit are the frameworks to go, right? As far as I'm informed correctly, Jackrabbit does not support annotations or other convenience techniques for mapping between object instances and data storage. Hibernate , on the other hand, does not support versioning out-of-the box. What would you suggest me to use? Could I in some way combine both these frameworks? Could you also, if possible, summarize the pros and cons of the two frameworks? Thank you! EDIT I really would like to use something that does NOT require me to take care of mapping objects to tables and back. Why should I? In which century do we live? ;) I had good experience with JAXB (mapping objects to XML and back in an object-oriented way), but JAXB has no use in databases.
