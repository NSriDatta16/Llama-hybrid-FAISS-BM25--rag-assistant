Items in Multiple Categories Show Multiple Times

I've got items in an "equip" table that are linked to the equipcat table using a junction table. The problem is that I want to get a list of all items where the user supplied search term is found inside one of numerous fields, including the equipcat (aka category description) field. But I want each item to only be listed once. It seems I must have some fundamental misunderstanding about SQL because I've faced this problem before and had trouble figuring it out. I'm not only looking to solve this particular issue but to also understand it better for future needs. Here's my SQL. Please ignore the fuzzy searches as I realize they don't scale/perform well. I'm also aware that my use of a single field to hold keywords violates good design and I'm simply asking that you ignore that unless you feel that it is important to the question I'm asking. SELECT equip.equipid, equip.equipdesc, equip.equipgeneraldesc, equip.keywords, equip.dayprice, equip.weekprice, equip.monthprice, equip.hideyn, equipcat.equipcat, equipcat.equipcatkeywords FROM (equip INNER JOIN equip_equipcat ON equip.equipid = equip_equipcat.equipid) INNER JOIN equipcat ON equip_equipcat.equipcatid = equipcat.equipcatid WHERE (equip.equipdesc LIKE '%rake%' OR equip.keywords LIKE '%rake%' OR equipcat.equipcat LIKE '%rake%' OR equipcat.equipcatkeywords LIKE '%rake%') AND (equip.hideyn = 0) ORDER BY equipdesc ASC;
