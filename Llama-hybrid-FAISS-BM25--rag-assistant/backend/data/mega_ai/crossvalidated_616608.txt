Weighted logistic regression for complex survey design

I want to run a logistic regression on my dataset in R. I want to test the probability of which direction a fish is facing depending on my variables. I am considering using a weighted logistic regression since my data come from a complex survey design where there could be a possible lack of independence. My concerns come from nets located near another (possibly recapturing individuals) or some nets may catch more fish due to schooling behavior (species). I am searching for advice on how to weigh these observations. Dependent variable: Direction fish is facing in net (1: out; 0: in) Independent variables: Month, Year, Depth, Time Period, Site (all variables are categorical) > summary(ALE) Sample_ID Year Month Site DepthCat TimePeriodCalc Species Length:993 2011:887 August :141 3S:228 Deep :549 Morning:591 ALE:993 Class :character 2013:106 July :623 4S:765 Mid :426 Day :112 STS: 0 Mode :character June :120 Shallow: 18 Evening:290 YEP: 0 May : 87 September: 22 Direction 0:284 1:709
