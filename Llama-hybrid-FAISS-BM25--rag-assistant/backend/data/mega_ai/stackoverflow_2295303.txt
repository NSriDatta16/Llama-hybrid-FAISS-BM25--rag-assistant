First question: System Preferences organizes its pref panes by categories in a very simple way: the first 4 categories are reserved to Apple, and they organize the items in it in a way they like. Your pref pane will be added to the category Other, ordered among the others pref panes by alphabetic order. Second question: I would do one project for the "System Preferences like.app", and as many project as pref panes. If you want to have a way to build the "System Preferences like" app and all its pref pane at once, add the pref pane projects as a dependency to the "System Preferences like" project.
