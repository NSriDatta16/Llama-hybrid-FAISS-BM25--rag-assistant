I am a data analyst rather than a statistician but these are my suggestions. 1)Before you analyze data make sure the assumptions of your method are right. Once you see results they can be hard to forget even after you fix the problems and the results change. 2) It helps to know your data. I run time series and got a result that made little sense given recent years data. I reviewed the methods in light of that and discovered the averaging of models in the method was distorting results for one period (and a structural break had occurred). 3) Be careful about rules of thumb. They reflect the experiences of individual researchers from their own data and if their field is very different from yours their conclusions may not be correct for your data. Moreover, and this was a shock to me, statisticians often disagree on key points. 4) Try to analyze data with different methods and see if the results are similar. Understand that no method is perfect and be careful to check when you can for violations of the assumptions.
