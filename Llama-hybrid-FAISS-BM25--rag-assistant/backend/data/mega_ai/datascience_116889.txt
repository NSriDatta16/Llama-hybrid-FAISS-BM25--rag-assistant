Ideas on how to solve a problem using machine learning

I am fairly new to machine learning. I have been in mechanical simulation field for the past 7-8 years, I realise there are potential areas which I have been doing the same thing day in and day out, but ML can automate those activities. I need ideas on one such activity: I have a system which rotates from a angle $\theta_1$ to a different angle $\theta_2$ . The system starts from rest and should end at the particular angle at rest. In between, initially an operator accelerates it until he realizes at a certain time that he need to deccelerate the system to make it stop at the particular angle. My job is to determine the time point when the operator should start deccelerating (using I get the time point by trial and error). The input of the acceleration/ decceleration is coming from a motor whose torque v time data is there with me. I have plenty of acceleration-velocity-displacement-time graph with me. Is this possible to be automated using ML? The problem might not be very exact right now, but as ideas starts pouring in, I can enrich the problem and solve it. Thanks for participating.
