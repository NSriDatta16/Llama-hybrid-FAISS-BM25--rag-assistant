Nice work Dan. The inclusion of 1.0 in an odds ratio's confidence interval will be entirely consistent with the P-value from anova() if and only if the variable is linear or if it is categorical and the reference cell happened to be consistent with how summary sets up the contrasts. This is why I prefer anova for overall inference, accompanied by partial effect plots from ggplot(Predict(...)) . When a predictor's relationship is non-monotonic, e.g. U-shaped, the two approaches will be most inconsistent. Note that there is one dissatisfying aspect of fit.mult.impute : the model summary statistics such as $D_{xy}$ are only for the last imputed dataset. We need a better way to compute overall summary statistics, such as computing them on an "average model" or averaging the summary statistics over completed datasets. I would show ORs and CLs but have a footnote stating the reason they are not necessarily consistent with the general tests of association. And you can add the association test statistics on the partial effect plots.
