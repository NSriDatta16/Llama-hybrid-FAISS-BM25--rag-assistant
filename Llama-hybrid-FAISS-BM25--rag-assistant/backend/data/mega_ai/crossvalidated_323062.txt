What Bayesian test to conduct with one independent variable and two dependent variables?

In my current study I am looking at the effects of creatine monohydrate ingestion on ground reaction force and repeated sprint times. With CM as the independent variable, and ground reaction force and repeated sprint times as the dependent variables, what Bayesian inferential test would be the best to conduct?
