Read the hs_err_pid1234.log file (or whatever the error log file name is). There are usually clues in there. The next step depends on what you discover in the log. Yes, it could be a bug in the specific version of the JVM implementation you are using, but I have also seen problems caused by memory fragmentation in the operating system. Windows, for example, is prone to pin dlls at inappropriate locations, and fail to allocate a contiguous block of memory when the JVM asks for it as a result. Other out opf memory problems can also manifest themselves through crash dumps of this type.
