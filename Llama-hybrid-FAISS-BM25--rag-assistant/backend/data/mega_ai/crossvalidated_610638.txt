Definitely yes. To see this let's consider the population case. Suppose $X$ is a $p\times 1$ random vector with mean $\mu$ and covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and consider $Y = X\text{diag}(\Sigma)^{-1/2}$ . If $\Sigma_Y$ is the covariance matrix of $Y$ , then this has values 1 in its main diagonal. Now consider the PCA applied to $Y$ , i.e. consider the eigen decomposition $\Sigma_y = \Gamma\Lambda \Gamma^\top$ , where $\Lambda = \text{diag}(\lambda_1,\ldots,\lambda_p)$ . The principal components of $Y$ are the components of the vector $$ Z = Y\Gamma. $$ You can easily check that $\text{cov}(Z) = \Lambda$ and thus $$p^{-1}\text{trace}(\Sigma_Y) =p^{-1}\text{trace}(\Lambda) = p^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^p \lambda_i= 1.$$ Of course, a similar property holds also for the sample PCA.
