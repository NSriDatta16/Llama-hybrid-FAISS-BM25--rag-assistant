Options_for_select - how to select what's in the database?

I have a complex form (like Ryan B's Complex Form Railscasts) where I have a few levels of database tables being altered at the same time. The code for this dropdown box works in that it delivers the correct integer to the database. But, despite numerous attempts I cannot get it to correctly reflect the database's CURRENT value. How can I sort out this code? "bold"}], ["Good", "3"], ["Average", "2"], ["Poor", "1"], ["Incorrect", "0", {:class=>"bold"}] ], :weighting), {}, html_options = {:class => "listBox", :style=>"float:left;"} %> Thanks.
