PCI compliance issues for Magento running on Bluehost

I'm trying to setup an ecommerce site for a client and PCI compliance has come up. I'm having a hard time finding specific examples online... Lets say that I am running a magento store for a small non-profit ( I do not believe that magento stores credit card numbers in its database. Therefore, when a user submits an order, it passes through SSL to bluehost's servers, where it is processed by authorize.net, then is forgotten. Bluehost supports PCI A and B compliance on all systems... http://helpdesk.bluehost.com/index.php/kb/article/000512 Do I have any PCI concerns? If so - any suggestions on what I can change? Different hosting service. Thanks! (PS I know that redirecting the user to paypal would solve everything, but nobody wants that)
