convergence of an average of consistent estimators?

Let $\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^j \overset{\text{p}}{\to} \mu^j$ for each $j$ (as $n \to \infty$ ). Under what conditions can we guarantee that $$ \frac{1}{nm}\sum_{j=1}^m\sum_{i=1}^nX_i^j \overset{\text{p}}{\to} E[\mu]? $$ Is there a way to guarantee it that doesn't involve assuming uniform convergence in probability ? The sequences are uniformly convergent in probability if $$ \sup_{j} \left| \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n X_i^j - \mu^j \right| \overset{\text{p}}{\to} 0. $$
