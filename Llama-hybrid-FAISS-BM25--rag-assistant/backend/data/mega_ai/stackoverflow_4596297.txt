There's no good way to do this, you can't inject the #pragma warning disable in the auto-generated file. Also a problem with Winforms designer files btw. Project + Properties, Build tab, Suppress warnings = 1591. But that will disable the diagnostic also where you might want it turned on. A #pragma warning restore doesn't fix that.
