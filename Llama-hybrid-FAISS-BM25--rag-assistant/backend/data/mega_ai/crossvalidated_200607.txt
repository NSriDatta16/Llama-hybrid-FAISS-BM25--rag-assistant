How does CausalImpact Prevent Overfitting

I'm using Google Research's Causal Impact package, and I'd like to understand more fully how the package prevents overfitting and selecting a bad batch of the covariates by chance.

(p. 251) Why does "integrating out our posterior uncertainty about the influence of each predictor as well as our uncertainty about which predictors to include in the first place" avoid overfitting, in as close to layman's terms as possible?
