Looking for a web based hierarchical menu editor

I'm looking for a web based menu editor that has the following functionality: implemented in JavaScript, no postbacks to server side code on each edit create menu entries edit menu entries delete menu entries reorganize menu entries create sub-menu entries (a hierarchy) no hard-connected back-end code possibility to load the current menu hierarchy using a custom javascript function possibility to persist menu changes on each modification Menu entry should (at least) exist of title and url. Editor should (does not have to) provide rendering of the menu. I want to persist the edited hierarchy, and be able to bind a custom menu renderer to the stored hierarchical menu structure. Any ideas on available editors, either open source or commercial?
