Biased XGBoosting fot non target variable

I am training an XGBoosting model where the hyperparameter I got from RandomizedsearchCV and the best one was: {'n_estimators': 800, 'min_samples_split': 1500, 'min_samples_leaf': 500, 'max_features': 'sqrt', 'max_depth': 17, 'learning_rate': 0.1} With this model I have an ER of 0.28 However when i use predict_proba and check for the distribution of both target and non target along the probabilities the results are: On train The distribution is OK for the target variable however for the 0 I hoped the same of the target variable but inverted (Decreasing amount of 0's as probabilities increased). Is my model biased? What can I do?
