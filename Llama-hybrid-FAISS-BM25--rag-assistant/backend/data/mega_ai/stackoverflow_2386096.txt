What is an elegant way for calling a custom close-method on each worker-thread in a Java threadpool?

say I'm using a ExecutorService ex = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(nrofthreads); spinning up some work and waiting when it's done. However I have same Threadlocal objects in the worker-threads which need to be closed when the batch is done. Therefore, I would like to be able to call a custom close-method on all worker-threads created by the threadpool. What would be the most elegant way to do that? Right now as a hack I'm using: for(int i =0 ; i but that doesn't look particulary robust to me ;-) Thanks GJ
