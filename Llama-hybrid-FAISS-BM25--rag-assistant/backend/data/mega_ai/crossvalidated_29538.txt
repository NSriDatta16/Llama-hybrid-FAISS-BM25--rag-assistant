When to use a t value and when to use 1.645 for a 90% confidence interval?

The question I am working with is: Setup a 90% confidence interval estimate for the average processing time. I gathered the information below from the spreadsheet $n = 27$ $\bar{X} =48.888$ Sample standard deviation $= 25.283$ $\sigma/\sqrt{n} = 4.871$ I am confused because I thought that to setup the confidence level I would use 1.645 which is a common level confidence for the 90% confidence level. My final answer was: We are 90% confident that the average processing time is between 40.8 and 56.9 days. My final answer is wrong. I double checked with a excel template and instead of 1.645 the template used a t value calculated using an exel function called TINV which I am not sure how to calculate. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
