SQL query duration is longer for smaller dataset?

I received reports that a my report generating application was not working. After my initial investigation, I found that the SQL transaction was timing out. I'm mystified as to why the query for a smaller selection of items would take so much longer to return results. Quick query (averages 4 seconds to return): SELECT * FROM Payroll WHERE LINEDATE >= '04-17-2010'AND LINEDATE Long query (averages 1 minute 20 seconds to return): SELECT * FROM Payroll WHERE LINEDATE >= '04-18-2010'AND LINEDATE I could simply increase the timeout on the SqlCommand, but it doesn't change the fact the query is taking longer than it should. Why would requesting a subset of the items take longer than the query that returns more data? How can I optimize this query?
