You could create a content filter function something like the below in your theme's functions.php file or in a plugin. Note that this will add a class to any paragraph in the post body which has an image as it's first child element (providing no text comes first), which may not be the exact behaviour you want. function my_content_filter($content) { return preg_replace('| ( |i', ' ${1} ', $content); } add_filter('the_content', 'my_content_filter');
