I'm not sure which is your final goal as amphetamachine said but a pretty common approach to detect shapes could be the use of cvFindContours which given a binary image and returns a set of ' CvContour ' (which in fact is a cvSeq). Binary image can be retrieved quite simple by thresholding the image (cvThreshold). Check out the contours.c example in the sample/ of opencv src directory. Check this link as well: Noah (2009) opencv tutorial this sample code will give you an general idea: cvThreshold( g_gray, g_gray, g_thresh, 255, CV_THRESH_BINARY ); cvFindContours( g_gray, g_storage, &contours ); cvZero( g_gray ); if( contours ){ cvDrawContours( g_gray, contours, cvScalarAll(255), cvScalarAll(255), 100 ); } cvShowImage( "Contours", g_gray ); Once you have an encoding of the contour you can use cvMatchShapes which take 2 contours and return a measure of similarity between these contours. Hope this approach provide you a head start!
