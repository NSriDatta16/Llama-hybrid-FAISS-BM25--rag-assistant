for testing purposes try adding an event listener to the aboutSub MovieClip and see if that works. If it doesn't then check that you don't have another DisplayObject above it and make sure that you have not set anything like mouseEnabled = false or mouseChildren = false on the aboutSub. If it does work then check that in aboutSub clip that there are no DisplayObjectsw above the buttons etc (so same principle as the first paragraph)
