CMS vs Filesystem storage id scalability

Please consider the following: I am storing around 1.2 Million TIF files ranging from 40 KB to 120 KB in size. These documents are stored on a windows server with NTFS file-system. The documents are stored using the following variables: client document type image folder actual image See below: C:\ \ \image001\1.TIF Example C:\1\3\image001\1.TiF It is a PHP hosted system. The performance is acceptable at this stage. I want to know what the best strategy is going forward. Considering that the customers and document amounts are going to increase dramatically. I am looking at replacing the complete storage with Jackrabbit CMS. Would this be the way? Or Is storing the documents in a format like: Customer Document type Julian date day of the year document imported. Current User 6 digit unique code Example C:\1\1\167\2\453257\image001\image.TIF going to be just as efficient? Please take all other considerations of CMS vs File-system out of the picture. e.g versioning, data backup. Thanks.
