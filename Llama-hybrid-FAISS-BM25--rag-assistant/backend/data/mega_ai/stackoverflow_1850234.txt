From copyright.gov : Copyrightable works include the following categories: literary works musical works, including any accompanying words dramatic works, including any accompanying music pantomimes and choreographic works pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works motion pictures and other audiovisual works sound recordings architectural works These categories should be viewed broadly. For example, computer programs and most "compilations" may be registered as "literary works"; maps and architectural plans may be registered as "pictorial, graphic, and sculptural works." And more specific to your question: Several categories of material are generally not eligible for federal copyright protection. These include among others: Works that have not been fixed in a tangible form of expression (for example, choreographic works that have not been notated or recorded, or improvisational speeches or performances that have not been written or recorded) Titles, names, short phrases, and slogans; familiar symbols or designs; mere variations of typographic ornamentation, lettering, or coloring; mere listings of ingredients or contents Ideas, procedures, methods, systems, processes, concepts, principles, discoveries, or devices, as distinguished from a description, explanation, or illustration Works consisting entirely of information that is common property and containing no original authorship (for example: standard calendars, height and weight charts, tape measures and rulers, and lists or tables taken from public documents or other common sources) IANAL, but I don't see anything in that list that would make a SQL query ineligible for copyright protection, while a program written in a turing-complete language would be considered copyrightable. I'm inclined to say, open-and-shut, SQL can be copyrighted. With that in mind, you definitely want to take the advice of one of the other answers and either replace the code with something that doesn't have such an onerous license or get your contractor to parameterize the query. If he refuses, fire him without hesitation.
