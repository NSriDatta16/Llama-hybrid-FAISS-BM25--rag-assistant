Show that the equivalence of MAP in Bayesian estimation to Structural Risk Minimization (SRM)

I'm sorry that I didn't explain my problem clearlyI would like to add something. I saw this problem in Machine Learning Method written by Li Hang(p16). The book states the problem as below: "Maximum Posteriori probability estimation(MAP) in Bayesian estimation is an example of Structural Risk Minimization (SRM). When the model is a conditional probability distribution, the loss function is the logarithmic loss function, and model complexity is represented by the prior probability of the model, then Structural Risk Minimization is equivalent to MAP." The following picture is my attempt to show it: But I don't know how to continue conduct this is equivalent to MAP It might be a really simple problem, but I still need your help Thank you!
