Given an image how to find height of an object?

If I have an image of apple then how can I find the height of an apple using Deep learning? The photo of an apple is taken from the top view and I want to detect the height of that apple. How to do it? Are there any papers regarding this? I have searched a lot but the solution were only giving me length and breadth but not height. So how to determine height?
