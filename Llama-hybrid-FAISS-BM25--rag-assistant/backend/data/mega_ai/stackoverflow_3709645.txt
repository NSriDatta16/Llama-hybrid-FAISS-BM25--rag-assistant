How do I access the userid and password of a page using HTML Agility Pack?

I'm trying to get started with HtmlAgilityPack and was wondering if someone could help me get off to a good start. I'm trying to access the user1 id and the password1 id from the url https://www.foragentsonly.com/login.aspx How would I go about that?
