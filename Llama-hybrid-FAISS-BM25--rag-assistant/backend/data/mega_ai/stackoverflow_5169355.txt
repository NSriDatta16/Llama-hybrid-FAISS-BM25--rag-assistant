Callbacks When an NSScrollView is Scrolled?

I'm making a Mac app which needs to know when the user is scrolling the NSScrollView , however, I can't find any methods like UIScrollView , which has the following delegate methods: – scrollViewDidScroll: – scrollViewWillBeginDragging: – scrollViewDidEndDragging:willDecelerate: – scrollViewShouldScrollToTop: – scrollViewDidScrollToTop: – scrollViewWillBeginDecelerating: – scrollViewDidEndDecelerating: Can I have the similar delegate methods for the App Kit? Thanks in advance. Kai.
