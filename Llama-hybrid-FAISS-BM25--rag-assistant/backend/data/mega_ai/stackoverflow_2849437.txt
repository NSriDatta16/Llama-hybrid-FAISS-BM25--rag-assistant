Cufon: links change size on hover and stay that way

I have text links in a paragraph which is replaced using Cufon. For some reason, when I hover over the links, the text in them gets wider, and stays that way when I move the cursor away. A colour change, added to hover in the css, reverts as one would expect. So it isn't "stuck" in the hover state as far as I can tell. When I turn javascript off, disabling cufon, there is only a color change change to the font on hover. With javascript off, the hover state works for colour, but it dosn't have the width problem. This happens in IE6, 7 & 8, as well as Firefox, Safari and Chrome, which leads me to believe the problem is peculiar to how Cufon has been implemented on this site. Anybody run into this before? I'd love an assist here, but if I find the cause, I'll post it back as an answer. Unfortunately I can't post links or code due to an NDA.
