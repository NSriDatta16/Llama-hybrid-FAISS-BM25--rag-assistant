Also note the distinction between line (or perhaps physical line) and screen line . A line is terminated by the End Of Line character ("\n"). A screen line is whatever happens to be shown as one row of characters in your terminal or in your screen. The two come apart if you have physical lines longer than the screen width, which is very common when writing emails and such. The distinction shows up in the end-of-line commands as well. $ and 0 move to the end or beginning of the physical line or paragraph, respectively: g $ and g 0 move to the end or beginning of the screen line or paragraph, respectively. If you always prefer the latter behavior, you can remap the keys like this: :noremap 0 g0 :noremap $ g$
