How would I implement a model in Keras to generate embeddings based on documents?

I would like to create a model which generates embeddings for documents. I can create the model, but I was wondering how I would implement a training scheme where data consisted of two documents, either identical or different, and would be fed in parallel to the model (two instances running at the same time), which would create embeddings for their respective document. I want to use cosine distance to see similarity, and distance would be lower for documents that are the same. How would I train/implement this?
