I would recommend to Review and have a solid grasp on conditional probability and joint probability Bayes rules. Be comfortable with deriving probabilities in analytical form. Fully understand the basic knowledge of Markov chain before checking HMM. Dynamic programming is the key of Baum-Welch algorithm (and many other algorithms in Markov chain and HMM). I would strongly recommend you to understand the key ideal of dynamic programming and using recursions to solve the problem.
