Reusable CSS Classes or Lots?

Had a question that I've often wondered about. Is it better to have multiple CSS classes that you can use in multiple places across you site i.e. .padding5 {padding:5px;} .margin10 {margin:10px;} .left {float:left;} .right {float:right;} So you HTML code looks like this ... Or rather have explicit classes for every element. i.e. .title-demo {padding:5px; float:left;} with HTML ... The obvious advantages of the top organisation are that you save yourself having to repeat CSS over and over and over and your CSS stylesheet is much smaller for larger websites. Just wondering what's recommended by the gurus out there? My idea is essentially to create a "hybrid" solution which allows common CSS to be included as "padding5" combined with classes etc ?
