NSKeyedArchiver/NSuserDefaults - saving a CGRect

My app involves a user being able to drag specific items such as volume sliders and UIImage views. My goal is to be able to save the locations of the items so that the user can not have to drag the items again after re-launch. Unfortunately, I have seen errors along taking the 'saving CGRect rect = item.frame to NSuserDefaults or NSKeyedArchiver ' route. Any other suggestions?
