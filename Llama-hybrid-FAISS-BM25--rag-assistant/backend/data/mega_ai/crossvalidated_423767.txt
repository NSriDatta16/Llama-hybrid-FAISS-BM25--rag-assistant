The logistic regression and MH analysis should come up with the same conclusion, here is the logistic regression on top (with B as dependent, A, C, and AC interaction as independent) and Mantel-Haenszel test at the bottom. The two p-values are highlighted for your reference. While both of them test homogeneity of odds ratio, I believe it can inform if conditional dependence is likely or not. As in linear regression the a significant interaction term would imply i) the association between A and B depends on C, and also ii) the association between B and C depends on A. Here is the Stata code I used in case anyone would like to replicate: clear input a b c freq 1 1 1 77 1 0 1 92 1 1 0 76 1 0 0 63 0 1 1 68 0 0 1 53 0 1 0 57 0 0 0 81 end expand freq logit b a##c cc b a, by(c)
