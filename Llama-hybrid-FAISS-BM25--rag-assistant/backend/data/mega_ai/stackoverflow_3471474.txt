mysql load data infile can't get stat of file Errcode: 2

I have looked all over and found no solution, any help on this would be great. Query: LOAD DATA INFILE '/Users/name/Desktop/loadIntoDb/loadIntoDB.csv' INTO TABLE `tba`.`tbl_name` FIELDS TERMINATED BY ',' LINES TERMINATED BY '\r\n' IGNORE 1 LINES ( field1, field2, field3 ) Error: Can't get stat of '/Users/name/Desktop/loadIntoDb/loadIntoDB.csv' (Errcode:2) NOTE: I'm running MySQL Query browser on OSX 10.6.4 connecting to MySQL 5.x Things I've tried: Drag-n-drop Chmod 777 Put in a folder with 777 permissions as well as the file having 777 permissions
