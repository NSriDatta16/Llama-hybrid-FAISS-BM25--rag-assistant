JQuery or canvas layout tool (snap to grid)

I'm trying to implement some kind of drag and drop snap to grid similar to something like this http://wordsquared.com/ . Was contemplating trying to use JQuery UI and somehow save the position of the items. Seems like snapping to a grid, and saving would be a fairly common scenario. I was contemplating trying to implement this all in Drupal, any suggestions, examples, things I ay not be aware of would be very helpfull.
