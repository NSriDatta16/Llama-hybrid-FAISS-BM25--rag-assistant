How would you handle extensions/plugins within Zend Framework?

For one of my client I need to develop a CMS. For instance, I need to have the following features: Skinnable (layout and extensions) Able to upload zip archives and process them (they contain pictures) Classic pages (articles ala wordpress, joomla) Contact form A catalog A cart I'm used to Zend Framework so I'd like to develop it using Zf. I'd like to have a very modular application, and I hope that my experience in playing around with Modx, Wordpress, Joomla, Magento will help me to avoid bad design. I'd like to have a minimalist core system which on I could plug extensions/plugins and be able to customize them using defined conventions. For example, I'd like that even one of my "core" features will be one of these extensions. My feature could have: An admin interface A custom/default skin/themes Models Any needed fixtures A configuration files (xml/ini) Controllers Views So my question is how would you handle such design? Is it good? I'm wondering on how I'll register an extension to my app, how will I use it inside my layouts, controllers. Well I don't really know how to start as the design will define all the development of my application. I already decided to use ZF 1.1/2, Doctrine 2, jQuery/Dojo (don't know yet I don't really know Dojo)
