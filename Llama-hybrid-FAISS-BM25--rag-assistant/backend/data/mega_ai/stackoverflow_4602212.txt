Organize routes in Node.js

I start to look at Node.js. Also I'm using Express. And I have a question - how can I organize web application routes? All examples just put all this app.get/post/put() handlers in app.js and it works just fine. This is good but if I have something more than a simple HW Blog? Is it possible to do something like this: var app = express.createServer(); app.get( '/module-a/*', require('./module-a').urls ); app.get( '/module-b/*', require('./module-b').urls ); and // file: module-a.js urls.get('/:id', function(req, res){...}); // In other words - I'd like something like Django's URLConf but in Node.js.
