Why am I getting such poor results from this example of LASSO-regression?

I'm modelling the number of people in a population working, married, being ill, studying, having kids etc. I call one combination of these Boolean variables a "state". I'm estimating transition probabilities between these states from one year to the next year. I want to use a logistic regression model to estimate these transition probabilities. Since there are a lot of variables in the data set, I want to try to choose variables automatically and I'm trying LASSO-regression at the moment. Below is a made up example where I try to model the probability of working next year. The usual glm-function in R works fine and gives estimations of the true parameters that are quite close (although the true influence of the variable married is actually 0). However, when I try LASSO-regression I get results that are far away from the true parameters. Furthermore, I thought that the LASSO-regression would pick up that the variable marriage does not have any influence, but keep the rest of the parameters. Why doesnâ€™t it work? library(glmnet) library(boot) seed
