Is there any way to detect in an adapter,when getview() returned the view?,Android

So i have a list and i wan to check is the view is returned so i can call loadingAnimation.start() to make a imageview insite listview animate Let me tell you what i mean.. public View getView(final int position, View convertView, ViewGroup parent) { final ViewHolder holder; if (convertView == null) { .... blah blah } else { holder = (ViewHolder) convertView.getTag(); //HERE IMAGE IS LOADED (SHOWN) SO .start() WILL WORK holder.loadingAnimation.start(); } using this code if i scroll down the animation starts to work.But the first initial positions of the listview don't work at the start Note that if i make the call of loadingAnimation.start() inside the if (convertView == null) { or only outside the if .. else .. the animation will not ever work So i need a way inside the adapter (doesn't have to be inside the getView) to get if a view is loaded (shown) Ty EDIT I got it to work by emulation lag and then call the .start() to the animation class emulateLag extends AsyncTask { protected Drawable doInBackground(Object... urls) { SystemClock.sleep(500); holder.loadingAnimation.start(); return null; } protected void onPostExecute(Object result) { } } new emulateLag().execute("JUSTFORANIMATION"); return convertView; But i really don't like this approach so i keep the Question unanswered
