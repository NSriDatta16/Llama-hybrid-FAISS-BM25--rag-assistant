I'm also looking into a fast, cross-platform, cross-language, non-GPL-licensed RPC library. From looking at the C++ source of MessagePack it seems that it doesn't work on Win32 though, which is a requirement for myself. Except for that that single item it is on top of my list of serialization/RPC libraries. http://msgpack.org/ - Win32 missing http://avro.apache.org/ http://thrift.apache.org/ - Win32 missing http://bert-rpc.org/ http://www.xmlrpc.com/ http://json-rpc.org/ - GPL license http://code.google.com/p/protobuf/ - RPC missing
