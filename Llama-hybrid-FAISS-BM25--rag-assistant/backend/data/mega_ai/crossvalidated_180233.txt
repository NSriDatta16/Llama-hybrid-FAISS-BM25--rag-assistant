You can estimate coefficients one at a time. This makes the most sense if you are approaching the problem from a causal inference perspective. The idea is to estimate y ~ x to predict hat{y}. Then estimate in a linear model, (y - hat{y}) ~ z. This is analogous to E[E[y|x]|z] = E[y|z,x], which will yield an estimate of the effect of z on y given x, under some standard selection assumption. In theory you could do this piecewise regression throughout, but note your SEs will be incorrect (and possibly meaningless since it's not clear what sampling theory is motivated them). Anyway these should probably should be bootrapped, assuming bootstrapping random forests makes sense...
