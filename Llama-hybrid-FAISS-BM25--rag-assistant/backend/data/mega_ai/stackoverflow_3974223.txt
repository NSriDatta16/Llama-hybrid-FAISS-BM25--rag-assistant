Indenting partially selected lines in TextMate

Is there any way to make TextMate indent an entire line when only part of it is selected? Currently, when I select several lines by dragging my mouse over them, or holding shift and pressing up/down, pressing the indent key (Opt-TAB) only shifts the selected portion of the line by one indent level. That is worse than useless to a programmer, because it ruins your code on that line that's getting split apart. Every other editor that I've ever used recognizes that you actually want to indent that entire line, and does just that. I've heard that TextMate is incredibly customizable, so I'm hoping that someone knows a way to make it act like one expects. Maybe so that pressing the indent key expands the selection to include the whole line automatically, and then does the indent?
