Showing Infragistics UltraTabControl's shared content even with no tabs

We have a screen that shows a grid inside a tab control. There's one grid instance, and it needs to always be visible, regardless of which tab you're on. (We repopulate its content when you switch tabs, but it's always the same grid instance.) The UltraTabControl has a "shared controls page" that seems perfect for this, and most of the time it works great. However, when the tab control has no tabs at all , Infragistics does not show the shared controls. We need the grid to be visible even if there are no tabs at the top of the tab control. Is there a way I can get the shared content to show, even when there are no tabs?
