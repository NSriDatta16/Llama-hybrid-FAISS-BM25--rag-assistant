You are dragging from the grid in one user control and trying to drop onto a specific listview on the other user control or anywhere on the other user control? If you want to drop anywhere on the other user control, I think you will need to setup the apprporate event handler on that user control to respond. If you want to drop on to a specific listview that also accepts drag events from the other listview you will need to do extra work in your event handler on that listview to figure out where the drag initiated from.
