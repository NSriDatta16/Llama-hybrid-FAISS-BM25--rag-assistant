In your code you'll want to create a link to your control. In xcode, in your .h file put something like: @interface Mycontroller : UIViewController { IBOutlet UILabel *namelabel; } @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UILabel *namelabel; -(void)ChangeName:(NSString *)toName; @end Then in your .m file put something like: @implementation ProjectCell @synthesize namelabel; -(void)ChangeName:(NSString *)toName { [namelabel setText:@"your new string"]; } You then want to open your nib in interface builder. Select your label and go to the inspector (Tool Menu > Inspector). Go to the Connections tab (blue circle w/ white arrow, and then click and drag the circle by New References Outlet from there to File's Owner in the nib window. Select "namelabel" from the popup. They're now linked and changing namelabel in code will change that specific label that you setup in interface builder.
