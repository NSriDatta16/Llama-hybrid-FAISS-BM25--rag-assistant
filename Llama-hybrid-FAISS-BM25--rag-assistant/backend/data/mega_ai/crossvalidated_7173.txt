How to decide between a logistic regression or conditional logistic regression?

I have a case-control study in which the cases are firms with health insurance and the controls are firms with no health insurance. I am studying the factors affecting enrolment in health insurance and was therefore using a logistic regression, which includes several covariates on firm characteristics that were measured in a survey. I have randomly sampled the firms from a database that includes two strata: insured and uninsured firms. I selected 65 from each group. However, within the group I also sampled from four strata that correspond to industry. I am therefore wondering if I need to use conditional logistic regression, as opposed to unconditional logistic regression. However, I was under the impression that conditional logistic regression was for matched case-control studies or panel studies. In other feedback I've received I've been told that because I sampled on the outcome, I need to use the conditional model. Could someone please help me figure out which m? Any references would also be much appreciated. Thank you.
