Case weighted logistic regression

I'm looking at a few logistic regression issues. ("regular" and "conditional"). Ideally, I'd like to weight each of the input cases so that the glm will focus more on predicting the higher weighted cases correctly at the expense of possibly misclassifying the lower weighted cases. Surely this has been done before. Can anyone point me toward some relevant literature (Or possibly suggest a modified likelihood function.) Thanks!
