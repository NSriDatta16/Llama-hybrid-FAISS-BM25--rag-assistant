Generally, forms fields are neither paragraphs nor list items, semantically speaking. If you require your form fields to be grouped together, s with classes are likely most appropriate, but if you're just looking for a container around the / pair, consider the alternate method for associating a label with a field: Name Location You can then style or manipulate them together without an artificial wrapper (and without ever having to worry about for= again).
