Using word embeddings as features in classification algorithms?

I see there are ways to combine word vectors to form documents by taking averages or weighted averages. However, as a result of averaging there is a loss of information. Are there ways to retain the word embeddings of a document as is and use it as an input to a classification algorithm?
