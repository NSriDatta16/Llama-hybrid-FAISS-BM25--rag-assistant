The point of wddxing the complex data for database storage is that is a means of centralization as suggested by Peter above. The servers would replication a key that references the data, and flag indicating if it was changed. Then upon change the other servers would query the modified data and cache it until the change flag was set again. Each server would query the database only once per change, and the data is centralized, and not held only in memory. If the data is not so complex, then Session Replication can accomplish what you want without involving a database at all. The performance is inversely proportional to the number of servers in the cluster (because the amount of replication will grow exponentially as they all replicate data to the other members) and the quantity of data to be replicated.
