Confusion about independent and identically distributed?

Say that I wish to measure the height of male within the population (so gender=Male is the only factor I am accounting for). Say I collect 100 observations of male height from an elderly population. This is not representative of male heights because it is heights of males of a particular age range. Since my sample age may differ from the population average, if i derive a MLE, then it will be completely different to the population parameter. Am I violating the assumption that my random variables are iid?
