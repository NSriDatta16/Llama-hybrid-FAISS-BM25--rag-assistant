Fisher - Neyman dispute over weak and strong null hypotheses

I am trying to find information on one of the many exchanges between Fisher and (I believe, but cannot be sure) Neyman. I believe the exchange took place at one of the Royal Statistical Society meetings, but I cannot be sure anymore. I read about it years ago and have forgotten it. The discussion was about Fisher's randomization inference (i.e. the famous Lady Tasting Tea experiment). Fisher's interlocutor pointed out that the null hypothesis was what we, today, call a sharp or strong null -- no effects for any units. Fisher replied that this null was the one of most scientific interest, as opposed to "no effect, on average, across all units." Again, I think this was a discussion with Neyman, but I cannot be sure. Anyone who can describe this discussion in more detail or -- ideally -- point me to a source discussing it would be greatly appreciated.
