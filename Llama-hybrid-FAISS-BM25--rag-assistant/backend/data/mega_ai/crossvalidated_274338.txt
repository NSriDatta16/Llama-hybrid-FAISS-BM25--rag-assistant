Selecting random effect in random effect model

I'm working on a project regarding the effect of water sources on the number of species inhabiting 3 mountains. Species were surveyed in 5 plots for each mountain and data were organised as follows: a table reporting the number of species (columns) in each plot (rows), and a table containing information about each plot including the number of water sources available. I was trying to estimate the effect of the presence of water (normalized number of sources available) on the number of individuals of each species found in each plot. Given the structure of my data, I was thinking to fit multiple mixed effect models using the glmmADMB package in R . The probability distribution that best fits my data, based on the Akaike information criterion, is the negative binomial distribution which is supported in glmmADMB . Would it be correct to consider the mountains and the plots as nested random effects (i.e. 1|plot/mountain ) or it's better to include plots only (i.e. 1|plot )?
