Database design - ERD. Modeling Question

Hopefully someone may be able to quickly advise the best way for me to model my ERD (I'm using IDEF1X & ERWin not Chen Notation) although it doesn't really matter. Basically I have Three Entities Organisation Person Trustee Business rules state that a Trustee can be either a person or organisation. My question is, would it be correct to have two primary, foreign key relationships to Trustee. One from Organisation > Trustee and the second from Person > Trustee. Where one of the FK fields of Trustee will always be NULL depending on if the Trustee is a person or organisation. Or would it be better to have some sort of associative table between person and organisation (person_organisation) and create a PK, FK relationship from person_Organisation > Trustee. The second option seems better as there might be other entities that also need to link to both Organisation and person. Hopefully that makes sense. Many many thanks in advance
