How to force a IE version in a Winform WebControl?

I was trying to find out the problem in one web design I had and remembered to use a simple javascript to get the browser version as I had completly 2 different behaviors so I add this: txt = " Browser CodeName: " + navigator.appCodeName + " "; txt+= " Browser Name: " + navigator.appName + " "; txt+= " Browser Version: " + navigator.appVersion + " "; txt+= " Cookies Enabled: " + navigator.cookieEnabled + " "; txt+= " Platform: " + navigator.platform + " "; txt+= " User-agent header: " + navigator.userAgent + " "; document.getElementById("example").innerHTML=txt; and found out this: original image even though I have Internet Explorer 8 installed on this machine, the webbrowser control loads a version of IE (Internet Explorer 7) that is not the one installed. How can I force using the correct version?
