design a neural network for sales prediction

I'm developing a distributedsystem in which a plan to use a neural network for sales prediction. A small description of the system: the system combine the workflow of modules such as Pharmacy, Patient (electric health record) and a Doctor module. the problem is: I have many information related to the sales of medicine and i'm a little bit confused in designing the neural network. My current design : Inputs (according to the data that can be taken from the database): Date: the date of selling the medicine to a customer (YYYY/MM/DD format). Patient Age Category: a value that correspond to the age category of the patient ex: (1 -> 12: child, 13 -> 30: Young …..) Patient Gender. Medicine ID: a value that correspond to the medicine. Disease ID: a value that correspond to the disease which was discovered by the doctor who generate the prescription. Medicine Unit Cost: a value that correspond to the cost of purchasing a medicine. Medicine Unit Sold: a value that corresponds to the cost of selling a medicine. Pharmacy Address ID : a value that corresponds to the address of the pharmacy. Season ID : a value that corresponds to the season of selling the medicine ex(summer, winter , … etc). Outputs : Quantity : A Value that correspond to the quantity of the medicine that will be sold. Profit : A Value that correspond to the profit amount of selling the previous quantity. the question is : I'm not sure if this design is meaningful, any better suggestion? and what type of networks should I use to implement this design .. I'm planning to use multi-layer recurrent network ... It's a good choice or there is a better model? note: I'm planning to implement the network using c# with "AForge.NET Framework". hope this description is clear and simple, and sorry for my poor language.
