How does py2exe actually -and simply explained- work? :)

I have a c++ app that calls another python one (bundled into an exe with py2exe) So I have 2 apps. So I was wondering: What if my c++ did what py2exe does? i.e. embed the python app in the c++ one. This way I won't depend on py2exe and its configurations nighmares (yes, it has some) Hence my questions: how does py2exe work (so I can do its job with my c++ app) What about just embedding the whole python app with the c++? I read the python doc about embedding, did an example (a very simple one that does PyRun_SimpleString ) but what about a whole python app with tons of modules? (zipimport maybe?) I'd love to hear how you'd do that. Thanks a lot! :)
