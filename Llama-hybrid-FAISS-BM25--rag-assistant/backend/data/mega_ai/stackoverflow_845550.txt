Refine step 3. Look through current list and see whether any word in the list starts with a suffix of the current word. (You might want to keep the suffix longer than some length - longer than 1, for example). If yes, then add the distinct prefix to this word as a prefix to the existing word, and adjust all existing references appropriately (slow!) If no, add word to end of list as in current step 3. This would give you 'ragdollhouse' as the stored data in your example. It is not clear whether it would always work optimally (if you also had 'barbiedoll' and 'dollar' in the word list, for example).
