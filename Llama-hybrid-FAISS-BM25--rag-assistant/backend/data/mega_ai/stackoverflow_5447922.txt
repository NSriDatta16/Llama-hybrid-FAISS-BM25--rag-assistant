How to communicate between my model and flex component?

I'm trying to get my Actionscript 3.0 model that links to an SQLite database using Probertson's SQLRunner class to talk to my flex component; I'm really unsure of how best to accomplish this. I have worked off a few examples, but I don't know the simplest way to tell my component the results of the SQL query. Anyone have any recommendations? Here is some of the code, to give you an idea of what I'm working with right now. Component Model public function getPatient(PatientId:int):void { var stmt:String = new String(); stmt = "SELECT * FROM Patient WHERE PatientID= @PatiendId;"; sqlRunner.execute(stmt, {PatientId:PatientId}, loadPatient_result, Patient); } private function loadPatient_result(result:SQLResult):void { if (result.data != null && result.data.length > 0) { var Patient:Patient = result.data[0]; } }
