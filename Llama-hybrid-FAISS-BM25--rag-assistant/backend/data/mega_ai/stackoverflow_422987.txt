Check the user agent before incrementing the page view count, but remember that this can be spoofed. PHP exposes the user agent in $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] , assuming that the web server provides it with this information. More information about $_SERVER can be found at http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php . You can find a list of user agents at http://www.user-agents.org ; Googling will also provide the names of those belonging to the major providers. A third possible source would be your web server's access logs, if you can aggregate them.
