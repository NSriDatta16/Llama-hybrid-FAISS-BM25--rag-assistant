I don't think GROUP BY is what you really want here. DISTINCT is more correct because it will eliminate duplicates but the results are defined on the non-grouped by fields SELECT DISTINCT `view_customer_locations`.customerid, `view_customer_locations`.community_groupid, `view_customer_locations`.community_group, `view_sip_user_agents`.sip_user_agentid, `view_sip_user_agents`.didid, `view_sip_user_agents`.temporary_didid, `view_sip_user_agents`.active_did, GROUP_CONCAT( (IF(`view_sip_user_agents`.active_did = 'permanent', cast(`permanent_dids`.did as char(10)), cast(`temporary_dids`.did as char(10)))) SEPARATOR ', ') as did, `view_sip_user_agents`.sip_user_agents_date_archived FROM `view_customer_locations` LEFT JOIN `view_sip_user_agents` on `view_customer_locations`.customerid = `view_sip_user_agents`.customerid LEFT JOIN `dids` AS permanent_dids ON `view_sip_user_agents`.didid = `permanent_dids`.id LEFT JOIN `dids` AS temporary_dids ON `view_sip_user_agents`.temporary_didid = `temporary_dids`.id Group by `view_customer_locations`.customerid
