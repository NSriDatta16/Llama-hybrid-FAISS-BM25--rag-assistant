Edge computing is a distributed computing model that brings computation and data storage closer to the sources of data. More broadly, it refers to any design that pushes computation physically closer to a user, so as to reduce the latency compared to when an application runs on a centralized data center. The term began being used in the 1990s to describe content delivery networks—these were used to deliver website and video content from servers located near users. In the early 2000s, these systems expanded their scope to hosting other applications, leading to early edge computing services. These services could do things like find dealers, manage shopping carts, gather real-time data, and place ads. The Internet of Things (IoT), where devices are connected to the internet, is often linked with edge computing. Definition Edge computing involves running computer programs that deliver quick responses close to where requests are made. Karim Arabi, during an IEEE DAC 2014 keynote and later at an MIT MTL Seminar in 2015, described edge computing as computing that occurs outside the cloud, at the network's edge, particularly for applications needing immediate data processing. Edge computing is often equated with fog computing, particularly in smaller setups. However, in larger deployments, such as smart cities, fog computing serves as a distinct layer between edge computing and cloud computing, with each layer having its own responsibilities. "The State of the Edge" report explains that edge computing focuses on servers located close to the end-users. Alex Reznik, Chair of the ETSI MEC ISG standards committee, defines 'edge' loosely as anything that's not a traditional data center. In cloud gaming, edge nodes, known as "gamelets", are typically within one or two network hops from the client, ensuring quick response times for real-time games. Edge computing might use virtualization technology to simplify deploying and managing various applications on edge servers. Concept In 2018, the world's data was expected to grow 61 percent to 175 zettabytes by 2025. According to research firm Gartner, around 10 percent of enterprise-generated data is created and processed outside a traditional centralized data center or cloud. By 2025, the firm predicts that this figure will reach 75 percent. The increase in IoT devices at the edge of the network is producing a massive amount of data — storing and using all that data in cloud data centers pushes network bandwidth requirements to the limit. Despite the improvements in network technology, data centers cannot guarantee acceptable transfer rates and response times, which often is a critical requirement for many applications. Furthermore, devices at the edge constantly consume data coming from the cloud, forcing companies to decentralize data storage and service provisioning, leveraging physical proximity to the end user. In a similar way, the aim of edge computing is to move the computation away from data centers towards the edge of the network, exploiting smart objects, mobile phones, or network gateways to perform tasks and provide services on behalf of the cloud. By moving services to the edge, it is possible to provide content caching, service delivery, persistent data storage, and IoT management resulting in better response times and transfer rates. At the same time, distributing the logic to different network nodes introduces new issues and challenges. Privacy and security The distributed nature of this paradigm introduces a shift in security schemes used in cloud computing. In edge computing, data may travel between different distributed nodes connected via the internet, and thus requires special encryption mechanisms independent of the cloud. This approach minimizes latency, reduces bandwidth consumption, and enhances real-time responsiveness for applications. Edge nodes may also be resource-constrained devices, limiting the choice in terms of security methods. Moreover, a shift from centrali
