2 seconds, that is a really tight timeline, and I'm guessing that your windows app solution just might not cut it, not if there are hundreds of changes or anything at one time, and the poll time has to be almost every second to hope to make it within 2. Are the databases using the same structure? If so, I'd look at implementing replication. Edit After the comment and addition that the schemas are entirely different, I have to say that really I see two sets of operations. Modify the data storage options IN the app to make inserts/updates/deletes in both tables. Advantage: Immediate, no external process to share. Disadvantage: have to modify all code, hard to disable etc. Create a sync application as you mentioned, to sync changed data. Advantage: can simply disable after transfer done. Disadvantage: very complex to write especially if there are a large number of tables. Also, not as fast, 2 seconds is going to be VERY hard to accomplish
