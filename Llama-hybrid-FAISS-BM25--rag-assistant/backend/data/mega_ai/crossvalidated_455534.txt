Understanding the difference between Logistic Regression and nonlinear Regression

I had a statistic class where a Logistic Regression (or what I thought a Logistic Regression is) was set up on some ecotoxicological data (dose-response curve) and the nlstools package was used for this purpose. So far when I came across the Logistic Regression I only used the glm and I am not sure what is the difference between these two approaches. When applying both approaches on the same data there was a clear difference between the fitted curves. So, it seems like there is a difference between the Logistic Regression and the nonlinear Regression with the logit function but my google search has not helped me yet. It would be nice if you guys could help me understand that.
