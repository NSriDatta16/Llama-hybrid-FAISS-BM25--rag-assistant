Try these 2 queries. The first is a view that gives you the average exam scores for each student. V_AveragesPoints SELECT s.FullName, c.ClassName, AVG(p.ExamPoint) AS AvgPoints FROM Points p INNER JOIN Student s ON p.StudentID = s.ID INNER JOIN Class c ON s.ClassID = c.ID GROUP BY s.FullName, c.ClassName The second gives you a view of the highest averages scores for each class. SELECT FullName, ClassName, AvgPoints FROM V_AveragePoints ap1 WHERE AvgPoints = (SELECT MAX(AvgPoints) FROM V_AveragePoints WHERE ClassName = ap1.ClassName) I wrote these using standard T-SQL so they should work in MS Access, although I haven't verified them using MS Access yet. They work fine in SQL Server, but let me know.
