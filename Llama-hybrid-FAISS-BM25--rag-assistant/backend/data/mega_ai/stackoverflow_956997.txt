Determine location of a UIElement on a Canvas

I have spent 20 minutes trying to find an example in C# of how to draw a line between two rectangles, and I can't find anything. I don't know if I just don't understand the paradigm of drawing 2D shapes in Silverlight, or if I'm just looking in the wrong place. I have set up the rectangles so I can drag them around, and now I want to draw a line between the two shapes as I drag a rectangle across the canvas. I want to be able to do something like this as I drag the second rectangle: void host1_MouseLeftButtonMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (isDown) { this.host1TranslateTransform.X = e.GetPosition(canvas).X - x; this.host1TranslateTransform.Y = e.GetPosition(canvas).Y - y; Line l = new Line(); l.X1 = rect1.X; // does not work l.X2 = e.GetPosition(canvas).X; l.Y1 = rect1.Y; // does not work l.Y2 = e.GetPosition(canvas).Y; } } How do I get the coordinates of the first box? I can't figure out how to get the coordinates of shapes relative to the canvas in my application. I would appreciate any tutorials that give a beginner overview for how to draw simple 2D shapes. Thanks!
