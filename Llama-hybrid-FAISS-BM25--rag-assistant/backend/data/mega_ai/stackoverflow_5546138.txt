Compressing a text field in Sql Server 2k8 R2

So I have an application that stores a lot of text in a text field in SQL Server 2008 R2. I'm adding about 5000 records a day, and that is going to grow. The amount of data in the field can be between 4 KB and 100 KB. I can change the field to be a blob field and store a byte stream in there (eg. zipped text), but I'm wondering if there is any compression option that I can use in SQL Server 2k8 (perhaps something designed for storing a lot of text?) that I could leverage using SQL Server out of the box? thanks
