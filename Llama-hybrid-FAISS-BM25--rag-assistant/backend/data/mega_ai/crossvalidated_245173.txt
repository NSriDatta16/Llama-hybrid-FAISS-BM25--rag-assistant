Neural Networks Regression Model

I'm working on estimation of pressure based on a noisy sensor for an R&D project. I've achieved good results with GBM \ Random Forest using the excellent xgboost software library. I'm trying to compare this model to a Tensorflow neural network regression. I know this may not be the optimal approach, as highlighted here and the simplistic models recommended here . Is there a good neural network model (not necessarily deep) that can be used for regression? I am aware that neural nets usually have "smooth" activation functions which can be used for regression, however I don't know which model is useful and\or is competitive with more classic "statistical" regression models (such as Lasso, ElasticNet etc.).
