How to assess "reliability" for a non-stationary time series compared to a reference

I have two arterial pressure measurement devices, one of which is the reference. My goal is to assess reliability compared to the reference and the variables (demographics, passing time, etc.) characteristics influencing this relationship. The measurement consists of a pair of time series with one sample per 5 seconds over 10 minutes. Given the need to assess multiple potential influencing variables including passing time, I am thinking of building some kind of multiple regression model on the delta between sample pairs, but I am lost from here on. What are the established techniques geared towards such questions, please?
