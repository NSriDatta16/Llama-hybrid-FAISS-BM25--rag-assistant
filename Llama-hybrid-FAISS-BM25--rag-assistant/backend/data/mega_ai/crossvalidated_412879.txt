Conditional Volatility of GARCH squared residuals

Motivation I want to wrap up my own GARCH implementation to make sure I have understood the underlying model/assumption. to leverage forecast::auto.arima to automate model order selection (see below). to mitigate the potential issues with parameters, so that I don't have to switch to IGARCH when the sum of parameters are close to 1, etc. Background Suppose $a_t$ is a residual term with zero mean and zero conditional mean, the GARCH(p, q) model is given by $$ \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{aligned} a_t &= \sigma_t \epsilon_t \\ \sigma_t^2 &= \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^p \alpha_i a_{t-i}^2 + \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j \sigma_{t-j}^2 \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation} $$ Where $\epsilon_t \stackrel{iid}{\sim} \text{WN}(0, 1)$ . If we let $\eta_t^2 := a_t^2 - \sigma_t^2$ , then an alternative representation is $$ \begin{equation} \left\{ \begin{aligned} a_t &= \sigma_t \epsilon_t \\ a_t^2 &= \alpha_0 + \sum_{i=1}^{\max(p, q)} (\alpha_i + \beta_i)a_{t-i}^2 + \eta_t - \sum_{j=1}^q \beta_j \eta_{t-j} \end{aligned} \right. \end{equation} $$ According to my professor, $\eta_t$ can be proved to have zero mean, and are uncorrelated (but not independent). Methodology From above we can see that the squared residual $a_t^2$ is an ARMA process, so as stated before , I'll just fit an ARMA on $a_t^2$ . As far as I know, we don't have xxx::auto.garch but there is forecast::auto.arima , which would help us to find the correct order of ARMA. This lets us model/forecast the conditional mean of squared residuals. However, what we really care about is the conditional volatility of $a_t$ , but I'm lost here. $$ \begin{equation} \begin{aligned} E(a_t^2 | I_{t-1}) &= \text{var}(a_t | I_{t-1}) \\ &= \text{var}(\sigma_t \epsilon_t | I_{t-1}) \\ &= \text{var}(\sigma_t | I_{t-1}) \text{var}(\epsilon_t | I_{t-1}) + \text{var}(\sigma_t | I_{t-1}) E^2(\epsilon_t | I_{t-1}) + \text{var}(\epsilon_t | I_{t-1}) E^2(\sigma_t | I_{t-1}) \\ &= \text{var}(\sigma_t | I_{t-1}) + E^2(\sigma_t | I_{t-1}) \\ &= \text{???} \end{aligned} \end{equation} $$ Question How do I get "conditional volatility of residuals" from "conditional mean of squared residuals"?
