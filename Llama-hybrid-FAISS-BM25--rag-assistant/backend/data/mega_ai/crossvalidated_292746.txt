When neural networks are stuck in a local minimum the problem is usually the activation function. Which one works best? That changes from project to project. Most of the time, we find the best activation function by trial and error...welcome to world of machine learning! I seriously over-complicated this in the beginning. I researched for hours and hours which activation function is "best" or when to use each one. The answer was so simple that I couldn't believe it. The answer I received from many, many modelers without hesitation or variation was "whichever one works best." Hope this helps.
