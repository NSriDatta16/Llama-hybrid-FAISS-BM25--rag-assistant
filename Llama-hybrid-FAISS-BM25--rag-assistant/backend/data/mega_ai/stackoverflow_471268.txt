C# WinForms Naming Convention

Is there any kind of naming convention for C# WinForms code? I Googled this a bit and got nowhere fast. I'm designing a WinForms app and the Class View is becoming tough to navigate fast, so I need to apply some standards to find things faster. New (typical) control When you drag a new control onto a form in VS, it assigns it a camel cased name, but generates a private member field. I thought the convention for private class members was camel case prefixed with an underscore? What about events & methods for controls placed on a form? Is the Studio default of ControlName_MethodName the way to go for eveything?
