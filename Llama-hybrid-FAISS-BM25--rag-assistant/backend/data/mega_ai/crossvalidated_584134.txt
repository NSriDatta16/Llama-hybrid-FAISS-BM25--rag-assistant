Validation dataset is not a random sample from whole dataset

I am facing a small dataset to do machine learning. The small dataset is not the dataset on which ML will be applied. It is a derived dataset on which the model will be trained. However, due to derived nature, part of dataset will be discarded. In particular, some of the sample in training will never show up in the validation set as there are not enough observations for those samples not in validation set. Normally, the validation requires a random subsample from total dataset. Q: Can I train model based upon the training set and test on a validation set which is necessarily a random split from total dataset? Discarding data is very bad in my case. In particular, I want to do a random split on a subset of total dataset and keep data short of observations in training at the same time.
