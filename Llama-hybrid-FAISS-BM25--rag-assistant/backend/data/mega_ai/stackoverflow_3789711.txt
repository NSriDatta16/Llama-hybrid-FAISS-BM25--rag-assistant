When it comes to performance or storage, it is absolutely the same thing. As a GENERAL RULE, use whichever fits better for you: if you will need only positive values, store values as UNSIGNED, otherwise, let it be the default [SIGNED]. One problem arises when a SIGNED value is set for a PRIMARY AUTOINCREMENT column: the counting of the auto-generated numbers begin with 1 (not the smallest negative number) and the possible values will end earlier, as you will use only a half of values. So in this case (PRIMARY + AUTOINCREMENT column) it is better to store as UNSIGNED.
