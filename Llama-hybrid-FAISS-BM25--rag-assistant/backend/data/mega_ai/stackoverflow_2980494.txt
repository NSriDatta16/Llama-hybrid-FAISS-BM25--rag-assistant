The straightforward way is to keep a reference of the thread you use to run the runnable and interrupt it on shutdown. Alternatively you can use thread pools to organize the threads for a service. Then the threadpool takes care of keeping track of the threads and managing them, including interrupting them when shutting down. Yet another (hacky and not recommended way) way is to enumerate all running threads in the JVM (using the ThreadGroup's method) and try to guess which thread runs your runnable (e.g. by analyzing the stack of each thread).
