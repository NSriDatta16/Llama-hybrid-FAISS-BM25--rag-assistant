Having trouble balancing the recall and precision of my XGBoost model

The title essentially says it all. Below are some details regarding my data and model. This is the current class distribution within my training set: 0 1353849 1 26217 Name: binary, dtype: int64 My training set includes 104 features. My current recall is at 94%; My current precision is at 20% Here are the hyperparameters for my XGBoost model: nrounds = 500, eta = 0.2, max_depth = 20, subsample = 0.8, colsample_bytree = 0.2,reg_alpha=0.1, reg_lambda=0.8 I've tried SMOTE but it isn't working well likely cause of the high dimensionality. If you all have any recommendations, that would be much appreciated.
