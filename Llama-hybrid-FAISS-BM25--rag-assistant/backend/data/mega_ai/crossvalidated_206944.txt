How do I know when a Q-learning algorithm converges?

I am currently trying to implement the Q-learning algorithm. After reading enough to have a good understanding of how it works, I am now wondering how to know when the algorithm actually reaches convergence. Say, I have a Q-table generated as in this example , how do I know the job is done, i.e, the algorithm has converged? Thanks!
