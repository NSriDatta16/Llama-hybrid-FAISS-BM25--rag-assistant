i think the answer depends on what you are planning to do with the html content, and also what type of html content you plan to support. Especially when it comes to included javascript, encoding often results in problems. CDATA definitely helps you there. If you plan to use only small snippets (ie. a paragraph) and have a way to preprocess/filter it (because oyu dont want javascript or fancy things anyways), you will probably be better off with encoding or actually just putting it directly as subtree in the xml. You can then also post-process the html (ie filter style or onclick attributes). But this is definitely more work.
