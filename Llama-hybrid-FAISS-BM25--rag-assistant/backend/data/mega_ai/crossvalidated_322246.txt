Let's address your two questions separately: Is the "rare outcome assumption" for an OR to approximate a relative risk still true in ordinal logistic regression? Not really. You said yourself that your outcomes are evenly spread throughout the four categories, so no category is going to be particularly rare. If so, is it possible to change the link function to directly estimate a relative risk, and is it still possible to use something like a poisson approximation with robust standard errors to deal with convergence issues in such a case? You can, but there is a risk that when you use your model to make predictions, the predicted probability of being in a class might be more than 1. The standard ordered logit model is formulated $$Y_i \sim categorical({\bf{p}}_i);logit({\bf{p}}_i) = X\beta$$ together with the proportional odds assumption. All we are doing is replacing the "logit" with "log", which still produces a valid model with a valid likelihood that produces valid estimates for $\beta$. When you apply these to real data though, it is possible that a component for $\bf{p}_i$ is more than one (and since this is outside the range of the proportional odds assumption, you can't use it to populate the remaining components). This can't happen if you only use your model to predict on the data it was trained on, and is less likely if you have a lot of training data your training data covers all possible combinations of covariates (if they are categorical) or the full range of covariates (if they are numeric)
