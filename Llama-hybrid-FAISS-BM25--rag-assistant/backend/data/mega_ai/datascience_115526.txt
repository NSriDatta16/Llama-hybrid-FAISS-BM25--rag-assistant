Can you clearly divide the short sequences or are they merged together? If they have a clear time division (ex: a day or a week), you can set a batch of a short time and learn every short sequence correctly. Otherwise, you have to find ways to cut the short sequences correctly without overlapping each other. In both cases, you can detect short sequences' shapes thanks to 2D CNN for instance. https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-convolutional-neural-networks-for-time-series-classification-56b1b0a07a57
