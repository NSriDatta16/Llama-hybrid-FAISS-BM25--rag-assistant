Combining text (NLP), numeric, and categorical data for a regression problem

I have a dataset data = { points: 3.765, review: `Food was great, staff was friendly`, country: 'Chile', designation: 'random', age: 20 } I am looking for a way to use these features to build a model to predict points. Description seems to hold a lot of information about points. How do I feed this data into the model and also which model? Note I don't want to use word2vec (embeddings)
