Recently I've found that Mylyn rocks for task organization. It's Eclipse plugin . Especially if you're already using some external task trasking system like Jira, Trac or other. If you're programmer then all your tasks are linked to some source files. That is what Mylyn do. It remembers which files (and other stuff) you've used to work of specific task. Then you can always return to it later. You can copy your task context if you're doing similar task again. You can share it with other team members. Tasks can be stored in external system. Or directly in source code with marked by TODO comments. In Mylyn you can: argregate tasks from various sources (Jira, Trac, TODO comments in source, and others) make your personal schedule search tasks edit tasks resolve/close them add comments/attachments track work time and it's open source I recommend you to look at Mylyn concept screencast which is 50 minutes long. But it's very good introduction to Mylyn.
