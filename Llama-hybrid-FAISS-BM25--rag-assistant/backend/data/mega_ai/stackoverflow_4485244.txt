How to ensure iphone app crash logs can be symbolocated?

I have a niggling issue in an app I'm developing; it's not in the app store, however I can see the crash logs from the Organizer when I plug in my iPhone. The problem is that the crash logs do not symbolocate. I can see a .dSYM file in my build/Debug-iphoneos directory from the last time I installed the app on my phone, however I can't figure out how to make it work. I've consulted this technote , however it doesn't really say what to do, simply that the organizer "must have the .dSYM and application binary that produced the crash report." How do I make it "have" these things? They appear to be sitting around on my hard drive, but it doesn't recognize them. Is there a more clear step-by-step process to making this work?
