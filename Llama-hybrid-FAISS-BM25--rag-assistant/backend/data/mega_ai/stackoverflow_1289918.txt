jcarousel problems

Right now I'm building a website. Here's the link: http://theoew.uuuq.com/home/ This probably won't make much sense unless you look at the website so just scan the next paragraph and then go to the site and just watch the slideshow go through. I'm having a problem with the jcarousel slideshow. Let me first explain the basics of it. It automatically goes to the next slide unless you hover over it. For some reason after the third slide instead of going back to the first slide, it first moves about 20px to the right and then goes back to the first slide when you click the next button. Its looks like the slideshow thinks there is an extra slide that is only like 20px wide. I (obviously don't want this to happen.) I have made a page with just the slideshow to make it a little easier for you guys to help me. Oh, and I used the autoscrolling example to start out with. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Woops! here's the link for the slideshow by its self. http://theoew.uuuq.com/simple%20carousel/
