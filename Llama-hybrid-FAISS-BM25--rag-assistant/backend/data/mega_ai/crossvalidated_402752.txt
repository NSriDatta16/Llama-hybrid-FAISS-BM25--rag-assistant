Use simulation to check where the structure of your model may be creating "results" which are simply mathematical artifacts of your model's assumptions Perform your analysis on rerandomized variables, or on simulated variables known to be uncorrelated with one another. Do this many times and contrast averaged point estimates (and confidence or credible intervals) with the results you obtain on actual data: are they all that different?
