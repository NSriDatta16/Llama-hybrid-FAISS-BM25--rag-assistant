If you take a look at the time deltas, you'll probably find they're not very consistent frame-to-frame. This probably isn't because the frames are taking different amounts of time to render, it's just an artifact of the batched, pipelined nature of the GLES driver. Try using some kind of moving average of the time deltas instead: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moving_average Note that even though the time deltas you're observing in your application aren't very consistent, the fact that you're getting 60fps implies the frames are probably getting displayed at fixed intervals (I'm assuming you're getting one frame per display v-sync). What this means is that the delay between your application making GL calls and the resulting frame appearing on the display is changing. It's this change that you're trying to hide with a moving average.
