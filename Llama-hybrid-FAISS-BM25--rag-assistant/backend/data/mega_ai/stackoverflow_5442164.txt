Entity Framework Code First: Using a database that doesn't need to be separately installed?

I understand that SQL Server Express will work with Code First and is free, but my client doesn't like an additional install step. Is there any other database that I can use that won't need to be installed separately? This is just a single user application so I don't really need a powerful database... just need storage and a way to enforce data integrity. I did a little research on my own and came up with: SQLLite SQL Server Compact Edition 4 MS Access However, and please correct me if I'm wrong, none of these work with Entity Framework... Any ideas? EDIT: To put it short: I need an embedded database that supports EF.
