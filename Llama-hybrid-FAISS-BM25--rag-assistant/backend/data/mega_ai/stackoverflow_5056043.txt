Unless there is a very good reason for using XML, I would avoid it. If you have a fixed number of objects that will need conversion from logical layer to storage layer I would suggest to create a DataModelToStorageTranslator facade like this: DataModelToStorageTranslator{ SubjectStore translate(SubjectLogical subject); TestStore translate(TestLogical test); ResultStore translate(ResultLogical result); } That would give you more type safety as you will not need to check object types and cast. You will need to extend your interface anytime you want to add new objects (which I think is a good way of doing it for smaller projects).
