As far as I know quite a few of the conventions you posted are encouraged by the Zend PHP Framework as well. You're not alone, I'm a Codeigniter user and my work is pretty big on using Zend Framework. These kind of naming conventions are absolutely ridiculous and I honestly can only see an advantage of using camelCase for variable names, not function names as it makes things confusing. Read this: http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/coding-standard.naming-conventions.html Do these coding conventions look familiar to you?
