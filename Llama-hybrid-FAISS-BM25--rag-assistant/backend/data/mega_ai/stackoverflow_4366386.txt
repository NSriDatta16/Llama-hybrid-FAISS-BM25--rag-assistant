Get list of stores using the zip/city in shipping address

I need to get the list of stores using the zip/city that we specify in the shipping address ( In Admin Panel System->Configuration->Shipping Settings(In Sales Tab left)->Origin. ) Is there any way to query Magento to get the list of stores with a particular Zip/city ?
