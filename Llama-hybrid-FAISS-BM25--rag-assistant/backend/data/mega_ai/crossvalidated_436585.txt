How to have better confidence in my logistic regression model

I have been working on a logistic regression model to predict 'yeses' in a yes/no classification problem. The objective of my problem is not necessarily to predict the outcome, but it's rather to just get a better understanding of my variables and how they influence the outcome. For example, I want to say that feature X is 2.2 more likely to achieve 'yes' then my reference level, and Y feature Y is 2.5 less likely to achieve 'yes', etc. I did my model, received the output, and I know how to read the coefficients, but I want to know if there are any tests I can do to confirm the confidence of the coefficients. I did a few things already: 1. checked the P-value of the summary (focused on the ones Besides these things, are there anything else that I can do? Basically, if I say that a feature is 2.5x more likely to vote 'yes', I want to make sure that is more or less correct. Right now, I feel like i"m just taking the output at face value and it's a bit uncomfortable.
