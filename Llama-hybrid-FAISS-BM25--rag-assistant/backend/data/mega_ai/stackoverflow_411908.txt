You might consider using structured XML files. Seems like this would be a more elegant solution than hacking .resx files to work in an unconventional way. You could use a LINQ query to get to the XML in a strongly typed manner similar to the resx file. Additionally, XML files could be edited by the user through the presentation layer since they aren't compiled into the application.
