If I understand correctly, you have to separate problems : Predict what should each warehouse pre-buy Get the best warehouse for an order For the first problem, I point you to the netflix prize : this was almost the same problem, and great solutions have been proposed. (My datamining handbook is at home and I can't remember for precise keyword to google, sorry.Try "data mining time series" ) For the second one, this is a problem for Prolog. Set a cost for separately ordering an item Set a cost, for, idk, proximity to the customer Set the cost for already owning the product to 0 Make the rule to get a product : buy it if you don't have it, get it if you do Make the rule to get all products : foreach product, rule above get the cost of this rule Gently ask Prolog to get a solution. If it's not good enough, ask more. If you don't want to use Prolog, there are several constraints libraries out there. Just google "constraint library >"
