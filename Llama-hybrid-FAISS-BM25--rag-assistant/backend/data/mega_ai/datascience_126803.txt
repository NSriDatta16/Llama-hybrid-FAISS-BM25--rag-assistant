How can I use Time-GPT for pretraining my model

I am mentioning Time-GPT here as a placeholder example. It can be any pretrained model. Suppose I have a dataset that requires some time series prediction. How can I leverage a well-trained model and transfer that learning to make a better prediction for my model? Asking this because, in almost all cases the I/P and O/P dimensions of Time-GPT and my dataset would be different. Then how can I use it? Could you share some resourceful git repo with similar examples?
