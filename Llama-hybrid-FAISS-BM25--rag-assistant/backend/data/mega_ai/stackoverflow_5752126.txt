Why is passing data in arrays not discouraged in CodeIgniter?

I come from a Java background and have only recently started learning PHP and CodeIgniter. While I find the framework awesome for its clean design and impressive documentation, I notice that the framework doesn't necessarily discourage the use of data arrays instead of value objects for passing data around. For ex., the database queries return the result in an array which you can then pass over to the views for rendering. Similarly, most of the core library methods take associative arrays as inputs. This, to me, seems like a bad design for an Object Oriented language which should promote and maybe even enforce using value objects for their obvious benefits of encapsulation. Is this really an example of bad design or simply a matter of style/preference ? Are there any obvious benefits of using arrays for data over a more OO approach ?
