Is there anyone that has any pointer/link/good advices? Your issue seems to be addressed by the Microsoft Connect issue Mouse Events Consumed / Not Raised in 2.0 Designers . This issue is all but easy to grasp though, but apparently the upgrade from .NET Framework 1.1 (2003) to 2.0 (2006) implied a change in drag & drop behavior - given that the article you mentioned stems from 2003 this could well be related. Specifically you should scroll ahead to section Issue 2 , citation: You will now notice constant flickering when dragging over the form. This is partially caused by the new drag-drop behavior in 2.0. I'm unable to dig deeper into this right now myself but you might also be able to figure something from Customize Drag & Drop in the Designer , which addresses changed behavior regarding drag & drop between Visual Studio versions 2003 and 2005; quite likely this might be related and one of the accepted answers does in fact specifically reference the Microsoft Connect issue above, plus it offers more hints towards possible solutions too.
