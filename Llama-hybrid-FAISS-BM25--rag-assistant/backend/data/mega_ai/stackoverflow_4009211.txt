class family_tree { private: string name, surname; family_tree father(); //fragile point! public: family_tree(); family_tree(string n, string sur); // note that I removed a " here. void print(); }; It's perfectly valid. Your fragile point is not fragile at all- you have a function that returns a family_tree, and it doesn't matter that it's called on a family_tree object. Whether or not the language provides for you to implicitly cast the const char* string literal to the std::string, I can't recall.
