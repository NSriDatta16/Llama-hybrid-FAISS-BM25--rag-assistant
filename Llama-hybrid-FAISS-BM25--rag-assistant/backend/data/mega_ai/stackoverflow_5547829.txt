ddawber, you are mentioning three points: 1. I have to provide dummy data that would normally be retrieved from forms You should take a look into CakePHP's fixtures 2. The format of the dummy data does not take into account the fact that the actual form data might be incorrect Form data is validated against the model's validation rules, see here . 3. I am only testing whether or not the update succeeds: it seems like a lot of effort to create all the dummy data to test this This should then simply be solved by writing a test method (and you pick only relevant cases), taking 1. and 2. into account. Maybe you are interested in the fact, that the CakePHP devs switch from simpletest to phpunit in the 2.0 release, which could help you planning your efforts. Good journey into CakePHP's testing facility anyway. Edit0: The forth point on code coverage seems controversial. If you would go for 100% coverage, you would have to write lots of mock objects, just to make sure that a controller's action is actually called when you call it. Writing something like this is imho a task for the developers of the framework, and omitting to write superfluous code of this kind directly hits the code coverage.
