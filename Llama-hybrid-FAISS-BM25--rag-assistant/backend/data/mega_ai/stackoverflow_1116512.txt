Have the same solution for both, but 2 projects, the .NET project and the NUnit project (One to One), now if I have a solution that have multiple projects, then I have just 1 NUnit project for the solution as it and 1 for each project.. I think is a good way because it serves me to mantain organized my projects. Also, you can take a look at this book: http://www.artofunittesting.com/ it's very good.
