There are many things that idea solves in a much simpler way, or there's no equivalent: Autocomplete actions: Doing ctrl+shift+a you can call any idea action from the keyboard without remembering its key combination... Think about gnome-do or launchy in windows, and you've got the idea! Also, this feature supports CamelCasing abbreviations ;) Shelf: Lets you keep easily some pieces of code apart, and then review them through the diff viewer. Local history: It's far better managed, and simpler. SVN annotations and history: simpler to inspect, and also you can easily see the history only for such a part of a whole source file. Autocomplete everywhere, such as the evaluate expression and breakpoint condition windows. Maven integration... much, much simpler, and well integrated. Refactors much closer to the hand, such as loops insertion, wrapping/casting, renaming, and add variables. Find much powerful and well organized. Even in big projects Much stable to work with several branches of a big project at the same time (as a former bugfixer of 1.5Gb by branch sources, and the need to working in them simultaneously, idea shown its rock-solid capabilities) Cleaner and simpler interface... And, simpler to use only with the keyboard, letting apart the need of using the mouse for lots of simple taks, saving you time and giving you more focus on the code... where it matters! And now, being opensource... the Idea user base will grow exponentially.
