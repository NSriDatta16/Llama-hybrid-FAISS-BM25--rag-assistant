Don't forget that PHP CLI and Apache usually are running as different users. If you created some directories from the PHP command line and now want to access the same directory from the Apache context, it will not work. Sidenote: it is probably not advantagous to create directories on the fly during a web request, please pay attention to the 30 sec. limit.
