To be general, let us consider a time series with arbitrary steps. Therefore, let $k$ be the number of steps in three months and write $\omega_1$ for the weight for the immediately preceding time, $\omega_2$ for the weight preceding it, and so on, so that the sequence of weights $$(\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_k)$$ is applied to the preceding three months. The total weight for those three months is the sum of these. Assumption I: It is natural to hope that the next sequence of weights starting at $\omega_{k+1}$ be in proportion to the first sequence; the question specifies that the constant of proportionality be $1/2$, entailing $$\frac{1}{2}(\omega_1, \omega_2, \ldots, \omega_k) = (\omega_{k+1}, \omega_{k+2}, \ldots, \omega_{2k}).$$ The requirement of "smoothness," together with the natural idea of a monotonic decrease in weights over time, suggests that $\omega_{k+1} \lt \omega_k$. This leads to Assumption II: We might hope that the sequence of weights could be arranged in geometric proportion, say with constant of proportionality $\rho$, whence $$\frac{1}{2}\omega_1 = \omega_{k+1} = \rho^k \omega_1.$$ The unique solution is $$\rho = 2^{-1/k}.$$ Summing these weights over $n$ time steps and requiring them to sum to unity gives $$1 = \omega_1 + \omega_2 + \cdots + \omega_n = \omega_1(1 + \rho + \rho^2 + \cdots + \rho^{n-1}) = \omega_1 \frac{1-\rho^n}{1-\rho}.$$ It follows that $$\omega_1 = \frac{1-\rho}{1-\rho^n} = \frac{1-2^{-1/k}}{1-2^{-n/k}}$$ and $$\omega_i = \rho^{i-1}\omega_1 = 2^{(1-i)/k}\omega_1, \quad i=1, 2, \ldots, n.$$ For example , with $k=3$ (monthly data) and $n=6$ (giving two full three-month periods), $\rho = 2^{-1/3} = 0.793701$, $\omega_1 = 0.275066$, and the sequence of weights for the first three-month period is $0.275066$, $0.21832$, $0.173281$ followed by half these weights for the second three-month period, $0.137533$, $0.10916$, $0.0866403$. Other solutions to the problem are possible ; in particular, there are infinitely many available when we do not make Assumption II. But Assumption II has the particularly nice property that if you were to combine the data into sequential groups, taking $m$ of them at a time (such as combining daily data into monthly data, with $m \approx 30$), and recalculate the weights, then the sum of the weights for each group will equal the recalculated group weights.
