Encode overlapped areas as inputs for Neural Networks (SOM)?

How am I supposed to represent area input variables to SOM, with the weights/distances to be based on how much they overlap? I'm trying to encode ranges of finite and positive integers. Like: 500-600 550-650 0-100 101-102 Problem is, the underlying calculations of SOM are supposed to use numeric subtraction and multiplication. So, how do I represent, like: (500-600) is very close to (550-650) (overlap 50 points) while (0-100) has nothing to do with (500-600), same as (0-100) to (101-102) It's more like boolean toogles of 0...1000, but the distances should really be calculated by OR not subtraction. How is this usually done? Unless I change the input vector from the original inputs to distances between each of them?
