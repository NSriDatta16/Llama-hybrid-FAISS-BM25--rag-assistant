How to data bind to the CSS top, left, width, and height of a DOM element?

I'm trying to use KnockoutJS to build an interactive dashboard with data bindings on different aspects of the style property; namely left , top , width , and height . For example, I'm using JQuery UI along with ui-draggable and ui-resizable effects to enable users to drag panels around on a canvas and resize them however they see fit. Without KnockoutJS, I was simply iterating over each div and stealing these properties from the dom element. I'm sure there's a better way using KnockoutJS, right? To explain my problem a little better, consider two panels side by side: Update My view model looks something like this (note: pseudo coded for brevity): var viewModel = { panels: [ { id: 'panel1', left: 0, top: 0, width: 50; height: 50 }, { id: 'panel2', left: 50, top: 0, width: 50; height: 50 } ], send: function() { ko.utils.postJson( location.href , { panels: this.panels } ); } }; ko.applyBindings( '#dashboard', viewModel ); I'd like to bind it in such a way that when the user sizes any of the div elements (ie. the panels), that it would then update the underlying viewModel using the built in data binding OnMouseUp . Then when the user clicks the "Update" button, I would then post the coordinates to the server. I'm thinking it might have something to do with custom templates, but even there I ran into some complexities that I couldn't quite grasp in managing the mouse events on each panel. Ideas?
