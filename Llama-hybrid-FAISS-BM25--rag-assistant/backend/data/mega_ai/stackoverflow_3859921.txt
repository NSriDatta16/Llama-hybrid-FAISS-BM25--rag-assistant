Using jScrollPane, drag block doesn't go to the bottom of scrollbar

I've used jScrollPane before but I'm having some trouble getting it right this time. I am using it in two pages of the site, and on both the drag block (orange box, in my case) never reaches the bottom of the scroll track. I've tried a number of things playing with margins and padding but can't seem to get it to respond. I'll keep code out of the post solely because it's probably easier to just Firebug the thing, but please comment if you need more information. The two pages it occurs on are http://juisebox.com/fmg/index.php/work-with-us/contracts and http://juisebox.com/fmg/index.php/news-and-media/publications
