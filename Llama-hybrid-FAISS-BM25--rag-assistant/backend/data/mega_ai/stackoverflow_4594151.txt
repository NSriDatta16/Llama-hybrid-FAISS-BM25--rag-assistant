select a column where the column name is retrieved from a query

I'm looking for a elegant way to select a column from table A where as the column name is retrieved from a query on table B. A query on table B results in 'col01' The Table A has several columns named 'col01','col02','col03',... Final query should be for result result from B | effective SQL query 'col01' | SELECT col01 FROM A 'col02' | SELECT col02 FROM A I'm looking for pure SQL solution with no scripting. It should run with Oracle and/or MySQL.
