Fastest way to find most similar string to an input?

Given a query string Q of length N, and a list L of M sequences of length exactly N, what is the most efficient algorithm to find the string in L with the fewest mismatch positions to Q? For example: Q = "ABCDEFG"; L = ["ABCCEFG", "AAAAAAA", "TTAGGGT", "ZYXWVUT"]; answer = L.query(Q); # Returns "ABCCEFG" answer2 = L.query("AAAATAA"); #Returns "AAAAAAA". The obvious way is to scan every sequence in L, making the search take O(M * N). Is there any way to do this in sublinear time? I don't care if there's a large upfront cost to organizing L into some data structure because it will be queried a lot of times. Also, handling tied scores arbitrarily is fine. Edit: To clarify, I am looking for the Hamming distance.
