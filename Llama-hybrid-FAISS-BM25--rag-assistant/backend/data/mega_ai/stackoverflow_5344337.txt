In a word, that's a lot of effort. At least with the v2 API, I could retrieve those details thusly: var place = response.Placemark[0]; var point = new GLatLng(place.Point.coordinates[1], place.Point.coordinates[0]); myAddress = place.AddressDetails.Country.AdministrativeArea.SubAdministrativeArea.Locality.Thoroughfare.ThoroughfareName myCity = place.AddressDetails.Country.AdministrativeArea.SubAdministrativeArea.Locality.LocalityName myState = place.AddressDetails.Country.AdministrativeArea.AdministrativeAreaName myZipCode = place.AddressDetails.Country.AdministrativeArea.SubAdministrativeArea.Locality.PostalCode.PostalCodeNumber There has got to be a more elegant way to retrieve individual address_components without going through the looping jujitsu you just went through.
