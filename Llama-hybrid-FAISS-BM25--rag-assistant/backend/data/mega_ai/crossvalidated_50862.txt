Consider the following pointers: Adding parameters to a model is not cost-free, both from a classical and a Bayesian point of view. Taylor, J. M. G., Siqueira, A. L. and Weiss, R. T. (2000). The cost of adding parameters to a model. Journal of the Royal Statistical Society, Series B 58: 593â€“607. The Occam's razor can also be used to give an argument in favour of models with less parameters. Conduct a formal model comparison (either by using AIC, BIC, DIC, Bayes factors or your favourite scoring rule) in order to obtain more believable evidence in favour of one of the models in question. In vague words. Small or even moderate samples usually contain little information about hidden variables or hierarchical variables. For this reason, the less parameters you use, the more information you are likely to obtain from the sample.
