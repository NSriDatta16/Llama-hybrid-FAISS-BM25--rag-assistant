@F.Alanazi already directed to an elegant analytical way of answering your question. Here I suggest an alternative empirical method for: any set of figures any repetition of digits I wrote a simple function in R language: unique.digits It finds the amount of figures composed by a single digit, two digits, three digits etc. It can be tested with these examples: > unique.digits(c(123, 101, 111, 222)) count.unique 1 2 3 2 1 1 > unique.digits(100:999) count.unique 1 2 3 9 243 648 In the case of your answer, we are interested in the amount of figures with 3 different digits, thus, 648.
