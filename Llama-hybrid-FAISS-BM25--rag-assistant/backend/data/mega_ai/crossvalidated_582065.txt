Should I remove some independent features based on PCA?

I am quite new to machine learning and just got started on classification. My Class is either positive or negative for around 400 genes. I performed a PCA analysis in R to figure out how my independent features are interacting and this is the output I got. Some of the features like expression1_1.1, expression1_1.2, and expression2_1.1 seem to be highly correlated, as they are just superimposed on each other. Should I remove some of these features before I start my random forest/SVM/neural net classifier? How can I interpret this graph? Thank you!
