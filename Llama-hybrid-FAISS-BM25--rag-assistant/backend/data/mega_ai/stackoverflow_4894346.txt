How can I quickly change the cell that many of my formulas point to?

I've got a spreadsheet that has a bunch of cells with simple formulas that look like: =(column letter)(row)/(column letter)(row). =E92/E77 for example. There are 6 rows of 12 of these formulas, and I want to change the divisor row (77 in example) to a different row for each of them. Now I know that I can just change the first one in each of the 6 rows and drag the formula across the remaining columns for each row. I want to know is there a quicker way to change a cell reference (terminology?) for many cells? I hope the question is clear enough, if it is not then say so and I will try to clarify. Thanks!
