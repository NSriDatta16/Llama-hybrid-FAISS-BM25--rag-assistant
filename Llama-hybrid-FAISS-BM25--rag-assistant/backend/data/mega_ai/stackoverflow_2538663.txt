You should always write test, if your existing testsuite is insufficient. The best sign, that your tests are not enough are bugs. So a good practice is to write a unit-test for every bug you encounter. With test-driven development you should start with some test, do define the functionality of a class. test-coverage-tools gives you some hints, which parts could need more testing.
