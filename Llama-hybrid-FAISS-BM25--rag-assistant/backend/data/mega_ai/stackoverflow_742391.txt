Project Organization in C Best Practices

I am wondering what the best practices are for organizing a large C project are. It is a professional project, not an open source one, likely to be stored in a Git repository. How should things be sorted? Where should structures go? When should one use functions attached to structures versus functions that take a structure as a parameter? In terms of laying out the files in the project, how should things come together? What naming conventions are most appropriate?
