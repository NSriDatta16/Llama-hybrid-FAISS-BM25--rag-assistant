I assume your EventManager is a singleton, or you have access to the particular instance of the class you're testing. 1 - I suppose you can send events to your class. Your method is private, and nobody else can call it, then sending an event should be enough. 2 - You can access that through reflection, if you really need to. Your test would depend on a particular implementation. 3 - What would you like to test, actually? If you want to be sure that this method is called, you can replace the EventListener with another EventListener object through reflection (and eventually call the onEvent method of the first listener from your new listener). But your question seems to be more about code coverage than actual unit-testing.
