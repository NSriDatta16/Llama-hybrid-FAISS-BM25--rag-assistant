Deep Learning vs gradient boosting: When to use what?

I have a big data problem with a large dataset (take for example 50 million rows and 200 columns). The dataset consists of about 100 numerical columns and 100 categorical columns and a response column that represents a binary class problem. The cardinality of each of the categorical columns is less than 50. I want to know a priori whether I should go for deep learning methods or ensemble tree based methods (for example gradient boosting, adaboost, or random forests). Are there some exploratory data analysis or some other techniques that can help me decide for one method over the other?
