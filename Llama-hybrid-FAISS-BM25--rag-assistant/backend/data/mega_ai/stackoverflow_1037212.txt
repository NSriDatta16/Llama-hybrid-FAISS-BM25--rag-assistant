How to drag from browser area and deposit to the explorer area?

Sometime ago I was facing the problem the other way around: how to drag an item (folder/file) from an explorer window (be it windows explorer, linux nautilus etc.) to the browser window - that is, the drag starts in one application and ends in the browser. Since I had control over the browser, I was able to intercept the dragend event: the one which interested me. Now, I want to do this from the browser to the file explorer application: much like when you drag an image from firefox and drop it in a folder. My main problem is that while I can check when the drag event exited the browser window, I have no ideea how to get the location where the drag event finished. My ideea is to create a signed java applet and somehow track the mouse movement on the desktop - but this seems a little more than overkill. Any pointers on this?
