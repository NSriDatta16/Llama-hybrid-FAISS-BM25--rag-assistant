RSS is XML. It has very specific rules for encoding HTML. If you're generating it, I'd recommend using an xml library to write the node containing HTML, to be sure you get the encoding right. HTMLencode will only perform the escaping necessary for embedding data within HTML, XML rules are more strict.
