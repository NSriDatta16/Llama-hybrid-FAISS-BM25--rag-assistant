Pull. Always pull. I know it's a manufacturing-oriented book but the advice from Lean Thinking (Womack & Jones) is invaluable in any context (roughly, from memory): Start by defining value , line up the activities that create value in the value-stream , create flow across the value-stream, let customers pull value from the value-stream, compete against perfection rather than other organizations If I misquoted them, I apologize. Anyway, all of those principles can easily be applied in the development of any software product just as they could in the production of any physical product but the one that matters for you is pull . Letting consumers of a service pull rather than pushing to them not only makes your programming model easier, it aligns activity with demand. You can still use queuing to load-level over time, if you have to, just the way you could with push but, this way, you have complete visibility into what, exactly happens in any given transaction. I don't quite get your first question but the answer is still pull .
