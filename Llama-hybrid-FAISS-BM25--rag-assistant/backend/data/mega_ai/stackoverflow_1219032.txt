referencing each case of a switch from a conditional inside a different method in java

I am implementing some methods which use switch statements to distinguish between different cases: private void doThis(){ switch(command){ case on: {status = doCalculationsA; break;} case off: {status = doCalculationsB; break;} case idle: {status = doCalculationsC; break;} case stdby:{status = doCalculationsD; break;} } } The above works fine, when, further down the business logic, I call doThis() inside other methods which need the doThis() functionality. However, at this moment I am a bit confused how to incorporate other conditions/restrictions posed on each case of the above switch. I mean, when I call doThis() within say biggerOperation(), I have new conditions that need to be applied against each case of the switch belonging in the doThis() function: Sample logic: biggerOperation(){ doThat(); doTheOther(); if(somethingIsTrue){ execute "case: on" of doThis() } else if(somethingElseIsTrue){ execute "case: off" of doThis() } else if(aThirdThingIsTrue){ execute "case: idle" of doThis() } else if(aFourthThingIsTrue){ execute "case: stdby" of doThis() } } I have not been able to figure out an elegant, clean and compact way to do this as of now. Are there any ideas perhaps? How can I explicitly target each case of a switch? Could I use a new switch to implement that conditional logic? Any suggestions are welcome. Much appreciate your help.
