How to plot data when their values differ by orders of magnitude?

What is the best practice for plotting data where their values differ by several orders of magnitude? For example, suppose that you are comparing the learning times of two machine learning algorithms $A$ and $B$ and you have the following data: n y_A y_B 1 0.00001 0.02 2 0.00002 0.04 3 0.00003 0.08 4 0.00002 0.04 5 0.00001 0.02 Here $n$ is the number of features, and $y$ is the learning times. The plot of these results looks like this: However, the plot suggests like algorithm A has 0 learning time, or constant time. Therefore, should I use a semi-log plot? What is the best practice in this scenario? The point of the plot is to show that algorithm $A$ learns substantially quicker than algorithm $B$ for all values of $n$.
