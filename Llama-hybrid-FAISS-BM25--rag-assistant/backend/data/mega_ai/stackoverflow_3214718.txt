Depending on your use-case, you could create a public Api that delegated its work to a private method that takes a dynamic . This keeps the strong typing for your public Api and eliminates code duplication, even though it falls back to using dynamic internally. public void DoSomethingwithInlines(Paragraph p) { do(p); } public void DoSomethingwithInlines(Bolb b) { do(b); } private void do(dynamic d) { // access Inlines here, using c# dynamic }
