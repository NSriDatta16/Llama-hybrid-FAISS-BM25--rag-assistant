It depends on what you mean by the population. If you want an estimate of the prevalence of a disease in the population as a whole, really this is more a question of study design. So, for instance: How are patients referred to this clinic? The prevalence of a disorder at a tertiary care center in a specialized clinic will be much higher than that found in family practice. Are there barriers to accessing care (e.g. insurance) that may cause the prevalence to be underestimated? What time window are you using to sample the cases? If you want the prevalence at a particular point (e.g. over one year) you need to make sure your random sample only includes charts from that time period. There are many good texts on clinical epidemiology that can help you with some of these considerations: http://www.amazon.ca/Clinical-Epidemiology-Robert-Fletcher-MSc/dp/1451144474 http://www.springer.com/public+health/book/978-0-387-09833-3 If you're looking specifically at the prevalence in your particular environment, some of these concerns may be less important. The equation for the sample size required to estimate a proportion (i.e. prevalence) in one sample is given by: $$ n = \frac{z^{2}_{1-a/2}p(1-p)}{d^2} $$ where: d = the desired precision p = the estimated proportion z = the number of standard errors away from the mean (1.96 for 95% confidence) If you don't have a good estimate of the proportion, choosing p =0.5 will maximize the sample size estimate.
