Toggle dragging of Google Map markers once added as Draggable

I'm developing a Google Map API v2 app, where markers are loaded from a database. These markers can then be dragged to a new location by a user and saved to the database. I'm adding these markers as draggable, however I don't just want the users to be able to drag them accidentally. So I have added a button to enable the dragging and then press again to disable it. Only problem is I'm not sure how I can toggle the ability to drag the markers without reloading them again, as there could be a few hundred markers on the map and may take some time. Any ideas how I could achieve this? Thanks
