How to perform isometric log-ratio transformation

I have data on movement behaviours (time spent sleeping, sedentary, and doing physical activity) that sums to approximately 24 (as in hours per day). I want to create a variable that captures the relative time spent in each of these behaviours - I've been told that an isometric log-ratio transformation would accomplish this. It looks like I should use the ilr function in R, but can't find any actual examples with code. Where do I start? The variables I have are time spent sleeping, average sedentary time, average average light physical activity, average moderate physical activity, and average vigorous physical activity. Sleep was self-reported, while the others are averages from valid days of accelerometer data. So for these variables, cases do not sum to exactly 24. My guess: I'm working in SAS, but it looks like R will be much easier to use for this part. So first import data with only the variables of interest. Then use acomp() function. Then I can't figure out the syntax for the ilr() function. Any help would be much appreciated.
