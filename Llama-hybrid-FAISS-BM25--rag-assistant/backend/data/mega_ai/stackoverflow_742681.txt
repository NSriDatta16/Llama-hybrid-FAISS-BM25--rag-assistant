1) Two tiers -- raw data, and summarized data. For raw data, indexes will likely be of no help. You are doing aggregations, in most cases that necessitates a full table scan. If it doesn't, reorganize so it does, it'll be faster. 2) Figure out your aggregates, automatically generate them, and run the reports off the aggregate data. Do index these summary tables! 3) Avoid joins. Aggregate, materialize results of the group-bys, then join the aggregated results. 4) Partition. Keep data for one day (or whatever granularity makes sense) separate from data for another day. Make automated table creation scripts if necessary (grown-up -- or feature-heavy, depending on your point of view -- databases give you something called "partitioning" to do this in a more sane way). 5) Read up on "data warehousing" http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_warehouse
