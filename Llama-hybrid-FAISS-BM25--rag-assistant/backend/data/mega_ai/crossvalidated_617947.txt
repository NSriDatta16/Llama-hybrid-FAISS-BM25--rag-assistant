How to measure effective sample size for multivariate time series?

I am working with images collected over time from a fixed camera. Since the scene doesn't change for long periods, my effective sample size is much lower than the actual number of images I've collected. I would like to compute the effective sample size (ESS) for my data as described here . However, since each of the data points is an image and not a scalar, my time series is actually a vector time series: $$ S = \langle\vec{x}^{(1)}, \vec{x}^{(2)}, \ldots, \vec{x}^{(t)}, \ldots\rangle $$ where $\vec{x}^{(t)}_{i,j}$ denotes the intensity of pixel $i,j$ at time $t$ . I am wondering how to compute the effective sample size in this multivariate setting. One way would be to consider each pixel as a separate time series with its own effective sample size and to compute the average ESS over all pixels. Or I could compute the minimum ESS, though this would be extremely pessimistic since some background pixels rarely change value. Is there a "better" or established way to compute effective sample size in a multivariate time series or image data?
