As Mark has said, IEnumerable is just an interface. Object[] and List (and most any other generic collection in the .NET framework) actually implement the IEnumerable interface. A more appropriate question would be whether Object[] or List or LinkedList etc. are better. An array of Objects (ie Object[]) will have the smallest memory footprint because the List can possibly be double the memory size of an array (depending on how many elements are in the list). When you add an item to a List and the internal array is full, it doubles the size of the array in an attempt to make the addition of new elements faster on average from an algorithmic perspective.
