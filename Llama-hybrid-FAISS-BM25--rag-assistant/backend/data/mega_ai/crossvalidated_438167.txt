Using a sample obtained via McMc for Monte Carlo

Suppose we have a sample obtained via McMc. In order to use this sample for Monte-Carlo we need the sample to be independent. However our sample obtained via McMc is not independent, how can we justify using this? I think I know of a tactic which allows us to take every Nth value of the sample to minimise the dependency. Can we use this sample without this tactic? I ask because my lecturer used a sample to obtain an estimate of the mean, however he did not take every Nth value. I think there is a hole in my understanding but I am not sure where. Many thanks gang
