Deep Learning has been around for a long time. CNN,RNN,Boltzmann Machines sure look like new techniques but they were developed long time back. Check the history of deep learning . The resurgence of Deep Learning is due to the fact that the computational powers increased exponentially from that time. With a laptop equipped with GPUs you can train a complex Deep Learning model is a very small time as compared to its previous days. Deep learning models are also very efficient empirically. Current state of the art in Images,Speech and many fields is Deep Learning models. I believe due to these factors we can see lot of NLP/ML community has shifted its focus on Deep Learning.
