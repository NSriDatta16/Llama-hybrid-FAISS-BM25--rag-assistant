Books on non-parametric theory with correlated data

Short question: I am looking for books that deal with correlated data in a systematic and theoretical way. Long version: Right now I am developing approximation algorithms for time series data (more concrete I want to approximate a function $f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^3$ where $[a,b]$ is a time interval). The raw approximation of that data shall not be of concern for this question. However, what has a certain relevance for my works is a proof of correctness of the developed algorithm. That means that I have to take the measurement error of the data that is to be approximated into account. Problem with that is that I do not know a lot on the distribution of the error. Furthermore, I know that high absolute errors are likely to be correlated. Thus, I need to use statistical methods that do not fail completely with correlated data for my theoretical examination of the data. (Intuitively I would guess that quantiles already might be enough for my purpose, if I can justify their use reasonably.) My problem with that is that I do not have a strong knowledge on methods that hold with correlated data. All statistical methods I remember have that small but important iid among the list of their requirements. Thus, the question is: Can you recommend any good books that build up statistical methods for correlated data? As I'm looking for methods and used theory, I do need a book dealing with probability theory rather than just practical methods. My background on statistics is a bit rusty but certainly should be enough for understanding theoretical books as well. For me it is important to gain an understanding on the mathematics used for that kind of problem rather than just to get to know a lot of different tests.
