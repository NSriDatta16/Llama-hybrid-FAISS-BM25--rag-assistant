I'm doing the same thing. Xcode 4 is in pre-release, so there's not much in the way of tutorials while the tools are in a semi-NDA limbo and could be changed significantly before final release. I highly recommend reading tutorials (I'm working my way through Aaron Hillegass' books on iPhone and OSX development) that use Xcode 3, and allowing extra time for learning where to map across to the new version. Xcode 4 is much better organised, so it can be annoying but not impossible to find what you are looking for fairly quickly. Resources you should go to first: WWDC10 sessions 307, 308 and 315 : Introducing Xcode 4, Developing your app with Xcode 4, and Using Interface Builder in Xcode 4. Access these through the developer portal. They are the definitive Apple guide to the new design and workflow. In the Xcode 4 Help menu, the Xcode 4 Transition guide is the second choice. I skimmed it, then kept coming back to dive into topics when they came up.
