Well, I've ended up breaking the machine into multiple machines in order to prevent Ragel from eating all available memory - in fact, I had to break up the machine into a couple of separate Ragel files because the generated java class had too many constants in it from the huge state tables generated. I'm still interested in hearing of a better solution for this, if anybody has one!
