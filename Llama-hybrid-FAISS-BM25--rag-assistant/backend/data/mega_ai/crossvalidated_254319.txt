Using skewed factor scores from PCA in regression analysis

I want to use the first predicted factor score from PCA as an independent variable in the regression analysis. The factor score is skewed. Is it plausible to apply the ln transformation to the factor score, so to treat the factor scores as ordinary numeric independent variables?
