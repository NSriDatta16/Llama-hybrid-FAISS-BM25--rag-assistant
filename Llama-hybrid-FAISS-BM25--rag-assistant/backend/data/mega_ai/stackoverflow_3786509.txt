Mercurial has a filter system that lets you mangle files when they are read from the repository or written back. If you have a program like the SSH agent running that lets you do non-interactive encryption and decryption, then this might just be workable. As Ryan points out, this will necessarily lead to a bigger repository since each encrypted version of your files will look completely different from the previous version. Mercurial detects this and stores the versions uncompressed (encrypted files cannot be compressed anyway). Since you will use this for dotfiles, you can ignore the space overhead, but it's something to take into consideration if you will be versioning bigger files in encrypted form. Please post a mail to Mercurial mailing list with your experiences so that other users can benefit from them too.
