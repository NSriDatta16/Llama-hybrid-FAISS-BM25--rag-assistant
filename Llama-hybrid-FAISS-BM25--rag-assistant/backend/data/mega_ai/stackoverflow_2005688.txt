Select DIV with highest z-index

Example code so I can start explaining this problem: 5 2 1 4 3 (z-index values do not matter, and their order, even less. Just example code) Problem: I want to select (either using CSS or JS with jQuery) the DIV with highest z-index value. In the case above, I want to select the first one, because it's z-index 5 is higher than all the others' z-indexes. Is there a way to do this? Extra information: I'm writing a Simple Window Manager with jQuery + jQuery UI, and the z-indexes are assigned by the stack option in .draggable. I can't seem to find a way to make jQuery to assign the last dragged element a class either, so I'm going by the highest z-index way. Any help please? Thanks.
