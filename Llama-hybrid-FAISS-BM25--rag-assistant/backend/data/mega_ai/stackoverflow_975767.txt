mouse followed drawing in C#

I want to to make a shared drawing board in C#. This means that two people connected via a TCP connection can draw on this board. The idea (for now) is that people can click on the screen and draw. What do you think is the best method for this? It's easy enough to draw a dot when the user clicks on a certain spot, but it gets a little more complicated when the user drags the mouse, where you need to draw a line between the last point and the current. Also that doesn't work so well, so I draw a dot where the line starts to improve things a bit, but it's not that good. Lastly, I need to also send this over TCP, so I need to distinguish between the two. I hoped that I could just send points and have it draw it on the other side, but it seems it wouldn't work. Any ideas except also sending the type? drawing http://img193.imageshack.us/img193/9697/drawingw.png EDIT: ok, I'm going with a IDrawingArgument interface that has Dispatch(myForm), and basically does double dispatch, so it solves the TCP problem (going to serialize/deserialize it). Lines are still a bit bulky.
