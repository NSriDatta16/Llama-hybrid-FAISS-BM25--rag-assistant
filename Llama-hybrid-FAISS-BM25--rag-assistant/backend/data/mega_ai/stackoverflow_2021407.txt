The netbeans tutorials can be found here: http://netbeans.org/kb/trails/java-se.html To start off, just make a plain Java project. The other types all probably include different plugins or libraries that you won't need right away. A WAR is an archive of Java classes and other files that constitutes a web application. The default version of the JDK that you have on your Mac should be fine, but if you want to upgrade or mess around with any other Java preferences, OS X offers all that for you. Apple has a good tutorial here: http://developer.apple.com/java/faq/ Edit : Ok, if you want to make a web app then the first step is to learn how a Java web app is organized. That will make your life much easier. Java EE is mostly a buzzword (IMO) and it refers to a specific set of libraries. It's not important to know what's officially considered Java EE and what isn't. To learn about what a Java web app looks like, the best place is the Tomcat manual. Read this section , then make a WAR project in Netbeans and you should have a good start. Don't try to bite off too much at first, just make a Hello, World! app.
