The representation is quite easy to implement and you should do this yourself as the internal implementation of the Scala libs may change and your data would be broken: object WeekDay extends Enumeration { type WeekDay = Value val Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun = Value } import WeekDay._ val values = Set(Mon,Wed,Fri) require(values.length s | 1 Keep in mind that storing the ordinal in the database is fragile: Storing EnumSet in a database? . You should pick a stabile ordinal for each value.
