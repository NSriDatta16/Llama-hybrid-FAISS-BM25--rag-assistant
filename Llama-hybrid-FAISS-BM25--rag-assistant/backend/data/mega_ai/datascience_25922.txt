allocation to customers

My data set contains the pickup latitude, pickup longitude of the customer and drivers current location latitude and longitude. My aim is to distribute a set of M or M-x (in the case where shortage of drivers) for N customers. The driver has to be chosen with less distance and less ETA. Any solution in data science with python or R? customer_id pickuplocationaddress pickuplatd pickuplong driverlatd driverlong
