Get a DIV wrapper to fill the entire page with CSS

I have a layout made up of several DIvs, a navbar on top, a footer dv on the bottom and a wrapper called #frame between the two to hold the content. navbar Content (c) 2010 MySite.com The content in #frame will obviously vary depending on the page, and I want to make sure that even if there's only a few lines in #frame it will fill the entire screen and ensure that #footer is always resting at the bottom of the page. Trying height:100% ends up adding vertical scrollbars because of the extra height taken up by the header and footer, and I'd definitely like to avoid this as well. I currently am getting around the issue by making #frame's CSS height 89%, but I know this is an ugly hack and will break if I change the header and/or footer. Anyone know a more elegant way to accomplish this?
