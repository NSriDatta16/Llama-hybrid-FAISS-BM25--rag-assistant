You'll want to use something like Akismet . Last I checked, it's the thing WordPress uses to prevent comment spam. It's pretty straightforward, too. Here are a couple links: Ryan Bates over at Railscasts (always excellent, but a little old so may not current with Rails 3 though) Another tutorial on using Akismet in Rails Here's a gem/plugin: Rakismet As for profanity instead of general spam, you might want something like WebPurify (first one I found). You can hack your own together by blacklisting profane words and using Ruby's elegant string handling to replace/filter them, but that would probably be a never ending battle against 1337 speak and stuff like that. Plus it's probably better practice to outsource something like that, if possible.
