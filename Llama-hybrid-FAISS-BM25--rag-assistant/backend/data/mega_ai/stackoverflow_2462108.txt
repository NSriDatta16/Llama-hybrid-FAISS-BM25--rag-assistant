Rotating on the camera might be the best option, but if you rotate before storage and the image is a JPEG, rotation is a lossy operation -- so the image you store will immediately lose some quality. Luckily, it doesn't have to be that way -- if instead of reading in the JPEG, rotating the image and then re-encoding as JPEG, there are ways to apply rotation directly to the file. JPEG is stored as a series of 8x8 cells -- they can individually be rotated and rearranged without losing quality (90 degree increments) -- then you need to update the meta-data that has the size information. Here's some C++ code you could try to port http://eng.neologica.it/download/downloadIJGWin32.html For .NET, my company ( Atalasoft ) provides an SDK that can do this. Another option is reading the JPEG, rotating and then storing as PNG, but the file size will be much larger.
