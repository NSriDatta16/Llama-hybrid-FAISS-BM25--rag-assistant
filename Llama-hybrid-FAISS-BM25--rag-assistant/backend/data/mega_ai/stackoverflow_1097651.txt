Is there a practical HTTP Header length limit?

I have a web application that adds contextual information to XmlHttpRequest objects using the setRequestHeader API. I am using a custom header name (e.g. X-Foo) and a JSON structured value. It isn't part of the URL QueryString or POST body because it is meta information about the request. Is there a practical size limit to the header value? If my JSON gets truncated, it becomes unparseable. I am most concerned with limits in Apache 2, Tomcat 6 and IIS 7. I did a Google search for http header length limit , but many of the results seem dated. There are some relevant comments in How big can a user agent string get? but not as specific as I would like. Edit: I just ran across this similar question - Maximum on http header values?
