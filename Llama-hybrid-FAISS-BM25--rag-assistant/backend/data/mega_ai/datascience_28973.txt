I didn't get what you meant by "other LDA Methods". To the best of my knowledge, Fisher method is just one. Sklearn has the implementation and you can find it here . Is it good or bad? When it comes to dimensionality reduction you don't know as dimensionality reduction methods are usually unsupervised. So if PCA works better? No one knows . At least in the context of two-class classification, Fisher method is still brilliant. Hope it helped!
