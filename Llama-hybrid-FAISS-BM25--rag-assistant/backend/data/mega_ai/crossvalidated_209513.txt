How does centering affect leverage?

For a linear regression model $Y = β_0 + β_1X$, consider the matrix $X$ and $X_c$ with centering the mean. How do you use algebra to show directly that centering does not change the leverage? I have tried to expand the $X'_c(X'_cX_c)^{-1}X_c$ matrix but that does not seem to work out.
