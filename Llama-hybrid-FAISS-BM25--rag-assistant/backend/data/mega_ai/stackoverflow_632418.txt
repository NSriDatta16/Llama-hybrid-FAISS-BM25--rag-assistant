In the name "Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saladdin ), which is the first name, and which is the last? What about in the name "Roberto Garcia y Vega" (invented)? "Chiang Kai-shek" (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chang_Kai-shek )? Spaces in names are the least of your problems! See Personal names in a global application: What to store .
