al links Articles on LSA Latent Semantic Analysis, a scholarpedia article on LSA written by Tom Landauer, one of the creators of LSA. Talks and demonstrations LSA Overview, talk by Prof. Thomas Hofmann Archived 2017-12-22 at the Wayback Machine describing LSA, its applications in Information Retrieval, and its connections to probabilistic latent semantic analysis. Complete LSA sample code in C# for Windows. The demo code includes enumeration of text files, filtering stop words, stemming, making a document-term matrix and SVD. Implementations Due to its cross-domain applications in Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Cognitive Science and Computational Linguistics, LSA has been implemented to support many different kinds of applications. Sense Clusters, an Information Retrieval-oriented perl implementation of LSA S-Space Package, a Computational Linguistics and Cognitive Science-oriented Java implementation of LSA Semantic Vectors applies Random Projection, LSA, and Reflective Random Indexing to Lucene term-document matrices Infomap Project, an NLP-oriented C implementation of LSA (superseded by semanticvectors project) Text to Matrix Generator Archived 2013-01-07 at archive.today, A MATLAB Toolbox for generating term-document matrices from text collections, with support for LSA Gensim contains a Python implementation of LSA for matrices larger than RAM.
