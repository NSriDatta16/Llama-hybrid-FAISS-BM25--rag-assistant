Logistic Regression using two categorical variables

I've been doing some work on regression, and a paper in particular caught my attention where they utilised two categorical variables in a logistic regression. From my understanding, if you're using two categorical variables, does that not just come down to conditional probabilities? Out of interest, I wrote some code, and was surprised to see that the method returned a p value (reproducible code below). I'm struggling to understand what the null and alternative hypotheses are in this context, so that I can interpret what the p value is telling me. Any assistance in dissecting the resulting model summary would be greatly appreciated. Example interpretation: P(Dep = Class1 | Pred = C) = 20/120 = 1/6 Is the model summary telling me this? Code foo Output Call: glm(formula = Dep ~ Pred, family = binomial(link = "logit"), data = foo) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.17741 -0.00003 -0.00003 0.00003 1.17741 Coefficients: Estimate Std.
