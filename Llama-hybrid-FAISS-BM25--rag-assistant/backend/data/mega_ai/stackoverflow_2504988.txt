Some people say that operator overloading in Java would lead to obsfuscation. Have those people ever stopped to look at some Java code doing some basic maths like increasing a financial value by a percentage using BigDecimal ? .... the verbosity of such an exercise becomes its own demonstration of obsfuscation. Ironically, adding operator overloading to Java would allow us to create our own Currency class which would make such mathematical code elegant and simple (less obsfuscated). It would be awesome to be able to create a Financial class or Complex number class and use simple +, -, /, * operators on their instances ... like I could in C++ way back in 1999! It's now 2024 but "Tonight I want to code like it's nineteen ninety nine..."
