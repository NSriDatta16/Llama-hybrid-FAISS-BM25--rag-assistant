Not able to check Android Service Issue

All I want to do is simply control background music in my app through a service so I am able to start it and stop it from any activity. I have everything set up perfectly when I tell the service to Toast when it is started and destroyed but as soon as I put the media play-in in there instead It starts fine and starts playing the music but as soon as a click a button to stop the service I get an error and a force close. Can anyone suggest what I am doing wrong? Here is my code: import android.app.Service; import android.content.Intent; import android.media.MediaPlayer; import android.os.IBinder; import android.widget.Toast; public class MyService extends Service { private MediaPlayer player; @Override public IBinder onBind(Intent intent) { returnnull; } @Override publicvoid onCreate() { super.onCreate(); Toast.makeText(this, "Service Started", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); MediaPlayer player = MediaPlayer.create(MyService.this, R.raw.oceanwavestest); player.start(); player.setLooping(true); } @Override publicvoid onDestroy() { super.onDestroy(); player.stop(); Toast.makeText(this, "Service Stopped", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show(); } }
