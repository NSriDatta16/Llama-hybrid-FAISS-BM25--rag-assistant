Are the consistency/data loss/query optimization issues I read about "that bad"?

As I've been looking into the differences between Postgres and MySQL, it has struck me that, if what I read is to be believed, MySQL should be (disclaimer: by reading the rest of this sentence, you agree to read the next paragraph as well) the laughingstock of the RMDB world: it doesn't enforce ACID by default, the net is rife with stories of MySQL-related data loss and by all accounts and the query optimizer is a joke. But none of this seems to matter. It's not hard to tell that MySQL has about a million times* as much hype as Postgres (it's LA M P, not LAPP), big installations of MySQL are not unheard of (LJ? Digg?) and I haven't noticed a drop in MySQL's popularity. This makes me wonder: are these "problems" with MySQL really that bad? So, if you have used MySQL for a reasonably large project **, what was your experience like? Did you use Postgres as well ? How was it worse? How was it better? *: [citation needed] **: I'm well aware that, for "small things" (blogs, what have you), MySQL (along with practically every other RDB) is just fine.
