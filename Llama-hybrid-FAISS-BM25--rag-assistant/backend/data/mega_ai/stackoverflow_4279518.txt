The local data has no allocated storage but your code is reading and writing to it. Based on the sizes though it looks like you're trying to read and write 16 bytes of storage on every iteration of the loop. Use the following instead char data[16]; while(!feof(music)){ fread(data, sizeof(char), sizeof(data), music); fwrite(data, sizeof(char), sizeof(data), speaker); }
