How can I calculate ePCP and/or Brier scores for a mixed-effects logistic regression in R

I am trying to calculate ePCP and Brier scores in R for a mixed-effect binary logistic regression. It cannot seem to find any packages that work for mixed models. I have tried the packages OOmisc and ModelGood, and spent much time searching the web with no success. I am using the lme4 package to fit the regression. I would be very grateful for any tips.
