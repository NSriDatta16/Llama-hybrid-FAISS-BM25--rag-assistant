are these repeated measures?

I have a set of 30 patients. Each patient has a variable number of observations over a variable length of time(ranging from 4 to 10 data points per patient). My outcome variable is whether they have gained or loss/stabilised their weight at any given point in time. I calculate this weight gain/loss by taking their weight on a given observation and compare it to the previous observation. Creating a dichotomous nominal Loss / Gained Weight variable. I have a few continuous explanatory variables. some are normally distributed and others non-normal. Can i treat my outcome variable as "independent observations" and use logistic regression modeling? Otherwise, is there any suggestion for which model to use?
