Gaussian process with time series

I am trying to apply Gaussian process to estimate the value of a sensor reading. I have the readings of the sensor for few years (hourly paced time series) so my data is an array of two columns the first one is the time the other one is the sensor reading at that time. I have tried to write the code of the Gaussian process but I have no idea how can I model the time as it is the input of the model, should I just use the hour as a number , so I end up with a repeated series of numbers between 0 and 23 ? should I use the UNIX time-stamp which is an integer but then I will end up with an increasing series of numbers? What is the best practice about handling this problem? In other words what is the input to the Gaussian process model when we deal with time series. If you can provide me with some code snippets in python or MATLAB that will be very appreciated. And another question, Could you recommend a Python package to deal with the problem of forecasting time series using Gaussian processes.
