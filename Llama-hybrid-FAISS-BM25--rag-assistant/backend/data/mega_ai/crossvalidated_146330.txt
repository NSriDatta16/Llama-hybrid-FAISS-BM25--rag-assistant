First, you could try power transformations (e.g. log, square root, multiplicative inverse, etc.). To determine which power transformation is best for the non-stationary covariates, you can employ the Box-Cox technique. If power transformations don't help, check the time series for seasonal trends. If they exist, deflation or seasonal adjustment may be necessary to account for those patterns. In preparation for time series modeling, consider differencing and detrending. Here's a helpful article: http://www.mathworks.com/help/econ/data-transformations.html
