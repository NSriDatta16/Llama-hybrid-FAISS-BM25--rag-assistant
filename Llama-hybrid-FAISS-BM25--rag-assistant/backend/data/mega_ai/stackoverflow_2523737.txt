NetBeans PHP run configuration: how can I omit the doc-root folder?

So I have this project in PHP where I have some include files next to the wwwroot (or doc-root) folder instead of under the wwwroot folder. I need however to run/debug this project. in the project properties I can select a index file (index.php) but it's under the doc-root folder, so the Project URL makes http://myprojectmachine/doc-root/index.php instead of ..://myprojectmachine/index.php. Manually typing in the index file doesn't work as NetBeans states the file isn't found. How can I overcome this in an elegant way?
