Do you try the scipy.stats.ttest_rel ? in the scipy API reference we can see as description: "This is a test for the null hypothesis that two related or repeated samples have identical average (expected) values." and in this page we see a good example. i use in this way: # import stats from scipy import scipy.stats as stats # define the vectors df1 = df[df.payment_type == 1].fare_amount df2 = df[df.payment_type == 2].fare_amount #simply execute t, p = stats.ttest_ind(df1, df2, alternative='two-sided') That's works fine for me; some comment and corrections are always welcome
