"Continuing" an ARMA process

I have a time series and fitted an AR(I)MA object (I really just want an ARMA process so the order is (p,0,q)) in R. Now I'd like to "continue" that process (I guess what I mean is perform simulations). I found arima.sim() but I'm not sure how to get it to use my existing time series (that I'd like to "continue"). I hope my question makes sense! Thanks!
