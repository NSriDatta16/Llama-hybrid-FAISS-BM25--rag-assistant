Should I Impute target values?

I am new to data science and I am currently playing around a bit. Data exploration and preparation is really annoying. Eventhough I use pandas. I achieved imputing missing values in independant variables. For numerical data by using the Imputer with the means strategy and for one categorical variable I used the Labelencoder and afterwards imputed with the mode strategy. But now I face the issue that the dependant variable $y$ also contains missing values. Should I delete those lines or should I impute $y$ which is numerical.
