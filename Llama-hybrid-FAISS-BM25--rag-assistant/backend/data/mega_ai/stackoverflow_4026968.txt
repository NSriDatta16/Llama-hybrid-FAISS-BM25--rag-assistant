validating user input

I am almost done with this but there are 2 things that are stumping me in my code. When I query a user for the test score, if the score is not within the 0-100 range, I want to not accept it and then tell them why and ask for another input. I also want to print the letter grade for their average next to their average score. For some reason my If logic statement isn't working when I try to check to make sure the score entered is within 0-100. Also I can't figure out how to get the letter grade to print, but I am not getting any error output so I think that I am on the right track. I think that I could mainly use pointers on my while looping to check for the number being in the range of 0-100. I would greatly appreciate it. Here is my code: import java.text.DecimalFormat; import java.util.Scanner; public class GradeReport { String name; int score1, score2, score3; double average; String grade; public GradeReport() //creates the first constructor { Scanner sc = new Scanner (System.in); System.out.println ("Enter student's name: "); name = sc.nextLine(); System.out.println ("Enter first grade: "); //try while loops to get grade in between 0-100 score1 = sc.nextInt(); while (score1 100); System.out.println("please enter a grade 0-100"); //checks that score is inclusive 1-100 System.out.println ("Enter second grade: "); score2 = sc.nextInt(); while score2 100; System.out.println("please enter a grade 0-100");//checks that score is inclusive 1-100 System.out.println ("Enter third grade: "); score3 = sc.nextInt(); while score3 100; System.out.println("please enter a grade 0-100");//checks that score is inclusive 1-100 } public GradeReport (String v1, int v2, int v3, int v4) { name = v1; //these are to initialize the variables so that I don't get null for the second set of results. score1 = v2; score2 = v3; score3 = v4; } public void calculateAvg() { average = (double)((score1 + score2 + score3) / 3.0); } public String calculateGrade() { if (average >= 90) grade = "A"; else if (average >= 80) grade = "B"; else if (average >= 70) grade = "C"; else if (average >= 60) grade = "D"; else grade = "F"; return grade; } public String toString() { DecimalFormat fmt = new DecimalFormat ("0.00"); //to format average to 2 decimal places String gradeReport = name + "\n " + Double.toString(score1) + "\t" + Double.toString(score2)+ "\t" + Double.toString(score3) + "\n" + fmt.format(average) + grade; return gradeReport; } public static void main (String[] args) { GradeReport gr1 = new GradeReport(); GradeReport gr2 = new GradeReport("Col Een", 76, 76, 75); gr1.calculateAvg(); gr1.calculateGrade(); gr2.calculateAvg(); gr2.calculateGrade(); System.out.println(gr1); System.out.println(gr2); } }
