What is a mixture of RNNs?

I am reading papers on different types of classification and prediction methods and keep coming across "Mixture of Recurrent Neural Networks" and "Mixture of Markov Chain Models". Does this refer to more than one RNN (or MC) being used, or is this referring to the probability distributions? What exactly does "mixture" mean here? One paper that mentions both of these, is "Predicting shopping behaviour with Mixture of RNNs": https://difabbrizio.com/papers/sigir-ecom-2017-cs.pdf
