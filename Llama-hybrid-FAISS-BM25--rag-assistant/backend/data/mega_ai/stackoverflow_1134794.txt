Hilbert tree: Does anyone know where to find a code implementation of this?

I'm looking for the code or even a visual demo on how this tree works. I have read this paper on Hilbert R-Trees and tried to implement the algorithms stated I get lost when I have to adjust the tree with the sets, as well as not sure on most other things. It doesn't matter what language if there is an implementation as it will be used to build a C# implementation and I will be using it for reference. Its for moving points with boundaries, that needs to have very fast insert and update calls.
