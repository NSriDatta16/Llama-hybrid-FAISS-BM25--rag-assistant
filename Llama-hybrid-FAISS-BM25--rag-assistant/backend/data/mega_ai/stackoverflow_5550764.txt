How to set a default layout in Magento 1.5 using local.xml?

So I've done some layouts that I want to use and I was thinking that setting this in your local.xml file would fix this for every page. Like this page/mytheme.phtml This however doesn't do anything. Instead if I go ... page/mytheme.phtml page/mytheme.phtml ... and so on for every specific place it gets changed on those specific pages. Am I thinking wrong or this the only way to do it?
