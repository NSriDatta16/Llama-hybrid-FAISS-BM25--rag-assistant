Paying attention to correlation between two non-stationary time series. (It is not unexpected that they will have a high correlation coefficient: search on "non-sense correlation" and "cointegration".) For example, on google correlate, dogs and ear piercings have a correlation coefficient of 0.84. For an older analysis, see Yule's 1926 exploration of the problem
