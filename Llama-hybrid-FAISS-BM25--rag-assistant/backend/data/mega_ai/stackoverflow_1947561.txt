The storage of calculated data in your database is generally an optimisation. I would suggest that you calculate the value on every request and then monitor the performance of your application. If the fact that this data is not stored becomes an issue for you then is the time to refactor and store the value within the database. Storing calculated values, particularly those that can affect multiple tables are generally a bad idea for the reasons that you have mentioned. When/if you do refactor and store the value in the DB then you probably want a batch job that checks the value for data integrity on a regular basis.
