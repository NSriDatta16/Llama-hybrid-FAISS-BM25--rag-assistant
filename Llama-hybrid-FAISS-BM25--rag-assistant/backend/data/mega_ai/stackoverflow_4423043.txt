Most cloud storages (Table Storage is one of those) do not offer scalable writes on a single entity/blob/whatever. There is no quick-fix for this limitation, as this limitation comes from the core tradeoff that have being made to create cloud storage in the first place. Basically, a storage unit (entity/blob/whatever) can be updated about once every 20ms, and that's about it. Having a dedicated worker or not will not change anything to this aspect. Instead, you need to address your task from from a different angle. For counters, the most usual approach is the use of sharded counters (link is for GAE, but you can implement an equivalent behavior on Azure). Also, another way to ease the pain to go for an asynchronous architecture ala CQRS where the performance constraints you put on the update latency of entities is significantly relaxed.
