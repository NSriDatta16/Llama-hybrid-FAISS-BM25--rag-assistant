Help with Magento and related products

I have a customer product page that literally lives beside the catalog/product/view.phtml page. It's basically identical to that page with a few small exceptions. It's basically a 'product of the day' type page so I can't combine it with the regular product page since I have to fetch the data from the DB and perform a load to get the product information $_product = Mage::getModel('catalog/product')->load($row['productid']); To make a long story short, everything works (including all children html blocks) with the singular exception of the related products. After the load I save the product into the registry with Mage::register('product', $_product); and then attempt to load the related products with: echo $this->getLayout()->createBlock('catalog/product_view')->setTemplate('catalog/product/list/related.phtml')->toHtml();` All of which give back the error: Fatal error: Call to a member function getSize() on a non-object in catalog/product/list/related.phtml on line 29`, and line 29 is getItems()->getSize()): ?>`. Any help getting the relateds to load would be appreicated.
