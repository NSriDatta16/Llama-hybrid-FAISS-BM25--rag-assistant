You can use as many layers of hyperparameterizaiton as you want. It's not typically done in practice because these additional layers rapidly obscure the problem that you're trying to work on. Gelman's Bayesian Data Analysis (2nd and 3rd eds both) touches on this topic, but I can't find the particular reference right now. On the other hand, addtional layers of hyperparameters may be necessary to constrain posterior variance, admit additional domain knowledge, or if the data only poorly identifies the parameters.
