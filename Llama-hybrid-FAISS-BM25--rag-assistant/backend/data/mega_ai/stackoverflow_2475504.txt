This worked for me in Word 2007, but it seems like an awful work-around. Try using the clipboard to set a keyword in the document, then handle the WindowSelectionChange event that seems to fire reliably after text insertion to do what you really want to get done. public void listBox1_MouseDown(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { Clipboard.SetText(" "); IDataObject dObject = Clipboard.GetDataObject(); //This is extremely buggy coming from VSTO, this is why the clipboard is used. DoDragDrop(dObject, DragDropEffects.All); } void Application_WindowSelectionChange(Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Selection Sel) { if (Sel.Range.Text == " ") { Sel.Range.Text = string.Empty; // Do some action } }
