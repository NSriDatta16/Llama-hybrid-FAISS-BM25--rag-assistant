A sematically more appropriate way would be to define one main class (for example, FanStatistics or whatever you want to call it), in which you define general methods, like the average method, and the subclass it into FanSpeed and FanTemp . That way you wouldn't confuse the names, as the temperature is not a subclass, or specialization, of the speed â€“ but the speed and the temperature are both specializations of the abstract statistics data.
