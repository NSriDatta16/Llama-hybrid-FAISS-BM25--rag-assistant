document.write( (1 "); The operator is defined as working on signed 32-bit integers (converted from the native Number storage of double-precision float). So 1 must result in a negative number. The only JavaScript operator that works using unsigned 32-bit integers is >>> . You can exploit this to convert a signed-integer-in-Number you've been working on with the other bitwise operators to an unsigned-integer-in-Number: document.write(( (1 >>0 )+' '); Meanwhile: document.write( (1 "); won't work because all shift operations use only the lowest 5 bits of shift (in JavaScript and other C-like languages too). is equal to , ie. no change.
