yes you can check the event type and add a conditional for your function to execute private function mouseEventHandler(event:MouseEvent):void { switch( event.type ) { case MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN: dragClip(); break; case MouseEvent.CLICK: removeListeners(); clickHandler(); break; } } private function dragClip():void { //remove listeners while you're dragging //add them back on mouse up removeListeners(); } private function clickHandler():void { //do what you need //then re-add the event listeners when the action is done addListeners(); } if you still can't distinguish using this method, you may have to create a second handler for the conflicting functions... come to think of it , you could also consider disabling other mouse event handlers when one is active... just a thought
