I don't know the nature of the datum you wish to display, but for fast accomplishment, the System.Windows.Forms.DataGridView does the job well and is embedded in .Net Framework 2.0. If you're used to work with Linq to SQL Classes, if you're using SQL Server as the datastore, just create your DBML diagram and: Add a data source ; From the Data Source tool window, select the display as grid, and drag-drop it on your form ; Edit the columns and reorder them as you want them to be displayed for your client ; In the code, set the DataGridView.DataSource = someObject.GetList() which will return an IList of the object you wish to display in this grid. This only requires about ten lines of code and a few Windows Forms design-time. I hope I didn't forget anything crucial. :-P Please let know whether it helps!
