Your logic is slightly off. The second || should be && : if ((!isset($action)) || ($action != "add" && $action != "delete")) You can see why your original line fails by trying out a sample value. Let's say $action is "delete" . Here's how the condition reduces down step by step: // $action == "delete" if ((!isset($action)) || ($action != "add" || $action != "delete")) if ((!true) || ($action != "add" || $action != "delete")) if (false || ($action != "add" || $action != "delete")) if ($action != "add" || $action != "delete") if (true || $action != "delete") if (true || false) if (true) Oops! The condition just succeeded and printed "error", but it was supposed to fail. In fact, if you think about it, no matter what the value of $action is, one of the two != tests will return true. Switch the || to && and then the second to last line becomes if (true && false) , which properly reduces to if (false) . There is a way to use || and have the test work, by the way. You have to negate everything else using De Morgan's law , i.e.: if ((!isset($action)) || !($action == "add" || $action == "delete")) You can read that in English as "if action is not (either add or remove), then".
