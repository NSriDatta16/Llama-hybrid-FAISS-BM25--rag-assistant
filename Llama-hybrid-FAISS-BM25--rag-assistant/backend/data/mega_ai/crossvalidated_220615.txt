You have been caught in the trap of the difference between anova() and lm() in the ways that they partition variance among the predictor variables. The anova() function uses Type I sums of squares, as explained in this answer . In this approach, you look at the predictor variables in the order that they are entered into the model . In your case, you first determine how much variance is explained by the set of group variables, then how much of what remains is explained by time , then how much of the residual is explained by the interaction terms. In the summary of an lm() model with interactions, each level of the categorical variables, all continuous variables, and all interaction terms are examined in parallel, evaluating each of them with all the others taken into account . This can, as you see, lead to apparently different results from anova() even with the same underlying model. Further complicating the interpretation is, as you show, the default display with comparisons against the reference level of a categorical variable. Thus even the results for your continuous predictor, year , differ depending on which value of the categorical group variable is chosen as reference; as you are including interaction terms, the displayed result for year in summary(lm()) will be the coefficient for year for the reference category, not overall. For the case at hand, as the anova() shows no significant interaction term you should be OK with continuing your analysis on a linear model without interactions, and proceeding with standard post-hoc tests for your groups. That said, you should check whether the time-course nature of your data might be violating the assumptions of independent observations that are required for standard interpretation of p -values. Following values over time can lead to data correlation structures that require formal analysis as repeated measures or time series. Also, note that there seems to be an error in your very last displayed analysis. You seem to have tried to set "Z" to the reference by changing its label to "A", but it looks like "W" remained as the reference in the summary output. The relevel() function in R allows you to change the reference level without changing the labels themselves.
