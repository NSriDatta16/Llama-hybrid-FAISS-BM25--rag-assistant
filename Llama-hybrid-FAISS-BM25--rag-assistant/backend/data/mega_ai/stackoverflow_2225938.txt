Elegant solution to read and transform query string in php?

I have a query string such as this: file.php?search=keyword+here&genre1=1&genre4=1&genre19=1&genre181&director=436&actor=347&search_rating=3 I need to extract all the genres mentioned in the string, in this case its genre1, genre4, genre19 and genre18 and output them into a string such as ge1_ge4_ge19_ge18 What would be a good solution for this?
