If you will just draw brush shape on Graphics on each MOUSE_MOVE, you will get discontinous traces on fast mouse movements and soon there will be lot of vector shapes in Graphics, dragging the performance down. It is better to add each stroke into bitmap (and bitmap can be erased unlike vectors). For best results, you need to calculate brush shape extended into direction of stroke - circle would become oval, square become rectangle or hexagon. For a start, you can quite easily emulate round brush with lines of some thickness.
