The ratio of the means is not the mean of the ratios. $$ \dfrac{\sum_j x_j}{\sum_j y_j} = \sum_j w_j \dfrac{x_j}{y_j},$$ where $w_j = \dfrac{y_j}{\sum_j y_j}$. The correct way in this case is to calculate the ratio of the means of each coefficient, which converges to the ratio of the coefficients by the law of large numbers. Calculate the ratios $r_j=b_1^{(j)}/b_2^{(j)}$. Using the sample of ratios, approximate the probability $P(b_1/b_2>0)$. This is the posterior probability of your hypothesis. This can be done by approximating the distribution of the ratios using a kernel density estimator and the by integrating this over $(0,\infty)$. A second method consists of dividing the number of positive ratios by the total number of ratios, as you did. THIS IS NOT A P-VALUE, p-values have nothing to do with Bayesian statistics. You have to understand what posterior probabilities mean. Try to read a book on the fundamentals of this theory. For your last problem, calculate the sample of ratios for each group, say $r_A$ and $r_B$. Then, approximate $P(r_A>r_B) = P(r_B https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/30148
