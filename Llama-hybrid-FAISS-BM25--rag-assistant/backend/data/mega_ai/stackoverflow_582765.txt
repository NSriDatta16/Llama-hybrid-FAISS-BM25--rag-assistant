I cant think of a single thing that Hudson hasnt been able to do for our C# development, even with MSTest based tests, you can now run and trendgraph on them with the new plugin (only works if you are testing ONE assembly) or my method which works on multiple assemblies. I suppose the only thing that would be nice, would be to generate code coverage data and report on that, not sure if CC.net does that. Also, Hudson seems to have much stronger community support. I've never heard of someone picking CC.net over Hudson if they had the choice. We use it to Deploy windows services Deploy web services Run MSTests & display as much information as any junit tests Keep track of low,med,high tasks trendgraph warnings and errors These things may not be anything new to Hudson, but I felt the need to re emphasize that Hudson can handle this with a .net project, no problem. Here are some of the built in .net stuff that Hudson supports MSBuild NAnt MSTest (two methods, linked above) Nunit Team Foundation Server fxcop stylecop compiler warnings code tasks Also, god forbid you are using visual source safe, it supports that as well . I'd recommend you take a look at Redsolo's article on building .net projects using Hudson
