If you tell Rack to run MyApp , you need to define class MyApp first (which you're supposed to do inside MyApp.rb). Derive your class from Sinatra::Base to make it a Sinatra-Rack-App that can be run from config.ru: require 'sinatra/base' class MyApp See also Sinatra's README about modular Sinatra apps (search for the paragraph named "Modular Apps" on http://github.com/sinatra/sinatra/ )
