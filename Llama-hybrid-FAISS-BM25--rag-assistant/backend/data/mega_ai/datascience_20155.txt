You are definitely doing a great job of getting your basics down. I really like Patrick Winston's AI Course , he does a great job of conceptualizing the math behind these problems, which is the only place I think Ng lacks. Find a ton of papers you think are interesting, and read them top to bottom. Here is one from spotify on NLP (super awesome) Most importantly, IMO, the thing you need to start doing is applying the stuff you learn, to problems you think are interesting. Do a few run throughs of other stuff on github and then start doing your own! Good luck, hope that was helpful:)
