Why do we care if an MA process is invertible?

I am having trouble understanding why we care if an MA process is invertible or not. Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I can understand why we care whether or not an AR process is causal, ie if we can "re-write it," so to speak, as the sum of some parameter and white noise - ie a moving average process. If so, we can easily see that the AR process is causal. However, I'm having trouble understanding why we care whether or not we can represent an MA process as an AR process by showing that it is invertible. I don't really understand why we care. Any insight would be great.
