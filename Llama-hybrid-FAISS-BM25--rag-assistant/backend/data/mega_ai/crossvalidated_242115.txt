Controlling for overall economic factors and seasonality in a time series?

Let's say I have a time series of retail clothing sales. I want to see the sales data adjusted for several factors - overall economic trend and seasonality. I can do a seasonal decomposition with the assumption of an annual seasonality and linear trend, and use the residuals to see my time series adjusted for those factors. Or, I can use a control group (the overall retail clothing sales across my country) and subtract that out to get a time series presumably adjusted for trend and seasonality (and other factors). I could also do seasonal decomposition on the entire national data set, to determine national trends and seasonality and subtract that from my regional sales data. What are the differences between these three methods, and what would be the proper way to do this?
