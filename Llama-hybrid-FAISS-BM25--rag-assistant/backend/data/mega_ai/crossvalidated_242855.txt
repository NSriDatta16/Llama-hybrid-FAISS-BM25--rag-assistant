What is the difference of learning Latent features using SVD and using embedding vectors in deep network

Traditionally, singular value decomposition (SVD) can be used to learn latent feature of user and items according to user-item rating matrix. Recently, researchers use embedding layers as the input layer of a deep neural network to learn latent representation of entities, like users or items. What is the difference between these two? What is the possible advantages of embedding method over SVD?
