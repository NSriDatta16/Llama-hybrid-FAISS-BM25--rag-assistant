The br tags introduce a line break , not a new paragraph. If you want paragraphs, use p : $message1 = " Someone made the following comment on your submission $submission: $comment Please click the link below to see the comment in context. "; I assume you have sanitized $comment . If you haven't, the user can almost completely control how the e-mail will look like.
