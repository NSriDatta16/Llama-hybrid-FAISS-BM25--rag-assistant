I don't think so. In fact, In more recent versions they've added features to the project manager to make it easier to deal with the fact that code is spread around different directories (such as the flatten directories option), so I think it is accepted that this is how many people organize their code. I suspect it's more to do with projects growing organically over time, and whether anyone takes the time to tidy up.
