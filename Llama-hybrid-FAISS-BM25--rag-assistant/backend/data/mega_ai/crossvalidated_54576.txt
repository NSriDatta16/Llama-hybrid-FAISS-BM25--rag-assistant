self-organizing maps and order of samples

I've just started learning about self-organizing maps without much of a background in neural networks, so forgive me if this question seems trivial, but it seems that a SOM depends on which order the input training data points are fed into the SOM? So it's possible to obtain different visualizations for the same training data?
