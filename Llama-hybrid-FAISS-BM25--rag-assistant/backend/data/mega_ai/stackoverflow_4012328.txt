Various options: remove the cyclic dependencies from your model; this might be tricky for a generated model that has lots of existing code built against it, but is worth a try ; however, you typically want to not serialize the parent , which is exactly what LINQ-to-SQL wants you to keep (it'll let you drop the children property, but that is what you usually want to serialize) enable cyclic references; it looks like you've tried this without success; did you enable it at both ends , though? Actually I wouldn't be surprised if Silverlight doesn't like this extension (it has limited extension support) use a separate (flat) DTO model for data transfer purposes try using NetDataContractSerializer; I can't remember if this is supported in Silverlight, and I must admit I'm not its biggest fan, but it might be a pragmatic fix here I'd vote firmly in the "DTO model" category; simply, having a separate model means you are less likely to run into tangles whenever you tweak the DB - and you are in complete control over it.
