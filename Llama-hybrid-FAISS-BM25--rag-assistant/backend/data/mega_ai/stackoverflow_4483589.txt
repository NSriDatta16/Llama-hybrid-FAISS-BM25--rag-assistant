Questions on Scala from a C++ programmer (structs and stl)

I am having problems translating C++ data structures to Scala. Scala is really different from C++, but I like a lot of it. I have the following Code fragment in C++: struct Output { double point; double solution[6]; }; struct Coeff { double rcont1[6]; double rcont2[6]; double rcont3[6]; double rcont4[6]; double rcont5[6]; double rcont6[6]; }; std::list output; std::list coeff; I now fill the list in a while loop with data while(n I tried creating a simple class in Scala to hold the data. class Output { var point: Double var solution: Array[Double] = new Array(6) } But this doens't work since point is not initialized. Is there a way around this? I just want to define the variable but not initialize it. Another quick thing. I am looking for an equivalent to stl::lower_bound. Is finds the right position to insert an element in an sorted container to maintain the order. Thanks for helping a Scala beginner
