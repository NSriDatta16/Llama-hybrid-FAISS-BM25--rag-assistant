The question you ask is a whole area of research called topical text categorization. A great overview of techniques is "Machine learning in automated text categorization" in ACM Computing Surveys, by Fabrizio Sebastiani. . One of the simplest techniques (though not necessarily the best performing) is to have numerous (hundreds) examples of sentences in each category, and then train a Naive Bayesian classifier on those sample sentences. NLTK contains a Naive Bayesian classifier in the module nltk.classify.naivebayes .
