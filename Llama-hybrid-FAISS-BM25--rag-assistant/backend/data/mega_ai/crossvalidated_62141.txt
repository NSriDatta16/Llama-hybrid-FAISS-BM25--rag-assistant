Fixed effects have df=0 and chi-sq=0 when tested using anova()

I have a made a linear mixed model using lmer() . I began with a maximal model containing 6 terms and all two-way interactions (15 total), I also have a random effect of subject ID. Of these terms, 11 interactions were significant and so were kept in the final model. I found this by dropping interactions and comparing to previous model using anova() . As all 6 fixed terms are part of a significant interaction they remained in the model. My problem is that when I tried to test the fixed terms to find a chi-squared value for them by removing the term and comparing to the full model, the anova output said chisq = 0, df=0 but that p . I don't understand how p can be so small if chisq = 0 . I also don't understand why df=0 which would suggest I am comparing the same model when actually I have removed a term. What does this mean? Have I fit too many interactions to my data (I only have 160 data points). Is there any point in finding the chi-squared value for these fixed effects?
