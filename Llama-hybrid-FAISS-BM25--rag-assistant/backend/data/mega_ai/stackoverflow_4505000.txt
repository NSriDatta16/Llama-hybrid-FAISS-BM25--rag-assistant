MVC for dummies: why does controller have to send anything to views? This is the main point of MVC: to create loose coupling by separating and distinguishing the application's concerns. You have the View, Model, and Controller doing specific tasks. Why the need for separation because it's hard to debug and fix a one gigantic godzilla app. Imagine fixing a car made from stone. There are no bolts. Everything is chiseled from a big rock. How hard is fixing that if you just want to change the wheels. You will need to chisel out the rock itself. The main job of the controller is to handle requests and display the appropriate view. That it's job. It's like asking why does the mailman need to send the mail. Because that's his job.
