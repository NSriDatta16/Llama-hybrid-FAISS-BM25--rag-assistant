What is the name for non-time series data?

This feels like it might be a stupid question with a quick answer, but is there a specific term for a dataset that is not classed as time series data? I do not mean descriptions of the variables e.g. discrete, continuous etc., I mean for a dataset as a whole; for example, what kind of dataset is the classic iris dataset, which does not contain a time dimension?
