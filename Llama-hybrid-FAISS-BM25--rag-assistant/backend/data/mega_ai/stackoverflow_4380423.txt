Are you using development storage? If so I would highly recommend that you read Differences Between Development Storage and Windows Azure Storage Services . It sounds like you are hitting the issue that is unique to development storage in which you cannot query a table that has never contained any entities: In development storage, querying on a property that does not exist in the table returns an error. Such a query does not return an error in the cloud. A dev storage workaround is documented here : [E]nsure that the table storage knows about the structure of your objects. var query = from x in context.CreateQuery(VehicleTableName) select x; var l = query.ToList(); var v = new Vehicle(); context.AddVehicle(v); context.SaveChanges(); context.DeleteObject(v); context.SaveChanges();
