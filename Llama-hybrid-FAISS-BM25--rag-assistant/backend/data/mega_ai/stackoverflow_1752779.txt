def myGetTotals(self, team): count = 0 for aKey in self.lineup: if team in self.lineup[aKey]: count = count + self.lineup[aKey][team] return count Kind of verbose, but meh. Do pay attention to the first parameter which is the instance. Now, if you want it to be part of all team objects, you'd need to modify the class: lib.schedule.Team.getTotals = myGetTotals That should add said object to the class definition and make existing objects capable of using it from there on forth. It's been a few months since I coded some Python, but it should work.
