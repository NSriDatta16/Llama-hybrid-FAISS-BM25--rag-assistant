I don't have a specific answer to your question, but I'd say the right approach is not to muck about with the NSNumberFormatter at all and concentrate on trying to change the characters generated by the keyboard. The default locale for number formatters is usually the system's default locale as set by the user in the internationalization settings. If you change that behaviour programmatically for UI elements, you are effectively telling the user "I know better than you how you want to input numbers". Arrogance of that sort on the part of the developer never gets them good marks with respect to UI design. In fact, you could apply the same argument to remapping the dot button on the numeric keypad. How do you know that the user hasn't set US keyboard layout because it allows them to get a dot from that key? Maybe they consider it more important to be able to type the thousands separator from the keypad than the decimal separator. I'm not saying you shouldn't implement your feature, just make sure that the user has control over when it is enabled or disabled. Anyway, you probably want to override the keyDown event on the control. More info here .
