Is Blogengine.NET a stable blogging platform?

I implement many themes in Blogengine.net 2.0 for many users and have lots of problems with it then i need to thing first that are it is really stable. when i use Be.net 2.0 pagination in the stable version wrongly coded they never update them even someone reported them many time. means no one care about bad thing populated in Be.net 2.0 when i learn them their is too much blog but not as much as wordpress no problem but if you have a question their is no one answer you or answer you got from community going too late. this is not like a wordpress community then you question and get response quickly. the first and 2nd is small issue no problem i have from that but a big problem is that functionality in blogengine.net not working well as in wordpress and in some other cms have every functionality well designed. i found many issue i reported from other when i implement theme from them like. 3.1 if someone write a post who are in future date , in draft , or published then sometime they show addpost page instead of editpost page. this make sometime user feel dirty because you know what they thing when they write a big post and found that all their craft goes left 3.2 Be.net have less functionality then any average other CMS no problem if it's less the issue that sometime you not found what's going wrong whenever their is a issue in the code you write or refactor existing pattern in blogengine.net SO i want to know are Blogengine.net 2.0 really have stable version or they make them only for showing that they have really same thing as other. the issue is not customization or implement things but if you use them then when more error or issue come who believe on it.
