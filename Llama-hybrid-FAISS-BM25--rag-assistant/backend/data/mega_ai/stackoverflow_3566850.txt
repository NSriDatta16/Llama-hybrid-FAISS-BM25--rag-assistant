The only way for an upcast to return null-pointer is when you pass a null-pointer as an argument for the cast. The second possibility is this case is that your are thinking that you are performing an upcast , while in reality it is not an upcast. You haven't shown any code that calls the function with the cast, so there's no way to say what is happening there. Looking at your code: there's no upcast in your code. What you are trying to do is a downcast . And the argument you passed to the function is passed by value , which means that it got sliced in the process. No wonder the downcast fails. It should fail. You have to pass either by pointer or by reference to use dynamic_cast . P.S. Don't use HTML tags to format code on SO. Use the "Code" button.
