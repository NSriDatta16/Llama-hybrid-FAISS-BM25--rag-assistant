The probability model they are assuming for the binary outcome is the Bernoulli distRibution with success proportion p. The Bernoulli random variable has variance = p(1-p). The sum of n independent identically distributed random variables is the binomial with parameters n and p. The average of the n Bernoulli variable is an unbiased and maximum likelihood estimate for p. Its distribution is determined by the binomial. By the central limit theorem this estimate is approximately normal for large n because it is a sample mean whose distribution satisfies the necessary conditions. Now the theory tells us that the estimates variance is p(1-p)/n. So it makes sense to apply this formula with the estimate for p plugged in. This is better than simply using the sample standard error estimate which doesn't take account of the special form of the variance for the binomial. So a hypothesis test on the proportion can be made using the normal distribution approximation. That explains 2. Regarding 1, the error standard deviation is the standard deviation of the model residuals and not the standard deviation for the Bernoulli variable Y.
