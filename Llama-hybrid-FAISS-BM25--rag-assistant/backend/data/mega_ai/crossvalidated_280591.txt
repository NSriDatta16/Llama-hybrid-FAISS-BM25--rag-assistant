which neural network to use?

I have explored this site for the answer but could not find what i was looking for. My problem is i have data containing many variables (22) that are continuos and categorical and my output has two levels 1(present) or 0 (absent). My questions are: 1) What type of library, for a neural network model, would be best for this type of data ( nnet or neuralnet in r ) 2) I have been told that this is a regression problem not a classification, however since my output only has two levels why is this regression and not classification?
