Note that any NLP logic like this will be subject to attacks of "character replacement": For example, I can write "hello" as "he11o", replacing L's with One's. Same with obscenities. So while there's no perfect answer, a "blacklist" approach of "bad words" might work. Watch out for false positives (I'd run my blacklist against a large book to see what comes up)
