The key here is that you say "If I type in a URL directly...". By default under forms authentication the browser caches pages for the user. So, selecting a URL directly from the browsers address box dropdown, or typing it in, MAY get the page from the browser's cache, and never go back to the server to check authentication/authorization. The solution to this is to prevent client-side caching in the Page_Load event of each page, or in the OnLoad() of your base page: Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); You might also like to call: Response.Cache.SetNoStore();
