Firefox 3 CORS XMLHTTPRequest doesn't seem to work

I implemented a REST service, which I'm calling from a javascript application on a different domain. I'm attempting to do a GET request, and setting the Authorization: header, with a custom authentication scheme. Because I'm setting a custom header, Firefox will start with a preflight OPTIONS request. This request looks like this (simplified): OPTIONS /v1/articles HTTP/1.1 Host: example.org User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US; rv:1.9.2.13) Gecko/20101206 Ubuntu/10.10 (maverick) Firefox/3.6.13 FirePHP/0.5 Origin: http://example.com Access-Control-Request-Method: GET Access-Control-Request-Headers: authorization My response is as follows: HTTP/1.1 200 OK Date: Wed, 15 Dec 2010 16:36:47 GMT Server: Apache/2.2.9 (Debian) PHP/5.3.3-0.dotdeb.1 with Suhosin-Patch mod_vhost_hash_alias/1.0 X-Powered-By: PHP/5.3.3-0.dotdeb.1 Access-Control-Allow-Origin: http://example.com Access-Control-Request-Method: GET,POST,PUT,DELETE,HEAD,OPTIONS Access-Control-Request-Headers: Authorization, X-Authorization Content-Length: 2 Content-Type: application/json After this, the actual GET request is simply not performed. I'm worried I made a mistake in my response, but I can't seem to spot it. The other problem is that I've found no way to get a detailed error message. As you can see, I also tried X-Authorization instead of Authorization. My questions: Is there something wrong with my response? How can I find more details about the problem? Thanks!
