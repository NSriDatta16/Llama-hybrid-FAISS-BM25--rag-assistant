#include being ignored

So, I've got this code I'm trying to update. It was written for visual studio 6, and I'm trying to get it to compile in visual studio 2010. In stdafx.h, it includes afx.h and afxwin.h and a few other things necessary for the program to work. Notably, there's usage of CString in other header files. At the top of the includes in stdafx.h, I added in a #pragma message, to verify that it was being compiled first. There's one at the top of the header file which throws the error, as well. I can see from the compiler output that stdafx.h was being compiled first, so that's good. However, there was the error. (CString wasn't being recognized as a type.) So, I decided to make sure that it got through all of the includes. So, I put another #pragma message after #include and that message is not printed. Does that mean is not actually being included?
