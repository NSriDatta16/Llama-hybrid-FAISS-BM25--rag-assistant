Having trouble understanding None in the summary of my Keras model

The above code is a sample of a CNN model built using Keras. The first layer is a convolutional layer which will receive images of input_shape = (64, 64, 3) , thus meaning that the format of the images is in RBG. The output of the first layer is (None, 62, 62, 32) , but isn't in supposed to be (62, 62, 32) ? Where does the None come from? Also since my images are (64, 64, 3) doesn't it mean that the filter should have 3 dimensions to cater for the color channels of the image?
