Reading HTTP Request custom Headers

I am working on ASP.NET MVC 2 application. the website runs under SiteMinder (3rd party agent) for authentication. The Siteminder injects custom header to the incoming HTTP request. But when I try to read the custom header, I donot get the value. System.Web.HttpContext.Current.Request.ServerVariables["CustomKey"]; Looks like these custom headers are getting stripped by MVC. I hav eensured that the headers are for sure getting injected by SiteMinder. Am I doing anything wrong while reading as shown above?
