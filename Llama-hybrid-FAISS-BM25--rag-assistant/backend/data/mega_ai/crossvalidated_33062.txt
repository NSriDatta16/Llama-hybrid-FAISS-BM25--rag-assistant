Does the principle of indifference apply to the Borel-Kolmogorov paradox?

Consider Jaynes' solution to the Bertrand paradox using the principle of indifference . Why doesn't a similar argument apply to the Borel-Kolmogorov paradox ? Is there something wrong with arguing that since the problem does not specify an orientation for the sphere, rotating the sphere should not affect the resulting distribution arrived at by the chosen limiting process?
