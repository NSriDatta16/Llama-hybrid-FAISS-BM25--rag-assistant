How can I express a logistic regression equation

I see a lot of examples of linear regression like this: y = a1 x1 + a2 x2 + a3 x3 + a4 x4 + (a3*a5) x5 + (a4 a5)*x6. But I would like to write something similar for a logistic regression. I am not interested in being mathematically precise because the message I want to convey is simply: the outcome (is a function of) predictor-a, predictor-b, etc For example, Diabetes Mellitus (is a function of) age, sex, HbA1c, hypertension, ischemic heart disease, chronic kidney disease, socio-economic status. Is there a symbol typically employed in these situations for the relationship between the outcome (the thing you are predicting) and the predictor variables? Thanks
