Noise in simulating logistic regression model

I would like to simulate data for logistic regression model as follows, X = rnorm(1000) Z = 1 + 2*X pr = 1/(1 + exp(-Z)) Y = rbinom(1000, 1, pr) glm(Y ~ X, family="binomial") I am just wondering, in the step of generating "pr", do I need to add a noise to Z? It seems there is no noise added to Y to fit a logistic regression model. In other words, should I write Z = 1 + 2 X or Z = 1 + 2 X + rnorm(1000)?
