This is a sample of some HTML you might have in your document txt=document.getElementsByTagName("p")[0].childNodes[0].nodeValue; alert(" The text from the intro paragraph: " + txt + " "); it doesn't work. How can I get the childNodes.nodevalue "This is a sample of some HTML you might have in your document"
