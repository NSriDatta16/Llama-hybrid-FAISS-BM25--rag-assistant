I have my first draft. It goes like that: The app is a Project Management/Issue Tracking/Event Management/Collaboration Web app. I created a Role "External User". By default a user in that role can SELECT FROM Persons can SELECT FROM Units (organizational units-companies-depts etc) can SELECT Projects assigned to him can SELECT Tasks assigned to him can not SELECT any other Projects & Tasks The administrator can create a user group "External Partner" and assign to that some Projects and Products (with Issues) The members of this group can SELECT the assigned Objects. It is a complicated solution, but the only one that solves my customers problem (they don't want external partners to have access to all their project database).
