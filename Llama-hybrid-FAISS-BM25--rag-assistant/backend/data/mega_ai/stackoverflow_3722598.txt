If CSS property detection doesn't work out I'd recommend using IE conditionals like this: var ie7 = true; var ie6 = true; Or something along those lines...that's if you want to allow your scripts to determine which browser your using and don't want to parse the user agent string. If you just want to direct CSS to specific browsers then obviously just put a link to an IE stylesheet in the conditionals. I would never recommend sending different CSS based on JS browser detection as not all users will have JS enabled.
