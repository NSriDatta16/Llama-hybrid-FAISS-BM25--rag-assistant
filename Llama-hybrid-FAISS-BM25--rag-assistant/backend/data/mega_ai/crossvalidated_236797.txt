Neural Networks, what is the best way to deal with sequence when order does not matter?

Right now I am working on a problem where I have sets of 5 profile pictures of people. I am trying to classify those pictures using a CNN which feeds into an RNN. As a whole the set of 5 images should fall into one class although there may be some outliers within the 5 (like someone who posts a picture of their dog rather than themselves.) Ideally the network should be able to learn to ignore these. Right now this CNN->RNN approach works decently well. However, in an RNN the order in which the images are presented seems to matter. If I shuffle the profile images and feed them to the network the prediction probability tends to vary by about 5%. I was wondering if there is an architecture other than RNNs where the whole sequence can be considered yet where the ordering of the sequence does not matter?
