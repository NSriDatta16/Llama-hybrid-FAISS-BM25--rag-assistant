I'd guess it is some fluke in run-time optimisation - one uses a register and the other doesn't or something minor like that. The system clock probably runs to a precision of 100nsec. The average call time 30nsec or 25nsec is less than one clock tick. A rounding error of 5% of a clock tick is pretty small. Both times are near enough zero.
