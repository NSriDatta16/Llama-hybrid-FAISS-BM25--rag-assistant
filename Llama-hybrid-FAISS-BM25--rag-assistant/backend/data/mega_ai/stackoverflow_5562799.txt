The lightweight Java table is JTable. You can do almost whatever you like, if you use extend AbstractTableModel and use a sorter and a Renderer. Since the model provides the view with data you will never need to exhaust your memory with loading all your information. When you say, 10000x100 if 100 is the number of columns it is probably a bit too much for the average monitor. You probably have to make a discount there or make it scroll horizontally. If you let the model get the data from the database, you will never need to load your entire table, so there should probably be no problem with a JTable width of 50-100 or even more. Be careful: In order to make your JTable called "jTable1" scroll horizontally well, set jTable1.setAutoResizeMode(JTable.AUTO_RESIZE_OFF); The JTable Class has a sorter and filtering.
