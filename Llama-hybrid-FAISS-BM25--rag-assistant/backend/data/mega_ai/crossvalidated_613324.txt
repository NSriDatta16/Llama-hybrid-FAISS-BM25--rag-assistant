The empirical state transition matrices may be thought of as a collection of (row) histograms of a counting process given an initial state. You could compare the histograms using Kullback-Leibler divergence for the Dirichlet distribution. The row divergences could be combined using estimated state probabilities. This aggregate metric would allow you to rank the similarity of mating dances. Edit: after further thought, just vectorize the transition count matrices, and do a single KL-divergence computation. Sample MATLAB code is available here for function KL_dirichlet() . Zeros will remain "problematic" without a prior for each matrix. To resolve this, add pseudocounts to your observed counts, for instance add $\frac{1}{m \times n}$ to each element of a state transition matrix of size $m \times n$ . Hopefully you are okay with a Bayesian framework. the diagonal is all zeroes Given this constraint (apparently $m=n$ ), omit the diagonal elements from the vectorized representation of the observed state transition (count) matrices. No sense modeling and comparing the probability of something that can't happen.
