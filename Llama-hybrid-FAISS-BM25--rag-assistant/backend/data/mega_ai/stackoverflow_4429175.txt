I wouldn't recommend doing this for a production application but if it's just morbid curiosity then I suggest you have a read at this tutorial: Modifying the IL at runtime . It's not a tutorial that I've managed to get all the way through but a while back I was interested in playing with IL/CLR and tinkered with this. Anything you want to use it for in production should persist in the variety of available storage options you can use: config files, database, file system, registry, etc. Modifying the executable is a big thing and shouldn't be considered lightly.
