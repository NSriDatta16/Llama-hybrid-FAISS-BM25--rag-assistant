JAGS: unobserved parents and intialization

I have a very simple multinomial logistic regression problem; it's a simplified version of the alligator lake/food/size BUGS example. In my case I have (effectively) lake/food and have just stripped down the alli.bug example to handle two dimensional information: worker and IP address. There are 18 categories of 'worker' and 23 categories of 'IP address'. Unfortunately I am getting an error Error in node X[1,1:23] Observed node inconsistent with unobserved parents at initialization Granted, there is a strong possibility I've more than one bug, but I understand that this is typically associated with an initialization problem. Unfortunately, my initialization matrices are rather large. A shotgun approach to finding appropriate values seems unlikely to succeed within a reasonable period of time. Any hints or suggestions about possible next steps would be greatly appreciated. EDIT: Here's the code. As I mentioned, it's just a stripped down version of the Alligator example. I've also fiddled with the subscripts on X[i,] a bit so the error message may be slightly different (will refer to node X[1,1] rather than X[1,1:23]). var X[I,K], # observations I=no of workers=18, K=no of jobs=23 n[I], # total for each covariate pattern E[I,K], # fitted values OlogOE[I,K], # O log O/E G2, # goodness-of-fit statistic phi[I,K], # exp (beta[k] ' x[i,j]) p[I,K], # fitted probabilities alpha[K], # factor for jobs = 2,...,23 beta[I,K], # factor for workers = 2,...,18 for each job b[I,K]; # factor for workers = 2,..,,18, relative to job 1, centred model { # PRIORS alpha[1]
