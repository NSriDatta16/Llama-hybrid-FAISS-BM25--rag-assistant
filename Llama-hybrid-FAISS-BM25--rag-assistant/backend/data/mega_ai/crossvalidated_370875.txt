This notation has little to do with Bayesian statistics. The object $$p(y|\mu,\sigma^2)$$ is a density for the random variable $Y$ taking values $y$ ; the second part "|μ,σ²" means that this density (I suppose this is a probability density (pdf), but it could be a cdf as well) is indexed by two parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ , as for instance in the Normal density $\text{N}(\mu,\sigma^2))$ . Changing $(\mu,\sigma^2))$ modifies the density function. One could have used $$p(y;\mu,\sigma^2)\quad\text{or}\quad p_{\mu,\sigma^2}(y)$$ instead. (Incidentally the bar "|" notation was introduced by Harold Jeffreys in the 30's, the same influential Bayesian Jeffreys as in Jeffreys' prior.) When $\mu$ and $\sigma^2$ turn into random variables, as in Bayesian statistics, this becomes a conditional density of a random variable $Y$ with realisation $y$ given the random vector $(\mu,\sigma^2)$ . If the concept of conditional density is new to you, you should first check an introductory probability book or just the first chapters of Casella and Berger for instance.
