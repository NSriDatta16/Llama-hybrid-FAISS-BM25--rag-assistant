One thing you can do is break your logical fieldsets into separate model form classes. class PersonalInfoForm (forms.ModelForm): class Meta: model=MyModel fields=('field1', 'field2', ...) class TermsForm (forms.ModelForm): class Meta: model=MyModel fields=('fieldX', 'fieldY', ...) Pass them to your template in different variables and break up the formsets: Personal Information {{ personal_info_form }} Terms and Conditions {{ terms_form }} In that sense each of your form classes is just a fragment of the actual HTML form. It introduces a touch of complexity when you call save on the form. You'll probably want to pass commit=False and then merge the resultant objects. Or just avoid using ModelForm.save altogether and populate your model object by hand with 'cleaned_data'
