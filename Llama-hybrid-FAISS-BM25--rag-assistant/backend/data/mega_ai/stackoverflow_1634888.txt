I dont understand your objection to using a singleton to - this is the sort of thing they are made for. If you want them accessible to every object but not pass them as arguments or use a singlton - there are only a couple of tricks I can think of: -put the parsed arguments them into shared memory and then read them from every function that needs them -write the parsed arguments out to a binary file and then read them from every function that needs them -global variables None of these solutions are nearly as elegant as a singleton, are MUCH more labor intensive and are well... sort of silly compared to a singleton... why hamstring yourself?
