Creating those models should be quite simple. However, you may not have good results with linear regression because this kind of data use to be too complex to be translated in a linear way. You may prefer a logistic regression, with a shorter time frame, starting with one feature. I recommend using ARIMA , as it could be a good predictor for this case. Therefore, you will want to install the Time-Series add-on (see options, add-ons). Here is how it would look like: See also: http://dbfriend.blogspot.com/2021/03/time-series-forecasting-in-orange.html Keep in mind that Orange is very useful to have good data predictions, but there are better predictive models in Python (Multivariate LSTM, Prophet, ...). https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/multivariate-time-series-forecasting-using-fbprophet-66147f049e66
