RDBMS with type based structures are not designed for that. For instance, take Google's big table, which don't complain what you store (i.e, product A property types may be entirely different from product B, though both are of type Product). You need object based storage system, with type flexibility. Are you sure you want that at any cost? We still can do that, but with lot of overhead. Here is pseudo code. Model Product: id (primary key) Model AttributeType: """ Defines various data types available for storage. ex: (1, 'INT') or (2,'STRING') or (3, 'FLOAT') """ id: name: Model ProductAttributes: """ Stores various attributes of a product Ex: (P1,ATT1,100) or (P1, ATT3, 10.5) or (P2, ATT2, "ABCD") """ FK-> Product FK-> AttributeType Name 'String' Value Blob
