Isabelle Guyon, Andr√© Elisseeff, "An Introduction to Variable and Feature Selection", JMLR, 3(Mar):1157-1182, 2003. http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v3/guyon03a.html is well worth reading, it will give a good overview of approaches and issues. The one thing I would add is that feature selection doesn't necessarily improve predictive performance, and can easily make it worse (beacuse it is easy to over-fit the feature selection criterion). One of the advantages of (especially linear) SVMs is that they work well with large numbers of features (providing you tune the regularisation parameter properly), so there is often no need if you are only interested in prediction.
