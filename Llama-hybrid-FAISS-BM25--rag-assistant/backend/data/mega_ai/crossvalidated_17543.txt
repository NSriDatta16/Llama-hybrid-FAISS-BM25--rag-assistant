For sure you can computer a confidence interval . If $\mbox{acc}$ is your accuracy estimated on a test set of $N$ elements, it holds that $$\frac{acc-p}{\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}} \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$$ Thus $$ P\bigg( \frac{acc-p}{\sqrt{p(1-p)/N}} \in [-z_{\alpha/2},+z_{\alpha/2}]\bigg) \approx 1 - \alpha$$ So you can say that: $$P(p \in [l,u]) \approx 1 - \alpha$$ For example you can calculate the Wilson interval . $$l = \frac{2 \ N \ \mbox{acc} + z_{\alpha/2}^2 - z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{z_{\alpha/2}^2+4 \ N \ \mbox{acc}-4 \ N \ \mbox{acc}^2}}{2(N+z_{\alpha/2}^2)}$$ $$u = \frac{2 \ N \ \mbox{acc} + z_{\alpha/2}^2 + z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt{z_{\alpha/2}^2+4 \ N \ \mbox{acc}-4 \ N \ \mbox{acc}^2}}{2(N+z_{\alpha/2}^2)}$$ I think you can calculate how much your performance differs from a random one computing the gain . The accuracy of a random classifier is: $$ \mbox{acc}_r = \sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i^2$$ where $p_i$ is the empirical frequency of the class $i$ estimated on the test set, and $c$ is the number of different classes. On average a random classifier, which classifies random guessing the class $i$ relying on the priors probability of the test set, classifies $p_i\cdot n_i = \frac{n_i}{N} \cdot n_i$ examples of class $i$ correctly. Where $n_i$ is the number of records of class $i$ in the test set. Thus $$ \mbox{acc}_r = \frac{p_1 \cdot n_1 + \dots + p_c \cdot n_c}{n_1 + \dots + n_c} = \frac{p_1\cdot n_1}{N} + \dots + \frac{p_c\cdot n_c}{N} = \sum_{i}^{c} p_i^2$$ You might have a look to a question of mine. The gain is: $$\mbox{gain} = \frac{\mbox{acc}}{\mbox{acc}_r} $$ I actually think a statistical test can be sketched. The numerator could be seen as a Normal random variable, $\mathcal{N}(\mbox{acc},p(1-p)/N)$, but you should figure out what kind of random variable the denominator $\mbox{acc}_r$ could be.
