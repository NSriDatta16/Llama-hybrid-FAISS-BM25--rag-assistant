Drupal: how to upgrade a running production website to a dev version?

Can you help me to understand, how do I do Drupal website deployment and development? Suppose, I developed 1.0 version of Berty&Frank website. I copied everything to their production server and it is alive and kicking now. Site is already full of contents and is growing. I am asked to add additional features to the website. I am now experimenting with the way how I can implement them in a dev version. I am creating/deleting content types, fill created nodes with demo data just to see how they look like etc. Now I found the way and I want to upgrade production website to the same structure as my dev version now. How do I do that? Is the only way to manually make every change I made in dev version?
