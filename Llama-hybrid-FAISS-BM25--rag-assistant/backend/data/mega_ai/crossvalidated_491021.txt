Can I use a (paired) t-test to compare the accuracies of classification models on a hold out test set?

When comparing the Brier scores or logloss/cross-entropy for multiple models on a hold-out test set, how can I be sure the 'best' model doesn't just have the lowest loss due to chance? When can I be sure a model is better than another with statistical significance? Say I have a classification problem with targets $y \in \{0, 1\}$ and I've got $M$ models that produce probability predictions $\hat{y}_i^m$ , where $i$ represents the $i$ th observation in the hold out data and $m$ designates what model the prediction came from. Let's also say the $M$ different models could be based on a logistic regression, boosted decision tree, neural net, etc, So I have no easy way of quantifying the models complexity in a degrees of freedom sense. Can I do a bunch of pairwise t-tests to compare the means of the errors from each of the models? Because I am comparing predictions accross models on the same observations, can I use paired tests to reduce the variation? And would this test be less powerful if the predictions between two models were negatively correlated ? (not likely to be a problem in this setting). For comparing Brier scores accross models, I would calculate the Brier loss of model $m$ for each observation $i$ as $$ b_i^m = (y_i - \hat{y}_i^m)^2 $$ and for logloss I would calculate the loss as $$ l_i^m = -1 \times \big( y_i\log\hat{y}_i^m + (1-y_i)\log(1-\hat{y}_i^m)\big) $$ For two models $m_1$ and $m_2$ , can I then use regular t-tests to compare the means of the vectors $b^{m_1}$ and $b^{m_2}$ or $l^{m_1}$ and $l^{m_2}$ ? Would this give me a reliable confidence interval for the difference in classification performance between the two models? In the case of the Brier scores, could I equivalently do an F-test to test the ratio of $b^{m_1}/b^{m_2} \neq 1$ Another thought: Typically, when assessing models, we usually care about the mean of the errors or loss. So I think the t-test for the comparison of means of the Brier and logloss is appropriate. However, given that the logloss elements are not likely to be uniformly or symetrically distributed, perhaps a different test is more appropriate? Would a Mannâ€“Whitney U test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test make more sense?
