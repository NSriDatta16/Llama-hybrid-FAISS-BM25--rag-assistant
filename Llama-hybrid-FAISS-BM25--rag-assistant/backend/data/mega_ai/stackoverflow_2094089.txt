This is a weird problem as things are working fine on my machine (c). With the the following repository definition: java-net-m1-repository Java.net Maven 1.x Repository http://download.java.net/maven/1 legacy true And this dependency: javaee javaee-api 5 provided The artifact gets downloaded by m2eclipse/maven without problems: 1/19/10 3:09:48 PM CET: Downloading java-net-m1-repository : javaee/poms/javaee-api-5.pom 1/19/10 3:09:48 PM CET: Downloaded [java-net-m1-repository] -> http://download.java.net/maven/1/javaee/poms/javaee-api-5.pom 1/19/10 3:09:49 PM CET: Downloading java-net-m1-repository : javaee/jars/javaee-api-5.jar 1/19/10 3:09:52 PM CET: Downloaded [java-net-m1-repository] -> http://download.java.net/maven/1/javaee/jars/javaee-api-5.jar So I actually don't know what is happening exactly. To debug it, I'd first switch to the command line. In your case, I'd start by checking the URL from which the artifact is getting downloaded (this should be printed in the console, using the -X option shouldn't be necessary) and try to mimic this download with something like wget. If you don't find anything obvious, then check the effective POM that you can obtain using the following command: mvn help:effective-pom It's hard to point you in a special direction without more details but I would take a look at it (could it be a proxy problem?). Another idea would be to try to reproduce this problem on another machine/configuration and, if it works, check the differences. As I said, this should just work. But without a way to reproduce and/or more information, debugging this problem feels like walking in the dark :)
