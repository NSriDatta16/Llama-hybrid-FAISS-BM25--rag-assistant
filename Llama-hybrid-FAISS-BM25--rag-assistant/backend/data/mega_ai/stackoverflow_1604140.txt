I can completely understand this. I wrote some software ten years ago for a volunteer organization. They are still using it and it 'works'. But it is ugly. I know so much more now about how to design software. It is painful to even have to make updates and changes to it. I'd love to take some time to clean it up, but I just don't have time. I don't really want anyone else to take over the project because I am embarassed to have my name associated with the code -- even though my name isn't actually in the code. It still reflects on me and even though I may know better now. Logically, I know better. It is stupid to think this way. But I can't overcome the psychology. It is very real and it is a tough dilemma. I wouldnt assume issues with IP or hidden motives.
