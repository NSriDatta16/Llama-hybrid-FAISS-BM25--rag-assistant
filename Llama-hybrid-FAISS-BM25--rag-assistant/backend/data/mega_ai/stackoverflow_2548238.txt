How to get a volume measurement of iPhone recording in dB, with a limit of at least 120dB

I am trying to make a simple volume meter for the iPhone. I want the volume to be displayed in dB. When using this turorial , I am only getting measurements up to 78 dB. I've read that that is because the dBFS spectrum for 16 bit audio recordings is only 96 dB. I tried modifying this piece of code in the init function: dataFormat.mSampleRate = 44100.0f; dataFormat.mFormatID = kAudioFormatLinearPCM; dataFormat.mFramesPerPacket = 1; dataFormat.mChannelsPerFrame = 1; dataFormat.mBytesPerFrame = 2; dataFormat.mBytesPerPacket = 2; dataFormat.mBitsPerChannel = 16; dataFormat.mReserved = 0; I changed the value of mBitsPerChannel, hoping to increase the bit value of the recording. dataFormat.mBitsPerChannel = 32; With that variable set to 32, the "mAveragePower" function returns only 0. So, how can i measure more decibels? All my code is practically the same as in the tutorial i posted above. Thanks in advance, Thomas
