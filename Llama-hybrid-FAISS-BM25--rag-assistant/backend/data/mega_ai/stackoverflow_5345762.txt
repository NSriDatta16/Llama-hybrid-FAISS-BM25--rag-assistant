jquery mobile drag and drop

I'm playing around with the drag and drop feature of jQuery UI and it's working on my website, but when I navigate to my web page on an iPad, then the divs don't drag - the page itself moves up and down. I've have in the head tag: google.load("jquery", "1"); google.load("jqueryui", "1"); google.setOnLoadCallback(init);
