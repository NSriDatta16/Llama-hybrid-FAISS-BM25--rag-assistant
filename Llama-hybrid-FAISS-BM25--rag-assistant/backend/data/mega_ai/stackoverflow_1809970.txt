If Base is really a base class of Derived , there's absolutely no need for any cast, meaning that static_cast in the above code is absolutely superfluous. It doesn't achieve anything a mere assignment wouldn't do implicitly. Moreover, in upcasts (from derived to base), dynamic_cast is absolutely equivalent to static_cast , meaning that dynamic_cast wouldn't achieve anything new either. Actually, by placing an explicit static_cast cast in that code, its author enabled forceful "reverse" casts (downcasts). I.e. you can use this code to cast from base classes to derived classes. I don't know whether this was the intent (I doubt it was, judging by the template parameter names), and if it wasn't it might be a good idea to remove the cast entirely, since it is dangerous. If, despite my doubts, the code was actually supposed to support downcasts, then dynamic_cast might indeed help to catch potential errors. However, keep in mind that dynamic_cast works in downcasts with polymorphic class types only.
