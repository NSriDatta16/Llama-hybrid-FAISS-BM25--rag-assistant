SharePoint web part storage with multiple instances of web part on same page

I have a custom web part I've built, that I'm attempting to place three instances of on a single page. What I've noticed is that when I have a single instance on the page, the custom properties save and work appropriately. When I then add two more instances of the same custom web part to the page, the following web parts do not save their custom property values. I figure I must be doing something wrong when it comes to the WebPartStorage attribute. Any thoughts? [Browsable(true), Category("Miscellaneous"), WebPartStorage(Storage.Personal), FriendlyName("List"), Description("List")] public String List { get; set; }
