Will random data appended to a JPG make it unusable?

So, to simplify my life I want to be able to append from 1 to 7 additional characters on the end of some jpg images my program is processing*. These are dummy padding (fillers, etc - probably all 0x00) just to make the file size a multiple of 8 bytes for block encryption. Having tried this out with a few programs, it appears they are fine with the additional characters, which occur after the FF D9 that specifies the end of the image - so it appears that the file format is well defined enough that the 'corruption' I'm adding at the end shouldn't matter. I can always post process the files later if needed, but my preference is to do the simplest thing possible - which is to let them remain (I'm decrypting other file types and they won't mind, so having a special case is annoying). I figure with all the talk of Steganography hullaballo years ago, someone has some input here... (encryption processing by 8 byte blocks, I don't want to save pre-encrypted file size, so append 0x00 to input data, and leave them there after decoding)
