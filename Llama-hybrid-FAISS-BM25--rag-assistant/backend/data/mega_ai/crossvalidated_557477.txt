ALMOST Remember what a logistic regression is. $$ \log\bigg( \dfrac{\hat p}{1-\hat p} \bigg) = X\hat\beta $$ When $\hat p =0.5$ , $ \log\bigg( \dfrac{\hat p}{1-\hat p} \bigg) = 0 $ . Consequently, if you want to classify based on a threshold of $0.5$ , you only need to examine the $X\hat\beta$ portion and check if that value if greater than or less than zero. You can do something similar for any other threshold $\tau$ by calculating $ \log\bigg( \dfrac{\tau}{1-\tau} \bigg) $ and comparing that value to $X\hat\beta$ . The $\hat\beta$ that you calculate for your logistic regression, however, will be different from what you calculate in a linear model, so what you wrote in the question title is not quite correct. However, the predicted probabilities provide valuable information that you lose when you round them to categorical classifications.
