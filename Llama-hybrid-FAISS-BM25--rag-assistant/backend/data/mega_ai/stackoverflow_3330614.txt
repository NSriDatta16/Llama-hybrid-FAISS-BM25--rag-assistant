This concept is also a bit vague to me but after looking at your question I decided to clarify it a bit more for myself. please refer to this link in msdn and this . Basically it seems that it is about using http methods (Get/Post/Delete) to identify the exposure of resources the application allows. For example: Say you have the URL : http://Mysite.com/Videos/21 where 21 is an id of a video. We can further define what methods are allowed to this url - GET for retrieval of the resource, POST for updating/ Creating, Delete for deleting. Generally, it seems like an organized and clean way to expose your application resources and the operations that are supported on them with the use of http methods
