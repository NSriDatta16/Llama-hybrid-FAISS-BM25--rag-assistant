I thought I'd answer my own question because I ended up with a solution I am happy with and is a bit simpler than the other suggestions. I have this rather nice looking figure: The figure is simply the predictions +/- 95% CI (and raw means as dots) from this model with two spline knots (condition, age with knots, and the interaction): knotLoc As you can see the model works really nicely to generate the confidence intervals showing at what ages the conditions differ. However, I also note that in this model, neither the main effect of condition, nor any of its interactions with the age splines, are significant. This puzzles me a bit, because a really simple linear logistic regression with no splines show a very clear significant effect of condition. If anyone has any comment on that, I'd be interested. But for my purposes I think it may do to show the significance with the non-spline model, and the prettiness with spline model.
