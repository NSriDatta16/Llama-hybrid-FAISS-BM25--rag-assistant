t tests require not only constant variance BUT independent observations ...thus they are not recommended/appropriate for time series data. I took ACCOUNT3 and analyzed it with the intent of not only dealing with memory (arima) but latent deterministic structure ... thus empirically detecting the fixed effects that might be present . 9 data points is a challenge but two determimistic variables were identified , one being a pulse at period 6 and the the second being a level shift at period 6. This suggests that arima modelling alone would be insufficient/ineffective/less useful as your series is effected by an exogenous effects. and here All model are wrong but this seems possibly useful until more data is collected. At this juncture the memory component is (0,0,0)(0.0,0)12 . Since your data does not have a memory component , simple regression ( with the right candidate series/hypothesis ) is appropriate. More on Intervention Detection can be found here http://docplayer.net/12080848-Outliers-level-shifts-and-variance-changes-in-time-series.html . If you had simply proposed a permanent i.e. step/level shift at period 6 ...your result would not have been that dissimilar ... in this case !. In summary you are in the right direction using ARIMA model BUT you also need to incorporate potentially useful deterministic structure to create a possible hybrid model.
