Sensitivity analysis in logistic regression

I would like to run a sensitivity analysis of two logistic regression model in order to compare them and make a judgment in for what model a specific IV had an higher impact on the probability. My question is: What is the appropriate procedure? I know I can run a simulation on a given regression model, where I keep all IVs constant except the one I wanna examine for its reaction on the regression models (mean) probability. However, the following question remains unclear to me: What values do I choose to keep constant (group means? group probabilities?) and how do I variate the IV I wanna examine? Feel free to ask my any questions for further clarification.
