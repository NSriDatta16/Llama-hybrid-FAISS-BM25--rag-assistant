a vector is a set of values, which "normally" (mathematicians would kill me) represent the coefficients of a linear combination of things (functions, or other vectors). For example, when you say [4, 3, 7] and your basis is the set of power exponents of x (i.e. 1, x, x^2, x^3 etc...), this vector expresses the polynom 4 + 3x + 7 x^2 if you use a different basis, for example arbitrary directions in 3d space, that same vector expresses a direction in 3d space. 4i + 3j + 7k (lateral consideration: please note that 3d space is a finite vectorial space of dimension 3, while the polynomial space is an infinite vectorial space, or a Hilbert space as it is better defined) This is a vector (think an arrow) pointing in a specific direction in space, from an origin to an end. The convention is that i,j, and k are the so called basis set vectors of the 3d vectorial space, where the coordinates of each point are expressed as x,y and z. In other words, every point in space, and every direction in space, can be expressed with a triple of numbers (a vector) x, y, z which represents the spatial vector x * i + y * j + z * k . In vector graphics, you express graphical entities not as a grid of pixel (raster graphics) but as mathematical formulas. A curve is described as a parametrized mathematical expression. This opens up a lot of nice properties for displaying, because a mathematical description has basically infinite resolution. You can also apply mathematical transformation on these entities, like rotation, without ruining its description, and these transformations are deeply rooted in linear algebra, the discipline governing transformation of vectorial spaces, matrices and so on...
