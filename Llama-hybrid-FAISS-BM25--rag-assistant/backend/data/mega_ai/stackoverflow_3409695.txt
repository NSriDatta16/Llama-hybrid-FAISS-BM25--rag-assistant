$($element).draggable({ snap: true, '#mainwindow' }) This example isn't legal JavaScript/JSON. You would need something like... { snap: [true, '#mainwindow'] } Which I don't think draggable() will except. I'm trying to make my draggables snap to each other as well as their containing div. Try giving each draggable and the containing div(s) a class like "snappable" and pass { snap: ".snappable" }
