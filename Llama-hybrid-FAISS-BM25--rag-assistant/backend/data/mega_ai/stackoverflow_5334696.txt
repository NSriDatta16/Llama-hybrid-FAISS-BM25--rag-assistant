You're on the right track in that you want some sort of data controller object which will handle your user data objects from you. You could make this object a singleton, or you could not. The alternative is to have your application controller (app delegate usually) instantiate the data controller, and pass it on to each of your window or view controllers at launch time. One advantage is that it would be easier to modify your application to have multiple data controllers; this isn't as important for an iPhone app, but it may be an issue for a desktop app that could have multiple document windows open at once. On the other hand, a singleton is probably going to be simpler to code and may prevent bugs down the road. You might find the last few paragraphs on the Apple MVC design pattern documentation interesting, it talks a little bit about separating the model controller / view controller roles.
