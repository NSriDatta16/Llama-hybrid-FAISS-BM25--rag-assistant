I'd like to add another cautionary note, and a suggestion. When asked for a 1-5 rating, I usually think up some scale, like: worst ever real bad ok great awesome If your raters did similarly, taking an average is somewhat questionable; the difference between "worst ever" and "real bad" may be larger than the difference between "great" and "awesome". In jargon, your data may be somewhere between ordinal and interval (see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Level_of_measurement ). For this reason, I'd suggest that you give your speakers a histogram of their ratings as part of their feedback. And maybe even rank speakers by percent of their ratings above, say, 3, rather than by their mean rating.
