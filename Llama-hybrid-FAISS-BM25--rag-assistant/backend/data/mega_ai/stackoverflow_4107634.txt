Use cases for CollectionDataContractAttribute?

I'm working with an existing codebase and there are a lot of classes like: [Serializable] [CollectionDataContract ( Name = "DogList", ItemName = "Dog", Namespace = "Namespace" )] public class DogList : List { } According to the documentation I've found here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa347850.aspx usage of this attribute isn't encouraged. What would be the use case for writing code like this? It looks redundant to me.
