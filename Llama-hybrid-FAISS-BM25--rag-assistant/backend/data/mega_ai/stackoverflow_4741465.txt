Upgrading Eclipse SDK for Android Development

EDITED Thought I'd follow up a bit more and add the info here (as opposed to adding more comments below). After installing Galileo and finding it went well and no android problems, I installed Helios. It too went well and no Android problems (yet). I did add the necessary lines to the eclipse config ini file to increase Memory size and added Garbage Collection. When I did this to Gannymede, it made a significant speed improvement but, I don't see any effect in either Galileo or Helios. Makes me think that since they are not natively added for these two versions (at least not for 64-bit Cocoa / Mac), they may not be used. Nonetheless, they seem to have no negative affect. If anyone has knowledge to share on this, I'm all ears... Thanks I'd like to get opinions on updating Eclipse for Android development. I currently use Eclipse (Ganymede) 3.4.2. on a Mac (duo core intel) I've read many posts regarding this and, while there are differing opinions, probably mostly with regard to the interface. I have read about issues with the Android SDK and ADT with Eclipse versions above 3.4.2. but, thus far, all posts seem to be prior to the Android Dev site recommending the following (they previously recommend not using above 3.4): Eclipse 3.4 (Ganymede) or greater Eclipse JDT plugin (included in most Eclipse IDE packages) If you need to install or update Eclipse, you can download it from http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/ . Several types of Eclipse packages are available for each platform. For developing Android applications, we recommend that you install one of these packages: o Eclipse IDE for Java Developers o Eclipse Classic (versions 3.5.1 and higher) o Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers Some questions: Is there an advantage in switching from 3.4.2 Ganymede to Classic 3.5.1? Is it worth the trouble? Is anyone having compatibility issues with Android and the ADT? using 3.5.1? Thanks - any input/recommendations are appreciated...
