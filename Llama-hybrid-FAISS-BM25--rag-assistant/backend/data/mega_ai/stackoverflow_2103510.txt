I've used JMeter in the past, and I find it to be very useful for stress/load testing as website, even ones written in ASP.NET (with or without MVC). In general you would want to (with any tool) write a script of what an average user of your site would do. You may even end up creating multiple of these scripts. Tools like JMeter even allow for a random element to be added to a script. With these scripts created a load testing tool can then simulate as many users as you desire hitting your site. I would recommend allow JMeter to slowly ramp up the number of concurrent users and watch the response time graph. At the point where the response time starts increasing too highly is at the point where you've hit the maximum number of users (given you scripts) that your site can handle.
