You may want to try entering Robert'); DROP TABLE students; -- in your form :) In the above xkcd cartoon , Bobby was probably asked to fill in his name in a form, but he mischievously inserted Robert'); DROP TABLE students; -- as his name. Now imagine if that input was used in this query: SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = '$input' As you can see, if we substitute $input for what Bobby entered, you'll get this SELECT * FROM students WHERE name = 'Robert'); DROP TABLE students; --' Which are two very valid SQL commands, and a comment.
