Make a matrix that rotates an RGB color around the [1,1,1] axis (the luminance axis)* by an angle that would rotate your source color onto your target color. Set this matrix as a pixel shader constant. In the pixel shader, transform the pixel color by this matrix. Then, lerp between the untransformed and transformed colors, according to the angle between the untransformed pixel's hue and the source color's hue. When the angle is small, use the transformed color. When the angle is large, use the untransformed color. To determine the hue of a pixel, subtract the average of its RGB* from the pixel. The angle between this vector and [1,0,0] is the hue. *I'm aware that luminance is not this simple, but this is a good enough approximation for this case.
