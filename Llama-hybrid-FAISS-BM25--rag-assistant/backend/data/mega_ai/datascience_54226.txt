Question on X_train data formatting

I want to train a model to approximate the probability of an event between two objects based on previous occurrences. My input training data are the parameters (six in total) of the pairs that have taken part in a past event and the output training data are the computed probability of the event. So one case would be: X_train : param1_obj1,param2_obj2 param2_obj1,param2_obj2 ..., ... param6_obj1,param6_obj2 Y_train : probability of event My idea is to try to train a neural network and compare it with other models My question is: How should I format the inputs to feed them to the network properly? Would feeding the (6,2) array work?
