SharePoint is a v2 product...v3 is due in 2010, and it's the fastest growing product in MS's history (supposedly). v2 is short of mature, and it definitely leaves something to be desired for those of us who develop, but there's a lot of tools out there that make developing against it easier (stsdev, being one). It's something that you'll be seeing more and more of if you stay in the Windows realm. It's a powerful platform and the future of it looks very promising. From a developer's perspective, it's a bit frustrating that they've thought about developing against it as sort of an afterthought, as most Windows-based applications are. The end user wins in priority, that's for sure. SharePoint work is challenging and rewarding, even without the development aspect of it. You're affecting the entire organization and actually helping businesses run better. The development aspect will frustrate you from time to time, but it all tends to even out.
