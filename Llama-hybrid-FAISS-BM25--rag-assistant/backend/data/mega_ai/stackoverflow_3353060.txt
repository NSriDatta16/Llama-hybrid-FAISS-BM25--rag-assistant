My guess is to encourage you to use System.Web.HtmlString instead. But yes, I've wondered this myself and I've written a duplicate ToMvcHtmlString extension in my own helpers. MvcHtmlString is, IIRC, just their compatibility fix so MVC 2 can work on both .NET 3.5 and 4 - but even then it'd be useful to use in your own code for that.
