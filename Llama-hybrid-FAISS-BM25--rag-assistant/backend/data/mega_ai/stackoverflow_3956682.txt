How can I get the average value of a column with Core Data?

If I have the following NSManagedObject, how can I get the average of values for number1 and the average of values for number2 ? @interface Log : NSManagedObject { } @property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber * number1; @property (nonatomic, retain) NSNumber * number2; Thanks :D
