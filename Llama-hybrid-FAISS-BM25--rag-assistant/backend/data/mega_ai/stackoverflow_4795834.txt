Although tramp is more efficient, you can "drag and drop" it from $HOME/.gvfs/server.net/ into emacs. $HOME/.gvfs/server.net/ is where it's mounted locally. Typically I drop the file into scratch where (as you've seen) it's expanded to a filename. Just modify that into an evaluatable function, evaluate it with "C-M-x": (find-file "/sftp:username@server.net:/path/to/file.txt")
