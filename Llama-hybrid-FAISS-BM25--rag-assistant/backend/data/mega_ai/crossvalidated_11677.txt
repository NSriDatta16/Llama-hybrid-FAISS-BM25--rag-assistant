What is the difference between ITT and ATE?

I am having trouble understanding the different estimators that can be used in an impact evaluation. I know that the intention-to-treat (ITT) estimator compares differences between eligible individuals without the program, and eligible individuals with the program, regardless of compliance. However, I thought the average treatment effect (ATE) also measured the same thing. However, it seems that the ATE takes into consideration the compliance. Therefore, it compares outcomes between those eligible and taking up treatment with those who are not eligible. Is this correct?
