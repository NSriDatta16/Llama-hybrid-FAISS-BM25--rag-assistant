Using AXSLT Components in Spring MVC

I while ago I wrote a Java application that processes XML with XSLT using Xalan. Now I'm trying to move towards Spring. I've been having trouble accessing components. As far as I can tell my XML, XSLT and Java objects are correct, but Spring cannot seem to find and reference the components I want to access. ... ... I also tried with a JavaScript component (with bsf.jar and js.jar) and that also fails. ... function say() { return "Hello from JavaScript"; } ... I consistently get this error: javax.xml.transform.TransformerConfigurationException: Could not compile stylesheet com.sun.org.apache.xalan.internal.xsltc.trax.TransformerFactoryImpl.newTemplates(Unknown Source) org.springframework.web.servlet.view.xslt.XsltView.loadTemplates(XsltView.java:417) ... I've looked online and haven't found a lot to go on. Spring+XSLT doesn't seem to be a very prominent topic. Any suggestions on something in Spring I need to configure, or something I would need to extend?
