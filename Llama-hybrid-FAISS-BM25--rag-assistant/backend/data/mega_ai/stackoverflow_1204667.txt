Anyone have thoughts on using the Blackboard Pattern in this way?

Does anyone have any thoughts of the Blackboard concept from p.165 of 'The Pragmatic Programmer'? I want to have several small sub-systems (DLLs and EXEs) mostly independent of each other. There are some assemblies that will be used by all EXEs. These assemblies will nearly all use the same database. Rather than using interfaces for communication between these assemblies, wouldn't a Blackboard type pattern provide more independence? I'm thinking of some mediator type construct that notifies via events and all sub-system communication goes through it. This keeps the syb-systems very independent. The mediator will hold the name of all notifications it should broadcast. Subscribers will then listen to a particular event by name but always subscribe to the same (or perhaps pass name as parameter) mediator event. Here's some more discussion on it: http://www.experts-exchange.com/Programming/Languages/C_Sharp/Q_22829492.html
