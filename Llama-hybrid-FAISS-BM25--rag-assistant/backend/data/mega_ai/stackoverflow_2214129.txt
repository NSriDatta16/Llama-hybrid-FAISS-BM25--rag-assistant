USB is just a bus. The way you communicate to the device depends on the chip at the other side of bus. There isn't a standardized way to talk to all devices. If a USB device provider want to expose the device to a standard way (most of them do conform to standards to save costs on develop, document, and educate clients about their APIs), their driver programmers can write drivers that make the device available to various Windows APIs (massive storage, WIA, DirectShow, virtual serial port, bluetooth, Human Interface Device, etc). Again, since standardized drivers are already exposed to Windows API, there is no need for .Net to talk to hardware directly.
