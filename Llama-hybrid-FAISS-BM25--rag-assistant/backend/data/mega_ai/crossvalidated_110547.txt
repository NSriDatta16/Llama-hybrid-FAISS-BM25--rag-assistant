If your $\mu_i$ and $v_i$ are observations, then you have to define a likelihood on it, something like $\mu_i, v_i \sim N(M, V) \times IG(a,b)$. In this case you assume that all the $\mu$ comes from a normal with mean $M$ and variance $V$ while the $v$ are from an inverse gamma $a,b$. Then you can put prior on the values $M,V,a,b$, and using MCMC you can have posterior sample from $M,V,a,b$. With the posterior samples you can in fact simulate other $\mu$ and $v$ "similar" to the one observed.
