The : code nugget is part of the ASP.NET 4.0 web compiler and doesn't just call Html.Encode() . It works out whether or not the string is already encoded first (if the expression returns an IHtmlString then it probably won't get encoded). This means it is safe to use it when inserting actual data or when inserting HTML from some type of helper method (if you write your own helper methods, they should always return IHtmlString as of MVC 2). With regards to whether or not you always use it, of course you don't. But I'd rather not think about it too much and will be happier knowing I've gone some way towards fending off XSS attacks with little effort; therefore, I nearly always use it. It also encourages you to make sure you return a MvcHtmlString from your HTML helper methods rather than a string .
