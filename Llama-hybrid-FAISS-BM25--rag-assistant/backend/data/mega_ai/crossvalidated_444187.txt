The importance measures here are unlikely to be adapted into a scale that can be compared. Rather, the best way to compare these models is to compare the rank order of the input/predicting variables. It is also worth noting that the linear/lasso/ridge models are fairly different in what they represent compared to boosted tree ensemble. In particular, the boosted trees are based on series of if-then statements in the underlying decision trees that are necessarily non-linear in their construction. By contrast, linear/lasso/ridge models are based on individual linear coefficients representing each variable (with different constraints on estimation across linear, lasso, and ridge models). Thus, they aren't really comparing the same kinds of models. A discussion of a related issue is outlined in Groemping (2009). Again, if a comparison between these is still of interest, the best comparison in this case is likely between the rank ordering of the predicting variables as implied by the differently scaled Caret package outputs.
