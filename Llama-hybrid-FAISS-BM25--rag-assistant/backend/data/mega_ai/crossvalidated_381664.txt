While this post is older, I cannot help but note that ordinal logistic regression and the rank-sum test are feasible and perhaps preferred as they account for the ordered nature of the scores. The ability to create a table with neat cells from a restricted range of integer data does not mean that the data can be accurately analyzed with methods usually applied to tables. In the provided example, scores are not Bernoulli trials,nor nominal data. If the possible score values were 0.5,1.5,2.5,3.5 , one would never think to place those values in a table and carry out a chi-square analysis.
