I don't have a good answer for you, but I do know that Azure Table Storage is for non-relational data tables, meaning that if you need to create relational joins between tables, this most likely won't be the route to go. As for SQL Data Services, there's a CodePlex project called PhluffyFotos that has a "LINQ to SDS provider" that you might want to check out for inspiration. PhluffyFotos is a web 2.0 Picture Gallery Service where users can upload their pictures from the web or mobile device. This sample is designed to demonstrate how you can develop a multi tenant application using SQL Server Data Services (SSDS). The demo utilizes several technologies including: ASP.NET MVC Preview 4, LINQ, Windows Communication Foundation, Silverlight, Windows PowerShell, and the .NET Compact Framework 3.5.
