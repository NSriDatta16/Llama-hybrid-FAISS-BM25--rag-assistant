I'm going to just copy and paste the entire content of "Searching with / and ?" (within a visual selection) from the Vim Tips Wiki . In visual mode, / and ? will update the visual selection just like any other cursor-movement command (that is, when in visual mode, searching will extend the selection). In order to actually search within the visual selection, you will need to use the \%V atom, or use the markers defined by the visual selection with the \%>' and \% atoms. This is best done by leaving the visual selection with Esc before entering your search. You may want to consider a mapping to automatically leave visual selection and enter the appropriate atoms. For example: :vnoremap /\%V Using this mapping, you can press Alt - / in order to automatically fill in a "range" for your search just like using an Ex command with : . To use this, move to the first line of interest and press V to start line-wise visual selection. Move down (press j for a line or } for a paragraph, etc). When you have selected the area you want to search, press Alt - / . The visual selection will be removed, and a search command will start. You will see: /\%V Add what you want to find, then press Enter . For example, you may enter green and see: /\%Vgreen When you press Enter , each occurrence of "green" will be highlighted, but only in the area that you had previously selected. Here are two further examples that do not use a visual selection. The first command searches only in lines 10 to 20 inclusive. The second searches only between marks a and b. /\%>9l\% 'a\%
