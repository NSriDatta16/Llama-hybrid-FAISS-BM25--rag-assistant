Solutions are just containers for projects, so it's really the splitting of the projects that is in question. I would recommend using a different project (AKA class library or assembly) for each major functional area. You may still want to use different namespaces within each project, but separating the major functional areas into different assemblies will make each assembly smaller. Therefore, if you need to use only one or two functions in an application, you only reference those two projects instead of the one massive project. This will make for smaller applications that compile faster and have less overhead. In terms of solutions, you can organize those however you want because like I said, they are only containers. You may want to put them all in one solution...or maybe each in a separate solution...or maybe put related projects into solutions. Personally, I either use one solution, or for large projects, I use a "master" solution so I can easily compile everything in one shot and individual solutions so I can work on projects individually.
