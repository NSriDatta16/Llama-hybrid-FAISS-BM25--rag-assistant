Should I learn Haskell or F# if I already know OCaml?

I am wondering if I should continue to learn OCaml or switch to F# or Haskell. Here are the criteria I am most interested in: Longevity Which language will last longer? I don't want to learn something that might be abandoned in a couple years by users and developers. Will Inria, Microsoft, University of Glasgow continue to support their respective compilers for the long run? Practicality Articles like this make me afraid to use Haskell. A hash table is the best structure for fast retrieval. Haskell proponents in there suggest using Data.Map which is a binary tree. I don't like being tied to a bulky .NET framework unless the benefits are large. I want to be able to develop more than just parsers and math programs. Well Designed I like my languages to be consistent. Please support your opinion with logical arguments and citations from articles. Thank you.
