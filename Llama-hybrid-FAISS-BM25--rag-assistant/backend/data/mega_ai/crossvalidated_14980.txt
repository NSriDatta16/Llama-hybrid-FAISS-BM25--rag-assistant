If you want/have to use contrasts with the pooled error term from the corresponding ANOVA, you could do the following. Unfortunately, this will be long, and I don't know how to do this more conveniently. Still, I think the results are correct, as they are verified against Maxwell & Delaney (see below). You want to compare groups of your first within factor hour in an SPF-p.qr design (notation from Kirk (1995): Split-Plot-Factorial design 1 between factor treatment with p groups, first within factor hour with q groups, second within factor prePostFup with r groups). The following assumes identically sized treatment groups and sphericity. Nj First note that the main effect for hour is the same after averaging over prePostFup , thus switching to the simpler SPF-p.q design which only contains treatment and hour as IVs. dfPQ Now note that in the SPF-p.q ANOVA, the effect for hour is tested against the interaction id:hour , i.e., this interaction provides the error term for the test. Now the contrasts for hour groups can be tested just like in a oneway between-subjects ANOVA by simply substituting the error term, and corresponding degrees of freedom. The easy way to get the SS and df of this interaction is to fit the model with lm() . (anRes will be error SS dfSSE But let's also calculate everything manually here. # substitute DV with its difference to cell / person / treatment group means Mjk will be error SS dfSSE Now that we have the correct error term, we can build the usual test statistic for planned comparisons: $t = \frac{\hat{\psi} - 0}{||c|| \sqrt{MS_{E}}}$ where $c$ is the contrast vector, $||c||$ is its length, $\hat{\psi} = \sum\limits_{k=1}^{q} c_{k} M_{.k}$ is the contrast estimate, and $MS_{E}$ is the mean square for the hour:id interaction (the suitable error term). Mj For multiple comparisons, you'd have to think about $\alpha$-correction methods, e.g., Bonferroni. The corresponding calculations for Maxwell & Delaney's (2004) example on p. 599f can be found here . Note that M&D calculate the F-value, to see that the results are identical, you have to square the value for the t-statistic. That code also includes the analysis done with Anova() from car , as well as a manual calculation of the $\hat{\epsilon}$ corrections for the main effect of the within-factor.
