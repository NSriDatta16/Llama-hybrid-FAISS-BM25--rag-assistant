Create CRM Organizations on Load Balancing network

I'm trying to understand how to create CRM Organization on Load Balancing network. I've three web servers (Web01, Web 02, Web03); three application servers (App01, App02, App03) and a SQL Server (SQL01). I already have Load Balancer setup and there is already one organizaiton setup by someone on all web servers. This organization is Internet Facing. Now I want to create one more Organization on same set of Web Servers. Can anyone please help me understand how to setup new Organization on Load Balancer in this scenario?
