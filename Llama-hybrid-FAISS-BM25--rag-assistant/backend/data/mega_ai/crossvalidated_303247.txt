t-SNE is mostly used to visualize high dimensional data by embedding it in a 2D space. Since it ignores the classes, it can't tell you which variables are important for classification. PCA also ignores the classes, so although it can tell you which variables explain the variance of the data, that might not be the same as which variables best distinguish the classes. Linear Discriminant does include the classes so may be more useful.
