Create word embeddings without keeping fastText Vector file in the repository

I am trying to embed a sentence with the help of Infersent , and Infersent uses fastText vectors for word embedding. The fastText vector file is close to 5 GiB. When we keep the fastText vector file along with the code repository it makes the repository size huge, and makes the code difficult to share/deploy (even creating a docker container). Is there any method to avoid keeping the vector file along with the repository, but reuse it for embedding new sentences?
