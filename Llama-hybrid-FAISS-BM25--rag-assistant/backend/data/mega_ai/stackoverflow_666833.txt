Saving many-to-many relationship objects in entity framework

I'm trying to save an entity that forms part of a many-to-many relationship in the entity framework and am getting the error: Unable to update the EntitySet 'zRM_OP_defaultloccvgsMapping' because it has a DefiningQuery and no element exists in the element to support the current operation. My google-fu is weak on this one, but I understand I may have to edit the designer code and hook up a stored procedure to manually do the insert. My table structure looks like this: locations: LOCID, blah.. coverages: CVGID, blah.. loccvgs: LOCID, CVGID (no keys) Help!
