You can also do anything ETL tools can do with code. :-) Both tool categories you mention can be used to solve this problem, but they are optimized for the class of problems they are trying to solve: ETLs tend to come with a library of data manipulation tools (relational calculus, in-line computations, etc.), are optimized to handle large quantities of data, and have job management features (important if this isn't a single one-off data migration). Build tools (for me, Ant comes to mind as a prototypical example) could do similar tasks, but are focused on compilation, file organization and manipulation, and packaging.
