Java's DnD support does allow you to drag things out of a Java application into a native one, but I think that it's limited to text and only alows target components which will accept text, like the address bar in a browser. If the explorer address bar does not accept text from a drag and drop, you could always add a menu option to your application to "Open in Explorer" which just launches a new Explorer process with the file path as a parameter.
