Dependence is what makes time series, which are really sequences , interesting. Otherwise they would be an unordered set of random variables. Returning to your question, the issue is whether the joint distribution of $X_{t_i}$ and $X_{t_j}$ is separable: $f_{X_{t_i}, X_{t_j}}(x, y) \overset{?}{\equiv} f_{X_{t_i}}(x) f_{X_{t_j}}(y)$
