It is not like it is necessarily biased. Consider this little simulation: reps for which the bias is nonexistent. The distribution is also nicely normal: Bias comes in when considering more general (one should/could also say: more realistic) cases: when the error terms driving x and the cointegration equation (here, u ) are correlated and themselves exhibit short-run correlation. See e.g. the paper by Gonzalo, JoE 1994 for a more thorough simulation, or Chapter 19 in Hamilton, "Time Series Analysis", for an asymptotic analysis.
