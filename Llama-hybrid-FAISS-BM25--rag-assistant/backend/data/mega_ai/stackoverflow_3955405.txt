The condition nrtel NOT LIKE '0256%' OR nrtel NOT LIKE '0356%' is always true (unless nrtel is NULL). You need to use AND: SELECT * FROM rapoarte WHERE nrtel NOT LIKE '07%' AND nrtel NOT LIKE '0256%' AND nrtel NOT LIKE '0356%' Or you could rewrite it as follows if you find it easier to read: SELECT * FROM rapoarte WHERE NOT ( nrtel LIKE '07%' OR nrtel LIKE '0256%' OR nrtel LIKE '0356%' ) The expression (NOT a) OR (NOT B) is not the same as NOT (a OR b) . See De Morgan's Laws .
