How to build a Bayesian Model to estimate the probability distribution of the parameters given the output?

I'm currently facing a new type of problem, and i have no idea how to solve it, so any suggestion will be really appreciated ! The problem is the following: I have a matrix of temperatures, depending on two parameters (Alpha and Beta). We can plot this matrix with matplotlib, and we get : [ ] Because we can only observe the temperature in practice, I would like to build a model that estimate the probability distribution of the alpha and beta given a temperature. An example will be : what are the alpha and beta that most likely produce a temperature of 33 degrees ? Now suppose, we have many measurements of temperature , is it possible to get the probability distribution of alpha and beta given the observed temperatures . Example : we observed a lot of 28 degrees, we can induce that alpha is probably around 0.8 and alpha around 525. (we can suppose that we can approximate this distribution with a Gaussian for example) I know that it deals with Bayesian issues , propagation of uncertainty, but i have no idea what type of algorithm i have to use... and how to do in practice. Any idea ? (it seems to be a quite complicated problem no ? ) Thank you so much !
