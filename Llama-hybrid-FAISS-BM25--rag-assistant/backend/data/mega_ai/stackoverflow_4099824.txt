Thank you - I have added this but it still moves the original DOM element, what I was ultimately looking to do was to leave the original there and add a different class to it so the user would know it was in the cart. Here is my code. $(function() { $("drag_box").sortable({ connectWith: 'li.empty_list', opacity: 0.6, handle: 'img', forcePlaceholderSize: true, clone:'helper', revert:true }); $( "li.empty_list" ).sortable({ stop: function(event, ui) { $(ui.item).addClass("moved"); } });
