synchronizing executeSql in Safari (WebKit) Web Sql database

WebKit (Safari 4+ is my focus) has a feature called Web SQL. Web SQL is specified in the W3C draft . Currently only the asynchronous flavor is supported. I have a situation where I want to synchronize a few different operations - writing to database (using CREATE TABLE query and then a loop through INSERT queries) and then reading from the database. How do I do this? I googled and read a lot of tutorials, but did not find any explanation of that. If I can't find answer to this, I shall try the Worker feature and if unsuccessful I plan to store the data in webstorage (localstorage) instead.
