url problem with json data

For the API script of followcost.com. It is given that for using the follow cost API follow cost has a simple JSON API. Send a GET request to followcost.com using the Twitter user name: GET /lof.json The server responds (formated for clarity): 200 OK Content-Type: application/json {"milliscobles_all_time":141.93, "average_tweets_per_day":3.01034, "username":"lof", "twitter_created_at":"2008/01/24 11:21:43 -0600", "at_reply_index":55.0, "milliscobles_recently":147.92, "average_tweets_per_day_recently":3.13738, "statuses_count":1165, "golden_index":3.0, "profile_image_url":"http:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/twitter_production\/profile_images\/50450572\/75756154_N00_normal.jpg"} But when I use the URL www.followcost.com/GET/Anand_Dasgupta.json or www.followcost.com/api/GET/Anand_Dasgupta.json it gives twitter user doesnt exist error ... but I obviously have a twitter ID. So what is the URL that I need to use? Any help will be highly appreciated. Thank You Anand
