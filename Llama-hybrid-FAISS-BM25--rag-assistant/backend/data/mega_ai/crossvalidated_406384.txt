Here a relevant excerpt found on page 429 in chapter 12 "Principal component analysis" from the book "Methods of multivariate analysis" by AC Rencher and WF Christensen (3rd ed.): The authors seem to confirm your observation. Here is a small example in Stata just to check that the unrotated scores are in fact uncorrelated (some output is omitted): sysuse auto pca trunk weight length headroom predict f1-f4, score corr f1-f4 (obs=74) | f1 f2 f3 f4 -------------+------------------------------------ f1 | 1.0000 f2 | 0.0000 1.0000 f3 | 0.0000 -0.0000 1.0000 f4 | 0.0000 0.0000 0.0000 1.0000 All correlation coefficients between the scores are virtually zero, as desired.
