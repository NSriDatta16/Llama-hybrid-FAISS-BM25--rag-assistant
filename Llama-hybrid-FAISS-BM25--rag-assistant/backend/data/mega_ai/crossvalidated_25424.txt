Large data set for testing kernel logistic regression

Does anyone know of a large data set (upwards of $10^7$ rows, but I'll take $10^5$ as well) that would be appropriate for testing kernel logistic regression? Continuous variables, 2 to 50 independent variables? Would prefer business-like data as opposed to scientific (weather, chemical, bio ...).
