Updating SQL database using PHP

I am trying to make a password retrieval system on my site, and I am having problems updating the password reset field in my database. I have tried everything, but nothing seems to work. This is my code so far: $passwordreset = md5(mt_rand()) . md5(mt_rand()) . md5(mt_rand()); $con = mysql_connect("localhost","XXX","XXX"); if (!$con) { die('Could not connect: ' . mysql_error()); } mysql_select_db("database", $con); mysql_query("UPDATE members SET passwordreset = $passwordreset WHERE id = $id"); When I try to insert the data I get the error: Error: Query was empty Any help would be appreciated, Thanks.
