Why do the standard errors of logistic regression blow up with many zeros in response?

I am working on a fixed-effects model where the response is the number of successes in $N$ trials. I noticed that when the number of successes is $0$ for a large number of units the standard error blows up. Why is that happening and will it affect the estimates of other coefficients? Reproducible R code below. set.seed(123456) units
