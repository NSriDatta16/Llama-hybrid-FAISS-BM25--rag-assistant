Agentic AI is a class of artificial intelligence that focuses on autonomous systems that can make decisions and perform tasks with limited or no human intervention. The independent systems automatically respond to conditions to produce process results. The field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems, when applied to process automation. Applications include software development, customer support, cybersecurity and business intelligence. Overview The core concept of agentic AI is the use of AI agents to perform automated tasks with limited human intervention. While robotic process automation (RPA) systems automate rule-based, repetitive tasks with fixed logic, agentic AI adapts based on data inputs. Agentic AI refers to autonomous systems capable of pursuing complex goals with minimal human intervention, often making decisions based on continuous learning and external data. Functioning agents can require various AI techniques, such as natural language processing, machine learning (ML), and computer vision, depending on the environment. History The term 'agent-based process management system' was first used in 1998 to describe autonomous agents for business process management. Applications Web browsing Web browsers with integrated AI agents are sometimes called agentic browsers. Such agents can perform small tedious tasks during web browsing and potentially even perform browser actions on behalf of the user. Products like OpenAI Operator and Perplexity Comet integrate a spectrum of AI capabilities including the ability to browse the web, interact with websites and perform actions on behalf of the user. In 2025, Microsoft launched NLWeb, an agentic web search replacement that would allow websites to use agents to query content from websites by using RSS-like interfaces that allow for the lookup and semantic retrieval of content. Products integrating agentic web capabilities have been criticised for exfiltrating information about their users to third-party servers and exposing security issues since the way the agents communicate often occur through non-standard protocols.
