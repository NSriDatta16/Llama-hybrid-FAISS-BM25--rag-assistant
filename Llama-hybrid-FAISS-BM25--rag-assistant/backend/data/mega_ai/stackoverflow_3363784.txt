You cannot determine what the user is paying based on the email address. All you can hope for this way is to blacklist a few of the more popular domains - but then, there is an infinity of others left. I know hardly anyone paying money for (just) their email address, so the question IMHO is rather what kind of user you want to avoid. An even better question might be what kind of user you want to encourage.
