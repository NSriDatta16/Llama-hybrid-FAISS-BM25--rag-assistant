Database Design for Filtering Database

I'm new to complex database design. I'm currently into a project where the user should be able to retrieve Instructions based on a combination of 18 columns. So my parameter Table has the following columns Job State Manager ProcessCode ProcessType (rest of the columns truncated). InstructionID (FK of Instruction Table) When adding / Modifying the instruction, he can choose multiple options in each of the above parameters. The Stored Procedure will store data in all combinations possible, in order facilitate easy retrieval, as during search (retrieval) only one option will be chosen in each of the columns. There can be multiple instructions for same combination and the same instruction can apply to multiple combinations. I have somehow created the SP for adding instruction, but am now struck with modification. When my Webpage passes the new combination to SP, what is the best way to update the Table? I could delete all existing rows and create new rows for new combination, but I wanted to maintain the created date and created user columns. Further, there is a requirement to maintain history of these in a separate history table. Sorry for the length of the question... And, Thank you for help.
