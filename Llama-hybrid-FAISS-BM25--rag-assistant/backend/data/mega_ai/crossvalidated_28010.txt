Help on SVM for road image processing

I am new to SVM. I would like to use SVM to segment/cluster/classify a road image into two distinct regions i.e. drivable region and non-drivable region. Unfortunately, I do not have any images where the regions are already labeled. I really don't know how to go about this i.e. specifying the training set. Will weka be a good tool to use for the SVM? Thanks in advance
