1. Yes, the proportions do matter. In logistic regression, the estimated coefficients are log-odds, and when you exponentiate the beta coefficients of the independent variables you get the odds ratio, not the relative risk or something similar. Odds ratio, by definition, is similar to relative risk when the event is uncommon but as the event becomes more common, the odds ratio will be greatly distorted compared to the relative risk. I'll give you two examples, and for each example I'll first calculate the odds ratio and relative risk manually, then estimate the odds ratio via logistic regression: In the first example we compare the association between an uncommon disease (0/1) and sex (0 = female, 1 = male). We'll assume that the disease is twice as common in males than in females. This gives a 2x2 cross table with the following cell counts: a. Diseased males: 100 b. Diseased females: 50 c. Healthy males: 1900 d. Healthy females: 1950 The relative risk is (a/(a+c)) / (b/(b+d)) = 2. It is twice as common for men to have the disease. The odds ratio is (a/c)/(c/d) = 2.05. Quite close to the relative risk. Now a logistic regression model gives: disease |z|) (Intercept) -3.6636 0.1432 -25.580 The estimated beta coefficient for sex is 0.7191. When we exponentiate to get the odds ratio we get exp(0.7191) = 2.05. Ok, so no we'll try with another disease condition that is more common, and still more common in males. We'll assume that 30 percent of females and 60 males have the disease, just to make the results extreme: a. Diseased males: 1200 b. Diseased females: 600 c. Healthy males: 800 d. Healthy females: 1400 The relative risk is (a/(a+c)) / (b/(b+d)) = 2. So the relative risk is unchanged though this disease is far more common. The odds ratio is (a/c)/(c/d) = 3.5. So now the odds ratio is clearly distorted, almost twice the relative risk! Running a logistic regression model (in R) confirms this: disease |z|) (Intercept) -0.84730 0.04879 -17.36 exp(1.25276) = 3.5 So yes, the proportions do matter because the (log) odds are estimated, not probability. The relationship between probability and odds is odds = p(1-p), and p = odds(1+odds). 2. I don't understand the idea to "standardize the proportions". The approach suggest by your colleague may or may not be appropriate, depending on what it is that you want to study. I would like to know more about the dependent variable and independent variables of interest etc.
