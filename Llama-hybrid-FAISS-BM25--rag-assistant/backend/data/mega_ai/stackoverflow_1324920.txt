In Windows Forms, how to stop the the UI thread from blocking when the user clicks a scrollbar?

No other control does this other than the scrollbars of panels, etc. Clicking and holding a button, a label, a link, a tab, whatever other control does not have this effect. But as soon as a user clicks the scrollbar, or clicks and drags the scrollbar, all other processing on the UI thread is halted. This is something that is a big problem for my application (a game, which needs to keep running in this circumstance), but I can't figure out a way to deal with this through overloads, adding in Application.DoEvents calls, or anything like that. Any thoughts?
