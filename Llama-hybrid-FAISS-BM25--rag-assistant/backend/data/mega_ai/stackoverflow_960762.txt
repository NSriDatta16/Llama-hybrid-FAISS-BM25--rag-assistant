An agile project management application should have: A shrubbery; an ejector seat; a recycling toilet; a user inteface; maybe a database; and a Cherry on top. But seriously... Agile really is just another work process... Team planning (Gantt charts), a minimal workflow engine, communications, general record-keeping, recording estimates verses actuals... It's all pretty well covered by existing software (and thats one of the reasons Agile took-off). Cheers. Keith.
