How to interpret the output of caret::findCorrelation function?

The output I received after applying findCorrelation function from the caret package is: > print(highlyCorrelated) [1] 1 12 13 5 10 19 25 24 15 So could I remove all of these features in supervised machine learning? How to interpret the result? Is it that column 1 and 12 are correlated, 13 and 5 are correlated? or some other way?
