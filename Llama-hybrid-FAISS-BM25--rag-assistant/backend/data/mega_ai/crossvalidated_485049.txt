On Nonparametric bootstrap predictive distributions

Consider a model $p(x|\boldsymbol{\theta})$ which is trained using $N$ i.i.d. observations $X=\left\{x_1, \ldots, x_N\right\}$ . Bayesian predictive distribution is defined as \begin{equation} p(\bar{x} \mid X)=\int p(\bar{x} \mid \boldsymbol{\theta}) p(\boldsymbol{\theta} \mid X) d \boldsymbol{\theta} \end{equation} which accounts for uncertainty about $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ . Fushiki (2005) proposed non-parametric bootstrap predictive distribution \begin{equation} p_B(\bar{x} \mid X)=\int p(\bar{x} \mid \theta_{MLE}(\tilde{X})) \hat{p}(\tilde{X}) d \tilde{X} \end{equation} where $\theta_{MLE}(\tilde{X})$ is the MLE calculated from a non-parametric bootstrap sample $\tilde{X}$ independently obtained from the empirical distribution \begin{equation} \hat{p}(x)=\frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} \delta\left(x-x_{i}\right) \end{equation} He states that the nonparametric bootstrap predictive distribution coincides with the parametric bootstrap predictive distribution up to second order. I was wondering: What does "second order" refer to in the statement above. Is this an approximation of Bayesian predictive distribution? Does this model the posterior $p(\boldsymbol{\theta}|X)$ to account for the variability of parameter $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ ? How?
