Unless it is particularly large, I would just go with the array in memory. For a bit more functionality - and a bit more overhead - you could use a list or a dictionary. For lots of functionality - but lots of overhead - you could use an in-memory dataset. Again, unless you have more than, say, 250-500 items, it really wouldn't make sense to use disk storage during the operation of your program: the overhead in both latency (retrieval time) and coding is just not worth it. You may well, of course, keep records on disk as your long-term storage (e.g. to be loaded when the program starts). However, it looks from your problem that you may not even need this if you are pulling the data from the OS.
