Why do Random forest and XGBoost gives different importance weight on the same set of features?

I am using both random forest and xgboost to examine the feature importance. but i noticed that they give different weights for features as shown in both figures below, for example HFmean-Wav had the most important in RF while it has been given less weight in XGBoost and i can understand why?
