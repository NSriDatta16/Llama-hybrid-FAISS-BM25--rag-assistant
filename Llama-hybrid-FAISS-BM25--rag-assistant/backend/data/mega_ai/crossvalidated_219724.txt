Likert scale is also known as summated score. You can average the score to get a single variable from different items. Alternatively, you can use Factor Analysis for dimension reduction. For multiple regression, you can simply use your model Creativity == constant + β1 Climate + β2 Motivation + error If there is literature support for presence of mediation effect. You can use Sobel's test (If sample size is good enough) or bootstraping to test for it. Analysis should come after theory. Only on the basis of past evidences, you can take variable 'motivation [or climate] as a mediator or moderator [More complex relationship may occur], analysis for both is different' Make sure to test for model assumptions as well.
