Poor mans answer: No, but you can estimate. Calc a simple average reading (use the first 250 lines) and go with that. estNumOfLines = sizeOfFile / avgLineSize You could store off the number of lines in the file when you are creating the file... Alternatively, you could display the number of KB processed, and that would be perfectly accurate.
