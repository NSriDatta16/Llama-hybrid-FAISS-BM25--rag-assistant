Bayesians don't lose the relative frequency-based interpretation of probability. In particular, if you define this procedure: simulate from the prior, then simulate from the model using those values from the prior, and estimate the parameters using the same prior. Then your credible intervals should have the appropriate frequentist coverage, i.e. 95% intervals should include the true parameter in 95% of your analyses, over repeated replicates of the procedure.
