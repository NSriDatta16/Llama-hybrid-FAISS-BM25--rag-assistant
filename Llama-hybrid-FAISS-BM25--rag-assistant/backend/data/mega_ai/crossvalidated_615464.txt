How can I model the multivariate probability distribution of a dataset with both continuous and discrete variables for sampling?

This might seem like a duplicate of the following link, but I think that one is asking how to create a completely new dataset with specific distributions, rather than how to model an existing dataset distribution. How do you create a multivariate distribution with both continuous and discrete data? Problem I have a dataset containing a mixture of continuous and discrete columns, which are all dependent on one another, so it's a multivariate distribution with both continuous and discrete variables. I want to model the distribution so that new/synthetic data points can be sampled from it. Ideally this would be done using existing Python libraries, but if this is not possible I'll give it a go in Python myself. Solution that I can't use There is a solution to this, and it involves using GANs to train a model that understands the distribution of the dataset. It's possible to do this in Python with Synthetic Data Vault . Unfortunately, I don't have GPU capabilities yet, and have too much data to train these GANs without a GPU. Hence the following... Continuous data If I had a multivariate distribution of continuous data, I would typically use something like sklearn's KernelDensity class to model the distribution and easily sample from it. Discrete data With discrete data, you could set up a probability mass function and sample from it with something like random.choices() in Python. Combining continuous and discrete However, I'm a bit stuck with datasets that are a combination of the two. I don't think KernelDensity is strictly valid for discrete variables, and I'm not sure how probability mass functions can be sampled from for multivariate data. I'm hoping there is a solution that allows for some kind of Bayesian modelling of the relationships between different columns across rows which leads to the ability to set up a conditional distribution and sample from it. But I'm not sure, can't find any online, and have ended up here for help.
