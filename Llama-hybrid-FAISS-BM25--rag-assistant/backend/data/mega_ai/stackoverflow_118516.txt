How do I read an Excel file into Python using xlrd? Can it read newer Office formats?

My issue is below but would be interested comments from anyone with experience with xlrd. I just found xlrd and it looks like the perfect solution but I'm having a little problem getting started. I am attempting to extract data programatically from an Excel file I pulled from Dow Jones with current components of the Dow Jones Industrial Average (link: http://www.djindexes.com/mdsidx/?event=showAverages ) When I open the file unmodified I get a nasty BIFF error (binary format not recognized) However you can see in this screenshot that Excel 2008 for Mac thinks it is in 'Excel 1997-2004' format (screenshot: http://skitch.com/alok/ssa3/componentreport-dji.xls-properties ) If I instead open it in Excel manually and save as 'Excel 1997-2004' format explicitly, then open in python usig xlrd, everything is wonderful. Remember, Office thinks the file is already in 'Excel 1997-2004' format. All files are .xls Here is a pastebin of an ipython session replicating the issue: http://pastie.textmate.org/private/jbawdtrvlrruh88mzueqdq Any thoughts on: How to trick xlrd into recognizing the file so I can extract data? How to use python to automate the explicit 'save as' format to one that xlrd will accept? Plan B?
