One iteration of Random Forest: Select $m$ features randomly as a candidate set of splitting features Within each of these features, find "best" cutpoint, where "best" is defined by Gini / Entropy / whatever measure Now you have $m$ features paired with their optimal cutpoints. Choose as your splitting feature and cutpoint the pair that has the "best" performance with respect to Gini / Entropy / whatever measure One iteration of Extremely Randomized Trees: Select $m$ features randomly as a candidate set of splitting features Within each of these features $F_i$, with $i \in {1, ...,m}$ draw a single random cutpoint uniformly from the interval $(min(F_i), max(F_i))$. Evaluate the performance of this feature with this cutpoint with respect to Gini / Entropy / whatever measure Now you have $m$ features paired with their randomly selected cutpoints. Choose as your splitting feature and cutpoint the pair that has the "best" performance with respect to Gini / Entropy / whatever measure
