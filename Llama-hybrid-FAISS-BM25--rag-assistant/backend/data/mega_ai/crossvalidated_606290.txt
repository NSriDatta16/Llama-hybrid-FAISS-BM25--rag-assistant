Here's a pragmatic and easy approach with room to expand and establish proofs, with the focus on the main problem: how do you generate a correlated uniform sample? Let $U_1, U_2$ be uniformly distributed and independent on the unit interval. Let $V_1 = U_1$ . For a desired correlation $d$ , let $G_{1,2}$ be yet another uniformly distributed random variable. Let $$V_2 = \left\{ \begin{array}{ccc} U_1 & \text{if} & G_{1,2} I claim that: One can show that $V_2$ is indeed uniformly distributed, with a correlation of $d$ with $V_1$ By way of induction, one can set an arbitrary sequence of uniform random variables and create a new sample having a desired covariance structure. As usual, this site is always most compelled by code, so I can show a couple cases of the spherical AR-1 auto correlation, where the correlation between observations with a lag of 1 is set to $d$ , but otherwise it's relatively straightforward to use any structure you want. do.one
