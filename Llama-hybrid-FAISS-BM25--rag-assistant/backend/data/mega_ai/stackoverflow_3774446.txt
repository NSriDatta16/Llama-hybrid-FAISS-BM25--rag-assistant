You can obtain some benchmarks by embedding jgGrid in a C# web application. Try loading data in xml format and JSON format into the grid and find out how much time each takes for each of your scenarios. There is no predetermined way in taking benchmarks as one outlasts the other depending on the situations and the scenarios. But as far as I know JSON beats xml in most of the cases.
