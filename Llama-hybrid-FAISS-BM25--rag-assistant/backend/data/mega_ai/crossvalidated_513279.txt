It seems you are expecting your stratified cross-tabs and the covariate-adjusted logistic regression model to yield the same implied odds and odds ratios, but they do not contain the same information or make the same assumptions about the data. To reproduce the results of a stratified analysis using logistic regression, you need to include an interaction between x1 and x2 in the model. This makes the model saturated, meaning it will perfectly reproduce the results of the cross-tab. See below: mod4 The odds are indeed 2 for being in the reference category of each variable. See my answer here for essentially the same question.
