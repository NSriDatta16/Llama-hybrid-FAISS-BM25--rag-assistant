How does a dictionary do a fast lookup

I am looking at the Item[TKey] source of Dictionary trying to understand the mechanism of storage/retrieval in a dictionary, and why it is faster than just checking each entry one by one. Where I get confused is in the user of prime numbers in buckets field and the interplay with Entry .next . Can someone explain to me the logic, or point to a reference where I can understand it. Thanks.
