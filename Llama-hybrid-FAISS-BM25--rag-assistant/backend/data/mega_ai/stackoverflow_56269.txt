Another way is using the E Factory builder from lxml (available in Elementtree too) >>> from lxml import etree >>> from lxml.builder import E >>> def CLASS(*args): # class is a reserved word in Python ... return {"class":' '.join(args)} >>> html = page = ( ... E.html( # create an Element called "html" ... E.head( ... E.title("This is a sample document") ... ), ... E.body( ... E.h1("Hello!", CLASS("title")), ... E.p("This is a paragraph with ", E.b("bold"), " text in it!"), ... E.p("This is another paragraph, with a", "\n ", ... E.a("link", href="http://www.python.org"), "."), ... E.p("Here are some reserved characters: ."), ... etree.XML(" And finally an embedded XHTML fragment. "), ... ) ... ) ... ) >>> print(etree.tostring(page, pretty_print=True)) This is a sample document Hello! This is a paragraph with bold text in it! This is another paragraph, with a link . Here are some reservered characters: &lt;spam&amp;egg&gt;. And finally an embedded XHTML fragment.
