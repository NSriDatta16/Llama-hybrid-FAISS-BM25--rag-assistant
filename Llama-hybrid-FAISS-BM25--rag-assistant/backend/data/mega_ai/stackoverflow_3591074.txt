We have the data and schema stored in xml and use liquibase to handle the updates to both the schema and the data. The advantage here is that you can diff the files to see what's going on, it plays nicely with any VCS and you can automate it. Due to the size of your database this would mean a sizable "version 0" file. But, using the migration strategy, after that the updates should be manageable as they would only be deltas. You might be able to convert your existing migrations one-to-one to liquibase as well which might be nicer than a big-bang approach. You can also leverage @belisarius' strategy if your deltas are very large so each developer doesn't have to apply the delta individually.
