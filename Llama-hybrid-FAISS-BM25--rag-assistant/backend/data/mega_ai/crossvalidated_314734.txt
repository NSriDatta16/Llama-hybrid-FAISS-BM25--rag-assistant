What data generation process corresponds to exponential moving average prediction?

For each ARMA process formulation, there is an optimal prediction. E.g.: When you believe that $y_{t+1}=\alpha y_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}$, where $\varepsilon_{t+1}$ are IID, you predict $\hat{y}_{t+1}=\alpha y_t$. When you believe that $y_{t+1}=\beta \varepsilon_{t} + \varepsilon_{t+1}$, where $\varepsilon_{t+1}$ are IID, you predict $\hat{y}_{t+1}=\beta y_t - \beta^2 y_{t-1} + \beta^3 y_{t-2}-\beta^4 y_{t-3}+...$. The question is: For which data generating process (except the obvious AR($\infty$)), the exponentially-moving-average forecast $\hat{y}_{t+1}=\alpha\sum_{i=0}^{\infty}(1-\alpha)^iy_{t-i}$ is optimal?
