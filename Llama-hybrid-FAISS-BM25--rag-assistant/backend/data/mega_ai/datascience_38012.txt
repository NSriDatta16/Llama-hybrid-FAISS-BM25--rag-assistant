You are describing multivariate time series analysis, modeling the interactions and comovements among a group of time series variables. You can start with a vector autoregression (VAR) model , one of the most successful, flexible, and easy to use models for the analysis of multivariate time series. Then work through the decomposition of time series . You'll have to decide if you want assume if all components time series are stationary and ergodic. Each component will have autocovariances and autocorrelations but there are also cross lead-lag covariances and correlations between all possible pairs of components.
