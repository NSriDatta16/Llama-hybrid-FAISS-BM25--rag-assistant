Use the tag and style accordingly. GIVE US A CALL AT ###.###.### CSS: .accessSlogan{ float: right; } .accessSlogan strong { font-size: 1.8em; position:relative; bottom:0.4em; } The point is to use the existing "semantic" HTML to work with you and avoiding over-complicating things. The tag is what you mean, so use it:-) The relative position of the strong text will need to be adjusted to align perfectly. 0.4em is a starting point (half of the extra height), but it depends upon the size of the accessSlogan text.
