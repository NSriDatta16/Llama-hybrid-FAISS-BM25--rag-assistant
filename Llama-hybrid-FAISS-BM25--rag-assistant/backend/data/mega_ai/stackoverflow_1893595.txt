What are the benefits of using names rather than version numbers?

This is a general question but I'll illustrate it with Eclipse. I recently reinstalled Eclipse and find that the distribs are called eclipse-java-galileo-SR1-win32 and eclipse-java-ganymede-SR2-win32 (I also have a "europa" from the past - what happens when we run out of Jupiter's moons?) I find this very confusing as there is no indication of which version is the latest and in fact I muddled them. This is not restricted to Eclipse, and several version of software come out with version names (e.g. the Mozilla family). Personally I would much prefer the normal decimal version numbering. What other examples are there of name confusion and is there any justification for it? update some early replies suggest some people prefer names to numbers and vice versa. Could we not have both, therefore? update A majority view (but not consensus) seems to be emerging that names are useful for developers before release but that n umbers are better after release
