You really don't have a imbalance problem per se, with 31 controls and 32 patients. What you have is different precision of the within-subject errors, as 4 patients only completed 2 out of 3 runs (presumably for reasons not related to the imaging results per se). The simplest solution would be to down-weight the cases having only 2 instead of 3 runs, corresponding to the lower precision of the per-voxel estimates in those cases. This would presumably be something on the order of $\sqrt{2/3}$ relative to the other cases. This is relatively straightforward to handle with penalized logistic regression (ridge or LASSO), which has a very close connection to SVM as explained in Section 9.5 of ISLR . Standard statistical software for logistic regression allows for such case weighting. I do not have experience with libsvm , but if that also allows for case-specific weights then that would provide an answer. Also, consider what the authors of ISLR have to say about the relative performance of logistic regression and SVM (page 357): When the classes are well separated, SVMs tend to behave better than logistic regression; in more overlapping regimes, logistic regression is often preferred. So logistic regression might be preferred unless there are very clear imaging distinctions between your control and patient classes. You have a fairly difficult problem here, with only 31 cases in the smaller group and a desire to use multiple voxels as features for classification. To avoid overfitting you are limited to about 2 or 3 unpenalized features, or a larger number of penalized features, with that sample size. (The rule of thumb is 10-20 cases in the smaller group per unpenalized feature.) Tuning parameters help prevent overfitting in SVM , similarly to the way that penalized logistic regression works; Chapter 9 of ISLR explains this issue in more detail. My sense is that proper handling of penalization to avoid overfitting will be a more pressing problem here than the relatively small difference in precision due to having only 2 instead of 3 observations for some subjects.
