Can I select both MSc in Data Science and MSc in Artificial Intelligence programs at the same time while applying for Chevening Scholarship?

I know that Data Science is a subset of Artificial Intelligence. So, the two Masters programs are pretty similar, as both of them teach Machine Learning. However, Artificial Intelligence program focuses on much wider topics, like Deep Learning and Big Data. Nonetheless, there are a lot of similarities. As the two programs are quite similar, can I choose the two programs at the same time while applying for Chevening scholarship? Right now, I have got three conditional offer letters: Durham University - MSc in Data Science University of Plymouth - MSc in Artificial Intelligence University of Chester - MSc in Computer Science I am looking forward to your advice on this matter.
