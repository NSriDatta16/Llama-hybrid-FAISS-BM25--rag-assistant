One option is to wrap the returned IEnumerable into your collection type by using/adding constructor that takes IEnumerable as CStick suggest. Perhaps a bit more ellegant way is to add an extension method for the IEnumerable type that would return your collection: static MyListObject ToMyList(this IEnumerable en) { // construct your MyListObject from 'en' somehow } // And then just write: var mylist = (from c in ... ).ToMyList() The last option that's probably too complicated for this simple scenario is to implement all the LINQ query operators for your type (extension methods Where, Select, and many many others). The plus thing is that you could (maybe) do some things more efficiently, but it's really a bit difficult thing to do.
