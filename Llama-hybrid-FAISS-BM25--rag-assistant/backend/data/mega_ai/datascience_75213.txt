best NN architecture for point prediction

I'm training to predict a single value y (continuos in [0,1] ) based on a number of variables x1, ..., x45 .

I read that it works best for things like image recognition/classification, and this is clearly not the case 2) Which NN would work best? The benchmarks would be the naive linear regression and the average x
