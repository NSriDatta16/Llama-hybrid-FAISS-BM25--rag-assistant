I found parts of an answer to the question in this paper by Gelman and Shalizi , so I will post here for reference (relevant bits below). Basically, the "best attainable" solution is given by the "distance" as measured by likelihood function, in accordance to probabilityislogic's answer. We still have the unsolved puzzle of whether the solutions are (2,4) and (8,10) or (7,5) as argued by probabilityislogic. References: Gelman, Andrew, and Cosma Rohilla Shalizi.
