Create GUI similar to Windows Explorer using WPF

How would you implement a GUI similar to the "My Computer" view in Windows Explorer? In particular the "Icons" view mode. Including the grouping of different item types (as Files Stored on This Computer/Hard Disk Drives/Devices with Removable Storage groups in Windows Explorer) In WinForms I would use a ListView for this thing but in WPF the only thing that has even come close is a listbox with a custom ControlTemplate but it seems like too much effort!
