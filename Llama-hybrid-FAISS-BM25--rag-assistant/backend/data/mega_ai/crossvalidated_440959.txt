The recommendations of @kjetil_b_halvorsen to take advantage of spatio-temporal correlations and to model as a latent variable are valuable (+1). I have a few additional suggestions on details of how to put that into practice. The principles of storm-drain overflow (I'm assuming that's what you mean by sewer )* are pretty simple in outline. Either more water is presented to the drain per minute than the grate over the drain can accommodate (e.g., a covering grate clogged by leaves or ice), or the inflow minus outflow (into a storm sewer system or into the ground with a local system) integrated over time has exceeded the capacity of the associated local catch basin. These principles suggest that you should be focusing on appropriate scales both of time and space. Rainfall sums over a day, or maximum hourly rainfall, or numbers of hours of rain per day do not tell the whole story. Consider looking in detail at the patterns of local rainfall before individual overflow events; you do seem to have hourly rainfall data for this purpose. Plots of local rainfall versus time before overflow events should provide a good deal of insight into the problem. Other things to consider for choosing scales of space and time: The rate at which a drain can empty into a sewer system will depend on what is being presented to the other drains in the system. The rate of emptying of a locally draining catch basin into the ground might depend on the season and on prior rainfalls integrated over days or weeks. The probability of inflow blockage by leaves or ice will depend on the season. Modern machine-learning capabilities can lead to over-reliance on automated or semi-automated modeling to solve problems like yours. When you know a fair amount about the underlying principles, however, starting from those principles in deciding how to formulate the model in the first place might be a better way to proceed. Considering estimates of time-integrated local rainfall as the input to the sewer, some longer-term temporal and broader spatial integration (along with seasonal characteristics) setting the outflow capacity, and perhaps some additional consideration of a seasonally-associated probability of inflow blockage, might give you a more useful model than simply throwing all your data into a logistic regression and seeing what comes out. *If you are considering larger-scale systems than individual storm drains, you need to scale up these principles accordingly.
