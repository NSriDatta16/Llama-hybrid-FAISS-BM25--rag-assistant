Looks like your framework isn't being copied into your target. If a framework isn't part of the system (ie, you have to distribute it with your app), you need to not only link your executable against the framework but to copy it into your app's ./Frameworks folder. To do this, add a Copy Files build phase, select "Frameworks" as the build phase's destination, then drag the framework (from your Frameworks folder in your Xcode project) under that Copy Files build phase you just created. If you already have a Copy Files build phase for Frameworks, then just use it instead of creating a new one.
