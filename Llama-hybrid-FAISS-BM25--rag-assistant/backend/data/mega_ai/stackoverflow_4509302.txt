jquery draggable: drag and drop elements with snap but no overlay?

you can see my code right here: http://jsfiddle.net/Pghqv/6/ i have 3 black bars that can be dragged and dropped. they even snap to each other when they are close enough - that's exactly what i want to have. the last feature i want to add is that it's not possible to stack to bars over each other. Kind of a hittest, whenever an element is dragged upon another one and the mouse is released it should snap to the outer edges of the bar underneath. any idea how i can make that work? thank you for your help!
