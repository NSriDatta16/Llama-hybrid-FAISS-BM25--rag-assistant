phpDocumentor alternative consuming less memory

Okay, I'm fed up with phpDocumentator . It consumes way much more memory (1.4 GB) and time (5 minutes on 2.6GHz Core 2 Duo) than I'm willing to give it. Does there exist some really compatible program to generate documentation for PHP code? I've tried PHPDoctor , which looks nice, but it has some missing features . However it is probably closest to be replacement from all solutions I've tried so far. I've also tried PhpDocGen , but it just bails out with some Perl errors, which I'm too lazy to study. Doxygen also does not seem to play well with our sources. PS: The documentation would be for phpMyAdmin , a little bit outdated documentation is here . Update: The code contains lot of functions and not only objects, what is the biggest problem with Doxygen, because it fails to organize them.
