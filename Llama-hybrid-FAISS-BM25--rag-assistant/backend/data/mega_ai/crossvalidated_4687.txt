Specifying conditional probabilities in hybrid Bayesian networks

I am trying to get a deeper understanding of the various types of Bayesian networks. Most of the literature/lectures I've come across use discrete random variables exclusively and only mention continuous random variables in passing. It seems if you want to mix discrete and continuous variables in a hybrid network, then you have a few different scenarios to handle: Child Is Parent(s) Are ---------------------------------------- Discrete All Discrete Discrete All Continuous Discrete Hybrid (Discrete and Continuous) Continuous All Discrete Continuous All Continuous Continuous Hybrid (Discrete and Continuous) I understand how to specify conditional probabilities (i.e. $p(N=n_i|P)$) for the cases where the parents (P) are all discrete. The conditional probabilities are essentially a lookup table that maps a condition to either a probability mass function (when child is discrete) or probability density function (when child is continuous). The other cases are numbing my brain. How does one go about specifying conditional probabilities of a given node when any of its parents are continuous? Thanks Edit Terminology has been (hopefully) corrected based on feedback.
