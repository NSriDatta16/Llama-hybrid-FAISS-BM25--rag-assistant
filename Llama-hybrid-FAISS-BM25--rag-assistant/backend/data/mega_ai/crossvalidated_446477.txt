Within subject, Multiple treatment: testing if each treatment further increases dependent variable?

Suppose I have data that looks something like the following for a single subject: Treatments: amount of a shot they receive, such as 5cc, 10cc, 15cc, 20cc Outcome of interest: energy level Question of interest: do increases in the amount of the shot received cause increased energy levels. And then assume that the above is done with multiple subjects (i.e. $n$ subjects face all possible treatments). Can someone point me in the direction of tests that work for such a situation? Or perhaps point me to a book/chapter that discusses this topic? Some thoughts: What if we looked at two treatments at a time. For example, consider the 5cc and 10cc treatment. Average the "energy level" of each subject for the 5cc treatment, and call this $e_{5cc}$ . Average the "energy level" of each subject for the 10cc treatment, and call this $e_{10cc}$ test if $e_{10cc} \geq e_{5cc}$ with two-sample t-test or something? or, alternatively, just compute the sign (+ or -) of the difference in energy levels, for each subject, between the 10cc and 5cc treament, and do a Sign test? However, if we look at two treatments at a time, how would we deal with the possibility that sometimes we see an increase and sometimes we see a decrease? For example, what if we see a significant increase from 5 to 10cc, a decrease from 10 to 15cc, and an increase from 15-20 cc. Somehow we would need to test if the increases outweigh the decreases... (i.e., we would need a way to find out which pairwise comparisons matter most)
