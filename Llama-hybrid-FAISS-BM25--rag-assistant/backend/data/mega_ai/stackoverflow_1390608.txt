If you read the restructure of org.aspectj document , that project did precisely that: All dependencies would be expressed in OSGi bundle manifest files, which specify a classpath (for library jars) and "required" bundles. Libraries expected or hoped for in the deployment environment (e.g., XML or JRocket ) must be included for build and test purposes but excluded from the shipping product. These might be specified as "optional" required-bundles or as required-packages Initial binary assembly would work through the usual bundle assembly, with the bundle output including binaries from bundle fragments it requires (but not from optional bundles) The benefits also include the version aspect of OSGi, which allows to specify the minimum and maximum expected version of a dependency.
