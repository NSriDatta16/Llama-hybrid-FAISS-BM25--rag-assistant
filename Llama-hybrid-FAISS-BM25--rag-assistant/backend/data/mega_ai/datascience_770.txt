I am not an export in using SVMs, but usually (if you are using a machine learning library like Python's scikit-learn or R's libsvm , there is the class_weight parameter, or class.weights , respectively. Or if you'd use a Bayes classifier, you would take this "skew" into account via the "prior (class) probabilities" P(Ï‰ j )
