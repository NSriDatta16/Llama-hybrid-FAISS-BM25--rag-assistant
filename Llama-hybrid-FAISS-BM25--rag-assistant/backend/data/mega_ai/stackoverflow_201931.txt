Here is an example of using XML with SQL: Authenticated users read and write data to various databases, not all of which are the same DBMS. Users for Company A use data from a local SQL Server database. Users for Company B use data from a remote Oracle database. And so on. A dozen different databases, each with slightly different schemas for the same basic data. The website developer does not have the ability to create stored procedures on the remote databases. SQL must be sent directly from the web app to the database. Since each database has a slightly different SQL syntax and schema, it is necessary to use different SQL for each of the 12 databases for the same operation (SELECT, INSERT, etc). One of the choices for embedding the SQL statements in the web app is to place them in XML files. Each XML file contains the set of SQL statements for one of the dozen databases. The code determines which database is accessed for the logged-in user, and retrieves the appropriate SQL from the specified XML file. Just as with stored procedures, the SQL in the XML file can be updated without stopping or recompiling the application.
