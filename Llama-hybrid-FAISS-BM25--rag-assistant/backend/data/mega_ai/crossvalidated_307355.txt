Anomaly detection

I am trying to categorize the functionality of batteries in one kind of device. I am using linear models to find the functionality of batteries over time (considering other variables in the device that uses the battery). Then I get the lm coefficient of battery over time and I am assuming that the batteris functionality should be normally distributed (since it is factory made) which I see it too. The goal is to not only categorize their functionality but also detect anomalies. I know I can use SVM algorithm to detect the anomalies but I dont think svm is the correct algorithm for it since I know what a good battery should be almost and the distribution is Gaussian. So I decided to categorize batteries : Good: if lm coefficients are within the 1SD from mean of distribution (n=4266) Bad: if 1SD Anomaly: if lm coefficient is less than 2SD (n=160) I am not sure if this is a naive criteria? What do you think?
