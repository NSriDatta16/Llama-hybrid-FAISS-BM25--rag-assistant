Using exceptions within a boost::thread thread

I began to play around with boost::threads, but I'm kind of stuck with this problem: I don't understand why this program crashes as soon as the exception is thrown, because I try to catch it within the thread. I thought that it would be possible to work with exceptions as long as the handling happens in the same thread as the throwing ? #include #include using namespace std; void doWork(); void thrower(); int main( int argc, char** argv ){ boost::thread worker(doWork); worker.join(); return 0; } void doWork(){ try{ thrower(); } catch( const exception &e ){ //handle exception } } void thrower(){ // program terminates as soon as the exception is thrown throw exception(); } Additional information: *Using MinGW32 *Boost v.1.44 *Linking dynamically against the multithread debug dll Version of the thread lib
