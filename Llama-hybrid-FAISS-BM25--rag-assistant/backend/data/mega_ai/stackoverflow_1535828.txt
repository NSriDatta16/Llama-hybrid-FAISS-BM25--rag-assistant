What you have here is "Service Location" rather than "Dependency Injection", although both are examples of "Inversion of Control". You'll want to read " Inversion of Control Containers and the Dependency Injection pattern ", and pay close attention to this section . Don't worry if you feel overwhelmed, it's a lot to take in all at once. For a slightly more structured introduction to a real world dependency injection tool, I highly recommend the Ninject User Guide .
