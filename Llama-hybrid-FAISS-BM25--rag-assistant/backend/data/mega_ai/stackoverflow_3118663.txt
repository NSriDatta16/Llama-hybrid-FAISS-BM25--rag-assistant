I think the problem is with your "gethint.php" page. Try to set the header of your PHP page to: header("Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8", true); header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); header("Expires: -1"); header("Pragma: no-cache"); And dont forget to print this line in your XML result (must be the first line) This guarantee that Internet Explorer will read it correctly. Clean your cache after the changes. I'm glad if it helped. Sorry for the bad english. It's not my primary language.
