The UAE Strategy for Artificial Intelligence is a national initiative launched by the United Arab Emirates in October 2017 as part of its broader UAE Centennial 2071 vision. It aims to position the UAE as a global leader in artificial intelligence (AI) by 2031, integrating AI technologies across key sectors such as healthcare, education, transportation, energy, and government services. The strategy includes the development of AI-friendly legislation, promotion of AI education, investment in infrastructure, and fostering international partnerships. The UAE was the first country to appoint a Minister of State for Artificial Intelligence to lead these efforts. In 2024, Abu Dhabi announced plans to build the worldâ€™s largest AI data center cluster. See also Artificial intelligence Economy of the United Arab Emirates == References ==
