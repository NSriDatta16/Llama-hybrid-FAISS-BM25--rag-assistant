This improves the accuracy to round about 60 percent. Is this realistic that just scaling the data improves the accuracy dramatically? Linguistic Features may take values far larger than word features, and I expect word features to be much more important than linguistic features, so this may explain the performance boost you have obtained after scaling. Now what could be the next step to improve the accuracy? Convolutional neural networks often beat logistic regression for text classification. SVMs are also worth trying, which should be straightforward in sklearn. You should also try to increase the size of your n-grams when using LR or SVM.
