How are PQL, REML, ML, Laplace, Gauss-Hermite related to each other?

While learning about the Generalized Linear Mixed Models, I often see the above terms. Sometimes it seems to me these are separate methods of estimation of (fixed? random? both?) effects, but when I read the literature, I see the terms mixed. For example PQL under REML. Some write, that the Penalized Qusi Likelihood works well for non-normal conditional response, like log-normal, but is biased in classic binomial or Poisson case, so I should use REML or ML for that. In other articles I can see that REML or ML is used only in linear models, while another articles say that REML is now available also for GLMM (glmmTMB in R, for example). So I understand the PQL is a separate method from REML. But then I see a book, where they compare various estimation methods, including PQL via REML. So, is REML a special case of the PQL? And then, where the Laplace or Gauss-Hermitte comes into play? I am totally lost. Let's consider it using the examples from R: glmmPQL, nlme, lme4, glmmTMB. I know, that glmmPQL uses PQL, nlme uses Laplace, lme4 uses LMER or ML, glmmTMB uses LMER for GLM. I also saw both Laplace and Gauss-Hermitte Quadrature term related to all of them except PQL. Is there a way to organize these methods?
