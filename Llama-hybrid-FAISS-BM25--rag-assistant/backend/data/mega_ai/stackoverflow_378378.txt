One reason people add selectors like *, html, or body (or in this case, all 3) to a stylesheet rule is to increase the selector specificity calculation. Of course, html will never be a child of anything else, so * html is a specific IE hack, but there is a reason why people would add html or body to a declaration: For example: html p { font-color: red } p { font-color: blue } Paragraphs within html tags (as in, all of them) is more specific than just paragraphs, so the font-color will be red, regardless of the ordering of these declarations in stylesheets. If there were a third rule with html body p it would take precedence. It's slightly less of a hack than using !important but it's better to key off of more semantic tags, if possible.
