2 solutions: You aggregate each sequence of numbers into a single number, which use as a feature. There exist plenty of aggregation functions, such as some derived from descriptive statistics root-mean-square, kurtosis, skewness, max, min, duration, standard deviation, crest factor, mean, or more specific aggregation such as fourier transforms or wavelet transforms. You use some model that accepts sequences as input. Sequences may be of variable length. Example of such model: recurrent neural networks , Dynamic Bayesian networks .
