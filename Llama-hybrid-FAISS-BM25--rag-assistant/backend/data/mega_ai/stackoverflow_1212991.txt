Do you think it's a good idea to save billions of images into Database?

Recently, I and my colleagues, we are discussing how to build a huge storage systems which could store billions a pictures which could searched and download quickly. Something like a fickr, but not for an online gallery. Which means, most of these picture will never be download. My colleages suggest that we should save all these files in database directly. I really feels that it's not a good idea and I think database is not desgined for restore huge number of binary files. But I have very strong reason for why that's not a good ideas. What do you think about it.
