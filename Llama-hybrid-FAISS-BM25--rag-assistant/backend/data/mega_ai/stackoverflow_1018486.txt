Code coverage tool is what you need, but you will have to run our program through all functionality and see what is repoted as unused. Since the code could be DLL exported functions you will have to make sure nothing uses them externally. Some code coverage tools: Purify, CTC++, Boundschecker may have code coverage functionality if I remember right and a bunch of other tools. Be very careful about removing any function that may have been exported without knowing what external program may be linking/using it.
