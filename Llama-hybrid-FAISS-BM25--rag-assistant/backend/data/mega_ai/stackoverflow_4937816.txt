You're currently performing an INNER JOIN, which eliminates things records with no associated ratings . Instead, an OUTER JOIN... SELECT AVG(COALESCE(ratings.rating, 0)), thing.id FROM things LEFT JOIN ratings ON things.id = ratings.thingId GROUP BY thing.id Will return ALL things , regardless of whether or not they have ratings . Note the use of COALESCE() , which will return the first non-NULL argument - thus things with no ratings will return 0 as their average.
