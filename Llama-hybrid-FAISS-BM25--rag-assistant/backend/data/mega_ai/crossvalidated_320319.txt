it should be pointed out that in drug development the evidence accrues across phase i - phase iii clinical trials. Although, if we're not bayesian then the phase iii is a stand alone trial. In fact the fda wants two phase iii studies showing statistical significance: http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0258(19980815/30)17:15/16%3C1813::AID-SIM983%3E3.0.CO;2-8/full . Stephen Senn points out that this implies a p-value of 1/1600 (see Senn's book statistical issues in drug development, sectn 12.2.8 the two-trials rule). ipso facto an inefficacious drug will not reach market
