From what I've seen of the big data/ML craze, thinking about sampling and the population from which your sample is drawn is just as important as ever--but thought about even less. I'm "auditing" the Stanford ML class, and thus far we've covered regression and neural networks with nary a mention of population inference. Since this class has been taken by 6 figures-worth of people, there are now an awful lot of people out there who know how to fit data very will without any notion of the idea of a sample.
