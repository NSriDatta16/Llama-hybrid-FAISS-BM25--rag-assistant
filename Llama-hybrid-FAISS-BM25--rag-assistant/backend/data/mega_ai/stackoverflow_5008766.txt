Is having one COD file a requirement? RIM provides support for a preprocessor, and the idea is that you can conditionally compile code, depending on your target OS. The app I have experience with uses browser agent sniffing to offer the appropriate COD file to BlackBerry users. AppWorld also allows you to submit multiple COD files for one application, where each one is tailored for a specific OS version. AppWorld provides the right one to users when they download your app.
