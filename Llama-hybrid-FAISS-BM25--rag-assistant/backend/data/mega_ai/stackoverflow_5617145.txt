Consider the contour dots algorithm described in http://outliner.codeplex.com/ It will produce the vector-described edges in the form of Bezier curves organized in strokes. You need some effort to choose the most straigh strokes (the end points are ready to use). This algoritms is quite fast but not super duper.
