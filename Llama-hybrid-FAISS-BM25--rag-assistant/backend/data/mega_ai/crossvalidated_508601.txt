I have always found variable reduction techniques hurting the predictability, especially for multi classification. Stepwise elimination methods are also not very effective with highly correlated predictors, they are time consuming too. It is a tough area to deal with and it should be done differently on case to case basis. In my experience the dimensionality reduction techniques like LDA or PLS worked well, however they demand huge memory allocation if the number of predictors are too large in number. Even running LASSO on large size will demand huge memory allocation. Hence we should continuously look for more creative statistical based approaches for reducing large size of number of predictors.
