In SQL 2008 you can redirect failing rows to e.g. a flat file destination. Go to the destination OLEDB task goto the error output (select all fields in the windows). With the combobox below choose redirect row and apply, then ok. Next drag a precedance contraint (red arrow) from the OLEDB to a new Flat file task and configure this task (don't change the default mapping of the columns). Now you should be able to find the error row more easy. Eric
