Efficient Tuple List Comparisons

I am kind of hitting a wall on this problem and I was wondering if some fresh brains could help me out. I have a large list of four element tuples in the format: (ID number, Type, Start Index, End Index) Previously in the code, I have searched through thousands of blocks of text for two specific types of substrings. These tuples store in which large chunk of text the substring was found, which of the two types of substrings it is, and the start and end index of this substring. The final goal is to look through this list to find all instances where a type 1 substring occurs before a type 2 substring in a block of text with the same ID. Then I would like to store these objects in the format (ID, Type 1, Start, End, Type2, Start, End). I've tried to mess around with a bunch of stuff that was super inefficient. I have the list sorted by ID then Start Index, and if been trying varying ways of popping the items off the list for comparisons. I have to imagine there is a more elegant solution. Any brilliant people out there wish to assist my tired brain??? Thanks in advance
