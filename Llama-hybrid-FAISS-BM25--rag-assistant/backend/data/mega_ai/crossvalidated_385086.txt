The accepted answer is informative (I upvoted it myself), but it assumes that the "series" term in Time Series is really a misnomer and should be "sequence" instead. For the first few decades in the development of time series analysis, 1920s and 1930s, time series was synonymous with ARMA time series. An MA time series is indeed a sum of a sequence of white noise innovations. An AR time series, if covariance stationary, is also a sum of a sequence of white noise innovations. It may well be that the name "series" in time series was very appropriately assigned to time series, when these were synonymous with ARMA time series, but as other types of time series were discovered, which did not have a similar representation as a sum, nobody went back to revise the term because it's been used for decades and it may have just stuck in the statistics community.
