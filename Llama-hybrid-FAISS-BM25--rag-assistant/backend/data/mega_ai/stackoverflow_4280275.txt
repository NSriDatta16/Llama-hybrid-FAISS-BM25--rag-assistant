While INI files may not be the best format, I think you can safely ignore the warning MSDN puts on WritePrivateProfileString and ReadPrivateProfileString. Those two functions are NEVER going away. It would break THOUSANDS of applications. That warning has been there for years and I suspect was added when the registry was all the rage and someone naively thought it would one day completely replace INI files. I might be wrong but it would be very unlike Microsoft to break so many existing apps like this for no good reasons. (Not that they do not occasionally break backwards compatibility, but this would cause huge problems for zero benefit.)
