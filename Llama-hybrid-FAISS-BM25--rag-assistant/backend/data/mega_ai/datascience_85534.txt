How do we choose which feature(column) should we normalize or scale

I am a newcomer to machine learning, I was going through scaling and normalization. When I tried to explore most of the documentation on web, I found people explaining that the dataset needs to be scaled and normalized. But wanted to understand when to scale or normalize a column? And how to choose which feature/column in a dataset for scaling and normalization. And how to decide on which normalization algorithm to choose for a column?
