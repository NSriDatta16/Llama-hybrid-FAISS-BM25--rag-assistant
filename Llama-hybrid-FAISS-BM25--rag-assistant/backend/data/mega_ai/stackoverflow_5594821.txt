Pop across to this question on vulnerable Operating Systems at Security Stack Exchange or this one on vulnerable servers for penetration testing (especially this answer which has an awesome list) We have a few questions around this topic or Security Education in general, adn as a growing resource for IT and Information Security it could be well worth you popping over. Snippet of content from over there: http://www.irongeek.com/i.php?page=security/wargames WebGoat. WebGoat is a set of deliberately insecure Java server pages http://www.hackthissite.org/ http://www.smashthestack.org/wargames.php from their FAQ The Smash the Stack Wargaming Network hosts several Wargames. A Wargame in our context can be described as an ethical hacking environment that supports the simulation of real world software vulnerability theories or concepts and allows for the legal execution of exploitation techniques. Software can be an Operating System, network protocol, or any userland application. Blockquote http://www.astalavista.com/page/wargames.html http://www.governmentsecurity.org/forum/index.php?showtopic=15442 http://www.overthewire.org/wargames/ the list is long... some are up, some not... Update 26 Feb 2011, i found a nice post from http://r00tsec.blogspot.com/2011/02/pentest-lab-vulnerable-servers.html . Some links might be broken. I copy from there: Holynix Similar to the de-ice Cd’s and pWnOS, holynix is an ubuntu server vmware image that was deliberately built to have security holes for the purposes of penetration testing. More of an obstacle course than a real world example. http://pynstrom.net/index.php?page=holynix.php WackoPicko WackoPicko is a website that contains known vulnerabilities. It was first used for the paper Why Johnny Can’t Pentest: An Analysis of Black-box Web Vulnerability Scanners found: http://cs.ucsb.edu/~adoupe/static/black-box-scanners-dimva2010.pdf https://github.com/adamdoupe/WackoPicko De-ICE PenTest LiveCDs The PenTest LiveCDs are the creation of Thomas Wilhelm, who was transferred to a penetration test team at the company he worked for. Needing to learn as much about penetration testing as quickly as possible, Thomas began looking for both tools and targets. He found a number of tools, but no usable targets to practice against. Eventually, in an attempt to narrow the learning gap, Thomas created PenTest scenarios using LiveCDs. http://de-ice.net/hackerpedia/index.php/De-ICE.net_PenTest_Disks Metasploitable Metasploitable is an Ubuntu 8.04 server install on a VMWare 6.5 image. A number of vulnerable packages are included, including an install of tomcat 5.5 (with weak credentials), distcc, tikiwiki, twiki, and an older mysql. http://blog.metasploit.com/2010/05/introducing-metasploitable.html Owaspbwa Open Web Application Security Project (OWASP) Broken Web Applications Project, a collection of vulnerable web applications. http://code.google.com/p/owaspbwa/ Web Security Dojo A free open-source self-contained training environment for Web Application Security penetration testing. Tools + Targets = Dojo http://www.mavensecurity.com/web_security_dojo/ Lampsecurity LAMPSecurity training is designed to be a series of vunlerable virtual machine images along with complementary documentation designed to teach linux,apache,php,mysql security. http://sourceforge.net/projects/lampsecurity/files/ Damn Vulnerable Web App (DVWA) Damn Vulnerable Web App is a PHP/MySQL web application that is damn vulnerable. Its main goals are to be an aid for security professionals to test their skills and tools in a legal environment, help web developers better understand the processes of securing web applications and aid teachers/students to teach/learn web application security in a class room environment. www.dvwa.co.uk/ Hacking-Lab This is the Hacking-Lab LiveCD project. It is currently in beta stadium. The live-cd is a standardized client environment for solving our Hacking-Lab wargame challenges from remote. http://www.hacking-lab.com/hl_livecd/ Moth Moth is a VMware image with a set of vulnerable Web Applications and scripts, that you may use for: http://www.bonsai-sec.com/en/research/moth.php Damn Vulnerable Linux (DVL) Damn Vulnerable Linux is everything a good Linux distribution isn’t. Its developers have spent hours stuffing it with broken, ill-configured, outdated, and exploitable software that makes it vulnerable to attacks. DVL isn’t built to run on your desktop – it’s a learning tool for security students. http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.org pWnOS pWnOS is on a “VM Image”, that creates a target on which to practice penetration testing; with the “end goal” is to get root. It was designed to practice using exploits, with multiple entry points http://www.backtrack-linux.org/forums/backtrack-videos/2748-%5Bvideo%5D-attacking-pwnos.html http://www.krash.in/bond00/pWnOS%20v1.0.zip Virtual Hacking Lab A mirror of deliberately insecure applications and old softwares with known vulnerabilities. Used for proof-of-concept /security training/learning purposes. Available in either virtual images or live iso or standalone formats. http://sourceforge.net/projects/virtualhacking/files/ Badstore Badstore.net is dedicated to helping you understand how hackers prey on Web application vulnerabilities, and to showing you how to reduce your exposure. http://www.badstore.net/ Katana Katana is a portable multi-boot security suite which brings together many of today’s best security distributions and portable applications to run off a single Flash Drive. It includes distributions which focus on Pen-Testing, Auditing, Forensics, System Recovery, Network Analysis, and Malware Removal. Katana also comes with over 100 portable Windows applications; such as Wireshark, Metasploit, NMAP, Cain & Able, and many more. www.hackfromacave.com/katana.html
