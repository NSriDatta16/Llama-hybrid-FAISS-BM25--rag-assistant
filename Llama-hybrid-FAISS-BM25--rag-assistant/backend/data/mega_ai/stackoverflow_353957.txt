I'd look at the Pragmatic Version Control using Subversion book. They lay out a really good structure for organizing both the repository itself as well as for handing tagging, branching, and the trunk with regard to releases, bug fixes, new features, experiments, etc. They've got a naming convention for all of that as well as "recipes" for the SVN commands to take care of each. It's a fairly quick read and they've done much of the thinking and heavy lifting for you, including the stuff you haven't thought of yet.
