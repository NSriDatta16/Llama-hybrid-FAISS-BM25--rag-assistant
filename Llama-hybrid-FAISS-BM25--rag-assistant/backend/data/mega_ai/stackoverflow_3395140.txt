I've used Velocity for source code generation in the past. It worked fairly well, but I ended up writing a fair bit of the generator in Java anyway. Velocity is good when there is a straight-forward from your data structures to the target code. The trick is to get the in-memory data structures into the right form before you start generating. This may involve making preliminary passes over the data to reorganize things. (And I'm not going to criticize COBOL as a target language. There's clearly a pragmatic reason for using it. Nuff said.) Other alternatives to Velocity include Freemarker and JET (used in the Eclipse / EMF world).
