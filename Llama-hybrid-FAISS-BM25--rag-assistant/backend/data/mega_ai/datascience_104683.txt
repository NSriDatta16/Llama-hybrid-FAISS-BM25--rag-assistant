I have been thinking of using shapley values to cluster predictions. Indeed, for samples having the same prediction, the contributions of each feature leading to that prediction can be different. This information could be captured with techniques decomposing the prediction into "contributions" (or a proxy of contributions) such as shapley values. So clustering data according to a target could be done following these three steps: train a supervised ML model (e.g. a random forest) extract the shapley values for every sample cluster samples using their shapley values A quick search on google led me to the same idea in Christoph Molnar's famous book , so it comforts me in this approach.
