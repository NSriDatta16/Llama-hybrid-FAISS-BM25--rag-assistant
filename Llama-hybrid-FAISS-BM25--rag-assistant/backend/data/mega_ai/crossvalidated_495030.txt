Can two weak stationary time series $X_t, Y_t$ have covariance $\mathrm{Cov}(X_t,Y_t)$ that changes over time?

Can two weak stationary time series $X_t, Y_t$ have covariance $Cov(X_t,Y_t)$ that changes over time? No solution is needed, please give me some hints. I think it can but I find it is difficult to support my idea.
