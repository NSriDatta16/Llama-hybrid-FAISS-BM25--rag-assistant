Let's say you are working with images that are normalized between [0,..,1] this would be the domain of x as referred in the paper right? No, the domain of X would be "images of [whatever they contain (e.g. dogs)] normalized between 0 and 1". Does this mean that I would have to sample my z from the domain of x, i.e: [0,..,1] ? No, they are both different domains and the generator $G$ maps between them. In the paragraph you linked, the authors just point out that the generator $G$ is a function that maps the input data (i.e. random vectors following a uniform distribution in $[0, 1]$ ) to the output data (e.g. images of dogs) and that the mapping is non-regular, meaning that very different inputs may lead to similar outputs and vice versa.
