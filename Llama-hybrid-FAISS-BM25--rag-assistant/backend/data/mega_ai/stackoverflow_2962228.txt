tkinter 's major advantage (IMHO!) is that it comes with Python (at least on Windows). It looks ugly, and there's no progress bar or something like that (at least not builtin). Being a thin wrapper around Tk, its API doesn't feel very elegant or intuitive. However, there are quite a few good Tkinter resources on the web so learning it is not necessarily a pain. For any serious GUI attempts, I'd go for wxPython as well. I don't know about packaging, though. But I wouldn't expect any problems.
