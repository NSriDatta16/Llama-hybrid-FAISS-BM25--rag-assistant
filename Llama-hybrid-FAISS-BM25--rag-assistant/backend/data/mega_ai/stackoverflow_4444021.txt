Remote XML retrieval

I'm retrieving a remote XML file with wget -O remotefile localfile with a cron tab. Every so often the local file becomes malformed probably because of double whitespace (according to firefox) between the CDATA tags. Sometimes the parser gives an error for ' > ' missing, but upon checking the xml file the ' > ' exists... The remote xml file never gives malformed errors when called in the url. EDIT It seems CDATA is not parsed by the xml parser. (w3schools) Is there a way to set wget to retain wellformed XML? If not wget, What is a good way to continously retrieve a remote XML file and keep it well formed?
