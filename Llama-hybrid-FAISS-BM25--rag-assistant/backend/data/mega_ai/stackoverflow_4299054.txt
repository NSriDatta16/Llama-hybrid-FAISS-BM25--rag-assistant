Check the class of the instances. The hash code is probably not the issue, but the objects are most likely hibernate proxies which is the issue. Check if equals() is being called during contains() Also, changing this g:if to g:if test="${session.user.settings.id in documentInstance.downloadingOrganisations*.id}" May fix it.
