In Oracle, how do I make an external table that has the exact same structure as an existing table?

I know that you can create a table for export like this: create table bulk_mbr organization external( type ORACLE_DATAPUMP default directory jason_home location ('mbr.dat')) as SELECT * FROM mbr; But I'd like to do something like this for imports so I can create an external import table with the same structure as an existing table, load data into it, and then do a simple INSERT INTO/SELECT FROM query to move the data over there. Is there a way to do this? I've tried this, but it doesn't work: create table bulk_mbr organization external( type ORACLE_LOADER default directory jason_home location ('mbr.dat')) as SELECT * FROM mbr where 1=0; But got: ORA-30657: operation not supported on external organized table
