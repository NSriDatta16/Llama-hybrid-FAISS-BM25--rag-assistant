Rank links from rss feed

I am trying to create a script to filter the most "intersting" articles from an rss feed and rank them. feeds = ['http://feeds.theguardian.com/theguardian/technology/rss', 'http://rss.cnn.com/rss/money_news_international.rss', 'https://news.ycombinator.com/rss?format=xml', 'http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/companyNews', 'http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/businessNews'] I tried using applying the K-means algorithm to RSS feeds to filter the most popular articles from thousands of links in an attempts to reduce my personal RSS reading time. However, I feel that this might not be state of the art. Any suggestions on papers, actual implementations or approaches to get a proper list of " must-read " articles. I appreciate your replies!
