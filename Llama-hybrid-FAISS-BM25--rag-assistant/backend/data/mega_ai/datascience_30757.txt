Geometric and harmonic means in ensembling methods

When using ensembling methods for regression, a common approach is to average (using the arithmetic mean) the outputs of the weak learners in order to obtain the output of the ensemble. Is there a reason why the average that people take is the arithmetic mean? Why not performing a geometric or harmonic mean?
