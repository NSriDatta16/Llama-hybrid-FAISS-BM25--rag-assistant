No, the Dickey-Fuller test statistic does not show whether the residuals are serially correlated. To find that out, you should either manually build the test regression and extract the residuals; or extract the residuals from the output of the Dickey-Fuller test; and then test them for autocorrelation. Breusch-Godfrey test can be used for that (but it requires a whole model, not only the residuals). Here is how you can do it in R using "lmtest" and "urca" packages: library(lmtest) library(urca) bgtest(ur.df(x)) where x is your time series.
