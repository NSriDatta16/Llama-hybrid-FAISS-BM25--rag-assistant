in HTML, the Formfeed character (U+000C) is treated as white space, in XHTML http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#C_15 Also http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#uaconf (point 9): White space is handled according to the following rules. The following characters are defined in [XML] white space characters: SPACE ( ) HORIZONTAL TABULATION ( ) CARRIAGE RETURN ( ) LINE FEED ( ) The XML processor normalizes different systems' line end codes into one single LINE FEED character, that is passed up to the application. The user agent must use the definition from CSS for processing whitespace characters [CSS2]. Note that the CSS2 recommendation does not explicitly address the issue of whitespace handling in non-Latin character sets. This will be addressed in a future version of CSS, at which time this reference will be updated.
