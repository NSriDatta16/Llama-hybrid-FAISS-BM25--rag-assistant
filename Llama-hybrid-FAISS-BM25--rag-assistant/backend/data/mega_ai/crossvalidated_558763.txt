There are at least two roles for cost/loss functions in machine learning: in training and in evaluation. OLS is an estimator that corresponds to square cost in training. So if you choose OLS, you know your training cost. You may still need to specify evaluation cost for evaluating your model, and evaluation cost may differ from training cost. For a more in-depth review, see "Why is using squared error the standard when absolute error is more relevant to most problems?" .
