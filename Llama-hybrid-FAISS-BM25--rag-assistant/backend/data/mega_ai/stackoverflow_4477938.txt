It seems you're looking for a k -nearest-neighbor clustering algorithm. Yes, kd -trees are an option, and in fact the fastest option that I am aware of. To cite the Wikipedia: k -nearest neighbor clustering "can be used for regression, by simply assigning the property value for the object to be the average of the values of its k nearest neighbors. It can be useful to weight the contributions of the neighbors, so that the nearer neighbors contribute more to the average than the more distant ones." This seems to be what you want.
