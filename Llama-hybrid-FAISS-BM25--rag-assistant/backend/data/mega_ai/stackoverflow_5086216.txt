Hudson is basically using flat file storage. You can find those files within Hudson in the jobs/builds/ folders. I'm not sure I'd say, "Use Hudson as an alternative to checking in file to source control" but using something as an alternative is a decent idea if it provides: authoritative place to store versioned binaries access control checksums for tamper resistance release meta-data (environment information; approval level) retention periods I'm not sure how well Hudson scores on those marks, but I think it does at least some of that. SVN is non-terrible as a solution there as well, but really struggles with retention periods (old builds tend to eat disk space like crazy) and isn't terribly well optimized for large binaries - most SCM systems are optimized for smallish text files. I stole the list above from this presentation: http://www.anthillpro.com/html/resources/webinars/Role_of_Binary_repositories_in_Software_Configuration_Management.html (registration required)
