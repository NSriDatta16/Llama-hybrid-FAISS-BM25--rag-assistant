Given a classifier with 2-classes (e.g. a 2 class linear discriminant or logistic regression classifier) the discriminant value for both classes can be applied to a softmax function to yield an estimate of the posterior probability for that class: P1 = exp(d1)/(exp(d1) + exp(d2)) Where P1 is the posterior probability estimate for class 1, d1 and d2 are discriminant values for classes 1 and 2 respectively. In this case the estimated posterior probability for a given class can be taken as a degree of confidence in the class, for a given case as P1 will equal 1 - P2.
