prediction on short time series with seasonality and data correlations

I have, say, 5 weeks of data standing for daily income of a company and I want to predict the next income. Obviously, there is a seasonality in data - every day is "seasonal" with the same day of the previous week. Obviously, there is a correlation between preceding days - if for 5 days there is a decrease in income, it probably means something. The data is small. Any ideas on which model may suit best for such data? Using value of the previous week on the same day as predictor does not give good results. Using mean of previous values in some time-window does not give good results (either of same days from previous weeks or all days from previous weeks). Using weighted mean (or median) does not give good results too. I am new at time series analysis and from what I read, ARIMA can give an over fit for such series. Moreover, ARIMA will not really take into consideration the seasonality - on the contrary, it's advised to remove trends and seasonality from the system and bring the TS into stationary to use ARIMA. But it there are certain weeks where there is an increase and then say no sails, it's really hard to remove these automatically - too many conditions to test. It's obvious that I am not the first one who tackles this problem. Strangely I failed to find any comprehensive literature on the subject - a sea of signal processing works and nothing fits :-( Any suggestions/comments/approaches will be really appreciated. Following the request: a sample of data - 4 days out of 7 of the week available for 6 diff companies (the other 3 are unavailable, so let's assume that it's a 4-day week, it can also match quarterly results or else): A B C D E F 0.0428 0.3703 0.0656 0.0285 0.4171 0.0758 0.0402 0.3775 0.0621 0.0351 0.4050 0.0802 0.0420 0.4339 0.0395 0.0362 0.3512 0.0972 0.0365 0.4470 0.0516 0.0317 0.3352 0.0980 0.0387 0.4952 0.0346 0.0306 0.2888 0.1119 0.0349 0.4465 0.0515 0.0179 0.3228 0.1263 0.0325 0.4672 0.0567 0.0158 0.3087 0.1191 0.0318 0.4564 0.0464 0.0211 0.3258 0.1185 0.0351 0.5143 0.0398 0.0132 0.2650 0.1327 0.0326 0.4758 0.0597 0.0108 0.3004 0.1206 0.0366 0.5058 0.0275 0.0103 0.2764 0.1436 0.0342 0.4622 0.0591 0.0140 0.2972 0.1334 0.0366 0.5136 0.0345 0.0106 0.2385 0.1662 0.0330 0.4776 0.0413 0.0076 0.2814 0.1591 0.0320 0.5127 0.0320 0.0067 0.2578 0.1588 0.0162 0.4964 0.0506 0.0085 0.2747 0.1536 0.0179 0.5495 0.0572 0.0077 0.1969 0.1707 0.0171 0.5650 0.0450 0.0062 0.1916 0.1751 0.0138 0.5170 0.0431 0.0070 0.2191 0.2000 0.0124 0.4889 0.0550 0.0192 0.2370 0.1875 0.0135 0.5259 0.0508 0.0037 0.2104 0.1957 0.0050 0.5041 0.0503 0.0160 0.2363 0.1883 0.0122 0.5661 0.0549 0.0123 0.2116 0.1428 0.0063 0.5652 0.0209 0.0108 0.2330 0.1638 0.0035 0.5596 0.0367 0.0026 0.2419 0.1558 0.0017 0.5793 0.0307 0.0029 0.2203 0.1652 0.0006 0.6107 0.0307 0.0020 0.1916 0.1643 0 0.6394 0.0403 0.0021 0.1533 0.1650 0 0.6897 0.0232 0.0034 0.1093 0.1744 0 0.6674 0.0224 0.0057 0.1330 0.1715 0 0.6993 0.0257 0.0043 0.1010 0.1697 0 0.6628 0.0366 0.0061 0.1338 0.1607 0 0.6905 0.0347 0.0076 0.1096 0.1576 0 0.7152 0.0314 0.0077 0.0808 0.1648 0 0.7220 0.0246 0.0102 0.0830 0.1602 0 0.7006 0.0401 0.0065 0.0835 0.1693 0 0.7509 0.0190 0.0043 0.0667 0.1591 0 0.7374 0.0364 0.0066 0.0489 0.1707 0 0.7356 0.0171 0.0101 0.0593 0.1780 0 0.7371 0.0309 0.0082 0.0460 0.1779 0 0.7446 0.0212 0.0071 0.0302 0.1969 0 0.7374 0.0213 0.0062 0.0485 0.1866 0 0.7733 0.0174 0.0036 0.0295 0.1761 0 0.7683 0.0264 0.0010 0.0417 0.1626 0 0.7346 0.0209 0.0009 0.0396 0.2039 0 0.7277 0.0182 0.0036 0.0379 0.2126 0 0.7326 0.0219 0.0029 0.0316 0.2110 0 0.7306 0.0144 0.0014 0.0318 0.2218
