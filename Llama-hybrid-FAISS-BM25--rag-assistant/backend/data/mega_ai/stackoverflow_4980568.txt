Firstly, I disagree with everyone who says to use BigDecimal . Even if your 'backing storage' is BigDecimal (which is very sensible), you should use your own class because having BigDecimal fields, method parameters, etc, conveys no semantics. Commonly re-used types like currency amounts should have their own classes. All that said, don't write your own. There are plenty of libraries for this which already exist and have thought through many of the issues for you. Personally, I'd start with Joda-Money , by Stephen Colebourne (of Joda-Time fame).
