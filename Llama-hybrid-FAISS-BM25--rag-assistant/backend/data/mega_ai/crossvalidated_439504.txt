Can I apply PCA on continuous data and reduce the dimensions and keep categorical data as it is?

I have a dataset which contains 95 highly correlated continuous variables and other 3 categorical variables. I want to reduce the dimension of the data and by that I can deal with correlation as well. I know that I can not apply PCA on categorical data as they do not have concept of variance. I read about Multiple Factor Analysis but I do not feel confident about it. Can I do PCA on continuous data to reduce dimensions and keep categorical data as they are? The data are sensor data and my application is to predict the machine failure. Thank you, Arch
