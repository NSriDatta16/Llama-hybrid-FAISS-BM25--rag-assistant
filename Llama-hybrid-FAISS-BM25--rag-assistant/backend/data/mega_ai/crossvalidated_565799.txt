Comparing survey multiple choice survey questions response percentages between a subset's responses and the total collected responses

I have a survey composed of multiple choice questions. Several distinct branches of the same organization responded to the survey. I want to see if the distribution of answers from one branch is statistically different from the answers of all the branches combined (including the branch in question). For example: Q1: Do you feel staff safety has been increasing, declining, or staying the same? a) Increasing b) Declining c) Staying the same d) Uncertain If Branch A answered 25% A, 30% B, 25% C, and 20% D, whereas the organization as a whole answered 50% A, 20% B, 20% C, and 10% D, is there a test I could use to validate that Branch A's difference from the Organization is statistically significant? I used percentages because the branches have different numbers of responses. I am assuming my data in non-parametric. I thought about using a Chi Square test, but I don't know if that is appropriate given that I know my populations are not independent. Thanks for the help!
