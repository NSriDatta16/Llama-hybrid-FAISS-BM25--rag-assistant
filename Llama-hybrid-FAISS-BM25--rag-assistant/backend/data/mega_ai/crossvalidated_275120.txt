Binary prediction with time serial and dummys

I have this data set. I have 4 individuos, Y binary dependent variable. I want calculate (prediction) the probability of sale of the car d (?%), in the years 2001, 2002, 2003. The variables macroeconomics is for each city, but for some the values it is the same, I want than the model capture this relation and can predict well a car in a city with few train data using the train date of other city with the same macroeconomic variable o very similar. I have variables of the car, and they is atemporal, it have the same value for all years. I saw a Bayesian approach to solve this problem, but I think that the an easier solution can be found.
