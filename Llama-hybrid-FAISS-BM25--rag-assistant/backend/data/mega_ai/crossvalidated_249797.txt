If your data (to be predicted) is pure fractions/percentages, then logistic regression is not really appropriate. The closest continuous analogue would probably be to assume the data is logit-normal . I have done this before in similar situations and gotten reasonable results (however my "ad hoc" approach was not really statistically rigorous). In the more statistically rigorous GLM framework, you could still use a logit link function as in logistic regression, but the (conditional) data distribution will no longer be Bernoulli distributed. As you hint in your last point, beta regression is probably the most common approach for predicting a fraction/percentage (i.e. you assume a Beta distribution rather than a logit-normal). This would certainly be more appropriate than logistic regression, and I imagine it should be straightforward in R (which I do not use, so YMMV ). The second factor to consider though, as mentioned in the comments, is the possibility of using the raw counts rather than the percentages. This will affect the relative uncertainty of your data, e.g. $0.5=\frac{1}{2}=\frac{500}{1000}$ but the second ratio has much less uncertainty than the first. So if you can use the raw counts that approach should be strongly preferred! For integer count data, possible distributions would be Binomial or Poisson. For continuous "count" (i.e. non-negative weight) data, a Gamma distribution could be appropriate. (Note that the Beta distribution can be interpreted as the mixing-fraction for a binary mixture of two Gamma-distributed components.) In the count case you can model the two "component-counts" as your primary variables, i.e. if $y=\frac{A}{A+B}$ then you can model $A[x]$ and $B[x]$. Or you could model $A$ and the "total mass" $C=A+B$, depending on the relative correlations. For example if $C$ is relatively constant, $B$ will be strongly correlated to $A$, so $C$ may be a better 2nd variable to target, i.e. more independent.
