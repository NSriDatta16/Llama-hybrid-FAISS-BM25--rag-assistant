When she says she doesn't want to over complicate the database, maybe she meant she doesn't know or isn't competent in normalizing databases. In that case one way would be to try to convince her of the benefits of normalizing plus sending her to study database normalizing. One reason to normalize would be that just creating a database isn't the only requirement for a database. The database exists because it is used as data storage. And what stores the data? The application software. So the database creator should honor the software developer so much that she normalizes the database. Otherwise it would be a really awkward situation. To ease things out, you could show a few simpler normalization operations at first to get started with it.
