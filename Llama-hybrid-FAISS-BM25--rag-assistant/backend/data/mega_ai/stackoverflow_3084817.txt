you can pass options using either the 'SMO_OPTS' or the 'QUADPROG_OPTS' flags depending on which method you are using SVMTRAIN(...,'QUADPROG_OPTS',OPTIONS) or SVMTRAIN(...,'SMO_OPTS',SMO_OPTIONS) to create QP options, use optimset, to create SMO_OPTS, use svmsmoset. either way, it's the maxiter field that you want to change. doc svmsmoset OPTIONS = SVMSMOSET('NAME1',VALUE1,'NAME2',VALUE2,...) MaxIter Maximum number of iterations of main loop. If this number is exceeded before the algorithm converges then the algorithm stops and gives an error. Default value is 15000. By the way, help svmtrain or doc svmtrain contains all this info
