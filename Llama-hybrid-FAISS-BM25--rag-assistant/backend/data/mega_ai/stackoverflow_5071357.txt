showing UiImageView when tapped

I want to add an image view that should be hidden by default, and when the user taps its location, the image should appear. For example: If there is a chocolate bar and I added a small UIImageView on top of the left bottom piece and set it to be hidden, when the user taps that piece of chocolate, the new small image view should come and cover that tapped piece. This is the code I have The .h file #import @interface ChompViewController : UIViewController { int s; int turn; IBOutlet UIImageView *sq1; } //@property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UIImageView *aq1; - (IBAction) mainMenu:(id)sender; @end The .m file: #import "ChompViewController.h" #import "MainMenuViewController.h" @implementation ChompViewController // Main Menu button in Start Game view. - (IBAction) mainMenu:(id)sender { MainMenuViewController* mainM = [[MainMenuViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"MainMenuViewController" bundle:nil]; [self.navigationController pushViewController:mainM animated:YES]; } // The Game Method. - (void) startGame { s=20; while (s>0) { // Players' Turn if (turn = 1) { turn = 0; } // Computers' Turn else { turn = 1; } } } @end So I want to implement the tap and hide in the two 'if' statements under - (void) StartGame I hope you can help me, I really need your help.. Thanks EDIT: I have found a method and made some changes and it works, but it works when tapping any location on the screen and I want it to be triggered when the user taps the exact location of the small UIImageView. Also, I do not know how to implement this method inside my StartGame method. This is the code - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { sq1.hidden = NO; [sq1 release]; } I know I am asking a lot, I am noob and need some help to improve my knowledge of iPhone development. =============== EDIT 2.. I have done something else,, but there is something wrong in the code and I do not know what is it.. -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { s=20; turn =1; while (s>0) { // Players' Turn if (turn = 1) { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView:self.view]; if (CGRectContainsPoint(sq1.frame, touchLocation)){ sq1.hidden = YES; } turn = 0; } // Computers' Turn else { //Computer Here turn = 1; } } } Now when I touch the imageView, the simulator freezes and quits the app.
