The Excel data source picks a column type for the entire column. If one of the cells doesn't match that type exactly, it leaves blanks like that. We had issues where our typist entered a " 8" (a space before the number, so Excel converted it to a string for that cell) in a numeric column. It would make sense to me that it would try the .Net Parse methods as they are more robust, but I guess that's not how the Excel driver works. Our fix, since we were using database import services, was to log all the rows that 'failed' this way. Then, we went back to the XLS document and re-typed those cells, to ensure the underlying type was correct. (We found just deleting the space didn't fix it--we had to Clear the whole cell first, than re-type the '8'.) Feels hacky and isn't elagent, but that was the best method we found. If the Excel driver can't read it in correctly by itself, there's nothing you can do to get that data out of there once you're in .Net. Just another case where Office hides the important details from users in the name of simplicity, and therefore making it more difficult when you have to be exact for power uses.
