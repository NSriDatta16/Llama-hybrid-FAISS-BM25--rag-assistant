PHP Get random paragraph

Anyone know how to get a random set of lines from a text file? I want to get a set of 3 lines with on the front of each and display them through html. example: set 1 Hi what's your name goodbye set 2 stack overflow hi there set 3,4,5.... Choose one random set and display it. The sets of lines would be stored in a text file. Thanks a lot!
