How to parameterise a known distribution with mean, standard deviation and fixed upper and lower bounds?

I am looking for something resembling the normal distribution but which is capped at 0 and some size N. The average can be at any point between 0 and N, and there exists a specified standard deviation. What is this type of distribution called?
