Mapping sequences of different lengths to fixed vector - Python

I am trying to make a chatbot using a deep neural network in python using keras. The problem I am having is that for the deep neural network to work, the input dimension has to be fixed. So my question is, how can I map a sequence of words (sentence of different lengths) to a fixed vector so I am able to feed this through a deep neural network?
