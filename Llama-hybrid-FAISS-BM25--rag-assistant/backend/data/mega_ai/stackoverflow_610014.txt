Flex 3 and flash plugin error

I have built a flex 3 application using Flex Builder. I am then embedding it in a portal application but having problems with installing the Flash Player When i load up my application in Firefox or IE6 (without Flash installed) i get a message where my flex app should be, ("Additional plugins are required to display all the media on this page") When i click to install the plugin i get another error: (Unknown Plugin(application/octet-stream)). The plugin does not load and im left hangin. If i then go and manually install the Flash plugin the app works fine however i dont want other users to experience this difficult. Anyone have any suggestions? im using Flex Builder 3 to build the project
