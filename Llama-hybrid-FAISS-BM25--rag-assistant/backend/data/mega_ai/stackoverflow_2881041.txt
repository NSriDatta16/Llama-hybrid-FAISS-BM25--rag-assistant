Displaying shifts on a timetable/calendar using C#

I am very much a beginner and have experience of SQL and a tiny amount of VBA. What I am looking to do is create a tool to pull shift times from a database and to display them on a timetable/calendar. It will be part of a desktop application that the (very tech illiterate) end users will use to view and amend shift patterns. In essence it will be a grid with days on one axis and people on the other (I would however like to have the blocks proportional to shift length). In my mind it would potentially be a simple Gantt chart. All computing stuff I’ve learnt has been through trial and error and I want to use this project to get a much better understanding of C# as well as to get to the end product. I have been reading around for ways to tackle the problem and my issue is creating the timetable framework to which I will bind the data. I am using Visual Studio 2010 and SQL Server 2008 R2. Do you know of good resources which will either start me on the road to designing my own interface or give a basic framework I can adapt? All the resources I’ve found so far have been in different languages or for web based applications. Thank you for your time.
