While this might seem like a complicated problem, you can test this hypothesis in a pretty straightforward way using logistic regression. I'm assuming you do have access to the ratings of each player you face, and your own rating. First, prepare your data. You'll need columns encoding the difference in ratings between yourself and your opponent for each match (let's call this $\delta$ ), the outcome (win or loss), and the time of day. Time of day should be binned. The size of the bins will depend on the data you have, but bins of 3 hours each sounds like a reasonable starting point. Then, fit your baseline logistic regression model to this data: $$ \text{Log-odds(Win)} = \text{Intercept} + \text{Slope} \times \delta $$ This means the log-odds of you winning a match depends on a) an intercept, which represents the log-odds when playing an opponent of the same ratings as you ( $\delta = 0$ ), and the slope represents the change in odds as $\delta$ changes. This model is the null hypothesis : nothing is affected by time of day. Next, fit the alternative model: $$ \text{Log-odds(Win)} = \text{Intercept}_{\text{Time}} + \text{Slope} \times \delta $$ Here, the intercept term is estimated separately for each time bin, meaning that your chances of beating an opponent who has the same official rating as you can vary throughout the day - there is a main effect of time . Finally, you can compare the two models. If the alternative model fits the data significantly better than the null model, you can reject the null hypothesis, and conclude that your hypothesis is correct. In R code, this analysis would be something like the following: null_model = glm(win ~ delta, data = your_data, family = binomial) alt_model = glm(win ~ delta + time_window, data = your_data, family = binomial) anova(null_model, alt_model)
