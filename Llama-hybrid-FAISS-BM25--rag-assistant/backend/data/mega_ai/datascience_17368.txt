Outlier detection by unsupervised algorithm: Fraud Detection

I have set of 300,000 set of rows with credit card transactions and my job is to find outliers (suspicious transactions) in those dataset. I have created around 5 features (All continuous data, with 1 column as transaction id) I need to return list of all transaction id,which looks suspicious What have I tried I have tried using K means algorithm, but it does does not fit my laptop's memory (8 GB) and it crashes. I wanted to try 1 class SVM, but I do not see any good tutorial to get me started. I tried scikitlearn official tutorial, but it already has outliers added to it and they are just plotting it. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/svm/plot_oneclass.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-svm-plot-oneclass-py http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/covariance/plot_outlier_detection.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-covariance-plot-outlier-detection-py How do I automatically detect the outliers and return those observations ?
