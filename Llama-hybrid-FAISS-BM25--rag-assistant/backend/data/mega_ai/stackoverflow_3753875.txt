Not sure how to do this in C# but this should help you: Ive just tested this and works perfect On my computer have 1 hard drive devised into 2, C: & D: , going into D: i have a folder called Backup, if you right click the folder and click the Share Tab, you will see Network Path .. On my pc it looks like \\Robert-home\backup I then proceeded to CMD and executed the following command NET USE Z: \\Robert-home\backup Witch successfully map the contents of D:\backup to Z: Im sure you can complete such a task within C#.. I usually use this method at work for client support to transfer and backup files before new consoles are issued to them.
