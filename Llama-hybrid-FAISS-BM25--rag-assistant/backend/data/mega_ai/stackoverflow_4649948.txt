After your edit, it looks like you want the matching div that is right before the parent of this : $('.add').click(function(){ $(this).replaceWith(' '); $(this).parent().prev('.prod-img').addClass('prod-added'); return false; }); More generally, you want a way to link the clicked link to the target div. The above approach is somewhat fragile, as it is dependent on your HTML being arranged in just the right way. A better approach might be to put each set of elements into a container, and reference them that way: $40.00 Lorem ipsum dolor... $40.00 Lorem ipsum dolor... Then the key line in your jquery becomes $(this).parents(".product-display").find('.prod-img').addClass('prod-added'); Now it doesn't matter if you change the order of elements within a "product-display" group, or add new items in between them, or anything like that.
