Securing PHP XML Web Service AJAX

I have an XML web service that javascript calls are made using jQuery. This can output JSON or XML based on the parameters input. Is there a way to stop someone from easily just finding the URL of the AJAX call and then loading that into a cURL script and parsing the data. The users to the site do not authenticate but open to some creative methods! As it is AJAX is the user-agent set or can I block it using an .htaccess file in any way?
