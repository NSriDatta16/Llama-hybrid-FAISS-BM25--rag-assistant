Calculating the length at which the probability of maturing reaches 50% in R

I have been having real issues trying to calculate the length at which certain probabilities of maturing are reached. This is NOT the same as the proportion of individuals that are mature as dose.p would calculate. I know I have to run a logistic regression with binomial errors, something similar to the below code mylogit But from this how can I work out the length at which the probability of maturing equals 50%. My data frame consists of Maturity (0,1) data and length data. (I have other data but believe this is all I need at this stage (I could be wrong!) Any help would be greatly appreciated!
