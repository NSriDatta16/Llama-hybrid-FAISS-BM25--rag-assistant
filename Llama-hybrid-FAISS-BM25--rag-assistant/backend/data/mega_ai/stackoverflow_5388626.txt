How does the SAX parser process characters?

I wrote a little code to parse a XML file, and want to print it's characters, but each character seems invoke characters() callback function three times. codeï¼š def characters(self,chrs): if self.flag==1: self.outfile.write(chrs+'\n') xml file: 9308 865 and the output is like below, many blank lines. 9308 865 I think it should like: 9308 865 Why there are space line? and I read the doc info: characters(self, content) Receive notification of character data. The Parser will call this method to report each chunk of character data. SAX parsers may return all contiguous character data in a single chunk, or they may split it into several chunks; however, all of the characters in any single event must come from the same external entity so that the Locator provides useful information. so SAX will process one character area as several fragments? and callback several times?
