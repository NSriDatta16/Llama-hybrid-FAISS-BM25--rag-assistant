Python try/except ... function always returns false

I'm trying to figure out the problem in this short paragraph of code. Any help would be appreciated. Regardless of what I specify User.email to be, it always returns false. def add(self): #1 -- VALIDATE EMAIL ADDRESS #Check that e-mail has been completed try: #Validate if e-mail address is in correct format if (isAddressValid(self.email) == 0): self.errors['email'] = 'You have entered an invalid e-mail address'; return 0 except NameError: self.errors['email'] = 'Please enter your e-mail' return 0 >>> u = User() >>> u.email = 'test@example.com' >>> u.add() 0 >>> print u.errors {'email': 'Please enter your e-mail'} I have confirmed that the false being returned is coming from except NameError. Also, isAddressValid() is just a method to check the structure of an e-mail address. Thanks.
