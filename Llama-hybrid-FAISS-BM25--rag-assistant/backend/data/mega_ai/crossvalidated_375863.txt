As you begin to understand how to compute the sample variance, I suggest you make a table that corresponds with the formula $$S^2 = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(X_i - \bar X)^2}{n-1}.$$ To start you know $n = 3.$ Also $$\bar X = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^3 X_i}{n} = \frac 9 3 = 3.$$ i X ------- 1 -2 2 4 n=3 7 ------- Total 9 Now to finish the formula for the variance, you need a column for 'deviations from the mean', which are $D_i = X_i = \bar X.$ That column will always sum to $0.$ Also, you need a column for 'squared deviations from the mean', which are $Q_i = D_i^2 = (X_i - \bar X)^2.$ The total of that column will be the numerator of the sample variance. i X D Q ------------------------------- 1 -2 -2-3 = -5 25 2 4 4-3 = 1 1 n=3 7 7-3 = 4 16 ------------------------------- Total 9 0 42 So $S^2 = \frac{42}{3-1} = 21.$ Note: In R statistical software, the computation of the sample variance looks like this, where x is a vector (list) of the three data values: x = c(-2, 4, 7) var(x) [1] 21 I don't know whether you're interested in learning something about R statistical software. If you want to illustrate the individual steps performed by the function var , then you might do something like what is shown below, where I use a as a symbol for the sample mean (or average) $\bar X.$ (For now, ignore the numbers in brackets [ ] 's.) x = c(-2, 4, 7) a = mean(x); a [1] 3 x-a; sum(x-a) [1] -5 1 4 [1] 0 sum((x-a)^2) [1] 42 sum((x-a)^2)/(length(x)-1) [1] 21 cbind(x, d=x-a, q=(x-a)^2) x d q [1,] -2 -5 25 [2,] 4 1 1 [3,] 7 4 16
