App Engine: Launching a script upon update/run

I'm working with App Engine and I'm thinking about using the LESS CSS extension in my next project. There's no good LESS CSS library written in Python so I went on with the original Ruby one which works great and out of the box. I'd like App Engine to execute lessc ./templates/css/style.less before running the development server and before uploading the files to the cloud. What is the best way to automate this? I'm thinking: #run.sh: lessc ./templates/css/style.less .gae/dev_appserver.py --use_sqlite . And #deploy.sh lessc ./templates/css/style.less .gae/appcfg.py update . Am I on the correct path or is there a more elegant way of doing things, perhaps at the appcfg.py level? Thanks.
