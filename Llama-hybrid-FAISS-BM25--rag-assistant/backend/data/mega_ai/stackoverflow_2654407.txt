I'm the author of sharppcap/packet.net. What is the bug that you are seeing with the timestamp values? The conversion you mentioned seems correct. 0.002 seconds is 2 milliseconds. The timestamp values should be the full unix timeval when the packet was captured. Certainly a timeval of 0.002 doesn't make sense as an absolute time, only a relative one. I'll add a unit test to sharppcap to validate the packet timeval if there isn't one already.
