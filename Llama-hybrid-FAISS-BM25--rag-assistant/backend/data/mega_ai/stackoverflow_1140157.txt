Fear of change, as well as fear of accountability for making a change, is not uncommon in IT software organizations. Often, the culture in the organization is what drives this attitude. Having said that, in your specific example, you are describing an API that provides a facade on top of the ActiveDirectory service - one that appears to be intended to be used by different groups and/or projects in your organization. In that particular scenario, it makes sense to make portions of your API support configurability, since you may ultimately find that the requirements for different projects or groups could be different, or change over time. As a general practice, when I build code that involves a mapping of one programming interface to another and there are data mapping considerations involved, I try to make the mapping configurable. I've found that this helps both unit testing as well as dealing with evolving requirements or contradictory requirements from different consumers.
