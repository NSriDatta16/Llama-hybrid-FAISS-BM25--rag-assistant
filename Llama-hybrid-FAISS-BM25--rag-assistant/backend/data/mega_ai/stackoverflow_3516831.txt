You could probably get away with this, but you're purposely avoiding Magento to do so. Inside a module, make a directory called etc and put an XML config file in it called config.xml . That file will be read and included in the Magento configuration, which means you won't have to try to escape the framework to grab your configuration data. Take a look at the existing files for some examples. The other benefit to this approach is that the conversion from config XML files to user configuration options (in the admin panel) isn't too difficult (requires minor refactoring), so you can later change your configuration method with ease. Hope that helps! Thanks, Joe
