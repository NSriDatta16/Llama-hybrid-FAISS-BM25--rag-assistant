I had a similar issue using a UITableView to display information parsed from an RSS Feed. I ran into scrolling performance issues when there was a significant amount of data. Though I'm still working on it I suspend the parsing when the table is being scrolled. It resumes when scrolling stops. I am not at my computer, but I believe I used tableViewDidScroll and tableViewDidEndDecelerating . You can check these tableview delegates. In any case it works very well, I just need a more elegant way to pause my parsing.
