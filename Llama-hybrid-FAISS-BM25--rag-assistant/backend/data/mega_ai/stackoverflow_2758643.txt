What storage engine(s) do you use? If you are using InnoDB, then you can run mysqldump with the --single-transaction flag and get a consistent snapshot without locking the tables. If you are using MyISAM, then you need to lock the tables to get a consistent snapshot. Otherwise any insert/update/delete statements that run on your MyISAM tables while mysqldump is running may or may not be reflected in the output depending on the timing of those statements.
