Lilliefors-Test and Jarque-Bera-Test results interpretation

I have conducted both of the above tests via the commands: lb I think library(nortest) is required to do this. I want to test x for normality. x is a simple time series from t = 1 to t = 380 (I cannot hand out the data, but I can provide the results). The results are: lillie.test: 0.06*** (highly significant) jarque.bera.test: 28.97*** (highly significant) So can anyone help me with the interpretation? I did some searching and I also read documentations, but this only confused me more :( What is the Hypothesis of these tests and what do these results tell me? I thought the hypothesis was normally distributed data, but I am not sure anymore. kurtosis(x) [1] 3.28458 skewness(x) [1] -0.6423145 Thanks.
