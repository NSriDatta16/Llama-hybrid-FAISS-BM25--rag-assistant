I have some sample XML: Line 2 Line 3 ]]> This is a sample element with a text node child. Suppose you apply an identity transform. Then the result will be: Line 1&lt;br /&gt;Line 2&lt;br /&gt;Line 3&lt;br /&gt; Why? Because text nodes and attribute values have the special character & , and > escape as character entities. EDIT : Of course, you could use DOE... But, besides that it's an optional feature , the result will be a text node no matter what (without the encode character entities). You will need other parser fase (this may be useful when output and encode HTML fragment to a (X)HTML document like in feeds, with the risk of malformed output...). This stylesheet: Output: Line 1 Line 2 Line 3 Render as (actual markup): Line 1 Line 2 Line 3
