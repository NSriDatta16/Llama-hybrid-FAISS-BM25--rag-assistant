You need to convert your dates from characters into a Date type with as.Date() (or a POSIX type if you have more information like the time of day). Then you can make comparisons with standard relational operators such as =. You should consider using a timeseries package such as zoo for this. Edit : Just to respond to your comment, here's an example of using dates with your existing vector: > as.Date(names(bar)) bar[as.Date(names(bar)) Although you really should just use a time series package. Here's how you could do this with zoo (or xts , timeSeries , fts , etc.): library(zoo) ts Since the index is now a Date type, you can make as many comparisons as you want. Read the zoo vignette for more information.
