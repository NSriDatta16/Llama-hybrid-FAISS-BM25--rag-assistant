GAM on values per cell in a grid cell

I am running a GAM model on grid-cell data at a 1Km spatial resolution ~89K cells. My response variable is species richness, and I use a tw() distribution as it works better than Poisson and nb. The predictor variables are 2 Dimensions of a PCA analysis I conducted on bird abundance data. I am modelling spatial autocorrelation by including a smooth of lat long. Still, the plots show problems in the model and significance in the number of k values used for the spatial smooth. This is the model I am running: mod2 I am thinking of running the spatial autocorrelation with the bs = 'mrf", but I am unsure what else I might be missing. Does anyone have a recommendation regarding using the PCA axes?
