Given that principal components are orthogonal, can one say that they show opposite patterns?

I've conducted principal component analysis (PCA) with FactoMineR R package on my data set. I have a general question: Given that the first and the second dimensions of PCA are orthogonal, is it possible to say that these are opposite patterns? For example, can I interpret the results as: "the behavior that is characterized in the first dimension is the opposite behavior to the one that is characterized in the second dimension" ? I know there are several questions about orthogonal components, but none of them answers this question explicitly.
