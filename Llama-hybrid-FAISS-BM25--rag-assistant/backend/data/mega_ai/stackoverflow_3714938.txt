I don't have any experience in integrating OpenERP with other applications but web services should be the way to go. May be you can benefit from studying how others did to link OpenERP with other solutions like Magento , Prestashop , ezPublish ... Lastly an other interesting solution appeared for OpenERP EAI , Terminatooor . And by the way, seems like others are working on this too: http://openerp.netquatro.com/openerp_cms Anyway, it would be great to have a Drupal integration module ! Hope it helps Bests
