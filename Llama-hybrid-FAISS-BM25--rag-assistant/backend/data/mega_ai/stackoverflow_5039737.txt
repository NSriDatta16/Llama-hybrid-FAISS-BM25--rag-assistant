As far as the client computer is concerned, mail client applications are completely different from a web-based mail front-end. Typically, mail client applications (formally Mail User Agents or MUAs ) use a mail-specific protocol such as POP3 or IMAP to access a mailbox on a remote server. Depending on the capabilities of the protocol, the MUA may have to download a whole message before displaying anything (POP3) or it may be able to request each MIME attachment separately (IMAP). Usually images are included as MIME attachments and are encoded in a printable form (i.e. restricted to 7-bit ASCII ) using something like Base64 , in order to ensure delivery without corruption. Web-based mail front-ends, on the other hand, are accessed through the generic HTTP protocol - the message decoding happens at the remote server. Images are retrieved through normal GET requests like every other image. A few years back, you might have been able to see both cases at work using a network sniffer tool such as Wireshark . These days most decent mail providers prefer the encrypted versions of these protocols (POP3S, IMAPS and HTTPS ) which cannot be usefully studied using a network sniffer. If you really wish to have a look at the protocols, you might still be able to find a POP3/IMAP service that allows unencrypted connections, although it's probably not going to be a big provider. You could also set-up your own server for experimentation. If you use Firefox , on the other hand, there is at least one add-on that allows you to see the requests made by the browser, by intercepting the requests before they are encrypted. It will allow you to see what happens as you use e.g. Gmail.
