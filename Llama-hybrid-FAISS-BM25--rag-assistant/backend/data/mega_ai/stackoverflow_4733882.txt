Is it possible to pass data between two JQuery plugin?

I have two jquery plugin of my own and the elements created by the two plugin had its own z-index value .E.g: // auto increase the z-index value // auto increase the z-index to the maximum of their own when I drag it. element1 created by plugin1 and has the z-index:1; element2 created by plugin1 and has the z-index:2; .... // auto increase the z-index value // auto increase the z-index to the maximum of their own when I drag it. element2 created by plugin2 and has the z-index:1; element2 created by plugin2 and has the z-index:2; ..... and both of them can be draggable ,so when I click one of them I want its z-index value to be the maximum of all the elements I created .But now the z-index were separated! I am using JQuery UI draggable plugin but don't like the stack option ! Thank you very much!!
