Keeping the class balance in Cross Validation means that we want every fold to have approximately the same distribution as our training set, so that their results are comparable among themselves, and comparable with the results on the full training set - otherwise when averaging over the folds, some might be biased due to some particularly unlucky sampling. However, if your dataset is big enough this is usually not a problem worth focusing on. If instead you decide to oversample your minority class for some reason (might have different misclassification costs, or other), then this oversampled ratio (in your example, you minority class would go from 20% to 33%) is the one you would want to have in your Cross Validation folds. This means that every fold should have around the same class ratios as your (new, oversampled) training set.
