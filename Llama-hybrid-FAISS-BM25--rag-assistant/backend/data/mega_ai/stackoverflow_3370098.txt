Application configuration in Silverlight

I need to have some application settings in my Silverlight project. In a standard .NET project it is accomplished by adding some Settings file. However it is not supported in SL. What should be done then? I think of some xml configuration file, but where should it be placed and how should it be accessed? What is the most elegant way to set up some application configuration in SL? Thank you in advance for replies and hints! Cheers
