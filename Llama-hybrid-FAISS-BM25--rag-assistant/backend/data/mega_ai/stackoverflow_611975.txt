It's all sugar. Internally they're converted to constraints. From Pragmatic Unit Testing, pg 37: "NUnit 2.4 introduced a new style of assertions that are a little less procedural and allow for a more object oriented underlying implementation. ... For instance: Assert.That(actual, Is.EqualTo(expected)); Converts to: Assert.That(actual, new EqualConstraint(expected));" Using constraints also allows you to inherit from Constraint and create your own custom constraint(s) while keeping a consistent syntax.
