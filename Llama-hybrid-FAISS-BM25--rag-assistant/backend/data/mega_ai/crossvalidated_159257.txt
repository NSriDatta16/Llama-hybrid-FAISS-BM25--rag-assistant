Marketing Data with many zeros

I am working on a marketing data which is a time series data with marketing spend done through different channels and revenue generated. The data looks like this : My data contains too many zeros (no spend at that particular time) and my spend vs channel1 looks like this : I want to develop a marketing mix model on this data set to understand the impact of various marketing spend on Sales and to predict future Sales and to optimize spend on different channels. How can I proceed analyzing the same. Can I transform variables and do a regression?
