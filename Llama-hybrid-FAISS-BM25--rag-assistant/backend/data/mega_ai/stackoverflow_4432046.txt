How to Display Related Products Horizontally in Magento?

I have looked everywhere! I want to display 3-4 related products on the page in a horizontal line. Right now they are in their default state in a vertical line due to me moving it from the right sidebar to the content area. It would look great horizontally and visitors would not have to scroll to find products they like. Also how do you change the block title "Related Products" to something like "May We Also Recommend:"?
