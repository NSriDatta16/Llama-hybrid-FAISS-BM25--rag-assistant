Fitting proportions in a Bayesian model and controlling the error around the value

I am using a Bayesian state space model constructed in the BUGS language to fit my data. One of the outputs of the "state" part of the model is proportions. I use a beta distribution in the "observation" part to fit predicted values to observed ones with the following code. for(i in 1:n) { y[i] ~ dbeta(alpha[i], beta[i]) alpha[i] In that case, phi is controlling the spread around the mean value, but this "error" is variable when mu is changing. Its value follows a bell curve with highest error occurring at a proportion of 50%. Is there a way to fit proportions with a constant error? What do you think of the use of a truncated [0,1] normal distribution?
