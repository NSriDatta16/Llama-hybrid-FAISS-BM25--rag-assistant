I believe Stopwatch is built on top of QueryPerformanceCounter, so each call results in a kernel transition. If foo() is very brief, the QPC overhead will dwarf it. If you're using Stopwatch to measure short tasks, you should run foo() many times (like thousands), and use Stopwatch around the whole batch. Divide the total time by the number of runs to get average time for the task.
