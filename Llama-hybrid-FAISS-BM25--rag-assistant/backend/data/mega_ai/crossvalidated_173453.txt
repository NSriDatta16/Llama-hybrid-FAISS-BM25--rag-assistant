In SVC optimization problem, C parameter changes to C[i] , where i is index of sample. Each C[i] is C[i] = C * sample_weight[i] . AFAIK when you use sample_weights and class_weights simultaneously - C[i] = C * sample_weight[i] * class_weight[class[i]] Official documentation of scikit-learn unbalanced problems LibSVM manual Unbalanced Data and Solving the Two-variable Sub-problem page 26 Thus when you providing less sample_weights - you classifier becomes more regularized.
