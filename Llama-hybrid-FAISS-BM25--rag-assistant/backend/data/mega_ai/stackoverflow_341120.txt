Definitely look at TestAutomationFX.com. One can invest (OK, I did) a lot of time trying to capture / record events with White. (At the start of my quest I ignored the post or two in other places referring to it). I of course second the other points about the best type of testing not being UI testing. But if someone is going to do something automatable in the UI to get around shortcomings in other types of testing coverage, TAFX seems the quickest route there.
