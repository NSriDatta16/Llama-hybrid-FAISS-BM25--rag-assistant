I feel a bit silly answering my own question. But... After posting a feature request on the WiPFlash website. I received a reply which confirmed that there is currently no right click feature in WiPFlash. So I ended up moving on to using White this is quite similar in syntax to WiPFlash so I was able to port over all the work I had done up until that point with minimal effort. White currently has more features than WiPFlash, including drag and right click options.
