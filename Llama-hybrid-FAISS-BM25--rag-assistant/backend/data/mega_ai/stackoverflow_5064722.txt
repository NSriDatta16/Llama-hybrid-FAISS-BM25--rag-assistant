Importing timeSeries from csv file into R with correct dates

I have looked all over the internet to find an answer to my problem and failed. I am using R with the Rmetrics package. I tried reading my own dataset.csv via the readSeries function but sadly the dates I entered are not imported correctly, now every row has the current date. I tried using their sample data sets, exported them to csv and re-imported an it creates the same problem. You can test it using this code: data If you now check the data2 time series you will notice that the row date is the current date. I am confused why this is and what to do to fix it. Your help is much appreciated!
