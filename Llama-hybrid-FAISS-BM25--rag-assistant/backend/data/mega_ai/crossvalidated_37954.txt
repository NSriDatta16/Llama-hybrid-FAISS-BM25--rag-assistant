My hint for question a) to get you started is that 32+41=73% of those receiving the new compound have got more than a 50% reduction in the size of the wound (which is what is defined as "success") and hence 73% would be the point estimate of the percent success of patients receiving the new compound. To turn this point estimate into a confidence interval you need to somehow estimate the randomness associated with the 73%. 73% plus or minus what? Say the real value happens to actually be 73%. If you did this experiment exactly the same again, would you get exactly 73%? Probably not. On average, what would you get? Use this thinking to think through how the confidence interval is generated - and I presume your teachers have given you some material to help with this too.
