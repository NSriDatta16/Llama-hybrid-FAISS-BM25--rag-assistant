Bagging or Random Subspace Method for Random Forest?

I am reading a lot about the Random Forest regressor. I read about bagging (Bootstrap and aggregation) and random subspace. But I am not sure if the random forest regressor is just using bagging or bagging and random subspace method. Because in some articles, the random subspace method seems like an alternative to the bagging method.
