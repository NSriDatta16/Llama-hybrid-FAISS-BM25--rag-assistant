I actually think brute force will be the quickest but you have to mutate string A to do it fastests in one pass... just iterate over A change each letter to "-" that doesn't match the letter you are looking for unless it is a space type of deal... that will be constant time and require no extra storage... basically your time will be N. Of course you have to deal with the tokens from "B" so once you find "i" you need to make sure the next letter is "s" so that you find "is" but is still should be quick just don't go back to the I position if the next letter isn't s... that should point you in the correct direction without giving you the solution to your homework...
