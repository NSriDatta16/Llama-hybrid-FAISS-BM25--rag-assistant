It seems that playing animated GIFs is not supported directly in Android. The Google docs state the GIF is a discouraged file type for using in your Android projects. There are some possibilities but they all seem to require a great deal of work to show your animated GIFs. The one thing that seems to be working is splitting up the GIF into its frame and do the animation between the frames yourself, see this question for a little bit more information. There is also this question that shows another way but the answer may be outdated because of the changes made in the cupcake release that are mentioned in the other questsion.
