Valid HTML4, Valid XHTML and Valid HTML5 are all seperate things. Their validity is defined by an XML Schema definition at the top of the page. You can create your own "CupOfTML" schema definition if you really wanted to and it could be valid. Obviously not adviseable, as irregardless of validity, the browsers still need to be able to work out what to do. Which leads nicely to HTML5... The browser implementation and take up in even the most modern browsers is not complete yet and while some elements are there and working fine, others are less than ideal. If you / your organisation can cope with the fact that some people (not just IE6) get a less than optimal viewing experience - then go for HTML5. Better still, offer a 'gracefully degraded' version of the site that runs in everything else if HTML5 fails. But be aware you are effectively limiting your audience (those with vision disabilities may have adaptive browsers that don't support it, and anyone who still uses Win2K is stuck with IE6 ...).
