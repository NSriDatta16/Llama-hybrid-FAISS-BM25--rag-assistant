The feature importance chart already shows "which features influence quicker or slower time to DEFAULT ," at least insofar as you can tell that with a tree-based model. "Feature selection" usually means finding a subset of features and building a smaller model just using the selected features, but there's seldom a need to do that. If you already have built a reliable survival random forest, you can just use it for predictions without further feature selection. If you have a question about whether a particular feature leads to greater or lower hazard of default, you could try fixing all the other features at identical levels and then varying the one of particular interest. That can be tricky, however, as the random forest can involve multiple interactions among features, hidden from direct view. In principle those interactions could alter the apparent direction of association of any feature with outcome as the values of the other features change.
