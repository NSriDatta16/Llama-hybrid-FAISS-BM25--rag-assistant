To the average user, the UI IS the software. They don't care about how data is stored, what platform you use, etc. So if your software will be used by people, I strongly recommend starting with a UI- either a prototype or mock ups. Show that to the users and get feedback. Then build up the business layer and data layer. I find this helps gather requirements. Non-technical users are much more likely to tell you "oh wait, we need another field on this page" than "we need another attribute in this table schema". They may also say "we need another button here", which usually translates to some additional business logic, etc.
