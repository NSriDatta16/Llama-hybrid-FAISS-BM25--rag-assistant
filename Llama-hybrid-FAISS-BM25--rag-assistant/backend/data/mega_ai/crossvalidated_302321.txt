Text classification beginner steps

I've created a data set containing title , abstract and keywords of scientific articles, I want to train a model to classify and assign keywords to a new article based on its abstract(for now I'm not including title ). I've almost done the pre-processing(removing stop and single character words, stemming). Question 1: What are my next steps? Which Classifiers are you suggesting and why? Question 2: How should I measure the accuracy while some classifier suggested keywords might seem correct but not same with keywords in the data set? I'm new to machine learning and text classification problems, I know there are enough articles and I've read some but multiplicity of them made me confused. I need ideas from more experienced users to continue.
