T4 end result indentation T4 templates will format code as defined in the template. Indents are as defined in the file itself. To have great indented end result, T4 templates will often look strange and odd indented. But code is coloured so template's code is usually just fine. T4 organization I usually have a solution folder with all reusable T4 templates (if lots of them they can be put in subfolders as well). I give them the ttinclude file extension. Others just include these and are put in place where needed.
