In Java you should be able process the mouse pressed, mouse moved and mouse released events, and ignore mouse click events altogether to be able to program the behavior you want. This is independent of the higher level dragged event, which can often have a tolerance built in for how far the mouse has to move before it becomes a dragged. Certainly, this has been my experience with Java on touch-screen handheld devices.
