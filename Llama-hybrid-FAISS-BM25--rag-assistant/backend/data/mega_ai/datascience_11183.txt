Take the taxi routes and combine them with civilian car routes to form a data set for classification. Using a map (say, from Google) break down each route into a sequence of roads segments, from intersection to intersection. If you only have GPS traces this will involve spatio-temporal segmentation. (Intersections/terminuses are places where cars go but stop at, and the road segments are the places cars move through to get to from one intersection to another). Model these as categorical variables (road segment 1, 2, 3, etc); abstract out the physical location. Then train a classifier than accepts a sequence as input (e.g., a recurrent neural network). Use the time of departure as another feature, modeled as two real variables, $\cos(2*\pi*t/24), \sin(2*\pi*t/24)$, where $0 The rest is your usual hyper-parameter optimization black magic. If you want to be able to do anything besides classify a given route as taxi-driven or not, please say so.
