Sort an object by an other one

Here's the deal : I have Publication objets in my application. I also have Vote objet (forOrAgainst,author,linkedPublication) I want to sort publication by date, title... and also by number of votes. I cant directly sort my list of publication as i dont have the number of vote in that list. How can i sort my list of publication without adding method to the publication object. What is the best way to link them ? Should i return a hashmap ? a treeset ? an array ? It's kinda messy in my brain now...
