Most languages nowadays - e.g. perl (mention by Jon Ericson), php, javascript - have a join() function or method, and this is by far the most elegant solution. Less code is better code. In response to Mendelt Siebenga, if you do require a hand-rolled solution, I'd go with the ternary operator for something like: separator = "," foreach (item in stringCollection) { concatenatedString += concatenatedString ? separator + item : item }
