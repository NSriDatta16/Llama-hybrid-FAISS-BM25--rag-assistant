Ridge-like alternative for multicollinearity in classification

Multicollinearity affects both regression and classification tasks. OLS is the standard model for regression, while Logistic regression is the standard for classification. Ridge regression is a penalized version of OLS that treats multicollinearity in regression. Is there a similar alternative for logistic regression that treats multicollinearity in classification?
