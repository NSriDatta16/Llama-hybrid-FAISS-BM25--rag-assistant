100% shadow height has no height to count 100% from so it uses auto mode. So so far I see 3 ways to fix problem and none of them are nice as it should be: Setting fixed height on parent div ( bad if content extends ) Use 3x3 table ( but once again people say not to use tables for layout ) Use double sided shadow background image to fill content div. 1px height 974px width bg image with repeat-y; ( not very elegant if site width changes )
