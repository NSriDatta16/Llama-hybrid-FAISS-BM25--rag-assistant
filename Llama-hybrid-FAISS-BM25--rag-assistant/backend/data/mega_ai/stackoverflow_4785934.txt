google appspot application on custom domain?

Possible Duplicate: Google Appengine & google Apps - mapping www.mydomain.com to my-app-id.appspot.com I already own a custom domain for example www.onlinecourse.com, and I already have an application running on google infrastructure or google app engine with www.onlinecourse.appspot.com (just for example). What I want is when user try to access www.onlinecourse.com, my application that is running at www.onlinecourse.appspot.com should open up without URL redirection. I was completely fooled by this statement from google app engine. "You can serve your app from your own domain name (such as http://www.example.com/ ) using Google Apps. Or, you can serve your app using a free name on the appspot.com domain. You can share your application with the world, or limit access to members of your organization." I thought www.onlinecourse.com would completely replaces the www.onlinecourse.appspot.com
