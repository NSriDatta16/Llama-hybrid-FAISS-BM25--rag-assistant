For regression in general, including logistic regression, including dummy variables as independent variables entails having a reference group . That is, you you have dummies for (M-1) groups, where M is the total number of groups, and one of the groups doesn't get a dummy - that's the reference group. Note that female is also a reference group here. [See below where I explain why this has to be the case]. In this case, B is the reference group. So the coefficient on Treatment A can be interpreted as "the difference between A and the reference group, B". So the coefficient on Treatment A is, in effect, a coefficient recording the difference between the groups. As you've picked up there, if this coefficient is significant, then there's a significant difference between the treatment groups. As for part b, keep in mind that the coefficient gives you the difference between A and B. The coefficient is negative. That doesn't mean that the probability of remission in Treatment A is negative (how could it?) Rather, it means that the probability of remission in Treatment A is smaller than the probability in Treatment B - everything is relative to the reference group. Why does there have to be a reference group? This has to do with multicollinearity. Imagine we had a variable for Treatment A, another variable for Treatment B, and the Intercept (which is basically including a 1 as an independent variable). Since everyone is either Treatment A or Treatment B, we know that Treatment A + Treatment B = 1. So when we try to estimate the regression, it gets confused. Setting the coefficient on Treatment A to -.5, the coefficient on Treatment B to 0, and the coefficient on the Intercept to .2 (let's imagine that's what it is) is the exact same as setting the coefficient on Treatment A to -.3, the coefficient on Treatment B to .2, and the coefficient on Intercept to .4. And there are infinite such exactly-the-same combinations. It can't pick one, so it doesn't know what to do. We have to drop one of these terms from the model in order for it to be able to pick just one solution to estimate the model.
