If you want to zoom a static image, then you can do this: Make the magnifyingView (UIView) have a sub-view that's a UIImageView. The UIImageView has the same image that's being magnified, but much larger. Have the magnifyingView clip to bounds set. Then, as the UIView is moved by the user dragging/touching, the subview is moved in relation to that to create a magnify effect. I'd have to look up how to magnify dynamic content myself.
