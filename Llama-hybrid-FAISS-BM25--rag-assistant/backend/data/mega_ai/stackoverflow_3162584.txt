There are a few things you can do to try and prevent screen scraping. Some are not very effective, while others (a CAPTCHA) are, but hinder usability. You have to keep in mind too that it may hinder legitimate site scrapers, such as search engine indexes. However, I assume that if you don't want it scraped that means you don't want search engines to index it either. Here are some things you can try: Show the text in an image. This is quite reliable, and is less of a pain on the user than a CAPTCHA, but means they won't be able to cut and paste and it won't scale prettily or be accessible. Use a CAPTCHA and require it to be completed before returning the page. This is a reliable method, but also the biggest pain to impose on a user. Require the user to sign up for an account before viewing the pages, and confirm their email address. This will be pretty effective, but not totally - a screen-scraper might set up an account and might cleverly program their script to log in for them. If the client's user-agent string is empty, block access. A site-scraping script will often be lazily programmed and won't set a user-agent string, whereas all web browsers will. You can set up a black list of known screen scraper user-agent strings as you discover them. Again, this will only help the lazily-coded ones; a programmer who knows what he's doing can set a user-agent string to impersonate a web browser. Change the URL path often. When you change it, make sure the old one keeps working, but only for as long as one user is likely to have their browser open. Make it hard to predict what the new URL path will be. This will make it difficult for scripts to grab it if their URL is hard-coded. It'd be best to do this with some kind of script. If I had to do this, I'd probably use a combination of the last three, because they minimise the inconvenience to legitimate users. However, you'd have to accept that you won't be able to block everyone this way and once someone figures out how to get around it, they'll be able to scrape it forever. You could then just try to block their IP addresses as you discover them I guess.
