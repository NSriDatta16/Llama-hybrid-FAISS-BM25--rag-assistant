Okay, so I stumbled across this because I wanted to know too. So I tried to "test" it with a data set. test_data = data.frame(bw = c(5,6,7,10,15,20,25,27,29,30), time=1:10) plot(bw~time, test_data) The formula for logistic regression that makes sense to me is: Nt = K/(1+b e^(-r t)) where K is carrying capacity (or maximum achieved weight), r is maximum growth rate, t is time and b = K-N0/N0 where N0 is the lower asymptote (weight or starting population size). Next I fit a model that made sense to me using nls with r an explicit parameter. mod1 = nls(bw~(K/(1+b*exp(-r*time))), data=test_data, start = list(K=30, r=1, b=1)) #starting parameters estimated from graph summary(mod1) mod2 = nls(bw~SSlogis(time, Asym, xmid, scal), data=test_data) summary(mod2) mod2 = nls(bw~asym/(1+exp((xmid-time)/scal)), data=test_data, start = list(asym=30, xmid=5, scal=1)) summary(mod2) So looking at the summary from model 2 and model 3, the estimates are the same so I think this is good evidence that the formula that produced the SSlogis() results is the same one as that produced model 3 (the y = asym/(1+e^((xmid-x)/scal)) from the image in your original post. Next, is the scal parameter the same as 1/r? The scal parameter estimate from the last two models is 1.887 versus the r parameter estimate in model 1 is 0.52639. 1/r = 1/0.52639 = 1.899732 which is the same as the scal parameter in the last two models. No idea if this will help you or not but it helped me!
