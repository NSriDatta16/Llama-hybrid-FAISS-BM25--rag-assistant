Aside from subversion, I use crashplan for online offsite backups. It can also backup to local storage and other computers (though unfortunately seems to require the same backup set to be stored at each destination currently - i.e. can't store a smallish set of vital stuff offsite, and a larger set locally.) I also use unison (for things too large to backup offsite - music, movies etc), and an OSX time capsule, so that in the event of data loss, I can hopefully restore without resorting to online backup. The online backup is intended for a disaster like the house burning down or being burgled.
