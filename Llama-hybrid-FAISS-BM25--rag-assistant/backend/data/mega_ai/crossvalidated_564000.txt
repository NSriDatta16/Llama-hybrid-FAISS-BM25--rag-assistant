How am I misunderstanding sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score?

The documentation for scikit-learn sklearn.metrics.roc_auc_score() contains two statements regarding the 'average' parameter that, together, are confusing me: Note: multiclass ROC AUC currently only handles the ‘macro’ and ‘weighted’ averages. and Will be ignored when y_true is binary But won't y_true always be binary if the problem is not multiclass? In that case, it only takes this parameter if multiclass, and so the options other than 'macro' and 'average' aren't ever available. Or what am I getting wrong?
