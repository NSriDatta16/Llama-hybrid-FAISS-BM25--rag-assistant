I think what you're asking for is what is the percent change in price for a 1 unit change in an independent variable. For this, you log-transform your dependent variable (price) by changing your formula to reg.model1 To interpret the coefficient, exponentiate it, subtract 1, and multiply it by 100. For example, if you run the regression and the coefficient for Age comes out as 0.03, then a 1 unit increase in Age increases the price by $ (e^{0.03}-1) \times 100 = 3.04$ % on average. This link here explains it much better. Just be careful that log-transforming doesn't actually give a worse fit than before. Perhaps try using a quadratic model like reg.model1 and comparing the performance of the two.
