Serialize it to XML, load that XML as an XDocument (or whatever API you want), insert the comment, save it out again. Simple, and should work with whatever API you want to use. You can do it all in memory using a MemoryStream as the temporary storage. There may be a way of serializing directly into a new XDocument / XmlDocument , but I'm not aware of it.
