Unless you can guarantee that any strings in the data will not contain "}{", you can't even safely split it without parsing the JSON at least enough to keep track of whether you are in a string or not. For example if you just split this: {"foo": "}{", "bar": 42} around "}{", you would end get two invalid JSON objects instead of one. If you know that can never happen, you could split around the braces and append "}" to each element except the last one, and prepend "{" to the last element. I would only do that if there was absolutely no other way though, because it's really fragile.
