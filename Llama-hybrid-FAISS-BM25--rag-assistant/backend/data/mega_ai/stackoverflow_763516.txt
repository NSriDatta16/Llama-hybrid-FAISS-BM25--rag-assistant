information_schema.columns on sqlite

I would like to do a query like next: SELECT table_name, column_name, data_type, is_nullable, ... FROM information_schema.columns on a sqlite database. I checked PRAGMA table_info(table_name); but doesn't suit my needs, just check fields for one table. I checked select * from sqlite_master where type = 'table'; But this just gets table names and creation query. Is there any way to "join" these to methods? or any other suggestion or ideas? tx
