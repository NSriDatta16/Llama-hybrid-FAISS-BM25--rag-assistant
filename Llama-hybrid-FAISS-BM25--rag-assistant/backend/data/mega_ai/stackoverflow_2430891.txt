Replacing interface ids in the compiled binary is not that easy. They are usually hardcoded and the compiler allocates them in static storage and they might even have static linkage so you will have problems finding them. Remember how QueryInterface() is usually implemented? HRESULT CImpl::QueryInterface( IID& iid, void** result ) { if( iid == __uuidof( IInterfaceThisClassImplements1 ) ) { *result = static_cast ( this ); } else { ///same stuff for other interfaces } //call AddRef() if succeeded } It's not limited to resource editing, you have to actually patch the static data of the binary image and likely no tool will be able to do this automatically for you. Since you have the full source your best bet is to just rebuild the binary.
