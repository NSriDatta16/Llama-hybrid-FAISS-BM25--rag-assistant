I think what stackoverflow is doing is that, when an answer is submitted a unique id is generated and future timestamp (until which answer has to be accepted) is saved in database. There may be a scheduler running in the server for every five minutes, that queries the answers submitted for a particular time period.If the futuretime-currenttime > 14 then a flag column is set to Y to those answers which needs immediate attention. when user reloads the page, the flag is checked and alert is notified. The above solution may work for users who have asked questions 3 days ago and till now not accepted the answer for a question. Otherwise u can use a Server Push ajax and check the current time and the time stored in the database in server when answer was submitted.
