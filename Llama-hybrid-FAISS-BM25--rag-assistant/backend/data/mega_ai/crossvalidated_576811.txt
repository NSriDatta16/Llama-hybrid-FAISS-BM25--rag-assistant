a) What difference does it make whether I follow Approach 1, 2 or 3? You can do any post analysis using the remaining features, comparing clusters with each other etc, but still, your cluster assignments will be different across approaches. Because, the features available to your clustering algorithm are different. The characteristics of an average customer in a cluster will change based on the algorithm, hyper-parameters, your features etc. b) Is there any one approach that is superior over others? No, not in general. But, if assigned randomly, customer id is not useful for any task. Besides, clustering is an unsupervised task. Assessing which approach is better depends on your business case. c) ... If we are going to segment based on our own list of features, then I guess there is no need of ML. Clustering is not about specifying which features to look at. You don't know if those features (chosen or not) form up meaningful cluster using suitable metrics. That's where different clustering methods come into play, and it is for you to explore.
