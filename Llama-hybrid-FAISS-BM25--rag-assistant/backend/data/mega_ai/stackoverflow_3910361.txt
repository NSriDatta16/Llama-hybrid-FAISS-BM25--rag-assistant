I've actually written about this before: Secure Permutations with Block Ciphers . In a nutshell: Yes, you can use an LFSR to generate permutations with a length that's a power of 2. You can also use any block cipher. With a block cipher, you can also find the element at index n, or the index for element n. To generate a permutation with arbitrary length l, create one with the smallest power of 2 length greater than l. When you want to find the nth permutation element, apply the permutation function, and if it generates a number outside the desired range, apply it again; repeat until the number is in the acceptable range. The number of iterations required for step 2 will average no more than 2; the worst case is high, but extremely unlikely to occur.
