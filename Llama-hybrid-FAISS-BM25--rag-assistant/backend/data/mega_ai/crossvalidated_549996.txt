Omnibus test significant but no individual factors are significant

I'm running a multiple logistic regression in R. Im predicting whether or not a stimulus was seen from the number of dots in the stimulus ( sample_numerosity ; 4 levels), the length of time it was presented ( sample_length ; 5 levels), and the size of the dots in the stimulus ( dot_sizes_mean_c ). This is my model: logit = glm(formula = Response ~ sample_numerosity+ sample_length+sample_numerosity*sample_length*dot_sizes_mean_c,data = df_exp2) I'm using a single linear polynomial contrast for both sample_numerosity : 1 -0.6708204 2 -0.2236068 3 0.2236068 4 0.6708204 and sample_length : 60 -0.6324555 70 -0.3162278 80 0.0000000 90 0.3162278 100 0.6324555 When I compare the output from summary(logit) with car::Anova(logit,type=3,family = binomial(link="logit"),icontrasts = c("contr.sum","contr.poly")) , they seem to match up: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 0.7663676 0.0169710 45.158 Chisq) sample_numerosity 3.204 1 0.07348 . sample_length 54.636 1 1.45e-13 *** dot_sizes_rev_gen_mean_c 3.720 1 0.05375 . sample_numerosity:sample_length 5.263 1 0.02179 * sample_numerosity:dot_sizes_rev_gen_mean_c 6.835 1 0.00894 ** sample_length:dot_sizes_rev_gen_mean_c 2.118 1 0.14557 sample_numerosity:sample_length:dot_sizes_rev_gen_mean_c 2.056 1 0.15160 --- But when I add quadratic and cubic trend contrasts for both sample_numerosity and sample_length , the two functions' outputs no longer seem to match. Specifically, there are no significant effects of any of the linear, quadratic, or cubic trends for sample_numerosity , yet the omnibus test for sample_numerosity shown in the car package output is significant. How can this be? Estimate Std.
