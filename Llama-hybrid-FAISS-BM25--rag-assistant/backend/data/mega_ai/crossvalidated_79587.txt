While this reference EDIT: ADDED REFERENCE TO VERY SIMILAR STATISTIC "Nonparametric Estimation from Incomplete Observations" E. L. Kaplan and Paul Meier, Journal of the American Statistical Association, Vol. 53, No. 282 (Jun., 1958), pp. 457-481 is not to your ECDF-like estimator on $[0,1]$ I believe it is logically equivalent to the Kaplan-Meier estimator (aka. product limit estimator) as used in Survival Analysis, even though that's applied to a time range $[0,\infty)$. Estimating the bias would be possible once you have a reasonable estimate of the distribution via kernel smoothing if it is well enough behaved (see, e.g., Khmaladze transformation on Wikipedia). In the bivariate case in your graph problem estimating $f = W / \iint W$ from $A$ albeit with a trivial symmetry constraint seems similar to the approach in Jean-David Fermanian, Dragan Radulovic, and Marten Wegkamp (2004), Weak convergence of empirical copula processes , Bernoulli , vol. 10, no. 5, 847â€“860, as @cardinal indicated "Multivariate Delta Method".
