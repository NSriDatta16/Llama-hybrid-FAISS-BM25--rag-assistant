Distributions using np.rand and np.randn

I'm working through the Hands on Machine Learning book by GÃ©ron: https://www.amazon.co.uk/Hands-Machine-Learning-Scikit-Learn-TensorFlow/dp/1491962291 As part of the learning material, there is a dplyr jupyter notebook: https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml/blob/master/tools_numpy.ipynb I was wondering whether anybody could please explain the difference between the distributions that is outputted in the 'np.rand and np.randn' section. For example, the graphs that are output are as follows: One is clearly the normal distribution curve, but what is the blue line showing? Grateful for any explanations.
