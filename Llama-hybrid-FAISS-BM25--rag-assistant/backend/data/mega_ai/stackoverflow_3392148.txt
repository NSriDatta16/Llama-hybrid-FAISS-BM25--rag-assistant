Converting a C++ Iterator into an Iterator over a Member (Select iterator?)

In C#, I can create an iterator (or IEnumerable in C# land) which takes another iterator and selects a member of the original type: class ParentType { public MemberType member { get; private set; } } // And somewhere else IEnumerable getMembers(IEnumerable parents) { for each (ParentType parent in parents) yield return parent.member; } How would I do a similar operation in C++, where I want to basically take an iterator of a type, and return an iterator which iterates over a particular member?
