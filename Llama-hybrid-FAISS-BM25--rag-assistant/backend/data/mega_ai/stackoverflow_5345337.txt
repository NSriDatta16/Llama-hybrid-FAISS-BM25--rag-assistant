iPhone SDK: AVAudioRecorder will not record after calling [AVPlayer play]

I have a view controller that uses AVPlayer. this view controller can load a modal view controler where the user can record audio using AVAudioRecorder. this is what happens: if the user plays the composition in the fist controller with [AVPLayer play] the AVAudioRecorder will not record in the modal view controller. there are no errors but the current time returned by AVAudioRecorder is 0.0; if the user dismisses the modal dialog and reloads it. AVAudioRecorder works fine. this can be repeated over and over AVAudioRecorder does not work the first time it is invoked after a [AVPlayer play] call I have been fighting with this for days and just have reorganized my code related to both AVPlayer and AVAudioRecorder and it's still acting weird. Any help or pointer is much appreciated Thanks in advance Jean-Pierre
