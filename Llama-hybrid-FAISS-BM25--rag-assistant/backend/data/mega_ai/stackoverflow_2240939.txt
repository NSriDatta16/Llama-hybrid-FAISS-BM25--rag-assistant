I worked on a project that connected Motorola handsets running J2ME with a speech server in the network. We found that total bandwidth was worth optimizing (this was on a 2.5G network in 2004). So I'd suggest you measure how many bytes each serialization format takes and go with the smaller one (which will be JSON or YAML). You might even consider using a binary protocol like Hessian or Google's Protocol Buffers. We also discovered that minimizing the number of messages decreased latency, so be on the lookout for ways to send data to the iPhone in fewer, larger chunks, use an HTTP cache on your phone, use HTTP entity tags and If-Modified headers, and so on. Since you're using REST, you're well positioned to leverage all these nice features of HTTP. Of course this can all very easily be premature optimization, so code it up the easiest way possible and measure first.
