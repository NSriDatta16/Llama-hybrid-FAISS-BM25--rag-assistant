Considering paragraphs 6.2.7 (compatible types) and 6.5.16.1 (assignment rules), I understand the same as you. It seems that with your code GCC behave like if your struct definitions where tagged with different tags (which is not the case). In wich case types wouldn't be compatible ones. However it still looks like a gcc bug. Any feedback from other compilers that implements C99 standard ?
