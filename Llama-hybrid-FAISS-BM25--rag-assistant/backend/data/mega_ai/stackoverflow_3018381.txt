OK as I see there are plenty of useful answers ;). It basically confirms my doubts on Rails which I see more like a sort of VB : easy to learn, nice for small things (shopping or community sites) but very limited. Rails is completely out of scope when it gets to handling complex business logic and data ! As Rails 3.0 does not seem to be the answer neither (ok we have several ORM's but we're still unable to use inheritance in the model) I switched to Ramaze , a small framework that makes no assumptions on how the data is organized making it suitable for almost any kind of web needs. If you are facing model constraints with Rails, maybe you should forget about Rails and check Ramaze !
