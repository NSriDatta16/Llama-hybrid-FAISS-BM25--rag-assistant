How to handle temporary files in an ASP.NET application

Recently I was working on displaying workflow diagram images in our web application. I managed to use the rehosted WF designer and create images on-the-fly on the server, but imagining how large the workflow diagrams can very quickly become, I wanted to give a better user experience by using some ajax control for displaying images that would support zoom & pan functionality. I happened to come across the website of seadragon , which seems to be just an amazing piece of work that I could use. There is just one disadvantage - in order to use their library for generating deep zoom versions of images I have to use the file structure on a server. Because of the temporary nature of the images I am using (workflow diagrams with progress indicators), it is important to not only be able to create such images but also to get rid of them after some time. Now the question is how can I best ensure that the temporary image files and the folder hierarchy can be created on a server (ASP.NET web app), and later cleaned up. I was thinking of using the cache functionality and by the expiration of the cache item delete the corresponding image folder hierarchy, or simply in the Application_Start and Application_End of Global.asax delete the content of the whole temporary folder, but I'm not really sure whether this is a good idea and whether there are some security restrictions or file-system-related troubles. What do you think ?
