The weights and importance will change. The question is whether it is desired or not. The answer depends - among others - on the architecture used: If you use any penalization of weights such as L1 or L2, then the normalization is desired as the independent variables are treated fairly. This holds for MLP, polynomial, linear and logistic regression. If you use quantities that are considering are used as a reasonable distance (e.g. x and y coordinates), then all kernel based methods shall benefit from not normalizing the data. This class embraces kernelized SVM and RBF.
