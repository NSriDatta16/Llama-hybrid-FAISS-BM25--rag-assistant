Agile Software Development in Python

I have been trying to learn a cross platform language with a fast learning curve, and so it seemed obvious Python was the logical choice. I've never programmed before but I have been reading on pragmatic programming and agile development for quite some time. The question comes, "What is the single best choice to create a desktop software that is built heavily in python and can handle flexibilty of SQL injections, along with rich interface reporting?" e.g. SQL Alchemy, ReportLabs. I have been looking into pyHed found in sourceforge.net. However, it's on early development stage and is still not well documented. I checked out Titanium Desktop from Appcelerator and the concept seems exciting, but it's not in stable condition yet. Any suggestions, comments or ideas of what is currently being used? or new technologies out there now?
