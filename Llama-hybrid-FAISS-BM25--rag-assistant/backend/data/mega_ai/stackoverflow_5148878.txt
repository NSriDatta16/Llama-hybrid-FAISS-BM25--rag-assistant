file not being saved to S3 with paperclip amazon configuration

I am developing a Rails 3 app that has user upload for there profile picture. I have followed a number of online configurations and I think I am really close to getting it working but I can't seem to get the file to go to the amazon bucket for some reason. Here is my setup user model has this has_attached_file :photo, :styles => {:small => "83x83>"}, :storage => :s3, :s3_credentials => "#{RAILS_ROOT}/config/s3.yml", :path => "/:style/:filename", :bucket => 'mybucket' my yml file looks like so development: bucket: "dev" access_key_id: "kjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkj" secret_access_key: "kjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkj/kjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkj" test: bucket: "test" access_key_id: "kjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkj" secret_access_key: "kjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkj/kjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkj" production: bucket: "prod" access_key_id: "kjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkj" secret_access_key: "kjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkj/kjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkjlkj" my action in my controller does this def upload_image current_user.update_attributes(params[:user]) redirect_to "/profile/#{current_user.id}" end I am inspected the user.photo object in the rails console and I don't see anything in the :errors param. I am pretty stumped at this point. I did use my FTP program (transmit) to connect to the S3 account using the same creds and it worked just fine so I am pretty sure my config is correct.
