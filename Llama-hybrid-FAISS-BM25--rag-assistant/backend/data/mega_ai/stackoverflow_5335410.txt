You can find the dupes, based on your "key" fields, by doing: select id, count(*) as row_count from table group by market, agent, report_name, producer_code, report_date having (row_count > 1) which you could then use in a delete script. Of course, you'd have to be very careful doing this, as it'll return ALL the duplicate rows, and you'd want to save at least ONE of those rows from each grouping.
