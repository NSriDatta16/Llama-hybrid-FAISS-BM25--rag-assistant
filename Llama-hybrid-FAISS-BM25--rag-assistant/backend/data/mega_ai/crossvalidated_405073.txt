Interpretation linear mixed model with interaction

I'm doing linear mixed model with an interaction between the time and my exposure. The fixed effects look like this : $$Y \sim T + T\cdot \text{GRP} + X$$ with $T$ the time, $\rm GRP $ the exposure and $ X $ the adjustments factors. I am wondering how to see the average effect of my exposure (categorical variable) on my outcome at all times. How can I say that there is an effect at any time (or at some time) of my expositio on the outcome? By removing the interaction, what can I say?
