How to evaluate performance of a time series model?

I trained a LSTM network on a time series dataset. Predictions seem to follow the dataset. In fact, they are nearly a right shifted form of real values. Thus, in my opinion, it doesn't provide any predictive capability since only shifting a signal in time results in low RMSE but is not useful. How to properly evaluate a time series model?
