Passing variables to shopping cart with Javascript

This question is an extension of this one: Calculate order price by date selection value I'm trying to make a conference registration page based off the previous page, which passes the variables(name, email, price) to my organization's outdated shopping cart using javascript. I'm also using Seminar Registration by CSSTricks ( http://css-tricks.com/examples/SeminarRegTutorial/ ) Currently, my proceed to payment button produces an 'element is undefined' error on line 298(same thing on unresolved previous question, linked above^): switch (document.Information.amount.value) { Any help would be greatly appreciated. I'm at my wits end with this. Here is the page: Seminar Registration Form with jQuery legend { position: relative; top: -30px; } fieldset { margin: 30px 10px 0 0; } $(function(){ $("#step_2 legend").css({ opacity: 0.5 }); $("#step_3 legend").css({ opacity: 0.5 }); }); MFYC'10 Registration Step 1 How cool are you?
