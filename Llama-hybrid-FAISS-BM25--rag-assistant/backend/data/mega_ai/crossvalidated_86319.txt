Neither of your fitted models can be correct for your original equation, and your original equation cannot be a correct model for the random variables you observe. Let's address some issues one at a time. 1) Your original equation is $A=kC$, but of course data is not observed at population values (otherwise you'd only need one $x$ and $y$ value, since $k=y/x$. Clearly this is not the right model for the data or you wouldn't be trying to fit regressions. We'll see how to rewrite it shortly. 2) If both variables are observed with error, you need more specialized techniques than simple linear regression models. 3) If $C$ is observed with no error (or very low error relative to $A$), you presumably mean a model something like say $E(A|C) = kC$. The question then is "how to model the variation about the mean" - we need a distribution for $A$ at each $C$, or at least some information relating to the distribution. a) As you suggested, you could fit a linear model directly to the data on the original scale: $$\text{E}(A|C)=kC$$ This might suitable if the variability is near constant on this scale ($\text{Var}(A|C)$ near-constant). Note that this model, based on your population model, has no intercept term; it goes through the origin. Alternatively, if you have some other model for the variation about the line, such as $\text{Var}(A|C)\propto C^p$, then you could fit a weighted regression. b) As you mention, another possible model may be fitted on the log-scale: $$\text{E}(\log_{10}A|\log_{10}C)=\log_{10}k+\log_{10}C$$ This might suitable if the variation is near constant on the log scale ($\text{Var}(\log_{10}A|\log_{10}C)$ near-constant) ... which you'd tend to see if the variance-power in (a) were 2 or close to 2. Note that this model has an intercept, but has a slope coefficient of 1. A way to fit this model is to fit: $$\text{E}(\log_{10}A|\log_{10}C)-\log_{10}C=\log_{10}k$$ (That said, you may want to check a more general model that your original one, such as considering a non-unit slope in (b) for example. The fits in (a) and (b) weight the data differently (though with $p=2$ in (a) the results will be quite close), so they won't give identical answers. On your data they differ by about 26%, which illustrates that for such a sample the choice is quite important. If you don't have any prior knowledge to guide the choice, residual analysis might be a way to arrive at a model (especially if you have another data set on which you can base that choice); alternatively, you could make $p$ a parameter of a larger model. (As it happens, a little residual analysis suggests to me there may be potential problems with both (a) with constant variance and with the model in (b); neither model, nor even, perhaps, the more general models (a)-with0intercept and (b)-with-non-unit slope are necessarily suitable (there's a suggestion of curvature about the line). One of the concerns is leverage in (a), which stems from the 'many orders of magnitude') 4) Note that there are numerous other models that might be fitted. For example, consider $E(A^q|C) = k^qC^q$ for some specified constant $q$ (the log-model corresponds to $q=0$).
