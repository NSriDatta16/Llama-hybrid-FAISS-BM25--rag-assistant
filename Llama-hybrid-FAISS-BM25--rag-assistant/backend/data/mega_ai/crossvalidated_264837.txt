I now want to see if the measurements I've taken for each breed are a good representative of the actual breed This is impossible based on the sample itself. I understand what you want but it can't be done without knowing something in addition to the sample at hand, something about the entire population (i.e. breed in this case). For instance, you know what is the average weight of dogs in the population ( for entire breed), then you look at your 10 dogs and their weight is somehow not representative, then you have an issue with the sample. You probably can't use the length measurements either. Another example, suppose you know that the variance of length in population is $\sigma^2=100$. You measure the variance in 10 dog sample and it's $S^2=1000$. If we assume that the variance of sample variance $S^2$ is $\sigma^4/n=100^2/10=1000$, then the standard deviation is approximately $\sqrt{1000}\approx 33$, hence $S^2=1000$ is too high relative to $\sigma^2=100$. Note, we established that the sample variance was too high using external information, in this case the population variance
