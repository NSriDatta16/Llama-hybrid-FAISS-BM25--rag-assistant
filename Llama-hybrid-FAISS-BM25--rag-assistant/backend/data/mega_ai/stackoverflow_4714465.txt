Razor XHTML "&" Character encoding bug

i am loving this new view-engine and one of the coolest features is everything is encoded by default. but there is something i don't understand, let us say i have created this HTML paragraph this is a test Paragraph for both Development & Production now if i inspect element in firebug i get this is a test Paragraph for both Development &amp; Production which is correct but if i view source code in browser i get this is a test Paragraph for both Development & Production and i try to validate the page with W3C validation i get the error of "&" character as none valid. now my document is as i think set right What am I missing?
