It's important to note that there's no reason you can't write logs to a file (which as others have pointed out, is very fast, efficient, and robust), and then offload the data into a database (probably on some other machine) in order to perform analysis that will be expedited by having typical database features around. This is possible, of course, since log data usually doesn't need to be crunched immediately -- so it makes sense to defer all the overhead and fragility of a database until it's needed.
