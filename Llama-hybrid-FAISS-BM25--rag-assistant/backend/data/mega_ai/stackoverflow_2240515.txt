Thanks everyone for the suggestions. Before I started this project I had considered using comet technology, but decided against (PHP/Apache don't seem to implement well). I've come up with a hacked together solution, not the most elegant but workable. One PHP script is responsible for the MSN server communication, it will run as long as the user is active. It writes data to a file (email_out), as well as reads data from a file (email_in). Whenever the client sends a AJAX request a separate PHP script will write any POST data to the file (email_in) and will return any data from (email_out). Both scripts will not read/write data until they finally have access to the file (as there will be fighting for the file resource). I don't know, suggestions? This is certainty not the most efficient means of doing things but it's really the only PHP/apache solution I could think of.
