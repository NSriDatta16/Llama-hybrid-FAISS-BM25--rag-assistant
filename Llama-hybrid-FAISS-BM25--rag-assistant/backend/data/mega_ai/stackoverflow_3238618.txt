How to disable: Drag across UITableViewCell selects it

When you drag over a UITableViewCell in a TableView, the cell gets highlighted ("selected"), but didSelectRow... is not called. I wish to disable that selection. How would I do that? Note that setting the selectedStyle for a cell to selectedStyleNone, or something like that, is not what I want. I really want the OS not to select it. Thanks in advance,
