Take a look at "continueTrackingWithTouch:withEvent:" in the UIControl class, UITouch and the Event Handling guide. The basic idea is to make a handler for the TouchDragInside event, using the location data from the event to update the center of the button. This would be such handy advice if you were working on iOS, which you aren't. From a quick glance at a few thing in NSControl and NSView, I'm sure it can be done, I just don't have a quick answer, and I'm short on time. :( Basically, the idea is to catch the mouseDown events, and start paying attention to the mouse location, updating the location of the button by the same relative amount that the mouse moves each time you check. More later if needed.
