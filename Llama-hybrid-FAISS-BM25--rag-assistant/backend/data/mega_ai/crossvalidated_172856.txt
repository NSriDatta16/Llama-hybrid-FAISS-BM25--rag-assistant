Random Forest on ordinal dependent variable

I have a dataset with ~1000 obs and 10 categorical predictors. My dependent variable is ordinal and Poisson distributed. Can someone guide me on what technique to use for this case? I have tried using random forest with trees having non-parametric assumptions, treating the dependent as a continuous variable. For scoring I round off the predicted value to nearest integer,which is giving me better results than treating it as a classification problem. Can someone please help me out?
