How do customize django-registration (pass parameters, use other built-in forms)

I a new to django and python. I have however managed to build a small part of my application and I am in the point where I want to add a user registration feature. I have downloaded and installed django-administration and so far I have been impressed with the basic and default configuration. BUT upon trying to customize some of it's behaviour I am stuck for 3 hours now. How do I go about changing the success_url ? How do I go about using RegistrationFormTermsOfService() ? The docs make it sound so easy but for a newbie like I am stuck and frustrated. It is too vague and assumes too much from newcomers. Can anyone show me a very quick example on how to do this? What files to edit, etc. Any reply would be greatly appreciated as I have been trying to figure this out for the last few hours. Regards, Wenbert
