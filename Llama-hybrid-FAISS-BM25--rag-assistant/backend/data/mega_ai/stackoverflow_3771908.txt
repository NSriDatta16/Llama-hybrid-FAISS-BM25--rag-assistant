A good explanation by Rob Tiffany of how to encrypt your data in isolated storage can be found here: Donâ€™t forget to Encrypt your Windows Phone 7 Data I haven't tried out the code myself, so can't vouch for it's correctness (sorry Rob :-) - should serve as a good starting point though, I would imagine. I also second Dennis' point about application-specific isolated storage giving you an additional/basic layer of protection in addition to encryption, as theoretically at least, other applications cannot access your applications isolated store.
