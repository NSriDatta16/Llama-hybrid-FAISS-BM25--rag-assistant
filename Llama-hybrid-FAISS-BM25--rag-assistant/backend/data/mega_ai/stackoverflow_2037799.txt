Here's a link to a class that builds a number of string extension methods (like the first two examples) but leverages Microsoft's AntiXSS Library: Extension Methods for AntiXss Of course, you can always combine the algorithms (or similar ones) used within the AntiXSS library with the kind of algorithms that are often used in websites to generate "slug" URL's (much like Stack Overflow and many blog platforms do). Here's an example of a good C# slug generator: Improved C# Slug Generator
