Do you think that HTC Hero's Flash in the browser is strong enough indication that, at one point in the future, Android will support the Adobe platform? I look at it more of Adobe supporting the Android platform. That is mostly up to Adobe. The fact that Flash Lite is on the Hero is the first step. I was kinda expecting perhaps more announcements on this front as part of the recent push of devices -- one might think Adobe would have wanted to jump on the bandwagon at that point. It might also be that they're waiting for a slightly faster crop of devices (e.g., Snapdragon), so full Flash can run nicely, or something. Still, if we assume that some future version of the SDK offers the developers support for SWF files That is highly unlikely, any more than the Windows SDK offers developers support for SWF files. Flash might be licensed widely and appear on many Android devices, but that does not mean Flash will be in the SDK or part of the SDK toolchain. That's not really a limiting factor, any more than Microsoft's lack of support for Flash in their SDK/tools has hindered Flash on Windows. how would that impact the Android application environment, in your opinion? Depends on what it looks like. If it is merely Flash in Web pages, it will not impact Android development much. If, on the other hand, Flash (perhaps even Flex) apps can be treated as first-class apps on the device, that will open up Android development to a new cadre of people for whom Java is not their cup of tea. there should be more community wiki posts So far, I have only used SO for questions and answers, so forgive me if the style of my response here differs from the SO "community wiki" norms. especially, when we have/had posters like Reto Meier and Mark Murphy. :: blushes ::
