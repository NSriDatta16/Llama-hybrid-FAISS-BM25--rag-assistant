CausalImpact - Choose the predictor time series as the shifted series

I asked this at the contributor's repo , but did not get any answers (seems somehow dead). It is about CausalImpact, to measure the impact of an event. I am interested in the CausalImpact to analyse the impact of an event on a time series. Now, it the serious challenge to find a proper Control Series, I think. But unfortunately in my case this might be a problem. So I came to the following idea. What about using the shifted time series for your response? If I have click rates for the last 3 years and what to analyse the impact of my event, I think I could use the same Series shifted by let's say 1 year. This underlies the assumption that over a year for eg a specific month my Response behaves similar to last years'month. So I can use the shifted series to see if the event has an impact for this year's month? This seems a very easy idea, but is not mentioned especially in this nice video. Maybe I oversee some statistical consequences? Any one who has an idea?
