You can shrink it down/speed it up a bit like this: $(" content ").click(function() { // blah blah }).appendTo("#myTable"); This takes out the need to find the element, and also you're dealing with a document fragment until you actually call .appendTo() , making it much faster to do DOM operations. There's also $(html, props) version since 1.4 that doesn't quite work for your example, but is even more terse in some situations that you may want to check out.
