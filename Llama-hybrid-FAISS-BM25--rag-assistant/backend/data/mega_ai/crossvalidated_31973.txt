If you are interested in "predicting" which of 2 candidates won, then use logistic regression, as Michael suggested. If you are interested in understanding ("predicting") the proportion of people voting for one party, then use multiple regression. Likewise, if you are trying to understand total voter turnout, use multiple regression. Note, however, multiple regression can get complex, so if you are not comfortable with MR, you might simply calculate and plot the correlations between the demographic variables and the election data of interest. That would tell you less than a MR analysis, but it would tell you something.
