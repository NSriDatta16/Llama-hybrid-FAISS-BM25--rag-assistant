Eclipse PDE build fails to find jar location on customAssembly

I'm running a PDE build - pretty much defaults ( see at the end of the message ) which manages to copy all my plugins/features, resolve them, compile them and generate p2 metadata. At the customAssembly step it fails misteriously with BUILD FAILED /home/robert/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.5.0.v20090527-1800/scripts /build.xml:38: The following error occurred while executing this line: /home/robert/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.5.0.v20090527-1800/scripts /build.xml:129: The following error occurred while executing this line: /home/robert/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.5.0.v20090527-1800/templates/headless-build/customTargets.xml:12: The following error occurred while executing this line: /home/robert/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.5.0.v20090527-1800/templates/headless-build/allElements.xml:16: The following error occurred while executing this line: /home/robert/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.5.0.v20090527-1800/scripts/genericTargets.xml:192: The following error occurred while executing this line: /tmp/eclipse.build/package.com.itsolut.mantis_feature.all.xml:23: The following error occurred while executing this line: /tmp/eclipse.build/package.com.itsolut.mantis_feature.all.xml:15: The following error occurred while executing this line: /home/robert/apps/eclipse/plugins/org.eclipse.pde.build_3.5.0.v20090527-1800/templates/headless-build/allElements.xml:31: The following error occurred while executing this line: /tmp/eclipse.build/package.com.itsolut.mantis_feature.xml:99: The following error occurred while executing this line: /tmp/eclipse.build/package.com.itsolut.mantis_feature.xml:169: /tmp/eclipse.build/tmp/eclipse/plugins/javax.xml.soap_1.3.0.v200904281458 not found. Strangely enough, there is a jar file located in the /tmp/eclipse.build/tmp/eclipse/plugins/ directory: /tmp/eclipse.build/tmp/eclipse/plugins/javax.xml.soap_1.3.0.v200904281458.jar I'm out of idea since this is supposed to be a completely automatic process, but yet it fails misteriously. Any ideas? Build file Complete source Brave souls can take a look at the project in svn for more information.
