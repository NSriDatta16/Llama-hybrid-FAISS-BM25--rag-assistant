Rules of thumb for creating composite scales

Normally when I create an index I basically just take the or averages of the individual variables that comprise the index. But I'm wondering if one should / could not, take the product? E.g., a scale "friendship" is comprised of the variables 1) "fun to be with" and 2) "good to talk to when I am sad". (just a hypothetical example). Lets say that variable 1 is answered on a 1-5 scale, and and variable 2 is answered on a 1-10 scale. Lets say that the two variables correlate nicely with a Pearson coefficient of 0.6. Now, with both variables scaled from eg. 0 to 1, what would be the best friendship measure? The average of the two variables or the product? If I use the product measure, friendship has a much larger variance than if I use the standard averages measure. Is there a simple mathematical reason why I should not take the product? Or does it depend on theoretical assumptions about "friendship"?
