SQL works fine for the domain for which it was designed â€” interrelated tables of data. This is generally found in traditional business data processing. SQL doesn't work that well when trying to persist a complex network of objects. If your needs are to store and process relatively traditional data, use some SQL-based DBMS. In response to your edit: If you're looking for alternatives to the SQL DML for retrieving data from relational data stores, I've never heard of any serious alternative to SQL. The knocks SQL gets are not, I think, so much against the language as opposed to the underlying data storage principles on which the language is based. People often confuse the language SQL with the relational data model on which RDBMSes are built.
