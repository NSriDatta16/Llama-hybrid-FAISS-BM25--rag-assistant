You have two decent suggestions, but I don't think either of them is optimal. If you turn your individual, five-element vectors into a single, ordinal scalar, you will lose information. This can be acceptable if it's necessary, but if a better way is possible, you may want to avoid it. Multivariate generalized linear models treat your response as a singular point in a multidimensional space, rather than five points ordered in time. Multivariate methods are typically used / understood for cases where you have five different kinds of measurements (here binary) that are all related to each other, but I gather you have a sequence of five instances of the same kind of measurement. It would be better to fit a model that is designed for that. Fortunately, there are models that are designed exactly for this type of situation. You will want to use a Generalized Linear Mixed effects Model or use the Generalized Estimating Equations . Which you should choose depends on the question you want to ask, GLiMMs provide information on the effects of the covariates for the individual study units, whereas the GEE provides information on the effects of the covariates for the population average. There are several threads on CV that discuss these: I provide a fairly conceptual explanation here: Difference between generalized linear models generalized linear mixed models in SPSS , there is also an explanation here: What is the difference between generalized estimating equations and GLMM , and, a little more mathematical explanation here: When to use generalized estimating equations vs. mixed effects models? Regarding whether to use the logit link or the probit link, I discussed that fairly extensively here: Difference between logit and probit models . (Actually, the answer there is a little more fundamental in nature, so it may be worth reading that one first.)
