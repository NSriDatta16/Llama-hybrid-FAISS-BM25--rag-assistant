The general rule is to use the data type that most suits the data you are storing in it. If you're talking about a varchar(100) then it sounds unlikely you will need to store data as large as a varchar(max) can handle and should probably stick with a varchar(100) The questions to ask yourself are what data are you storing, how often are you storing and retriving it. How are you using it, lookups, searching or storage only? As for the differences, varchar(max) is NOT equivalent to TEXT. The main enhancement in varchar(max) is that the data IS still stored in the row unless is exceeds the max length of 8k at which point is is stored in a blob. See this question that is more specific about the differences between varchar(max) and text. Using varchar(MAX) vs TEXT on SQL Server
