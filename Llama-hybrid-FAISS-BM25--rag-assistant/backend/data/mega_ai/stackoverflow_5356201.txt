Pulled from various answers around the internets: Question: Is there a way to get the current curl option settings? Like a curl_getopt() or curl_showopts()? Answer: Yes and no. There is curl_getinfo() which will show you some info about the last connection, but I suspect it's not what you're looking for. It's a weakness in curl, IMHO. My suggestion (and others) is to encapsulate cURL into a class where your $cURL->setOpt() function also stores the value for retrieval later. The multirequest PHP library has this functionality (and then some!): $request = new \MultiRequest\Request($url); $request->setCurlOption(CURLOPT_PROXY, $proxy); // ... $curlOptions = $request->getCurlOptions(); list($proxyIp, $proxyPort) = explode(':', $curlOptions[CURLOPT_PROXY]);
