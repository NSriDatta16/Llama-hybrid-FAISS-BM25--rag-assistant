Example of maximum a posteriori that does not match the mean of a marginalized posterior

Given a N-parameter likelihood and prior, I can obtain the marginalized posterior for each parameter through Bayesian MCMC. I can also estimate the maximum a posteriori (MAP) of the N-parameter posterior distribution $P(\theta|D)$ (which equals its mode). I'm having trouble visualizing the fact that, for any given parameter $\theta_i\; (i=1, N)$ , its MAP value does not necessarily match its mean value (taken from its marginalized posterior). Can you give an example of a distribution where this is visualized?
