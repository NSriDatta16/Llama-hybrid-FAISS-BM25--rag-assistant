In addition to computational reasons, you can read about biological neural networks to know this: In neuroscience, a biological neural network is a series of interconnected neurons whose activation defines a recognizable linear pathway.The interface through which neurons interact with their neighbors usually consists of several axon terminals connected via synapses to dendrites on other neurons. If the sum of the input signals into one neuron surpasses a certain threshold, the neuron sends an action potential (AP) at the axon hillock and transmits this electrical signal along the axon. As activation of a neuron depends on the sum of inputs, biologically makes sense that activation function be an increasing function.
