Here are some of the advantages of MongoDB for building web applications: A document-based data model. The basic unit of storage is analogous to JSON, Python dictionaries, Ruby hashes, etc. This is a rich data structure capable of holding arrays and other documents. This means you can often represent in a single entity a construct that would require several tables to properly represent in a relational db. This is especially useful if your data is immutable. Deep query-ability. MongoDB supports dynamic queries on documents using a document-based query language that's nearly as powerful as SQL. No schema migrations. Since MongoDB is schema-free, your code defines your schema. A clear path to horizontal scalability. You'll need to read more about it and play with it to get a better idea. Here's an online demo: http://try.mongodb.org/
