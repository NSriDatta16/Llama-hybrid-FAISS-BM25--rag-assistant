After some fiddling around with the penalization and referencing "Time Series Analysis and Its Applications: With R Examples, 4th Edition" from Robert H. Shumway & David S. Stoffer I was able to come up with a derivation that follows very similar steps to those that I worked out above. Here's a summary of the modifications: Since the data is now correlated in some manner, for a time series case we can say that $\epsilon \sim AR(p)$ so now $R$ will be the variance-covariance matrix of $\epsilon$ . Thus the penalized regression fitting problem is adjusted such that it is to minimize, $$||R^{-.5}y-R^{-.5}X \beta||^2 + \lambda \beta^T D \beta$$ The $R^{-.5}$ is introduced into the original problem such that the original model is $R^{-.5}y=R^{-.5} X \beta+ R^{-.5} \epsilon$ if we replace the original $f(x)$ with $X \beta$ . Working through the minimization there are several instances when we run into the terms of $\{ R^{-.5} \}^T R^{-.5}$ which turns into $\{ R^{-.5} \}^T R^{-.5}=R^{-1}$ . Finally with that property in mind and solving for $\hat{\beta}$ the final result is achieved, $$\hat{\beta}=(X^TR^{-1}X+ \lambda D)^{-1} X^T R^{-1} y$$
