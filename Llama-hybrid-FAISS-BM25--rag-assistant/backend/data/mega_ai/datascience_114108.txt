Hot take: Everything is a classification problem. For video recommendation, think about each row of your data is a person (observation), then each column (feature) is a different video. This would give us a HUGE dataset, of (num_users, 800m videos) . Clearly V difficult to build a model for, so recommendation is typically broken down into ~3 phases: Recall: Take your set of 800m videos down to some reasonable number. This is typically done with rules-based approaches (think subscriptions, similar users collaborative filtering, clustering etc...). Recently more exotic DNN architectures (transformers) have been used. Ranking: Now we take the smaller set of videos, attach a bunch of features to them (think age of video, length of video, trending etc...) and pass them into a Ranking model. This can be a deep learning ranker, a LightGBBM/XGBoost ranker, a more simple linear model and so on. Post-ranking: General clean up of the results, very domain specific. Maybe we choose this phase to remove harmful content the user has specifically asked not to see - I'm sure there is a better example. Caveats, I would need to see the actual paper you are talking about - this is a rough framework for modern recommendation engines - it's one of the most challenging topics in data science .
