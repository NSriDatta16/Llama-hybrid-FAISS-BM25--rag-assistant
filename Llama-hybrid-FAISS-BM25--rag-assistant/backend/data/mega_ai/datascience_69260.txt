Whether you want to do data transformation, really depends on the algorithm that you are using. Tree based algorithms (Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting algorithms), are scale invariant and thus will not benefit from the transformation. While for K-Nearest Neighbors, you probably would want to scale your features, otherwise features with larger values get disproportional influence.
