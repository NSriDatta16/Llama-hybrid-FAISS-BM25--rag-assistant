Books for self-learning about statistic Simulation?

Preferably an introductory book, i.e. for undergrad (or notes or something like that) that explains concepts with detail and with lots of examples, without losing the formality. That covers the topics Random numbers Generation of discrete random variables Generation of continuous random variables Monte Carlo method through Markov chains Thank you in advance
