The formula of zero-inflated count regression in "pscl" package of R?

Currently, I'm trying to learn the zero-inflated count model. So, I read about the model in the "pscl" package of R. It said that: "The formula can be used to specify both components of the model: If a formula of type y ~ x1 + x2 is supplied, then the same regressors are employed in both components. This is equivalent to y ~ x1 + x2 | x1 + x2. Of course, a different set of regressors could be specified for the count and zero-inflation component, e.g., y ~ x1 + x2 | z1 + z2 + z3 giving the count data model y ~ x1 + x2 conditional on (|) the zero-inflation model y ~ z1 + z2 + z3." I understand what this paragraph means, but I don't understand its following sentence, which is: "A simple inflation model where all zero counts have the same probability of belonging to the zero component can by specified by the formula y ~ x1 + x2 | 1." What is the meaning of "all zero counts have the same probability of belonging to the zero component?" Can someone explain to me with a practical example? And also, how do you choose which formula is appropriate for your research? Thank you, Hope you all always healthy :)
