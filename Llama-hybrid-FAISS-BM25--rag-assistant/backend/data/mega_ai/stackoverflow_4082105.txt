Not an answer to your question (it was too large for a comment), but do you really have a huge page with thousands of elements that really gives performance problems when using slow selectors? Because if that's not the case, I'd say using the :first-child pseudo-class is perfectly fine. Think of all the much, much worse performance atrocities that are done using JavaScript-side DOM manipulation every day. Many jQuery selectors are a catastrophe from an optimization standpoint. Yet, the average computer power nowadays simply mitigates most performance issues.
