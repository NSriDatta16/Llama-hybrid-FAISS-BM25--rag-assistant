The Sound of AI YouTube channel has a series called Deep Learning for Audio in Python , and a newly started series Audio Signal Processing for Machine Learning . I keep some resources on Machine Hearing , including a list of Stack Overflow answers with code examples. The presentation Audio Classification using Machine Learning that I did at Europython was also quite well received.
