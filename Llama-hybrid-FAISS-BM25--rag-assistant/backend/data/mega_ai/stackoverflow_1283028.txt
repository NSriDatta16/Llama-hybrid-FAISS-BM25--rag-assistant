Brute force approach: Find the center of your list of ten by averaging the latitude and longitude values. For each (latitude,longitude) pair in your database, use the great circle formula to calculate distance from the center from step (1) Pick greatest two distances. Obvious optimization: break the world in to N "squares" (e.g., 10 degrees longitude, 10 degrees latitude) and pre-compute the great circle distance between the centers of of each pairing. Store this in the database. Now you can quickly look for the furthest away "squares" and only check (latitude,longitude) pairs inside those tiles.
