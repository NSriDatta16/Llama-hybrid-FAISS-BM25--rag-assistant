PCA when missing data are meaningful

I'd like to use Principal Components Analysis, or some other dimension reduction technique, to help visualise relationships in a multidimensional dataset. However, the dataset has missing values. I know the standard procedure would be to impute the missing values, but I don't think this is appropriate in this case since the missing values are meaningful - i.e., they do not represent a lack of data, but certain variables being found to not be present in particular cases, which is interesting information to study. Is there any way that I could include such meaningful missing data in a PCA? I've considered replacing NAs with some value (e.g. a negative value - as suggested here: https://naniar.njtierney.com/reference/impute_below_all.html ), but I don't know whether this would be valid. EDIT: To clarify things a bit, in my dataset each case (row) represents a species, and each variable (column) is an ecological variable (e.g., rainfall, temperature, etc.) that could be relevant to a species and its value if it is (e.g., amount of rainfall in cm). My goal is to understand which variables and variable values most distinguish the different species. However, not all variables are relevant to all species (as determined by previous analyses), which creates missing values for those variables. A variable not being relevant to a species is an important observation though that could help distinguish it. Below is a heatmap illustrating the dataset. Grey cells indicate a particular variable not being relevant to a species.
