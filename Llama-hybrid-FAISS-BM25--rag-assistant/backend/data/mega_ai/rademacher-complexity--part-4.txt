p_{r}\leq p_{s}} and ∀ r , sup f ∈ F r ( L P ( f ) − L P ( f r ∗ ) − 2 ( L S ( f ) − L S ( f r ∗ ) ) ) ≤ 2 p r / 7 sup f ∈ F r ( L S ( f ) − L S ( f r ∗ ) − 2 ( L P ( f ) − L P ( f r ∗ ) ) ) ≤ 2 p r / 7 {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\forall r,\sup _{f\in {\mathcal {F}}_{r}}\left(L_{P}(f)-L_{P}\left(f_{r}^{*}\right)-2\left(L_{S}(f)-L_{S}\left(f_{r}^{*}\right)\right)\right)&\leq 2p_{r}/7\\\sup _{f\in {\mathcal {F}}_{r}}\left(L_{S}(f)-L_{S}\left(f_{r}^{*}\right)-2\left(L_{P}(f)-L_{P}\left(f_{r}^{*}\right)\right)\right)&\leq 2p_{r}/7\end{aligned}}} then we have the oracle inequality L P ( f ^ ) − L ∗ ≤ inf r ( inf f ∈ F r L P ( f ) − L ∗ + 3 p r ) {\displaystyle L_{P}({\widehat {f}})-L^{*}\leq \inf _{r}\left(\inf _{f\in {\mathcal {F}}_{r}}L_{P}(f)-L^{*}+3p_{r}\right)} Bounding the Rademacher complexity Since smaller Rademacher complexity is better, it is useful to have upper bounds on the Rademacher complexity of various function sets. The following rules can be used to upper-bound the Rademacher complexity of a set A ⊂ R m {\displaystyle A\subset \mathbb {R} ^{m}} . If all vectors in A {\displaystyle A} are translated by a constant vector a 0 ∈ R m {\displaystyle a_{0}\in \mathbb {R} ^{m}} , then Rad(A) does not change. If all vectors in A {\displaystyle A} are multiplied by a scalar c ∈ R {\displaystyle c\in \mathbb {R} } , then Rad(A) is multiplied by | c | {\displaystyle |c|} . Rad ⁡ ( A + B ) = Rad ⁡ ( A ) + Rad ⁡ ( B ) {\displaystyle \operatorname {Rad} (A+B)=\operatorname {Rad} (A)+\operatorname {Rad} (B)} . (Kakade & Tewari Lemma) If all vectors in A {\displaystyle A} are operated by a Lipschitz function, then Rad(A) is (at most) multiplied by the Lipschitz constant of the function. In particular, if all vectors in A {\displaystyle A} are operated by a contraction mapping, then Rad(A) strictly decreases. The Rademacher complexity of the convex hull of A {\displaystyle A} equals Rad(A). (Massart Lemma) The Rademacher complexity of a finite set grows logarithmically with the set size. Formally, let A {\displaystyle A} be a set of N {\displaystyle N} vectors in R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} , and let a ¯ {\displaystyle {\bar {a}}} be the mean of the vectors in A {\displaystyle A} . Then: Rad ⁡ ( A ) ≤ max a ∈ A ‖ a − a ¯ ‖ ⋅ 2 log ⁡ N m {\displaystyle \operatorname {Rad} (A)\leq \max _{a\in A}\|a-{\bar {a}}\|\cdot {{\sqrt {2\log N}} \over m}} In particular, if A {\displaystyle A} is a set of binary vectors, the norm is at most m {\displaystyle {\sqrt {m}}} , so: Rad ⁡ ( A ) ≤ 2 log ⁡ N m {\displaystyle \operatorname {Rad} (A)\leq {\sqrt {2\log N \over m}}} Bounds related to the VC dimension Let H {\displaystyle H} be a set family whose VC dimension is d {\displaystyle d} . It is known that the growth function of H {\displaystyle H} is bounded as: for all m > d + 1 {\displaystyle m>d+1} : Growth ⁡ ( H , m ) ≤ ( e m / d ) d {\displaystyle \operatorname {Growth} (H,m)\leq (em/d)^{d}} This means that, for every set h {\displaystyle h} with at most m {\displaystyle m} elements, | H ∩ h | ≤ ( e m / d ) d {\displaystyle |H\cap h|\leq (em/d)^{d}} . The set-family H ∩ h {\displaystyle H\cap h} can be considered as a set of binary vectors over R m {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{m}} . Substituting this in Massart's lemma gives: Rad ⁡ ( H ∩ h ) ≤ 2 d log ⁡ ( e m / d ) m {\displaystyle \operatorname {Rad} (H\cap h)\leq {\sqrt {2d\log(em/d) \over m}}} With more advanced techniques (Dudley's entropy bound and Haussler's upper bound) one can show, for example, that there exists a constant C {\displaystyle C} , such that any class of { 0 , 1 } {\displaystyle \{0,1\}} -indicator functions with Vapnik–Chervonenkis dimension d {\displaystyle d} has Rademacher complexity upper-bounded by C d m {\displaystyle C{\sqrt {\frac {d}{m}}}} . Bounds related to linear classes The following bounds are related to linear operations on S {\displaystyle S} – a constant set of m {\displaystyle m} vectors in R n {\displaystyle \mathbb {R} ^{n}} .
