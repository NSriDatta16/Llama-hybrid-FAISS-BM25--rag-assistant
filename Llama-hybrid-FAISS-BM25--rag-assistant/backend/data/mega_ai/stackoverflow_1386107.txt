Text Extraction from HTML Java

I'm working on a program that downloads HTML pages and then selects some of the information and write it to another file. I want to extract the information which is intbetween the paragraph tags, but i can only get one line of the paragraph. My code is as follows; FileReader fileReader = new FileReader(file); BufferedReader buffRd = new BufferedReader(fileReader); BufferedWriter out = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(newFile.txt)); String s; while ((s = br.readLine()) !=null) { if(s.contains(" ")) { try { out.write(s); } catch (IOException e) { } } } i was trying to add another while loop, which would tell the program to keep writing to file until the line contains the tag, by saying; while ((s = br.readLine()) !=null) { if(s.contains(" ")) { while(!s.contains(" ") { try { out.write(s); } catch (IOException e) { } } } } But this doesn't work. Could someone please help.
