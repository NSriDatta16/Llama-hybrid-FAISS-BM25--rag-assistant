One benefit of bagging (random forest is essentially a variation of bagging), is that bagging allows for more complex classifiers in the ` bag', which normally have the risk of overfitting and increasing generalization error. So essentially, the depth of your random forest should not be an issue; bagging will help stabilize the classifier estimates. This is why the random forest approach performs so well in practice. In addition, it is shown that the random forest technique will not overfit as more trees are grown (an important result) [Breiman2001].
