Logistic regression negative coefficient interpretation (reciprocal of negative logistic coefficient )

Suppose if a dependent variable is having a disease (1) and not having a disease (0). similarly , independent variable is smoking and not smoking. here , not smoking as reference group. Again, if logistic coefficient of smoking is - 0.3. odd ratio = exp (-0.3) = 0.74 Can we interpret it as , reciprocal of odd ratio= 1/0.74 = 1.34 .. Smoker have 1.34 times odd of not having disease than non smoker. or is it " Non smoker have 1.34 times odd of having disease than smoker" is both interpretation correct or not ? I am just confused.
