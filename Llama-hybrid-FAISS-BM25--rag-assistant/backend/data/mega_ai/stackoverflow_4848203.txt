The HTTP header fields have a fair amount of information in them, but whether or not the request originated from a new window is not included. Based on your question it sounds like you are using a lot of client side code for content retrieval and rendering - Ajax . Assuming that is the case your best bet is looking at the nonstandard HTTP request field X-Requested-With : mainly used to identify Ajax requests. Most JavaScript frameworks send this header with value of XMLHttpRequest In ASP.NET MVC you can use the Request.IsAjaxRequest extension method to poke at this field. In this manner if a link is opened in a new window you can return the full page Site.Master and all. When the request is your expected behavior you'll know because it is an Ajax request. That said, I'd recommend working on the way that you are rendering content and look up information on progressive enhancement .
