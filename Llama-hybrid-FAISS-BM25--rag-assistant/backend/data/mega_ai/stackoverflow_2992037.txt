How to reorder table rows (drag-and-drop) along with their sub rows

I have a table which looks like this (simplified for the example): Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 Level 1 Level 2 Level 3 The content in the rows with the lvl_3 class are children of the previous lvl_2 row, and the lvl_2 rows are children of the previous lvl_1. Had the data been a list, it would have looked something like this: Level 1 -- Level 2 ---- Level 3 Level 1 -- Level 2 ---- Level 3 I'm now looking to implement drag-and-drop sorting functionality, make it possible to rearrange the level 1 and two rows. The tricky part is that once I start moving a row, the corresponding children (and grand-children, if any) should move along with it. Is this even possible with the current markup, or do I have to rearrange the code?
