I believe I have a solution now. There were two issues. First, a quick correction: step 2a should read "Sample an index $i \sim U(1, 2, \dotso, M, M+1)$ ", rather than $M$ , because there are $M+1$ possible places a new element can be inserted in a list with $M$ elements. Second, the creation proposal kernel was not taking the random indexing of this new event into account, but the reverse proposal (destroy) was. The corrected Hastings ratio of the birth-death proposal is: $$ \frac{q(M,Y|M',Y')}{q(M',Y'|M,Y)} = \frac{\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{M+1}}{\frac{1}{2} \frac{1}{M+1} \frac{1}{T}} = T \text{ for a birth and } \frac{1}{T} \text{ for a death}. $$ Expectation of M and estimated number of events are now the same. Figure below is from 100 MCMC replicates across 100 expected values.
