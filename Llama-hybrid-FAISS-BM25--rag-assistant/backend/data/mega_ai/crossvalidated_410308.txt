You have a good possibility of both dependent and independent series non-stationary, in this case regression results are junk in many cases. For instance, if you have unit roots in series and no cointegration then the whole construct is useless. Therefore, yes, you have to look at both series and understand whether they're stationary or not. What's important is the sample time frame. Financial and economic time series sometimes can be stationary or not depending on the time frame. A typical AR(1) or ornstein uhlenbek type of process can have properties of unit root in short range and stationary properties over long periods. For instance, here's the oil price index in two different time frames. One is clearly nonstationary the other one may or not look stationary.
