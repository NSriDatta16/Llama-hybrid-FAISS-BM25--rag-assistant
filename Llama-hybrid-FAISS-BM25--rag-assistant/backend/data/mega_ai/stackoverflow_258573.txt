I thought I'd move to a new answer as I think I've managed to get it working. Here's what I did created the following files; app/code/local/Company/SpecialCheckout/controllers/Checkout/CartController.php app/code/local/Company/SpecialCheckout/etc/config.xml app/etc/modules/Company_SpecialCheckout.xml First the controller, which is exactly as you had; Then the module configuration 0.1.0 /SpecialCheckout/checkout_cart standard Company_SpecialCheckout SpecialCheckout and then finally the config file in app/etc/modules to make sure the module is picked up. true local then when you go /checkout/cart you should see 'test'. This is based on details I found here . Make sure you have the cacheing of config files disabled in the Magento admin.
