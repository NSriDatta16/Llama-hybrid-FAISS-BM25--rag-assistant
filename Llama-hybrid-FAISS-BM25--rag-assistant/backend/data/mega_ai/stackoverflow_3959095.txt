Seems to me, that it will be bad practice to optimize your css on the fly. Neither on server's side, nor on the client's because it will decrease performance of server/user's browser. If CSS size is so important for you, it would be a better way to manually create some pre-optimized stylesheets for each global types of pages used in your web application and switch between them. For this needs, there is one more useful addon for Firefox's Firebug, named CSS Coverage . It allows you to scan multiple pages of your site to see which CSS rules are actually used in your site per each page or per many.
