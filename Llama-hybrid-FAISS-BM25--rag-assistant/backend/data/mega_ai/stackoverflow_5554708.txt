Sorry for the quick answer but I only have a second. You definitely do not want to store the read information in the database, as you've already deduced, this table would become gigantic. Something in between what you've already suggested: Store the users last activity, and in conjunction with storing information of what they've seen in the cookie, to determine which threads/posts they've read already. This offloads the storage to the client side cookie, which is far more efficient.
