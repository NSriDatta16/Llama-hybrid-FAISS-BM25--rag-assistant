Found the answer in chapter 2 of another paper by Ian: ON DISTINGUISHABILITY CRITERIA FOR ESTIMATING GENERATIVE MODELS . It is based on the concept of noise-contrastive estimation and he calls it self-contrastive estimation as would be expected. In this case instead of static noise for the discriminator to work against, the samples are generated from the model as it evolves. The paper linked above [2011] by Italian researchers is amazingly simple and achieves similar goals via very similar methods, and was developed before Goodfellow's work on GANs, so he really should have given credit but he probably never knew about it.
