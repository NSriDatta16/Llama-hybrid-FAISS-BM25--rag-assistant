What's the easiest and safest way to record data being inputted by a user on a web site

Apologies, this is a tragically simple question that will bore most of you. I need to implement the simplest "leave your email and we'll contact you" web page. The simplest thing I could think of is doing an HTML form which calls a PHP script which appends the data in some file on the server. Easy to implement, but now I'm wondering if it's totally hackable. Is it? Are there obvious better ways that are still simple? thanks f
