The reason the first constructor doesn't work is that ASP.NET does not load the user profile store, which is the default store if you don't specify a storage location using X509KeyStorageFlags . However, the machine store is always loaded by ASP.NET, which is why the second constructor works. I'm assuming that you intend to use the private key on the certificate for encryption or creating digital signatures (hashing), in which case you can't avoid using a certificate store as private keys can only be accessed programmatically from imported certificates, and not directly from blobs or files. I don't think the certificate store is used if the certificate data only contains the public key (as there is no sensitive data to protect) - I've noticed that I only need to specify the machine store when I intend to work with certificates that contain a private key. I can't comment on the Rackspace situation though - there may be issues with importing certificates in code running in a partially-trusted environment, as loading a private key container demands specific permissions that may not be granted to your assembly.
