How can I transform my logistic regression with a binary categorical predictor?

I'm carrying out a logistic regression with a binary categorical predictor. Specifically, the predictor is two alleles of a genetic variant. The software that I'm using to carry out my logistic regression provides me with four values: The odds ratio The standard error of log(OR) The bottom and top of confidence the intervals (CI=0.95). However, this software formats the logistic regression differently depending on the relative frequencies of the predictors; it always looks at the probability the minor allele frequency affects the phenotype. In other words, for the binary predictor values T and A , if there are less values for T I will get the odds ratio, standard error and confidence intervals for T's effect, and vice versa for A. In instances where there are less values for A, how can I transform the values the software generates so that it represents the probability T is affecting the phenotype? (I believe that what I'm asking is the logistic regression equivalent of multiplying a standard linear regression by -1 in order to flip it.)
