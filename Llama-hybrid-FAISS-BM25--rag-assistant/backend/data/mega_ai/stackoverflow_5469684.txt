order confirmation email not sent to customer for a downloadable product in magento

When I am creating a downloadabale product and adding a link to it by uploading a file then on clicking "Add To cart" option the order confirmation email with the download link is not being sent to customer. Will this email only sent be when payment has been made. When I check this order from the list of orders from backend then it says "the order confirmation email was sent" but the item ordered section displays "video file (0/100)" One point to note here is that from the magento admin I have selected the "order status to enable downloads" as "Pending". Then why isn't email being sent to customer. Please help. Thanx in advance.
