You can also use the following for each range, then join the ranges together. This method avoids rejection of any samples. n Edit: n1 and n2 calculations added to correct probability of each selection, with n set to cover the entire dataset. The sample size is based upon the binomial distribution, thanks to an excellent suggestion in the comments. If time-series is important, you can reorder the vector with rand.unif to give you a random time series with a fixed number of samples of each distribution.
