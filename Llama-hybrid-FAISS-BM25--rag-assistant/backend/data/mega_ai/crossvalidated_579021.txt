Imputation for Big Data

I have a dataset with 78 observations and 25000 variables.I am trying to apply logistic regression with shrinkage methods(penalties like SCAD,MCP,LASSO).The problem is that the commands ncvreg(ncvreg library) and cv.ncpen(ncpen library),do not run,because I have lots of NA's in the data.I am trying to do imputation,but I cannot find a library that works for such a number of variables.Any help?
