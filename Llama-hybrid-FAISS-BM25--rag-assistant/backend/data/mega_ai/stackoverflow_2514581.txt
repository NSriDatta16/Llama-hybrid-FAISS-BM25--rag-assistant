Assuming : the design requirements prohibit showing the actual location of the files the end-user can copy or paste. Assume all file names shown are stripped of their path locations. the list of files is "flat" (no treeview type display is needed) there's a need to move, or copy, one or more files from an original "complete" list to another "partial list" I'd create an interface with two ListViews in a Panel : one column per ListView wide enough to display file names : allow multi-select in both of them. I'd either implement drag-and-drop using standard techniques, or, more likely, I'd create a set of buttons with arrows to move items back and forth between the ListViews. I might have seperate delete buttons for each ListView and require the end-user to confirm deletion depending on the application. If "multiple copies" (more than one list entry with identical content) are allowed I would probably use some keyboard options to control this, particularly if I were drag/dropping. Depending on the application, I'd think about letting the end-user make "snapshots" of the current state of the two ListViews, which could then be "restored" : while a simple "Cancel" button could take care of the case where you want to reset the whole thing.
