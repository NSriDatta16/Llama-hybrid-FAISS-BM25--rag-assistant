There are a lot of advantages to self-hosting your blog. You can do whatever you want with your own self-hosted blog. On Wordpress you could get banned and lose all of your content. You can host ads or and do other commercial stuff not possible on Wordpress. (The free wordpress blog doesn't allow any advertisements other than their own ads). Better ranking opportunity in search engines by using your own top-level domain. You can modify your functionality at will. It looks more professional and gives you bragging rights. On Wordpress you may run up against bandwidth restrictions if your blog gets really popular - you won't be able to do anything about it.
