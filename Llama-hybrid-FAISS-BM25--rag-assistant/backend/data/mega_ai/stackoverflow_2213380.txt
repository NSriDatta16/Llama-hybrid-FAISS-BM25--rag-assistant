You can allocate smaller chunks of memory separately, instead of one huge block. long** array = NULL; array = (long**) malloc(numCols * sizeof(long*)); for (int i = 0; i Generally, memory allocation may fail , every allocation. However, let's say statistically, due to memory fragmentation , allocating a single large block of memory has higher chance to fail more often than allocating N number of smaller blocks. Although, also the solution above may cause problems as it is a bit like a double-bladed sword because it may lead to further memory fragmentation. In other words, there is no generally perfect answer and solution depends on details of a system and application. As from the comments it seems C++ library is a possibility, then solution based on std::vector (i.e. generic vector of vectors in C++ ) or using Boost.MultiArray
