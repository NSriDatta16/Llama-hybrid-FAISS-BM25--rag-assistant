How do I implement a deep autoencoder?

I'm trying to replicate results of this paper using Theano. The problem at the moment is, all Theano-related tutorials are only for MNIST classifiers, which isn't much use in unsupervised image retrieval. I have following idea how to approach the implementation of this problem: First, I have to train a stack of inter-connected RBMs. When the RBMs are sufficiently trained, I will grab weight matrices and bias vectors from those matrices and construct a deep autoencoder. This autoencoder will then be trained in the traditional way, using back-propagation. Is my train of thought correct, or did I miss something essential?
