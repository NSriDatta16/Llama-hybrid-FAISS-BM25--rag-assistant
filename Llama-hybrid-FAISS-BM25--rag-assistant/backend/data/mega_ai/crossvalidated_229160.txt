It seems that we all want to know were do we stand with respect to the optimal solution. Are we there yet? Should we invest more time or will it be wasted? Unfortunately, there is a negative result saying that we cannot know it in general. In "The strength of weak learnability (1990)" Robert E. Schapire showed that hard to learn functions are hard to approximate (see section 6). That means that you might trying to predict a function, getting no success though a perfect prediction is possible. Please note that though this negative result, in practice you might estimate were you stand. Trying some models as Alex R. wrote is always a good suggestion. Correlations (e.g., mutual information) can help too but are risky in both directions. for details see here .
