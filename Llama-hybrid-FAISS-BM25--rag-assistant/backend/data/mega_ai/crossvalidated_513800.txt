Defining LP investment model in Lindo/Solver

Models provided below. My questions are: 1. (G+I+M) after each constraint in the screenshot of the mathematical model below represents Growth , Income and Money Market Funds , but does that mean for example, G >= 0.20 multiplied by (G+I+M) ? 2. Much less stable figures for the forecast net yields are 18%, 12.5%, and 7.5%. Those three yield values make up the OF, but what's the significance of saying "Much less stable figures..."? 3. Suggesting the investment plan with a slightly lower or slightly larger risk level is acceptable. Am I supposed to create second/third models with lower/higher risk levels than 5.5% for testing? Or am I meant to use the sensitivity reports to figure that out? Problem Diversification strategy requires any portfolio to be split across three different mutual funds while respecting the following limits: Between 20% and 30% to be allocated within Growth Fund Between 20% and 50% to be allocated within Income Fund No less than 30% to be allocated within Money Market Fund Current estimates of the risk factors are: 10% for the Growth Fund 7% for the Income Fund 1% for the Money Market Fund Much less stable figures for the forecast net yields are estimated to be: 18% for the Growth Fund 12.5% for the Income Fund 7.5% for the Money Market Fund Client is willing to invest up to Â£800,000 . Client risk profile indicates an average risk level of 5.5% . Suggesting the investment plan with a slightly lower or slightly larger risk level is acceptable. A mathematical model formulated for this problem using 5.5% as the maximum acceptable average risk level is shown below. Lindo gives syntax error when writing (G+I+M) . MAX TtlGain) 0.18G + 0.125I + 0.075M SUBJECT TO MaxInv) G + I + M = 0.20(G+I+M) MaxInvGF) G = 0.20(G+I+M) MaxInvIF) I = 0.30(G+I+M) AvRskLvl) 0.10G + 0.07I + 0.01M Final - it seems Lindo/Lingo solution output is better with transformations using rather than >= . The solution for both is the same but the sensitivity report does not contain negatives when using . I might post another question asking about that.
