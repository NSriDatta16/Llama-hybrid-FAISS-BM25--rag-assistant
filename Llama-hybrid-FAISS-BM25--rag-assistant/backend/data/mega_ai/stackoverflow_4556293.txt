SPSS logistic regression

I'm wondering if there is a way to get many single covariate logistic regression. I want to do it for all my variables because of the missing values. I wanted to have a multiple logistic regression but I have too many missing values. I don't want to compute a logistic regression for each variable in my DB, is there any automatic way? Thank you very much!
