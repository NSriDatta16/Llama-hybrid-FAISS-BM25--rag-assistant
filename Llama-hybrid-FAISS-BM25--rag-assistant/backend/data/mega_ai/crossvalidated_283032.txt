The impact of being a member of euro on growth rate vs. not being a member is the difference of the growth rate from being a member and the growth rate if the country is not a member. This difference is calculated over different periods after joining the eurozone. The problem is that the growth rate if the country is not a member is not observed. It is a "counterfactual," so it has to be estimated. For this estimation, the synthetic control algorithm builds a control as a weighted average of countries that did not join the eurozone (the "pool of donors"). How are the weights calculated? By minimizing a Euclidean distance between variables X of the synthetic control and the treated unit, subject to the constraints for the weights (each weight belongs to the interval [0,1] and the sum of all weights is 1). Variables X are presumably not affected by the treatment (joining the euro zone). This minimization problem has a quadratic objective function with linear constraints (linear quadratic minimization problem). Thus we can say that the synthetic control is similar to the treated unit in the sense that both have similar variables X (in a Euclidean metric sense). But as the pool of donors did not receive the treatment (did not join the eurozone), the growth rate of the synthetic control after joining the euro is an estimation of the counterfactual.
