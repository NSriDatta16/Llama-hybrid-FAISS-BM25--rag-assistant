There are two major advantages to making a lag autocorrelation plot 1) You get to see the number of significant lags of autocorrelation. This can not often be established just by looking at a time plot. 2) You get to estimate the lag autocorrelation, which indicates the strength of the correlation. Aside from these two advantages, the point of statistical analysis is to summarize raw data with numerical quantities so as to abstract the noise from the signals. When data is tirelessly huge, naked eye analysis fails in addressing both the above points. Below is an example of when naked eye analysis cannot help you differentiate between two time series plots, but an ACF plot helps.
