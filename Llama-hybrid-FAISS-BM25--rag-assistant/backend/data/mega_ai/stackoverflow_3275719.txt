Trade off between reading from database and memory storage of Java strings using servlets

I'm in the process of setting up a system which will have to repeatedly parse large amounts of text (as a String or StringBuffer - which might be better?) acquired from the a data source. The text will be displayed and may consist of several thousand words and each time the text is parsed, each word may have to checked against a list of 550 stop words. This will allow the words to be filtered from display. So I wonder about performance as this could be going on in multiple servlet sessions at any one time; is it better to check each word against a MySQL database table (MyISAM or InnoDB) using an index? Or simply to store the 550 words in a Java array or arraylist within servlet context so they possibly be read more quickly? So I wonder about the trade off between database IO against storing 550 strings in memory. Any advice? Thanks Mr Morgan.
