Well your issue is TeamCity stores artifacts in its data directory so you cannot specify an absolute location. Do you need the artifacts in that location? If so you will have to run a task to copy them from the artifacts folder (there is a rest api to help you with the downloading of artifacts) From the docs TeamCity stores artifacts on disk in a directory structure that can be accessed directly (for example, by configuring the Operating System to share the directory over the network). The artifacts are stored under /system/artifacts folder. Storage format is described in the TeamCity Data Directory section. Build artifacts are not archived in TeamCity and stay as they are (uncompressed).
