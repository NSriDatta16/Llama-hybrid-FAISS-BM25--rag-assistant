Better Alternative to Telerik Draggable Panel?

When putting a video in a Telerik Draggable Panel, when dragging the panel, on Firefox the video restart all over again because DOM is reconstructed. They don't seem to have an answer to this. Also we can't seem to be able to control the z-index as it doesn't take into account: when moving the panel over other telerik controls, the video slips under. So any other draggable panel that wouldn't have these annoyances ? Telerik doesn't seem to give any answer so we're afraid we're stuck and we cannot afford to wait longer. Currently think about using Yahoo UI.
