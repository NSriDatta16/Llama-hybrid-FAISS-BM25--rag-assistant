I found a slightly different solution the problem. I'm not 100% happy with it, but it's pretty simple. This was based on a solution I read here: http://panvega.wordpress.com/2009/03/16/masterpagepagelayout-format-date-field/ You create a custom column on the library of type "Calculated" and format the date however you want. In my case that meant: =TEXT(Modified,"d MMM yyyy") Then in the page layout I just reference this field and the formatting is already done: It's not as elegant a solution as I was looking for mostly because it requires adding a custom column on every page library. But it requires very little code. I'm still open to a better solution. It's seems strange to have to write a whole web control just to format a date, but it seems that might be the only other better alternative.
