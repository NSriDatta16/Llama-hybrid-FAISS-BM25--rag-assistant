ASP.NET MVC without ASP.NET?

As far as I know, ASP.NET MVC leverages a lot of the features of ASP.NET Web Forms, one of these services is how to get the Html response from the template .aspx file (the view). Can asp.net mvc leverages any other platform to generate html over template files (something like PHP for example)? EDIT: There is NO use case for this, just curiosity!
