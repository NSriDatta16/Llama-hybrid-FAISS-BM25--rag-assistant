One possibility is to use a Jeffreys Interval , which has a Bayesian derivation. One nice feature is that you're guaranteed to get values between 0 and 1. When using a Wald interval on similar problems I got negative lower bounds, which made no sense. The confidence intervals are found by computing the $\alpha$ quantiles of a $\text{Beta}(x + 1/2, n â€“ x + 1/2)$ distribution. Where $x$ is the number of successes and $n$ is the number of trials. Computing these quantiles must be done numerically, but it's no problem in something like R.
