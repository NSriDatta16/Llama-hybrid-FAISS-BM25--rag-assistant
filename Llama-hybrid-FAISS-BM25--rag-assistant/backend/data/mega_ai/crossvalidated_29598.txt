While reading the reviews for The Cartoon Guide to Statistics, I noticed one saying The Manga Guide To Statistics was better: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1593271891 The Manga Guide has fewer reviews, but gets better ones on average. (I.e. the mean number of stars is better; hopefully after reading either book you'd be able to calculate if that is a significant "better" or not ;-)
