What are good resources to learn about creating a custom WS_CAPTION style for Windows 7?

I want to learn more about creating my own, custom WS_CAPTION style, the end of which would allow me to build a custom CMainFrame for my application that will respond appropriately to Windows 7 drag events. Any books, web sites, etc that people recommend for learning this kind of thing?
