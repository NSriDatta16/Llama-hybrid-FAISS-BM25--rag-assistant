You can use an array to get the numbers 1 through 100, but you're limited on what you can do with them. You can't, for instance, concatenate in an array formula (which your pseudo code suggests). But you could SUM, AVERAGE or many other operations. {=SUM(ROW(1:100))} {=AVERAGE(ROW(1:100))} {=MAX(ROW(1:100))} The braces means enter with control+shift+enter, not just enter.
