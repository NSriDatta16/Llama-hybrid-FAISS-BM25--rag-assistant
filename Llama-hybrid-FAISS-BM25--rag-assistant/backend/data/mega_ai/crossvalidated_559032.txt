Linear Mixed Model: Multiple data points per participant at multiple time points

I am looking to compare change between pre and post time points separated by fatigue. The data has multiple participants and each participant has 6 data points pre fatigue and 6 data points post fatigue. All data at a single time point were collected in Is it necessary to average the 6 values for each subject taken at a given time point and only input one value per time point into the model, or can linear mixed model cope with the structure of multiple results at a single time point? Example code/data is below x $subject subject) x $time time) xModel
