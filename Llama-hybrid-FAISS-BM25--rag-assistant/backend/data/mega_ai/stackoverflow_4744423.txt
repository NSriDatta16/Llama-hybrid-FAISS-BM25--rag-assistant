(Full disclosure: I'm on the team that maintains this feature) Native C++ code coverage is supported by VS2010, but as you've seen, you can only instrument linked binaries (e.g. .dll or .exe). This means that the code you want to collect coverage for must be linked into a binary image before you instrument it. What unit test framework are you using? It sounds like your test project is pure managed C++ ( /clr:safe ). If you build your native C++ project as a DLL, your test project should at least be able to call into the native DLL using P/Invoke calls. By doing this, you don't actually need to link your native .lib into your test project.
