Some of the IDEs like Eclipse offer plugins for many such things. It has plugins for organizers, UML, todo lists, project deadlines (mylyn). I am not sure if there is a plugin for taking notes although I have heard there is a blogging plugin available. EDIT: There is a plugin to write blogs from within Eclipse.
