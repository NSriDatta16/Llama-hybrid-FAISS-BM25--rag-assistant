ASP.NET MVC: Displaying images for subdomains

I'm working on an multi tenant app, so I have a lot of dynamic subdomains: user1.example.com user2.example.com etc It works great, but there's one problem though. Images are not displayed. Will display on example.com, but it won't work on user1.example.com I can of course use the following solution: But I want to have something more elegant if that's possible.
