The URL may be wrong or your request is likely incomplete. You need to check the HTML source (rightclick page > View Source ) and use the same URL as definied in the and gather all request parameters (including those from hidden input fields and the button which you intend to "press"!) for use in your query string. That said, doing so is in most cases a policy violation and may result in your IP become blacklisted. Please check their robots.txt and the "Terms of use" -if any, I don't understand Polish. Their robots.txt at least says that everyone is disallowed to access the entire website programmatically . Use it on your own risks. You've been warned. Better contact them and ask if they have any public webservice and then use it instead. You can always spoof the user-agent request header with a real-looking string as extracted from a real webbrowser to minimize the risk to get recognized as a bot as pointed out by Bozho here, but you can still get caught on based on the visitor patterns/statistics.
