Carefully read through this thread which helps me greatly on understanding the whole PCA process, here is my summary (not sure if I get the true idea or not): PCA Eigen-decomposition on cov matrix -> it will find axis on whose direction the data has max spread. it doesn't matter whether we center the data data before hand, the cov matrix is the same and thus we will always get axis maximize the data spread. I saw some text book when introducing PCA, they assume that the data matrix is centered. I think this is the reason that triggers my confusion, it induced me that the data needs to be centered before doing PCA analysis. Now my feeling is that I need to look these in a revers way: centering the data helps to justify that eigen vectors of covariance matrix is the right axis that we are looking for.
