What model to use to predict multiple binary time series

I have dataset similar to above one. It contains ~ 1 lakh observations and and ~ 30 columns (those are my columns). I want to predict whether a particular individual is likely to watch television in a given time slot or not, for upcoming days(day5, day6, day7 in example above). I looked for time series forecasting, but doubt that it would be a good fit this case, as my data is binary entries and I am dealing with multiple individuals, therefore I will have to forecast for each individual at a time. I thought of using random forest - wherein I thought of considering column -(Day4) as a target variable and Day1, Day2, Day3 would be independent variables. Train model on first three columns keeping fourth column values as my dependent variable. Later, predict for Day5 and so on for other Days ( Days6, Days7 ...) Which algorithm should I use in such case?
