Sample Size and No. of Events in Logistics Regression Model

I want to develop a logistic regression model. There are 1000 cases in the dataset and there are only 180 'Yes'. Therefore, the proportion is 18%. I was told that I should have at least 500 Yes in the dataset in order to build a good logistic regression model. How can I handle this problem? Do I need to have at least 500 Yes??
