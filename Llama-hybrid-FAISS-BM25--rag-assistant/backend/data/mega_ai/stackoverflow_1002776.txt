The part about running the local Web server as a service appears unwise. Besides the fact that you are tied to certain operating environments that are available in the client, you are also imposing an additional burden of managing the server, on the end user. Additionally, the local Web server itself cannot be deployed in a Web-based model. All in all, I am not too thrilled by the prospect of a real "local Web server". There is a certain bias to it, no doubt since I have proposed embedded Web servers that run inside a Web browser as part of my proposal for seamless off-line Web storage. See BITSY 0.5.0 ( http://www.oracle.com/technology/tech/feeds/spec/bitsy.html ) I wonder how essential your requirement to prevent data loss at any cost is. What happens when you are offline and the disk crashes? Or there is a loss of device? In general, you want the local cache to be the least farther ahead of the server, but be prepared to tolerate loss of data to the extent that the server is behind the client. This may involve some amount of contractual negotiation or training. In practice this may not be a deal-breaker.
