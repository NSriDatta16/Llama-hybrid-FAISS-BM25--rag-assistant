If there is a linear relationship between the variables then "bucketing" will lose information and, all else being equal, you would expect that bucketing would lead to a higher (less-significant) p-value. However, in this example a linear relationship is unlikely. We might expect that an "average" student may get a lift in their marks due to their higher emotional intelligence. But, at the top end of GPA, perhaps the people with poor emotional intelligence will have an advantage (less friends = more time to study). Similarly, at the bottom end of GPA, students may be trying to get by with a minimum of effort, so the students with low emotional intelligence will try harder, which will offset the effect of emotional intelligence on grades. More generally, this issue is at the heart of why many people like non-parametric statistics: while they throw away some information they make less stringent assumptions.
