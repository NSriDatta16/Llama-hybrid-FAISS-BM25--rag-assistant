There are a couple reasons why I sometimes store session data in a DB. Here are the biggest two: Security Concerns on a Shared Server If you're running on a shared server, the chances are that it's easy for other users of the server to meddle their way into your temp directory and have access to the session data you have stored there. This isn't too common, but it can happen. Using Multiple Servers If you're upscaling and using more than one server, it's best to store the session data in a database. That way the data is easily available throughout your entire server stack (or farm depending on how big you're going). This is also attainable through a flat file system, but using a database is usually a more elegant, easy solution. The only thing I can think of for not using a database is simply the number of queries you'll be running. For each page load, you'll have an extra query to gather the session data. However, one small extra query shouldn't make that much difference. The two points I outlined above outweigh this small cost. Hope that helped a bit.
