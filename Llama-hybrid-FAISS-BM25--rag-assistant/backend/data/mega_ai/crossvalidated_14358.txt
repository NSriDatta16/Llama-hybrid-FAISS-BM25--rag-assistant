You're trying to predict what, future volume? Is this a market impact model or something? If you're trying to predict volume, time series analysis is likely your friend. This would basically be running an autoregressive model, i.e. a linear regression where the $x_{ij}$ are changes in volume ($j=0$) and Google searches ($j=1$) and the $y_i$ are future changes. As for SVMs, an ordinary linear SVM might not be the best bet; check out kernel SVMs, which transform the data in various ways to elucidate relationships that would otherwise not be linearly separable. This could be helpful for dealing with any nonlinearities in your data, which definitely occur in financial data sets. If you're actually intending to predict future price change, the KSVMs are likely the way to go, since predicting returns is extremely difficult and I could imagine many of the most useful aspects of the data would involve extreme values, i.e. nonlinearities. If you're actually predicting volume/market impact/slippage, time series analysis is the most standard way to go.
