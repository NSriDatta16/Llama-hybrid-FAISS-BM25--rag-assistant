It seems that iPhone Apps using the UIWebKit HTTP request component have user agent string like the following Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 4_0_1 like Mac OS X; fr-fr) AppleWebKit/532.9 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/8A306 Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 3_1_2 like Mac OS X; fr-fr) AppleWebKit/528.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7D11 Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; U; CPU iPhone OS 3_1_3 like Mac OS X; fr-fr) AppleWebKit/528.18 (KHTML, like Gecko) Mobile/7E18 While Safari on iPhone has mostly the same string but ending with " Safari/XXX" However, it is also possible to change the user agent of UIWebKit then there is no guarantee that you'll grab every iPhone app by proceeding this way.
