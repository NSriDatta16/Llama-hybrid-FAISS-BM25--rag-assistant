While I can't help you with your specific problem, here's what I would do: Download wireshark , sniff the HTTP request sent by your java application Copy/Paste the request, and run it with telnet (or a tool such as WFetch ) Fiddle with the request headers and see if behavior changes. (I'd suspect the site screens the request based on the User agent header or something similar)
