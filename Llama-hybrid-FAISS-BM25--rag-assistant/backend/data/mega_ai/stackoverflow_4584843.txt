How to track https urls through Android emulator using Fiddler?

I want to use Flurry in my android app, I have created an account, got api and using that api and I can use onEvent methods in FlurryAgent. Now I want to track those calls in fiddler to check, I am able to trace the http calls, but https calls are getting failed. I did the following, Changed the SSL settings in Fiddler and Firefox, so if I open any https urls in Firefox browser then it's tracked, but I am not able to track the calls through Android emulator. I have changed the emulator settings like given in this link http://aurir.wordpress.com/2010/03/22/tutorial-getting-android-emulator-working-with-fiddler-http-proxy-tool/ even though it is not working.
