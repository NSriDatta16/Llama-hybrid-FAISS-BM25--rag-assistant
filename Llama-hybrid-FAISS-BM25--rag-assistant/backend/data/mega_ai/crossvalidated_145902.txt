Can we use MLE to estimate Neural Network weights?

I just started to study about stats and models stuff. Currently, my understanding is that we use MLE to estimate the best parameter(s) for a model. However, when I try to understand how the neural networks work, it seems like they commonly use another approach to estimate the parameters instead. Why don't we use MLE or is it possible to use MLE at all?
