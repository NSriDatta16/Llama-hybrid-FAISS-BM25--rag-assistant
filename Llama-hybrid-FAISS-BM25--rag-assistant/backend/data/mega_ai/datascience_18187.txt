Adding document vector doc2ec to seq2seq model

In general we use word2vec for word embedding in seq2seq model, is it possible to add the document vector from Doc2vec with the input words , I mean using the tag of the document as a word and its vector for emending : the picture will explain mu point a view default seq2seq My opinion the doc_tag is followed by its original words so will that improve my seq2seq model ( logically ) ?
