No, Silverlight is a client-only technology and doesn't necessarily have the same "session" or cookie semantics that ASP.NET has as a result. You're more than free to pass information to and from web services and your back-end, store information on the machine in isolated storage (similar to a session, but do be careful - data is not encrypted unless you encrypt it), use the HTML interoperability features to get/set/call JavaScript and the serving web page's DOM allow your server to provide authentication and authorization, to enable login, out, etc.
