What MCMC algorithms/techniques are used for discrete parameters?

I know a fair amount about fitting continuous parameters particularly gradient-based methods, but not much about fitting discrete parameters. What are commonly used MCMC algorithms/techniques for fitting discrete parameters? Are there algorithms which are both fairly general and fairly powerful? Are there algorithms which deal with the curse of dimensionality well? For example, I would say Hamiltonian MCMC is general, powerful and scales well. Sampling from an arbitrary discrete distribution seems more difficult than sampling from a continuous distribution, but I am curious what the state of the art is. Edit : JMS asked me to elaborate. I don't have specific applications in mind, but here are some kinds of models I am imagining: Model selection between several kinds of continuous regression models. You have a discrete single 'model' parameter A continuous model where each observation has a possibility of being an 'outlier' and drawn from a much more dispersed distribution. I suppose this is a mixture model. I would expect many models to include both continuous and discrete parameters.
