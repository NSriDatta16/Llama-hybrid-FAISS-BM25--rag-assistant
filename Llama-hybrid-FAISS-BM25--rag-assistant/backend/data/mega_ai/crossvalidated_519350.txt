If you want to use a binary logistic regression technique, you'd have to use a longitudinal regression technique which will handle repeated outcomes having values 0,1. Examples are GLM or GEE with a family or "link function" set to "logit," i.e., logistic. GEE has the advantage of not requiring uniform time periods, meaning the time intervals can vary across measurements and animals. There are also "mixed" regression modules which will treat each animal as its own cluster (random effects) in order to accommodate the within-subject correlations.
