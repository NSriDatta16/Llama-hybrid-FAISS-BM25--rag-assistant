If as in the above example you are using the XML to store various string columns, I don't think you would really benefit from typed XML unless you have a need for the server to validate the data. Performance-wise, I suspect it would be faster untyped. For these kinds of queries you absolutely need to have XML indexes in place, they are essential for good performance of XML queries. Without indexes, XML columns are stored as blobs so in order to query them, SQL needs to shred the blob into XML first, then do whatever operations you are requesting. A primary XML index stores the shredded XML in the database so it doesn't need to be done on the fly. You need to create a primary XML index first, then secondary XML indexes can be created to support your queries. There are 3 types of secondary XML indexes: PATH, VALUE and PROPERTY. Which secondary indexes you need depends on the type of queries you're going to be doing, so I would encourage you to review the Secondary XML Indexes topic in Books Online to decide which one(s) would be useful to you: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb522562(SQL.100).aspx
