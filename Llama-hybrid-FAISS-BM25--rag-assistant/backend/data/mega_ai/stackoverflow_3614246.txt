Would someone explain to me why type(foo)(bar) is so heavily discouraged?

I have a dict of configuration variables that looks something like this: self.config = { "foo": "abcdef", "bar": 42, "xyz": True } I want to be able to update these variables from user input (which, in this case, will always be in the form of a string). The problem I'm facing is obvious, and my first solution seemed good enough to me: def updateconfig(self, key, value): if key in self.config: self.config[key] = type(self.config[key])(value) However, #python in Freenode almost seemed offended that I would suggest such a solution. Could someone tell me why this is bad practice?
