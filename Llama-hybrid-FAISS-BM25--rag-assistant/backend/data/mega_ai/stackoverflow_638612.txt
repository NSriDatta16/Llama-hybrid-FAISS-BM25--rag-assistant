Basically the same thing as everyone else is saying. COBOL had very distinct rules about what a sentence and a paragraph was. I guess, in the back of my mind, I follow those. If you have a large IF statement, you didn't put a period until the very end of the nest. Similarly, I put a blank line after my last } // end if And yes, I put the // end if, // end for, // end method stuff in there. Some of the more vocal people I know don't like it, but I like it. They say you shouldn't make your if-statements huge and that you're probably coding wrong if you NEED the // end if stuff, and I don't NEED it, but I do find it makes it easier to read. Call me old fashioned, OCD, whatever.
