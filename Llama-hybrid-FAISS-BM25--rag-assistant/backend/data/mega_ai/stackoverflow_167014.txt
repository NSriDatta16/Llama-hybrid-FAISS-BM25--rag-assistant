Best practice for creating subversion repositories?

Our team (5-10 developers) plans to adopt Subversion for our .NET (Visual Studio) projects/solutions (VisualSVN Server, TortoiseSVN / VisualSVN). What is the best way to organize a new repository tree ? Is it okay to use one big repository or is it better to create different repositories for every solution / product line etc.? Our projects can be categorized this way (example): Main Product Line Main Web App Library 1 Library 2 ... Windows Client Another Windows Client Windows Service Tools Tool A Tool B Product Line 2 Software 1 Software 2 Product Line 3 App 1 App 2
