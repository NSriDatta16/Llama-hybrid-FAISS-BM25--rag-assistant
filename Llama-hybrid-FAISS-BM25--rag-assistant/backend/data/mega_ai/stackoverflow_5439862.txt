Can you rely on the users always having internet access? It may be better to simply have them connect to a remote database via WCF and not use a local database at all. If your users will often be disconnected from the network, consider using SQL Server CE Client Agent. This is a DLL you can link with SQL CE that will connect to an IIS Server Agent service, and merge with an external database. Each time your SQL CE app connects it gets the latest version of data, then disconnects. There was an old article on MSDN Magazine , I believe this is still supported in SQL CE.
