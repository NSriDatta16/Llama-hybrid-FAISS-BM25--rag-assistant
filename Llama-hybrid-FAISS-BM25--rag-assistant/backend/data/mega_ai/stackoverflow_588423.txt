I'd just use regular polling instead of comet, as this is more like a hack. To make the UI more fluid you could cheat and update your progress bar without checking with the server, just by calculating the average time it needs to do a task. You could correct the error by polling for the correct status. If you implement that well, everyone will think it's live updating.
