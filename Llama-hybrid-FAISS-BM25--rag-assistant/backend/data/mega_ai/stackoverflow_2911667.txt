If you are working on the same computer and access your instalation via localhost (or 127.0.0.1) it can lead to problems. You should edit your hosts file and add same fake address such as www.localhost.com 127.0.0.1 I believe this is because most browsers don't store cookies for localhost and I have had problems with magento because of this in the past.
