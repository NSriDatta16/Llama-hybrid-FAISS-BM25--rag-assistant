Multivariate multiple input batch data regression

So, in general, my question is how to approach modeling with this kind of data. I'll try to explain the challenge and some of my thought process. Challenge I have batches of cars sold. One batch may contain 3 cars, other may contain 10. So the number of cars is not fixed. Each car has its own characteristic. Let's say I have fixed number of cars characteristics. Example : CarName fueltype aspiration door number carbody drivewheel cylindernumber enginesize horsepower audi fox gas std two sedan fwd five 136 110 audi 100ls gas std four sedan fwd five 136 110 audi 5000 gas std four wagon fwd five 136 110 audi 4000 gas turbo four sedan fwd five 131 140 audi 5s gas turbo two hatchback 4wd five 131 160 bmw 320i gas std two sedan rwd four 108 101 bmw 320i gas std four sedan rwd four 108 101 So this is a 7 cars batch, for which I know the price. However, I do not know the price of each car. Question My question would be, is there a way to model price prediction of batches of variable number of cars in them? Having a way to interpret what influenced the price would be even better. Having a way to predict each car's price would be great. In a sense this is like trying to compress multiple observations into "aggregated" one, but with keeping as much info of each original observation in mind when doing a prediction. Thought process Now, my thought process was to do component analysis, but I'm not sure if this is the right approach since latent vector space will be different for each batch, given the variable number of observations in it. Other approach that I was thinking is using LSTM and feeding it with rows in a sequence. At the end I would expect a price prediction. I'm not expert in neural networks, but vaguely this makes sense and is somehow similar to how LSTM is used for parsing sentences. One big difference is that order of words in sentence makes a difference, but in my case it shouldn't. Any insight, remark or discussion would be appreciated. Cheers!
