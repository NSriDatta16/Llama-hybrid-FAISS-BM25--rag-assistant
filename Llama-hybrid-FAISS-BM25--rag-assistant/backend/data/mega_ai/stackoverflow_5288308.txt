This failure message usually results from attempting to add a file (that is outside the project folder), when a file with that name already exists in the target location within the project folder. For example, let's say your project folder is ~/Developer/CoolProject/ , and the Xcode project is at ~/Developer/CoolProject/CoolProject.xcodeproj . If you drag an image, coolImage.png , from your Desktop to Xcode with the options set as you described, Xcode will copy the image file to ~/Developer/CoolProject/coolImage.png . If you then repeat this same procedure, it will fail the second time with that error message. What I would do is, in the Finder, check inside your project folder to see if the icns file has already been copied into the project folder. If there's a copy of the icns file already in the project folder, and that icns file isn't listed in the Groups & Files list in Xcode, you can resolve the problem by dragging the existing copy (that's inside the project folder) into the Xcode project window to bring up the Add File dialog. You can keep the same options as before, and this time, Xcode won't need to copy the image and so you'll avoid the error. [UPDATED] OK, so what you'll want to do, based on the comment above, is go in the Finder and remove the existing .icns file from your project (in other words, move it to the Trash). Then you can re-add an icon with the same name (from a location outside your project folder) without getting the error. Also, in the future, remember that you might want to consider using the Also Move to Trash option when deleting files from within Xcode, if you no longer want the unused items inside your project folder. Also, you may want to double-check to make sure the file in question is included as part of the Active Target. For example, if you add a file to your project, but the "include in active target" checkbox for the file is unchecked (like the ReadMe.rtfd file in the image below), then the file won't be copied into your application bundle at build time or be available at runtime. (To add that Active Target checkbox column to the Groups & Files list, Control-click on the table column header view and choose Target Membership from the menu).
