One option that sorta works is to add the underline strings to the comments variable. If your underline strings are a fixed size, you could add just those: :set comments+=:---------------,:=============== If they're variable size (more than one): :set comments+=n:--,n:== Using more-than-one allows a paragraph to start with a single - or = and keeps subsequent lines from being prepended with the comment string. Remove the + above to set comments just to those strings instead of adding them on. There are some cases where the formatting will act unexpectedly (e.g. underlines on consecutive lines). I'm sure there's a more appropriate way to do this but hopefully this will get you started. :h comments :h format-comments :h formatoptions :h fo-table
