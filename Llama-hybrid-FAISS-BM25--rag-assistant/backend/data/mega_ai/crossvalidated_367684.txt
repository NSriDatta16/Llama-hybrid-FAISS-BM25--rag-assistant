I recently found this paper on "Boltzmann Encoded Adversarial Machines" which integrates RBMs with CNNs as a generative model. The authors show it is mathematically "better" in some ways, and show some toy examples where BEAM seems far more capable of accurately learning the data distribution compared to other GAN models. The "real world" benchmark of CelebA faces was far less impressive -- it's not clear that BEAM does better or even as well as other popular GANs. However, the use of RBMs in this setting is certainly interesting.
