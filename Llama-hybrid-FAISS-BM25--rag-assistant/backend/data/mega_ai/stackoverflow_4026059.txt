So, of course , right after I posted this I found some inspiration over here . Manually iterating across the collections works just fine, even if it's not the preferred way to do this. I'm still keen to hear info from others related to this, so feel encouraged to help out even though I'm maybe over this one hurdle. For Each Entry In mySprShFeed.Entries If Entry.Title.Text = "spreadsheetNameSought" Then For Each link As AtomLink In Entry.Links If link.Rel = GDataSpreadsheetsNameTable.WorksheetRel Then Dim wsf As WorksheetFeed = service.Query(New WorksheetQuery(link.HRef.ToString)) For Each worksheet In wsf.Entries Console.WriteLine(worksheet.Title.Text) Next End If Next End If Next
