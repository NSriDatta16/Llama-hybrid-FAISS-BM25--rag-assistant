You will not be able to do this as described. The type parameters will not be retained by the class. However you could introduce some simple subclasses that could leverage the logic from your GenericMapAdapter: public class StringDoubleMapAdapter extends GenericMapAdapter { } Then use the adapter sub class on the property: @XmlJavaTypeAdapter(StringDoubleMapAdapter.class)// private final HashMap depWageSum = // new HashMap (); For more information on XmlAdapter see: http://bdoughan.blogspot.com/2010/07/xmladapter-jaxbs-secret-weapon.html
