Skewed classification results

I am dealing with a classification problem with 10 classes. More or less, the number of samples per class is same. Yet I am getting a skewed classification result. By changing the gamma value in the Gaussian kernel SVM, the samples are getting classified to one particular class in most cases. That is, when the gamma value is large, most of the samples are getting classified to class A. For smaller gamma values, most of the samples are getting classified to class B. With some other gamma values, they go to some other class etc. Can you suggest why this is happening? How can I get rid of this problem?
