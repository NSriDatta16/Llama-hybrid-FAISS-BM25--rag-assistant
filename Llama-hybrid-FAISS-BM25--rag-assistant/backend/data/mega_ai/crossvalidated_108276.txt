Given time series data, how to model the frequency of someone changes his job?

I am given a time series data vector (ordered by months and years),which contains only 0 s and 1 s. 1 s represent a person changes his job at a particular a month. Questions: What model can i use to determine model how frequently this person change his job ? In addition, this model should be able to predict the probability of this person changing his in the next 6 months. A poisson process ? (I have studied poisson process before however I have no idea when and how to apply it). Any assumptions that data need to meet before applying the poisson process ? Would love to gather more information on how to model something like this. Thanks
