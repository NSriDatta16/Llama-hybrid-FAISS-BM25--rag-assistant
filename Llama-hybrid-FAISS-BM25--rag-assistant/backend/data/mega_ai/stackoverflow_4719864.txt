I notice this is iOS tagged, so bad news: Core Data support in Interface Builder only exists for Macs, not iDevices (so far.) Make a MacOS X nib, not an ios nib, and you'll see "Managed Object Context" and "Core Data Entity" in the library. IB's Core Data support heavily uses Cocoa Bindings, which are also only available in MacOS proper (so far); without bindings it's not really meaningful to wire up model objects in the nib. To see how to use core data without setting things up in IB, make a new iOS project with the "Navigation-Based Application" template, and check the "use core data for storage" checkbox. The meat is in the app delegate and RootViewController classes it creates; the nibs just contain VCs and UIViews, as normal.
