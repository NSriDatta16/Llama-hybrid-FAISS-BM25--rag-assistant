I saw your edit, and I was about to tell you it is impossible to reference a nested table externally. The nested table is physically created as a distinct table that holds data separately from the parent table: SQL> SELECT object_name, object_type 2 FROM all_objects 3 WHERE created > trunc(sysdate) 4 AND object_type = 'TABLE'; OBJECT_NAME OBJECT_TYPE ------------------------------ ------------------- SCHOOL_TAB TABLE CHILD_TABLE TABLE PERSON_TAB TABLE Here you can see that Oracle has created a CHILD_TABLE table, however it is hidden from us and can only be worked internally by Oracle: SQL> select * from child_table; ORA-22812: cannot reference nested table column's storage table In this case I was pretty sure that you couldn't reference the child table in any way, however to my surprise this seems to work (we can't select from CHILD_TABLE, however we can reference to it): SQL> alter table child_table add constraint pk_child_table primary key (cid); Table altered SQL> CREATE TABLE school_child_tab ( 2 cid REFERENCES child_table, 3 sid REFERENCES school_tab 4 ); Table created You could build your inserts like this (I don't really like to store to store data as objects, but here you go): SQL> insert into school_tab values (school_t(1, 'school A')); 1 row inserted SQL> insert into person_tab values ( 2 person_t(1, 'person A', childtable_t(child_t(1, 'child A')))); 1 row inserted SQL> insert into school_child_tab values (1, 1); 1 row inserted
