Passing base64_encoded serialized data between form submissions

I'm creating a wizard-based series of forms for taking user inputs. One of the requirements for that wizard is that the script (PHP) cannot save the inputs into the database (MySQL) until the user clicks the 'Save' button, so I have to device a mechanism to transport user inputs in one form to another when the user clicks 'Previous' or 'Next' buttons. I looked into using various methods including cookies, sessions, temporary files etc, but I settled for embedding base64_encoded serialize data in a hidden field that exists in all the forms in the series. The value in this field will be decoded on form submissions and re-encoded for putting in the next form after other values from the current form are inserted. Here is a sample of how the hidden field looks: So the questions are: Is it considered a good/bad practice? Is there any length limit of hidden fields in HTMLform? What are the possible security issues? And are there better alternatives? (with explanations, preferably without using javascript) Thanks in advance!
