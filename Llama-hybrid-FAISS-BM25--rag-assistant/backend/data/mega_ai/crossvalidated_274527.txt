To get things started and also give some suggestions for open-source implementations, I know that theano (which is accessed via Python) allows one to compute gradients numerically, using theano.gradient.numeric_grad ( http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/library/gradient.html#module-theano.gradient ). There is also a python package called PyMC3 which allows one to implement Bayesian methods in Python and it also makes heavy use of theano. It offers Hamiltonian Monte Carlo: https://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/notebooks/getting_started.html : PyMC3, Stan (Stan Development Team, 2014), and the LaplacesDemon package for R are currently the only PP packages to offer HMC. This might help you to get some of the suggestions implemented.
