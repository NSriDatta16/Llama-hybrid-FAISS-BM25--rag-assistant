Memory management in memory intensive application

If you are developing a memory intensive application in C++ on Windows, do you opt to write your own custom memory manager to allocate memory from virtual address space or do you allow CRT to take control and do the memory management for you ? I am especially concerned about the fragmentation caused by the allocation and deallocation of small objects on heap. Because of this, I think the process will run out of memory eventhough there is enough memory but is fragmented.
