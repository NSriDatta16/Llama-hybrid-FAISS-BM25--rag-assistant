I am using "URL Parameters" as in PDF Open Parameters to get to a certain PDF Page or bookmark. There is something for the layout too. Fineprint: I also do have some issue ( see Fragment lost ) using it with the WinForm WebBrowser control, nevertheless I find the approach useful (for me it works on Win 7 with .NET 4 except the mentioned issue).
