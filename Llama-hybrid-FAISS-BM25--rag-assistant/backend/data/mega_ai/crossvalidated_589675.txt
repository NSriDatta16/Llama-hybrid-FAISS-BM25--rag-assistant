The amount of HIV DNA is a continuous value (or at least approximately). And if one is interested in the effect of a treatment on the increase of HIV DNA, one should rather use a model with continuous outcome rather than logistic regression. E.g. you might deem a linear model to be appropriate. Then you identify the treatment, devise a model of the amount of HIV DNA that is linear in the treatment, make sure that the experiment is properly randomized or that you have controlled for all relevant confounders, and then the effect can be obtained from the fitted coefficient of the treatment.
