Should I convert a categorical variable with k levels to (k-1) or k binary variables?

I'm building a predictive model with a combination of numeric, binary, and categorical variables. The outcome is binary. For methods like SVM, I have read on stack exchange that the categorical features must be converted to binary variables, i.e for a variable of "hair color" that can take on multiple levels (e.g red hair, blonde hair, black hair, or brown hair) we create a binary variable for each level (Hair red? y/n, hair blonde? y/n, etc) However, I'm concerned about linear dependence between the variables when I do this. In the hair color example, assuming everyone has hair color of either red, blonde, black or brown and that people only have 1 type of hair color, if I create 4 binary variables for hair color, then the sum of the 4 variables is always 1. In other words, I can write v1 + v2 + v2 + v4 = 1, which means there is a linear dependence between the binary variables I have introduced to replace the multi level categorical variable. If I create only k-1 variables then I don't have that issue. I understand that multi-collinearity is a problem when fitting a regression model with continuous data because the inverse of the covariance matrix is unstable. Is the issue of linear dependence/multi-collinearity a concern with SVM and Random Forest when using binary/categorical data?
