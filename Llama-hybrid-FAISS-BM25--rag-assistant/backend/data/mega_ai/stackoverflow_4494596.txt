adding some jquery script to Magento page

this has been driving me insane. I can't figure out how to append some jquery script to the head section of a particular page in Magento 1.4.2. I've added the latest jquery library to all pages by editing page.xml, and i've added the no conflict thing. I know i need to add some code to the custom layout update area for the page in question. However nothing works, i've tried many pieces of code and none appear in the head of the page when i later check the source code. I posted the same question on official mangeto forum but eight days later and no replies. That forum is horrible for getting advice most questions are unanswered :(. Any idea how i could add to the head via custom layout update this for example? $(document).ready(function(){ $("a").click(function(event){ alert("Thanks for visiting!"); }); }); I've tried enclosing that in script tags, in reference = head tag. Nothing works. Pulling my hair out and i've googled every word phrase i can think of but no examples of how to add scrip to a page's head in Magento. Please help.
