Should you use the same algorithm in your feature selection as your model

My question is should you use the same algorithm in feature selection as your model? If I'm using a KNN model for classification should I also use a KNN algo when running feature selection? Or lightGBM algo for feature selection and lightGBM model? Or is there a best algo for feature selection that you can use those features with any model? I know there are several different feature engineering techniques I just don't know which techniques should be used with different machine learning algorithms.
