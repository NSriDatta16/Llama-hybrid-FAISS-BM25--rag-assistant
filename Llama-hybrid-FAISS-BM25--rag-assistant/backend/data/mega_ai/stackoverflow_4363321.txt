Adding SKU information to Shopping Cart in Magento

My client needs to have the sku number, next to the Product Name in the Magento Shopping Cart. I tried adding this code: __('Style Number : %s', $_product->getSku()) ?> but I get this message: "Fatal error: Call to a member function getSku() on a non-object." I would appreciate any help. Thank you.
