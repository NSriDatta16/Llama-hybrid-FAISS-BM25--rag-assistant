Django Direct_to_template or flatpages

Building a django app with some mostly static pages at the front of the site e.g. about.html faq.html that kind of thing I was looking at how urls.py work and I created this. ('(.+\.html)$', direct_to_template), It seems to do exactly what I needed. Now for any new .html page I add to the root of my templates folder it just works. templates/about.html templates/faq.hml I can also use things like this in my templates {% include "_menu.html" %} Now someone has kindly pointed out Django FlatPages and suggested maybe I use them instead. If I'm not connecting to the db are there any disadvantages to the way I'm doing it. Seems to me like its a better way to do it than FlatPages because it uses the db and isn't quite as elegant (haven't actually used flatpages in practice though)
