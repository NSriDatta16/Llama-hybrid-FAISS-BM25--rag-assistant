Here is a sample of how you would do it in python. from sklearn import cross_validation scores = cross_validation.cross_val_score(your_model, your_data, y, cv=10) mean_score = scores.mean() std_dev = scores.std() std_error = scores.std() / math.sqrt(scores.shape[0]) ci = 2.262 * std_error lower_bound = mean_score - ci upper_bound = mean_score + ci print "Score is %f +/- %f" % (mean_score, ci) print '95 percent probability that if this experiment were repeated over and over the average score would be between %f and %f' % (lower_bound, upper_bound)
