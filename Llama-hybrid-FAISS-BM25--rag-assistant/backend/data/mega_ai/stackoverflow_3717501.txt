OSB WLS Initialisation issue

facing some strange behavior in OSB, i have configured WLS with MQ in client mode, i am doing some minor test to check the connection, i have created a proxy service to read the message from Q1 and a Business Service(BS) to route it to Q2. The issue is the proxy is able to read the message but the BS is throwing this: JMSPool BEA-169807 There was an error while making the initial connection to the JMS resource named ALSB_JMS_SessionPool_491704821 from within an EJB or a servlet. The server will attempt the connection again later. The error was javax.jms.JMSException: [JMSPool:169803]JNDI lookup of the JMS connection factory AKBConnFact failed: javax.naming.NoInitialContextException: Cannot instantiate class: com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory [Root exception is java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: com.sun.jndi.fscontext.RefFSContextFactory Note: The classpath or the domain/lib folder contains the RefFSContextFactory class Any ideas gang..? TIA
