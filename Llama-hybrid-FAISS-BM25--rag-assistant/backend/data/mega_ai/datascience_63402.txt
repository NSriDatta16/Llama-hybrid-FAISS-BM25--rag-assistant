There is lack for details here, but problem is very interesting, sounds like QA chat-bot (you may read more about these) a bit. My thoughts for this solution to be viable: there should be sufficient amount of users of your wizard to collect necessary amount of data if you want to use deep learning here. If you only have several hundred of cases when wizard is used, forget it, use some simple statistical analysis (like linear regression, naive Bayes etc.). For collected data being variable enough to cover different cases, there should be some randomization in collecting the data - sometimes wizard should be asking questions in different order and maybe even asking irrelevant questions. As for architecture, you may want to classify sequences of questions/answers, then the most obvious choice is variant of RNN. Or maybe you want to classify how good the next question is - maybe you want to use decision tree/random forest here to classify it. Or maybe you need reinforcement learning? That was to point you should think very well what you want to classify and then test it, maybe in several iterations. So, if the wizard is complex enough and amount of data you have or may collect is big, then answer is most probably yes.
