You could use a logistic regression, then you are implicitely using oddsratios as the measure. The parameter $\beta$ in a logistic regression is the log odds ratio. To add some detail: let the index $i$ index the observations, so the covariable $x_i$ is the type of contact $i$, being a categorical variable, and $y_i=1$ if washing hands after contact $i$, zero contrarywise. Then logistic regression is the model: $$ P(y_i=1 | x_i) = \frac{e^{\alpha+\beta x_i}}{1+e^{\alpha+\beta x_i}} $$ Note that the equation must be read symbolically, the exact interpretation of the $\beta$s depend on the coding of $x$. The most usual (recommended) coding: If there are $k$ possible categories for $x$, then it is coded with $k-1$ dummys. The one category "left out" is the "reference category", and the $k-1$ $\beta$s express comparison with that left-out category. So each of those $\beta$s is an estimate of the log-oddsratio for the comparison of that category to the left-out one.
