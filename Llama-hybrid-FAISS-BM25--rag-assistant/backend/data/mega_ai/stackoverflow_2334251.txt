Of all bit-operations XOR has the best bit shuffling properties. This truth-table explains why: A B AND 0 0 0 0 1 0 1 0 0 1 1 1 A B OR 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 A B XOR 0 0 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 As you can see for AND and OR do a poor job at mixing bits. OR will on average produce 3/4 one-bits. AND on the other hand will produce on average 3/4 null-bits. Only XOR has an even one-bit vs. null-bit distribution. That makes it so valuable for hash-code generation. Remember that for a hash-code you want to use as much information of the key as possible and get a good distribution of hash-values. If you use AND or OR you'll get numbers that are biased towards either numbers with lots of zeros or numbers with lots of ones.
