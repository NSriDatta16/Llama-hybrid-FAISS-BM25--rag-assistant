Random forests are robust to having data which isn't normally distributed but that doesn't mean that the predictions won't be pulled to the natural center of your data to minimize the rmse. Looks like your features may not be good enough to partition the data to follow the real distribution so you should look at getting better features or doing some feature engineering. Edit to add some more thoughts: It does look like your target is made of a mixture distribution which can be visibly seen. So you may want to look into separating the two distributions and look for any correlations, may reveal some useful insights that you may not be accounting for in the model.
