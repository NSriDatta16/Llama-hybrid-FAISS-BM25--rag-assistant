There are ways to handle this, but they are not the ones you describe. One strategy would be to impute the missing variable $z$ . This would mean that you would use a model which assumes $z$ is known, and in cases where $z$ is not known, it is inferred based on patterns in the design matrix used to fit the model (I'm not an expert in imputation, so I leave that with you to explore). Imputation makes a point estimate for the missing data. That may or may not be desirable. Another (Bayesian) approach would be to make assumptions on the population distribution of $z$ and then integrate over the uncertainty in $z$ and model uncertainty as well. I'll revisit this later tonight and perhaps add some exposition.
