Good introductory reference for Bayesian Non-parametric (Dirichlet Process / Chinese Restaurant Process)

I am looking for a recommendation for basic introductory material on Bayesian Non-parametric methods, specifically Dirichlet Process / Chinese Restaurant Process. I am looking for material which covers the modeling part as well as the inference part from ground-up. Most of the material I found on the internet has slightly advanced material and they skip the inference part, which is usually harder to grasp.
