Your best starting point is to always use some kind of "reset mechanism" like Eric Meyer's CSS Reset or framework like HTML5 Boilerplate , they help in reducing differences between browsers (not all, but most of it). If this is not possible (project is already in finishing phase, etc.) you can always ask questions here, check Position Is Everything for description of bugs, Quirks Mode , SitePoint reference and various other sites (Google is your friend :)). Hope this helps. There is "debugging" tool for IE - IE Developer Toolbar - but it's usefulness can't compare to that of Firebug, Dragonfly and such. IE8+ does have better support for debugging, thoughâ€¦ There are some articles that suggest using Visual Studio , but I haven't tried it. Mostly it's just trial and error with IE :).
