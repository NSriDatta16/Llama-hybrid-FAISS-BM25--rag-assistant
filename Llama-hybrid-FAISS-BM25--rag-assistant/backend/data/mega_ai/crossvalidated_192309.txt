Estimate group averages

If I have 100 numbers from two separate groups $X$ and $Y$. How can I manually estimate or derive an algorithm to automatically estimate $AVG(X)$ and $AVG(Y)$? I know all the numbers, but I don't know which numbers belong to which group. Is it really possible to give a proper answer to this question?
