Functional programming can be applied to almost any task. Web applications, scientific applications, games, you name it. It is very common to mix Clojure and Java, since Clojure does not have many dedicated libraries for things like I/O or networking. Organizations that already have a lot of Java code can use Clojure for small subsections of their Java projects. For new projects, it is usually more effective to use Clojure as the high-level driver language, calling Java libraries where necessary.
