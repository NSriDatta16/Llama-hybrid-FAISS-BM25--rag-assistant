PCA analysis on two datasets

I am new in statistics and would like to test correlations between two datasets I have: Biomarkers (6) activity on 14 populations. (columns:site, cat, gr, gst...) Metals (24) in tissue for the same 14 populations. (columns: site, Fe, Ni, Co,.) My question: How is the biomarkers activity correlated with concentration of metals in animal tissue? I'm using R, and would be great if anyone knows how to visualize this question, maybe by using PCA?
