Regular Expression to Detect a Specific Query

I wonder if you anyone can construct a regular expression that can detect if a person searches for something like "site:cnn.com" or "site:www.globe.com.ph/". I've been having the most difficult time figuring it out. Thanks a lot in advance! Edit: Sorry forgot to mention my script is in PHP.
