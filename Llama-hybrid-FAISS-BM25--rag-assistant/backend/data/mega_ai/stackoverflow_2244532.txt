Encouraging Open Source Project Programmers to Be Active Without Sacrificing Code Quality

I have an open source project which I had been actively developing JStock - Free Stock Market Software From programming side point of view, most of the time, is solo work. This worry me. As for long term growth of JStock, is is not healthy. Although I do have a few programmers as team members, they are not actively involve. Most of them are just one or two times code contributors. After that, I received no news from them. The main reason I think they are not active, is due to some strict rule which I had imposed : No commit write being given. All the changes must be submitted as patches, and reviewed by me See, even myself also doesn't like this strict rule. I had removed this rule once, and let the programmers have the freedom to commit the code as they like. As a result, just after a few days, I found the code being messed up (Being messed up mean, cann't even compile). I have no way, but quickly stop the commit access, and recover the source code manually. I feel that : Too much rules, bad for programmers. They will not contribute. No rule, bad for end users. They will be using product built from messed code. I know in current situation is totally unhealthy for JStock. May I know how do you all encourage the programmers to contribute code, at the same time maintain certain degree of code quality? Currently, JStock do have Feature Tracker and Bug Tracker . They are actively being used. Forum for developers. CVS Is Developer Guide PDF file is something must have, in order to let newly joint developer to understand the code? Or I shall let developers explore the 50,000 lines of code by their own? Thanks.
