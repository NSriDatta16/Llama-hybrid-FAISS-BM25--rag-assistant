You should run some test to figure out if you need to implement two-way, fixed or random effects. Could be a good idea to run a unit root test as well, depending on your time-interval. Control for heterosced, VIF and all that lala. If you are including lots of predictors then consider using GMM instead of FE model. Last advice: check out multilevel models or Bayesian models, personally I prefer these alternatives to econometric longitudinal models
