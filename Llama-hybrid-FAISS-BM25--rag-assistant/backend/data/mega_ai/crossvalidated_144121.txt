Logistic Regression: Bernoulli vs. Binomial Response Variables

I want to perform logistic regression with the following binomial response and with $X_1$ and $X_2$ as my predictors. I can present the same data as Bernoulli responses in the following format. The logistic regression outputs for these 2 data sets are mostly the same. The deviance residuals and AIC are different. (The difference between the null deviance and the residual deviance is the same in both cases - 0.228.) The following are the regression outputs from R. The data sets are called binom.data and bern.data. Here is the binomial output. Call: glm(formula = cbind(Successes, Trials - Successes) ~ X1 + X2, family = binomial, data = binom.data) Deviance Residuals: [1] 0 0 0 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.9649 21.6072 -0.137 0.891 X1Yes -0.1897 2.5290 -0.075 0.940 X2 0.3596 1.9094 0.188 0.851 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 2.2846e-01 on 2 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: -4.9328e-32 on 0 degrees of freedom AIC: 11.473 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 Here is the Bernoulli output. Call: glm(formula = Success ~ X1 + X2, family = binomial, data = bern.data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6651 -1.3537 0.7585 0.9281 1.0108 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -2.9649 21.6072 -0.137 0.891 X1Yes -0.1897 2.5290 -0.075 0.940 X2 0.3596 1.9094 0.188 0.851 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 15.276 on 11 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 15.048 on 9 degrees of freedom AIC: 21.048 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 My questions: I can see that the point estimates and standard errors between the 2 approaches are equivalent in this particular case. Is this equivalence true in general? How can the answer for Question #1 be justified mathematically? Why are the deviance residuals and AIC different?
