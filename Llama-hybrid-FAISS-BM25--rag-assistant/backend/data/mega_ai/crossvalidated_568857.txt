Can correlation matrix be used as features in machine learning classification

Can I use correlation between the training data as features, and if possible how will I test the test data with the model coefficients I will try to explain more If the training data are X = [X1, X2,....., Xn] and Xi = [Xi1,Xi2,....., Xi100] where X are the training data and Xi is one sample of the data and K = [Xcorr1,1 ... Xcorr1,n ... ... ... Xcorrn,1 ... Xcorrn,n] K will be something like that K = [1 .2 .3 .4 .2 1 .5 .6 .3 .5 1 .7 .4 .6 .7 1] Can I will use this K to train my model ? If it is possible How will I test my test data which will be X = [X1, X2,....., Xn]
