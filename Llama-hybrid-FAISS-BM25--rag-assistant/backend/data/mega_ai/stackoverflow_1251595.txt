I've read on the wiki that the accepted path of xd_receiver.html depends on the browser, and Firefox accept the full path, while IE Opera and Safari want a path relative to the current page (like "xd_receiver.html" or "../xd_receiver.html" ). I have to thank you because your hint on setting the URL and basedomain in Connect saved my day :-) Ciao, Roberto
