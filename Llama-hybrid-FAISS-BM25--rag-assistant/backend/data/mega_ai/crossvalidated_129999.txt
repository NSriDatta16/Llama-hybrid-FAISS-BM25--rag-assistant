Is there a known bias with telephone polls in the U.S.?

I was looking at a WashingtonTimes/ABC poll, and the results breakdown, especially by age, seemed surprising to me. So I went looking for bias. It said: "poll was conducted by telephone Dec. 11-14, 2014, among a random sample of 1,000 adults. Interviews were conducted in English and Spanish on landlines and cell phones." The poll did not give me the numbers of respondents in each age group, and my first thought was what kind of 18-29 year old is home to answer the phone?! OK, they include cellular, that makes it a bit fairer. But still, what kind of 18-29 year old answers their mobile phone, gets asked if they want to take a survey, and says "yeah, sure". (I don't mean that as a rhetorical question; my hunch is that certain groups are much more likely, e.g. someone with low self-esteem might enjoy the process of being asked for their opinion by a stranger over the phone.) So, is there any research on this topic? Would an organization interested in manipulating public opinion choose a telephone poll, over online polls, or interviewing in the street, if they were after a specific bias?
