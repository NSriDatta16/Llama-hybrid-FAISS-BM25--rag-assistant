Alternatives to three dimensional scatter plot

For a presentation I have to visualize three dimensional data. I should visualize them in "the style of a scatterplot". May first ideas were A three dimensional scatterplot A scatterplot matrix Dimensionality reduction (PCA) and afterwards a two dimensional scatterplot What are alternatives to these concepts? If possible include R Code in your answer. Edit: I have 40 objects with 3 dimensions. Each observation can take on an integer value from 1 to 6.
