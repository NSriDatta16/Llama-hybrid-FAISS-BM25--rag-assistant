If both installations are the exact same version of Magento, you could try taking a mysqldump for all tables that start with sales_ and insert those records into your target system. The trick would be to make sure that the ID values match up across all the key relationships. You'll need to make sure that the corresponding customers and their addresses already exist in the new system too, probably, as I imagine there would be foreign keys into those tables too. Make sure you take lots of backups before you try that. Good luck and please report back how it goes! Cheers, Jonathan
