In principle you can make the machinery of any logistic mixed model software perform ordinal logistic regression by expanding the ordinal response variable into a series of binary contrasts between successive levels (e.g. see Dobson and Barnett Introduction to Generalized Linear Models section 8.4.6). However, this is a pain, and luckily there are a few options in R: the ordinal package , via the clmm and clmm2 functions ( clmm = C umulative L ink M ixed M odel) the mixor package , via the mixor function ( Note that as of 31/7/21 this has been removed from CRAN ) the MCMCglmm package , via family="ordinal" (see ?MCMCglmm ) the brms package , e.g. via family="cumulative" (see ?brmsfamily ) The latter two options are implemented within Bayesian MCMC frameworks. As far as I know, all of the functions quoted (with the exception of ordinal::clmm2 ) can handle multiple random effects (intercepts, slopes, etc.); most of them (maybe not MCMCglmm ?) can handle choices of link function (logit, probit, etc.). ( If I have time I will come back and revise this answer with a worked example of setting up ordinal models from scratch using lme4 )
