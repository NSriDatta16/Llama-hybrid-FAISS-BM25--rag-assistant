There is a presentation on SVMs that does quite a good job of providing an intuitive explanation. To simplify, the basic idea is to find a line (or a hyperplane in multivariate models) that separates the data. The main difference with OLS is that not all points influence the fit of the line/hyperplane. Only a subset of training points "close" to the line (the support vectors), influence the "fit". SVMs are applied to datasets that can't be seperated by straight lines (including classification problems) by applying kernel functions .
