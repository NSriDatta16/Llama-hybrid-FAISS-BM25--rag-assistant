Think of the array as a wheel. Once you have filled it up, use a rotating index for the replace location. myIndex = ( ( myIndex + 1 ) % myCount ); [myArray replaceObjectAtIndex:myIndex withObject:newValue]; You can initialize it with a bunch of [NSNull null] objects that you will replace, so you do not need other special processing the first time through. Once you have finished collecting data, organize the array to have the appropriate element first if it simplifies other operations. NSRange range = NSMakeRange( 0 , myIndex ); NSArray *temp = [myArray subarrayWithRange:range]; [myArray removeObjectsInRange:range]; [myArray addObjectsFromArray:temp];
