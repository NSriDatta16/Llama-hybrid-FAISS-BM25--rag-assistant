Just to expand on Justin's answer, In this case, the Lagrange multipliers are not unique - there are an infinite number of combinations of Lagrange multipliers which are optimal, and produce the exact same performance of the SVM. Because the constraints are linear, the Kuhn-Tucker-Kasrush conditions apply, whether or not any of the constraints are redundant (i.e., not full rank). If you used a different optimization solver, you could get other, still optimal, values of the Lagrange multipliers.
