Cobertura, EMMA and even Clover only do branch/decision coverage (in addition to line/statement coverage, of course). Clover also provides method coverage (which simply measures if a method was entered at all during execution). For path coverage (plus line/statement coverage), try JMockit Coverage . A sample report can be found here . Actually, as of now this is only an initial version of the new path coverage support, which I still need to improve.
