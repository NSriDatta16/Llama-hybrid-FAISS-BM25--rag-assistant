How can I extract or change links in HTML with Perl?

I have this input text: &nbsp;what y all heard? i'm shark oysters. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As you can see, there's no newline in this chunk of HTML text, and I need to look for all image links inside, copy them out to a directory, and change the line inside the text to something like ./images/file_name . Currently, the Perl code that I'm using looks like this: my ($old_src,$new_src,$folder_name); foreach my $record (@readfile) { ## so the if else case for the url replacement block below will be correct $old_src = ""; $new_src = ""; if ($record =~ /\ This is only sufficient to handle HTML text with newlines in them. I thought only looping the regex statement, but then i would have to change the matching line to some other text. Do you have any idea if there an elegant Perl way to do this? Or maybe I'm just too dumb to see the obvious way of doing it, plus I know putting global option doesn't work. thanks. ~steve
