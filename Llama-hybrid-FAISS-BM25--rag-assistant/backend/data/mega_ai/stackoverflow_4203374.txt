Traceroute on android

I am a beginner on android platform, and I want to build a tracerouting app. So these are my queries: Is it possible to make such an application in Android? if possible then guide me the way that I follow. Does Android support low-level programming to capture ICMP packets? or do I need to add some kind of JAR (in java) or some other libraries to support this application? In Java, there are JPCAP and docjar etc kind of libraries that we can import in our IDE or Eclipse so that Java support for making such kind of API's? I need valuable suggestions.
