It may be relatively small now but do you think it might grow in the future? Of your course you have to be pragmatic, but if you already have natural separations of concern within your single assembly then it's fairly easy to split that into two or more assemblies. If the classes themselves combine business logic and data access then you have more work on your hands. However, I'd argue that it's almost no more work to write your data access logic in one assembly and your business logic in the other, in parallel if required, than to write it all in one place in the first place.
