How to test whether it is valid causal inference

definition of average causal effect $$ ACE = E(C_1) - E(C_0) $$ $$ ACE = E(Y|X=1) - E(Y|X=0) $$ given the condition that $$ X \bot (Y(0), Y(1)) $$ So if I have a regression m whose residual is perfectly normally distributed: Can I assert that coefficient of $X$ is the average causal effect of $X \rightarrow Y$ ? If so, how can I test whether that $m\$redisuals$ is normally distributed along $X$ ? Thank you a lot!
