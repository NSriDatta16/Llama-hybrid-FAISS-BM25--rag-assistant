Do not build a predictive instrument on a subset of the data. That is inefficient and arbitrary. Fix the fundamental problem that led you do to this: you chose a discontinuous improper accuracy scoring rule that is highly influenced by the prevalence of $Y=1$. Use methods that make random forests estimate probabilities in order to do this. Improper accuracy scores are optimized by bogus models, and create "classification" "rules" that do not transport to populations with different outcome prevalence.
