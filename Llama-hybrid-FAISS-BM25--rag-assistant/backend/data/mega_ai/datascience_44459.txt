You are looking for a fully convolution neural network trained for image segmentation. The architecture is typically convolutions followed by de-convolutional layers with out pooling. The forward inference serves to extract information with convolutions. The de-convolutions serve to resize the tensors to the size of the inputs height and width. A fully connected layer then classifies each pixel from the input. Deconvolutions demonstration. Unfortunately you need pixel wise labels to train a network to do this. You could look for a pretrained model that already segments faces from images or you could grind out hand labeling for a 1000 images and use transfer learning (there are online tools for doing this such as Label box .
