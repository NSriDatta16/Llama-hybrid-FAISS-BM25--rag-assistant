I agree that a simulation based on random initial assignment followed by some optimization is a good approach, but you're describing an optimization procedure which does not seem optimal, if I understand correctly (you're planning to swap frequencies at random if I read you correctly). At each optimization step you could pick a "reasonable" improvement by taking one radio from each frequency group and considering the 5*4/2=10 possible swaps of frequencies between two of them, and either choose the best, or (say) one of those which has positive delta score, with probabilities proportional to the deltas in the scores. In the spirit of "simulated annealing", once the overall score seems to have more or less stabilized, you may want to switch for a small number of steps to "high temperature" (high randomness) where you just pick the set of 5 radios and swap them all e.g. with a circular permutation of frequency assignments -- do that a few times then go to the "cooling down" part again with the procedure in the above paragraph (which tries to get a cheap simulation of a maximum-gradient descent;-).
