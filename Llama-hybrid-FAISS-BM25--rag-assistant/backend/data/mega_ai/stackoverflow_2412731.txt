Why does LaTeX not render my gantt-diagram into pdf

is there anybody out there, with experiences about how to do a gantt-diagram / chart using latex. I tryed it for a lot of hours today, lastly it worked switching outpout from pdf to dvi. Maybe someone can tell me what to include, besides pst-gantt, and the normal pstricks stuff. It showed more than 100 errors for 4 Tasks.. after switching to dvi there was a big 0. i am using the whole distribution mitex .. upgradet to the newest version. stupidly i have the error log not avaible on this computer. but it was always the same error. i was using pst-gantt, outload missing packages.. hm errors will follow tomorrow morning
