An algorithm is a sequence of well defined steps leading to the solution of a type of problem. A data structure is a way to store and organize data to facilitate access and modifications. The benefit of knowing standard algorithms and data structures is they are mostly better than you yourself could develop. They are the result of months or even years of work by people who are far more intelligent than the majority of programmers. Knowing a range of data structures and algorithms allows you to fit a problem roughly to a data structure or/and algorithm and tweak as required.
