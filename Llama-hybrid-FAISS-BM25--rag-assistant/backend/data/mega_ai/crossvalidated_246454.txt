Is it that cross-validation deals with the actual output against future data, while back propagation is for weight optimization? Yes, cross validation is meant to assess if your model performs well on data that was not used to build it. Backpropagation in neural networks is an iterative method by which you train/optimize weights to improve classification or regression accuracy.
