This is not a matter of notation. There are 3 ways to pass parameters to a function: by value by reference by pointer In amp_swap you pass the actual parameters by reference. This is introduced and valid in C++ only. In star_swap you pass the parameters using pointers. This was the original C-way. Basically, if you are using C++, it is encouraged to use reference, since it is more readable for variables. If you need pointers, by all means use them. And remember to use the & sign when declaring the method with references, because otherwise you produce a bug. If you don't declare the reference in amp_swap , the function will not swap anything. Because this way you use method 1 (pass the parameter values only) and in the function will be created two new automatic variables, which live only in the scope of the function. This way the original outer variables will not be touched.
