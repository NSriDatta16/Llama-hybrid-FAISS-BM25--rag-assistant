User Group and Role Management in .NET with Active Directory

I'm currently researching methods for storing user roles and permissions for .NET based projects. Some of these projects are web based, some are not. I'm currently struggling to find the best method to achieve what I'm looking for in a consistent, portable way across project types. Where I'm at, we're looking to leverage Active Directory as our single point of contact for basic user information. Because of this, we're looking to not have to maintain a custom database for each application's users since they are already stored in Active Directory and actively maintained there. Additionally, we don't want to write our own security model/code if possible and would like to use something pre-existing, like the security application blocks provided by Microsoft. Some projects require only basic privileges, such as read, write, or no access. Other projects require more complex permissions. Users of those applications might be granted access to some areas, but not others, and their permissions can change across each area. An administration section of the app would control and define this access, not the AD tools. Currently, we're using integrated Windows Authentication to perform authentication on our intranet. This works well for finding out basic user information, and I've seen that ASP.NET can be extended to provide an Active Directory roles provider, so I can find out any security groups a user belongs to. But, what seems like the downfall of this method to me is that everything is stored in Active Directory, which could lead to a mess to maintain if things grow too big. Along this same line, I've also heard of Active Directory Lightweight Directory Services, which seems like it could extend our schema and add only application specific attributes and groups. Problem is, I can't find anything on how this would be done or how this works. There are MSDN articles that describe how to talk to this instance and how to create a new instance, but nothing ever seems to answer my question. My question is: Based on your experience, am I going down the right track? Is what I'm looking to do possible using just Active Directory, or do other tools have to be used?
