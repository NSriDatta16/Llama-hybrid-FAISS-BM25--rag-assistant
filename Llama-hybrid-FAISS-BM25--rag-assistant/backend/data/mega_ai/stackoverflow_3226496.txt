To create tables you should use SQL Management Studio (an Express edition is available). To easily interact with these tables in Visual Studio, right click on your project, go Add New Item -> Data -> LINQ to SQL Classes (call it DB.dbml or Base.dbml or something similar). Now go View on the top menu -> Server Explorer. Right Click on Data Connections -> Add Connection -> Microsoft SQL Server -> Put your Server Name (probably YOUR-PC\SQLEXPRESS), Select your database. Now you can drag tables onto the dbml workspace. Now build, and you can reference your tables in code like this: DBDataContext db = new DBDataContext(); Car[] cars = db.Cars.Where(c => c.Make = "Ford").ToArray(); You might need to enable TCP/IP and Named Pipes for your SQL Server Express using the SQL Configuration Manager (Google for more details).
