SWI prolog A very popular implementation seems to have a Java interface as does SiCStus which would be easier than using JNI to instantiate an instance in your Java Process. I've used both from C quite a while ago and do recommend them. My prefference would be SWI as it is open-source and from my experience the de facto implementation. The documentation for SWI's Java interface seems to be adequate, and the embedding process quite straight forward.
