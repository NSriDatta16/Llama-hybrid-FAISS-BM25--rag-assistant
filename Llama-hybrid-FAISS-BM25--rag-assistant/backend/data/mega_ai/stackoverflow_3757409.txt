Write an Excel User Defined Function . Pseudocode for the function is below: string returnValue; for each ( char c in string) returnValue = returnValue + Chr(char) return returnValue You can call the UDF as part of an excell formula eg =StringToASCIICodeValues(A1) Formula Version You could do it manually with excel builtin formula's by ( excel doesn't have a for-loop function for formulae ) A1="some string" A2="=MID($A$1,COLUMN(A2),1)" Drag the formula in cell A2 to the right. Drag to K2 for some string example. A3="=CODE(A2)" Drag the formula in cell A3 to the right. Drag to K3 for some string example. A4="=A3" B4="=CONCATENATE(A4,B3)" Drag the formula in cell B4 to the right. Drag to Cell K4 for some string example. The right most column with a value on row 4 contains the final value. For some string it will return: 11511110910132115116114105110103 in cell K4
