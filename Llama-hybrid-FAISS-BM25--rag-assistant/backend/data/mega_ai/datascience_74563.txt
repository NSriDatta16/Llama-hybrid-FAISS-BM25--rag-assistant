Minimum number of samples on a CNN

Related to this paper , could it also be applied to convolutional neural networks? I ask this because FNN and CNN share many characteristics This is the formula: $(N_e+1)\cdot N_C + (N_C+1)\cdot N_S Where Ne it is Entry Layers, Nc it is Hidden Layers, Ns it is Output Layers and Nej it is the minimum number of samples needed for training.
