IMO, the answer is no. The main reason for this is that if you consider how many pages have items from multiple sources that would each have to use https and have a valid certificate that I don't think would work for some of the big companies that would have to change all their links. It isn't a bad idea and maybe some Web x.0 would have more secure communications by default, but I don't think http will be that protocol. Just to give a couple of examples, though I am from Canada which may affect how these sites render: www.msn.com : atdmt.com s-msn.com live.com www.cnn.com : revsci.net cnn.net turner.com dl-rms.com Those were listed through "NoScript" which notes this page has code from "google-analytics.com" and "quantserve.com" besides the stackoverflow.com for a third example of this.
