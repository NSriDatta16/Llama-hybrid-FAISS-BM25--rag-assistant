How to measure probabilistic forecast accuracy?

Suppose I make a bunch of probabilistic forecasts like: 70% probability that sales growth will be 10-15% in Q1, 10% probability that sales growth will be > 15%, 20% probability that sales growth will be Given the actual data, what's the best way to measure or track my accuracy? Brier score? And can I average my Brier score for different types of forecasts? (e.g. Find the brier score for the prediction "there is 80% chance of rain" and average it with the sales growth forecast)
