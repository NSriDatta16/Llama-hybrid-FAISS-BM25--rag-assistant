Only way to prevent the animation: -You have to monkey patch the DragProxy class (i.e. create a new class with identical name, code, and package structure), and remove the effects code from the mouseUpHandler(). No other way to override it as far as I know, though the issue was been submitted as a bug to Adobe over a year ago.
