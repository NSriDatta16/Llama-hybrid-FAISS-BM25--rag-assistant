securely authenticate client to server

System specs: C# client using .NET 3.0. WCF services hosted as windows services on App Servers. MSSql Server 2008R2 DB for data storage. Hashes of user passwords are stored in the DB for authenticating users. My problem is, I do not know how to securely authenticate the client to the server, using the hash of the client's password. Having read similar questions on SO, I saw that a challenge-response mechanism was recommended. Could some one give any good coding examples of how this can be done? Also, if we can securely generate private-public key pair on the server and distribute the public key to all the clients, would using a public key encryption for passing information from the client and server suffice instead of using challenge-response. EDIT: By Client I meant the user who will be actually using the client machine for logging in.
