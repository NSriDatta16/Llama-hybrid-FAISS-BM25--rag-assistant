This may not be relevant but... I have had problems working with bitmaps in C++, getting out-of-resource errors from the lower-level windows APIs. It appears to result from the windows internal resource heap not being able to handle/allocate bitmaps/bitmap-sections when drawing is being done with bitblts and the like. Don't know if something like this further down in the chain could be tripping the dotnet libraries. There is a tool somewhere on MSDN that installs a device driver and can be used to examine the various desktop heaps (don't know how that may relate to services.) I think (been a while since I used it) it shows percentages used/available - while that can be some indicator, I suspect fragmentation of those areas can also occur resulting the errors - unfortunately I have not been able to totally eliminate my problems, but that tool might help you diagnose yours. (Looks like the tool might be called 'dheapmon'.)
