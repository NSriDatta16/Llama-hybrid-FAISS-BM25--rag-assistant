Non-gaussian ML estimation with auto.arima in R

I am struggling with the details of the auto.arima function in R. Particularly, I would like to estimate an ARIMA model with errors (i.e. regressors) for which: the dependent variable in first difference is stationary and normal; the two independent variables (errors) are first difference stationary, but not normal. My questions are: is the default log-likelihood for the AIC in auto.arima Gaussian? Or is it empirical maximum likelihood? what about the method specification? ("ML" and "CSS" are the alternatives. I would really try to use ML for the hyperparameter estimation, but I am afraid the results would be biased for the coefficients of the regressors, because of non-gaussianity of the independent variables). Thank you in advance! Edits: By "two independent variables (errors)" I mean a model as suggested by Rob Hyndman here: https://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/arimax/ (Regression with ARMA errors) For example, considering an ARMA(2,0) with $x_t$ and $z_t$ errors, the model would be the following: $$y_t=\beta_1x_t+\beta_2z_t+n_t$$ $$n_t=\phi_1n_{t-1}+\phi_2n_{t-2}+z_t$$ Since the phi coefficients are estimated on a normal time series with MLE, it should be fine. My doubt is what concerns the tho beta coefficients, as they are as well estimated by a ML estimator, on non - normal data.
