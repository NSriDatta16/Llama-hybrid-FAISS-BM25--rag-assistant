It's simply been deprecated in favour of MSXML 6.0. This blog entry from the Microsoft XML team goes through the history of MXSML. Don't me put off by the "...in Internet Explorer" part of the title, the history on that page is completely independent of IE. In the section "MSXML Lifecycle and history" in that blog entry, the author states that: MSXML4 was a predecessor to MSXML6 but hasn't ever shipped in the operating system. MSXML6 is a significant step forward in terms of reliability, security, W3C and System.Xml compatibility, and it also has support for native 64-bit environments. Right now we are investing much more heavily in MSXML6 and MSXML3 and we're encouraging our customers to move to 6 when possible and 3 when necessary. OP edit: It's important to note that MSXML3 was released before the W3C decided on a final XSD specification. Ultimately W3C went with an XSD syntax different than what Microsoft had created for MSXML3. MSXML6 is fully compatible with the W3C's chosen XSD scheme. This means that MSXML3 and MSXML6 are not compatible with each other; and MSXML3 does not use standard XSD.
