me thinks this is a pretty good case for a decision tree analysis. So i assume your 40 variables dont include the time period but that you have decent markers for your time period (P1 , P2 etc :) ) and you could use average money spent as a decision label. What the tree is going to do is tell you , for instance, during P1 if the subject was male and if he had a car and if he had a wife his average spending was > 200 bucks ..the tree will do this for all periods and then its a simple matter of visual interpretation for you to figure out the anwer to your problem..hope this helps
