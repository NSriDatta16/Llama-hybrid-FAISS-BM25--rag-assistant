Changing Design For All Module Pages In Magento

I'm doing a custom module in Magento and everything is going swimmingly... except I want to change the base layout template that all pages in the module use. I've done some googling with little success. Anyone have any answers? I want to do something along the lines of: ... page/empty.phtml As you may guess, it's a lightbox... I'm a glutton for punishment I guess :)
