As another comment notes - multilevel regression and logistic regression are not mutually exclusive, and in fact it might be that the best model to run is a mutlilevel logit model! In this case, the key issue is whether or not you want to consider "school" as a variable or a unit of analysis. But first, this question conflates two separate questions about regression modeling that don't have much to do with one another. The first question is - what "flavor" of regression model should I use, based on the way my dependent variable is measured. Normal "OLS" regression assumes that the dependent variable is continuous and has a more or less normal-ish distribution. But if your dependent variable is binary - for example "did you graduate or not?" then an OLS model isn't really appropriate. Instead you want to use a logit (or logistic) regression model. This type of model is specifically set up to analyze binary dependent variables - it tells you the extent to which a one unit increase in a particular independent variable changes the probability of getting a "1" on the binary dependent variable, holding all other variables constant. Totally sperate from that entire discussion, we have the question of what to do when you have observations that are "nested" in other groups, and where some variables are at a different "level" than others. So in this case you have students who are nested in schools, and some variables (like gender, or graduation) refer the characteristics of students while other variables (like school size, public/private) refer to characteristics of the school, so that every student who went to school #345 will have identical values for those variables. As you allude to this messes with the assumption that observations are independent which is common to "single level" version of ALL types of regression analysis, including logit, OLS, tobit etc. Making whatever type of model you are running a "multilevel" model is one particular way to deal with this issue, although there are actually a bunch of different kinds of multilevel models. In this case what the student was probably proposing is a model that allows the intercept term to vary randomly (that is, according to a normal curve) at the school level - what's called a random intercept model. This sort of approach can work on an OLS or a logit model, although the implementation is a bit different in each case. However, there is one feature of this approach that may be problematic, and might be the source of your confusion. In a multilevel model you don't actually ANALYZE the effect of being in one "group" (school in this case) vs the other. The model assumes that, in general, school level intercepts vary randomly around an overall intercept and just estimates the variance of that normal curve using the data available. So it won't actually tell you if students at school A are more likely to graduate at school B, because it's not thinking about school as a variable but as another unit of analysis (like people). You can, however, use a method called empirical bayes estimation to try and figure out which schools do better or worse, based on the model you just ran. An alternative to a multilevel model would be a "fixed effects" model that just includes a dummy variable for each school. This model treats school like a variable and it will tell you how each school does in comparison to some reference school (although for various reasons the empirical bayes approach I discussed above might be better for this question). But a fixed effects model might end up with big standard errors, and it won't allow you to include school level variables (like school size) that might tell you WHY some schools do better than others. So to answer the question "what type of model should I use" you need to answer two separate questions: How is the dependent variable measured? If it's binary, use a logit model. If it's continuous use OLS. If it's something else...use another type of model (ologit, tobit, negative binomial etc) How are you going to deal with the fact that students are nested in schools? if you want to treat "school" like a variable, you can use a fixed effects model. If you want to include school level variables in the model, then you might explore a random intercept model.
