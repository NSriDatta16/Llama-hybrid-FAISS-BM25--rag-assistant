It is, but you're being confused by the extra unmentioned assumption: conditional independence of the past observations and the current observation given the current state. Your slides do not bother to draw the state space model diagram for the state space time series models they're interested in. This is unfortunate because you can read off this relationship directly. To make it look like your first version of Bayes theorem, rewrite $P(z_t | x_t)$ to condition also on $z_{1\ldots t-1}$ as everything else does. That should look more familiar. Now notice that the conditional independence assertion above means that once you condition on $x_t$, $z_t$ no longer actually depends on its past, the part you just added in. So you can take it back out.
