If you need only the k top items and you never need to look a the others, you can use a simple linked list or array storing only the current top k items, plus a number (the worst score of the elements in the list). In the Add() operation you simply compare the item with the worst value in the list and, if better, you swap the current worst with the added item. This takes O(k) time in the worst case for insertion because you need to find the element that has currently the worst score. The the average case, however, is O(1) , since, as you add better elements to the list, the probability of having to do a swap tends to 0 (that is, you're not actually adding any items). So if you generate elements at random, your performance is likely to be very good. Even if you generate ordered items (worst case), it might be fast enough for your value of k .
