They altered the way that they're displayed in MVC 3 RC. For example previously you would just scroll to: Project.Data.Models.User Now it's organized in reverse User (Project.Data.Models) This is most likely your problem. What would be nice is if they had a filter to show only local objects rather than all referenced assemblies
