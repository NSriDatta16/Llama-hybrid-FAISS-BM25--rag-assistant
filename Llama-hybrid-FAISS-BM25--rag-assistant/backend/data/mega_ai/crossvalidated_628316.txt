You can use a likelihood ratio test to investigate the statistical significance of factor A . In particular, Model1 Likewise, for the second model, you could use Model2 These would test the hypothesis of no difference in the average outcome B among the A factor levels in the second model after including/controlling for C and D . If you have a small sample, it would be best to use F-test with appropriate denominator degrees of freedom (e.g., using the lmerTest package). As noted in the comments, if you want to assess if the effect of A on the outcome B is different for the different levels of C and D , then you would need to include the corresponding interaction terms.
