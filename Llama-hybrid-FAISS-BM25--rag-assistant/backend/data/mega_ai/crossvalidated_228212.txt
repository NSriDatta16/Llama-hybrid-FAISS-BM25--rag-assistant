It simply is probability , you can call it "predicted" as suggested by others. I see from the discussion that you disagree with such name, so let me proove you that this is probability. First, recall that if $X$ is a Bernoulli distributed random variable parametrized by $p$, then $E(X) = p$ . Second, take an intercept-only logistic regression model, such model will calculate mean of your predicted $Y$ variable. This would be the same as if you calculated it simply taking $\hat y_i = (1/N) \sum_{i=1}^N y_i$. This mean would converge to expected value as $N\rightarrow\infty$, i.e. to $E(Y)= p$. In fact, sample mean is a maximum likelihood estimator of $p$ for Bernoulli distributed random variable. In case of more complicated logistic regression model you predict conditional means , i.e. conditional probabilities. Check also Why isn't Logistic Regression called Logistic Classification? If this still does not convince you, below you can see simple R example showing exactly that case: set.seed(123) p1
