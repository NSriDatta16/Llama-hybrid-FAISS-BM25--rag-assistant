One of the best is Cosma Shalizi's Advanced Data Analysis from an Elementary Point of View available for free download here ... http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~cshalizi/ADAfaEPoV/ It's eventually going to see the light of day as a published book. He pretty much covers the waterfront in terms of modern advanced analytic techniques that extend the classic multivariate framework. A great reference for the classic techniques is Dillon and Goldstein's Multivariate Analysis: Methods and Applications which was published in 1984 but has the advantages of being highly readable as well as applied. It's a great book. Of course, Hastie and Tibshirani are largely responsible for propagating the panoply of post-modern, advanced analytic techniques via a whole series of roving workshops back in the 90s. Their book is available for free download here ... https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/local.ftp/Springer/ISLR_print1.pdf There are many more references worth obtaining: Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies Max Kuhn's Applied Predictive Modeling Of course, Kuhn developed the caret package in R. Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models is a great introduction to Bayesian modeling techniques and it's very hands-on. Leskovec and Rajaraman's Mining of Massive Datasets introduces some terrific techniques for machine learning analysis of truly massive data. There's a ton more stuff worth digging into. This should keep you busy this summer though.
