FileDrop is standard, covered by the DataFormats class. Shell IDList and FileName/W are common for Windows Explorer. The rest of them are all custom. By their names, it sounds like they enhance the D+D feedback when you drag to other Microsoft apps, like Media Player. This stuff is poorly documented, possibly intentional.
