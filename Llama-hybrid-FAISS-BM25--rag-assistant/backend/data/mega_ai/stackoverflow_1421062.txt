jQuery - Load/Inject a remote pages DIV and jQuery Script

The Scenario Using jQuery, I have a page that has a popup overlay containing locations marked using Google Maps. The overlay works using 2 pages setup as follows: The main page opens an overlay via a text link to a map. The complete map page is then loaded into the overlay. The map page itself contains Google's API and initialization code to load the correct map. As they are, the overlay and map work fine providing I load the whole map page. The Problem My problem is, I don't want to load the complete page, I want to load just the particular div holding the map. I'm using jQuerys Ajax "load" function, (as follows) to load the complete map page. wrap.load(this.attr("href")) If I try to change this to load a particular DIV (as follows), the pages DIV content is loaded correctly, except the Google API is not loaded, meaning the map does not display. wrap.load(this.attr("href")+" #map_wrap") I have tried including Googles API and initialization code on the first main page that opens the overlay, however, this still doesn't work. I've also tried embedding the code within the loaded DIV, again, no luck. The Question Is there a way to load the map pages API script along with the DIV?
