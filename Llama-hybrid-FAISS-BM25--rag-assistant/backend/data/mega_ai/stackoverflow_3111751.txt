I'm not sure what your timeframe is with this, but I would probably make the suggestion to spend a little time in Subversion before jumping right into a SVN + Magento project. I was in your same shoes about 1.5 years ago and found that even on a clean install, there are hundreds of thousands of files in a Magento project. Then once you start testing loacally Magento creates even more cache, temp, and report (exception log) files which clog things up well. I found this nice list of files to svn:ignore Just doing that will save you hours of wait time when you're in your final stretch of the project. Over time, I've realized that a more portable solution (and better for upgrades) is to NOT have Magento itself in your repo. Now I only put modules, themes/interfaces, and assets in the repository. This makes installs/upgrades/migrations easy because I just download the latest Mage and unpack into Document Root and symlink my modules into the proper locations in the Mage install.
