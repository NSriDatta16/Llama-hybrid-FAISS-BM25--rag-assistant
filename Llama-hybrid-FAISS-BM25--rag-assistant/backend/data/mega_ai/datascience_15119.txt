Practical use of oop in R

R supports a wide range of OOP designs like s3,s4,RC and others via packages,and it's a bit overwhelming to decide on which to use and a more basic question that I have is when and where do you use OOP while doing machine learning or data analytics ,can someone answer this from a data scientist/ML practitioner point of view . I'm aware of how OOP works in R at a superficial level ,but should I invest time in learning OOP in R ? how practical is it from a data science point of view ?
