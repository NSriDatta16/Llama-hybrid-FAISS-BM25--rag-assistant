Is it possible to calculate the power from a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a ordinal outcomes, when you have only odd ratios, n and alp

I want to calculate the power of a mixed-effects logistic regression model with a ordinal outcomes from a study I want to replicate. I have alpha, the n and odd's ratio. Do anyone know r-package for this? I use to use 'clmm' but they do not have any power analyses. Thank you for any idea.
