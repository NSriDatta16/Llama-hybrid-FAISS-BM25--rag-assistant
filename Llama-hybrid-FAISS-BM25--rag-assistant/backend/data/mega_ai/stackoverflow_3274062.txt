Help clarify my thinking for rails associations

I'm building a rails app that allows athletes to create and manage timesheets for the sport of skeleton. I can't seem to wrap my brain around the correct associations between my models. Here's what I have so far. Athletes have Runs , which are composed of several Splits . Each individual split should be associated with a particular timing Eye on a bobsled/skeleton Track . A collection of runs on a particular date, at a particular track, and on a particular Circuit are organized into a Timesheet . An Athlete creates a timesheet, adds runs and splits to the timesheet, and then has the ability to view and graph the runs on the timesheet. Whew. Here's some code: class Athlete :runs end class Run :runs belongs_to :track belongs_to :circuit end class Split It seems like I make some unnecessary associations here. My biggest frustration has been associating splits with both timing eyes and tracks in the timesheet view table. Table headers are timing eyes that where turned on that day (not every timing eye is turned on every day) while table cells are the actual split times (sometimes, a timing eye misses a particular split for an athlete during a run). Do you see any place where improvements could be made to these associations?
