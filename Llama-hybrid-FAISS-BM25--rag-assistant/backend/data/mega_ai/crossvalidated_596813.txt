Logistic regression will not "state that all future patients do not have the disease". Logistic regression yields probabilistic predictions, i.e., probabilities that a patient has the disease. In the case of a rare disease, this probability may be extremely low (for a patient that is essentially healthy - no need for action), or very low (better to run another non-invasive test), or "merely" low. If the disease in question is rare but dangerous, it may make sense to run an invasive test, e.g., taking biopsies, even if the predicted probability your logistic regression yields is only $\hat{p}=0.2$ . You need to adapt your decision thresholds (possibly multiple ones, as here!) to the costs of decisions. Thus, while a "zero-inflated logistic regression" could in principle make sense (e.g., in the case where we suspect two data generating processes to be at work, one of which always yields a zero), that does not seem to be the case here. Logistic regression can deal quite well with rare instances of the target variable. If all goes well, it will simply output low probabilities. If these are well-calibrated, this is precisely what should happen. And no, oversampling (or weighting, which is essentially the same as oversampling) won't address a non-problem .
