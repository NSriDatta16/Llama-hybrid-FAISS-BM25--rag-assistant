Selecting Correct Statistical Methodology

I am designing a predictive model, and I am unsure of how to group the data from individuals companies, or whether I even need to group that data, and it's valid to treat each row as an independent event. The data will roughly be as given below. The values given are about what will be expected. 80 companies are surveyed. Trait_1 to Trait_4 are integers, will have a minimum value of zero, a mean of 2, and a standard deviation of 1.5, and the max observed value is 6. The trait can be accurately measured, and is not subjective. It is assumed that when Trait_1 to Trait_4 are higher, Project success will be more likely. It is expected that different Traits will be more important than others. There will be a different number of qualifying projects data from each company (from 2 to 16, with an average of 6). Project Success in Boolean. 30% of projects are successful. Project # is sequential by company. Company Name Project # Trait_1 Trait_2 Trait_3 Trait_4 Project Success ABC 1 0 2 3 1 False ABC 2 1 2 1 4 True ... XYZ 1 2 4 2 1 True I want to create a model which predicts Project Success, based on the traits (and maybe the company name). What is the correct way to model this? Should I treat the company name as an independent variable, and directly model the data as shown? (Different companies will probably have different success rates.) Should I apply some methodology to group an individual company's data into one row - and if so, what methodology? I think logistic regression is a good choice here, I'm just not sure how and whether I should group the individual companies.
