I wanted to add a comment but due to my reputation I can only post an answer... @erre4 your example seems to contradict the github example you quoted: Your example: sequence length of an instance divided by the batch size Github example: total number of instances is divided by the batch size The github example agrees with what I thought was the case, which is that batching does not alter the window size of a time series, or the number of features. Please clarify, thank you.
