C++ macro - capitalize string

I'm using preprocessor macros to declare some repetitive variables, specifically: QuitCallbackType quitCallback; LossCallbackType lossCallback; PauseCallbackType pauseCallback; KeyCallbackType keyCallback; MouseCallbackType mouseCallback; I'd like to use a preprocessor macro to do it, a la CREATE_CALLBACK_STORAGE(quit) CREATE_CALLBACK_STORAGE(loss) CREATE_CALLBACK_STORAGE(pause) CREATE_CALLBACK_STORAGE(key) CREATE_CALLBACK_STORAGE(mouse) where it would essentially be like this: #define CREATE_CALLBACK_STORAGE(x) capitalize(x)##CallbackType x##CallBack; Is there a way to do this, so that I don't have to pass in both the capitalized AND lowercase versions of each name? I realize it's not much less typing to use macros, but the problem itself began intriguing me.
