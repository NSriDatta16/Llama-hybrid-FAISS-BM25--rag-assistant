How do I read the cord_19_embeddings_2020-07-16.csv from the COVID-19 Open Research Dataset Challenge (CORD-19) on Kaggle?

What I'm trying to do I wanted to use the CORD19 word embeddings csv to map them to certain findings from the rest of the dataset, but as we can see there are no stings in the first column. The way I know word or sentence embeddings, is what they map a word or a sentence to multiple vectors. The values in the first column look somewhat like hashes, and they are the main problem I can't use the dataset. Can somebody give me a pointer on what I'm looking at and how to use them? I have not found documentation, usage examples or submissions on kaggle that have explained or outlined how this file is supposed to be used.
