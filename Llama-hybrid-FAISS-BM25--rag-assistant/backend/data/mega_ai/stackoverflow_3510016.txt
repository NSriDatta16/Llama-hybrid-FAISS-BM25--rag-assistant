Wanted: Directions/ideas for a custom tree-to-tree drag'n'drop implementation in ExtJS

I need some combined functionality regarding drag'n'drop between two trees in ExtJS . The first required feature is very simple and is just the builtin drag'n'drop features isolated to a single tree only. The second required feature is that I wan't the user to be able to drag a node from the left tree and drop it at any node in the right tree . The action should not remove the node from the left tree , thus creating the possibility of dragging the same node from the left tree to multiple places in the right tree . My question is: Which approach should I take to combine these two functionalities, utilizing the existing possibilities in the TreePanel object without inventing the wheel again? I am not looking for a complete solution (it would be nice though ;-) ), but rather how to handle drag/drop-zones, events and so on.
