Welcome to CV. You wrote I know that the average cost of production is LOWER in Region A, so it makes sense to me that b3 is negative. This is not what an interaction means. The interaction means that the relationship between cost and price is different in the two regions. Since you are getting a negative parameter estimate for the interaction and a positive estimate for cost of materials, it means that the relationship between cost of materials and price is weaker in region A than in region B. It also means that the relationship between region and price is weaker at higher costs. My issue now arises when I want to estimate the effect of selling in region A, everything else equal. When there is an interaction, the effect of region is different at different prices. So, this question has no general answer. A good way of getting a sense of this is to plug in a few sets of reasonable numbers for cost and then doing the calculation. You can also make a graph of the results. If you put cost on the x axis and price on the y axis, you can make a line for region A and another line for region B. These will not be parallel (that's another way of saying there is an interaction).
