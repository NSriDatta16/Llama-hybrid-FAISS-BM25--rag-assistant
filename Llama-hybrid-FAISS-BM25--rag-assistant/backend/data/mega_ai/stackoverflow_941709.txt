SoapClient save request to file instead of sending it

Is there a way to save the soap request SoapClient sends when calling __soapCall to a file instead of sending it to the actual server? I'm trying to save the soap requests to a queue and then send them over a period of time (the requests will be very different). I'm using Zend_Soap.
