I solved this by having my check-svnversion rule delete svnversion.o to force it to be recompiled if needed. This isn't exactly elegant, but it works; it looks similar to the autotools solution described in CesarB's answer . ../shared/svnversion.h: check-svnversion check-svnversion: ../shared/update-svnversion-h.pl @#Force recreation of svnversion.o. Otherwise, make won't notice that @#svnversion.h has changed until the next time it's invoked. @if [ ../shared/svnversion.h -nt shared/svnversion.o ] ; then rm shared/svnversion.o ; fi shared/svnversion.o: ../shared/svnversion.h .PHONY: check-svnversion
