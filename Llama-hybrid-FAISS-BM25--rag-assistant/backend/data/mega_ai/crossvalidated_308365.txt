Following discussion with my son, this is his answer: The expected value for the number of goes to complete ten steps, E(10) is Sum (1/r) with r running from 1 to 10. For n steps (n-1 stones in the river, one extra step to get onto the bank) the answer is Sum (1/r) with r running from 1 to n. This leads to a simple recurrence relation: E(n) = E(n-1) + 1/n. Method: If the first go is ten steps, then the expected value is 1. If the first go is nine steps, the expected value is 2. If the first go is eight steps, then the expected value is 2 1/2, because on the second go we either finish or take one step and join the pattern that follows from a first go of nine steps. If the first go is seven steps the expected value is 2 5/6, because on the second go we either finish or join the pattern that follows from eight or nine on the first go, so we average over those three values: 2, 3 1/2, 3 = 2 5/6. And on we go through all the possible first steps. At the end we average over the ten possible first steps, which were all equally likely. This is how he first did it, then he pattern spotted a formula for the case of n which simplified to Sum (1/r), r running from 1 to n. However, there is a more direct approach, which he later found. In the above description, when we move down from, say, landing on eight first go to landing on seven first go, we then add in, at the next stage, a 1/3 chance of landing on 8 next go, and thus drawing in the pattern starting at 8 again, but now with a further 1/3 contribution to the overall sum. Similarly, when we land on six first go, the pattern starting on eight provides a further 1/4 contribution to the overall sum. With this way of thinking still in mind, consider more directly landing on 10, finishing. The expected value for the number of goes to achieve this is a sum that accumulates exactly as Sum (1/r) r running from 1 to 10. Why? Because it gets 1 from ten steps in one go, 1/2 from landing on 9 first, 1/3 from 8 first, 1/4 from 7 first etc. If we calculate this we get the exact same answer (2.92....) as provided by Stephan.
