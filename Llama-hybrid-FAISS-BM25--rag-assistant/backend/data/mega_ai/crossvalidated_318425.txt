Deep Neural Network using mixture of image and non image data

I have rectangular bounding boxes for an object in an image, and 3-point vector of relative distances (x,y,z) of the object w.r.t camera, and 3-point vector indicating the pose of the object. I want to take the cropped patch (from bounding boxes) and resize them to 224 X 224 and pass it through to some standard networks like resnet (training from scratch) to estimate pose. Now, I think results can be improved if I use the distances and the aspect ratio (from bounding box coordinates) as input too. How do I go about doing that?
