Correct syntax for SQL UPDATE where value to be set is a SELECT

Can someone set me straight on the correct syntax for this statement? I am trying to update a new field in table rounds with an average of a field in table holes where rounds.id is stored as a foreign key. UPDATE `rounds` SET drivingDistance_avg_per_hole = SELECT SUM(holes.drivingDistance)/COUNT(holes.drivingDistance) as avg FROM `holes`, `rounds` WHERE holes.drivingDistance != '' AND holes.round = rounds.id Sure would appreciate the lesson!
