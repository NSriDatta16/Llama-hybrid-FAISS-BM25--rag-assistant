For me this would be ideal - public static String ellipsis(final String text, int length) { return text.substring(0, length - 3) + "..."; } I would not worry about the size of every character unless I really know where and in what font it is going to be displayed. Many fonts are fixed width fonts where every character has same dimension. Even if its a variable width font, and if you count 'i', 'l' to take half the width, then why not count 'w' 'm' to take double the width? A mix of such characters in a string will generally average out the effect of their size, and I would prefer ignoring such details. Choosing the value of 'length' wisely would matter the most.
