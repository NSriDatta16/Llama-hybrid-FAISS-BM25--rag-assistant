It is not a fix for the filter problem, but a workaround that works on IE7 and Firefox without needing conditional stylesheet and getting the same effect. I used a separated div for my backgound color and my content. For some reason, I had to put the background after the content, otherwise the transparency was still inherit and the image was cropped. I used the z-index to show elements in the proper order. I kept the main div bottompub mainly to keep thing organized and have a distinct id for all elements in that section. CSS: #bottompub { position:fixed; bottom:0px; left:0px; width:100%; height:50px; margin:0; padding:0; } #bottompub .background { position:fixed; bottom:0px; left:0px; width:100%; height:50px; background-color:#89BAE4; opacity: .80; filter: alpha(opacity="80"); z-index: 50; } #bottompub .insidebottompub { position:relative; width:1031px; margin-left:auto; margin-right: auto; z-index: 100; } #bottompub .pubimage { position:relative; float:left; left:220px; top:-25px; } HTML
