Behaviour is the same when a window finishes flashing for as long as it's supposed to: the taskbar button stays coloured. I don't think this is a bug. If you think about it, when you use FLASHW_STOP , the flashing does in fact stop, but the point of the flashing is to get the user's attention. The button stays coloured because the user still may not have looked down and discovered which window was trying to get her attention. Keeping the button coloured keeps that information available.
