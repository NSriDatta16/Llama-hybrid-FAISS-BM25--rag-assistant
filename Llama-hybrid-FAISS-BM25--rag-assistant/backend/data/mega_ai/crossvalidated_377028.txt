This looks like a stratified contingency table. I'm assuming here that Meds is an ordinal variable and that the column names are the outcome (e.g. Died or Lived). You haven't told us what difference you want to evaluate. Between population differences? Between medication type differences? Depending on the complexity of the hypothesis you are evaluating, you can perform a logistic regression. Here is some sample R code: library(tidyverse) #Population 1 x = as.table(matrix(c(42,58,44,59,50,47), nrow = 3)) rownames(x) = c(0,1,2) colnames(x) = c(0,1) dimnames(x) = list(Meds = c(0,1,2) ,Outcome = c(0,1)) x = as.data.frame.table(x) %>% mutate(Population = 1) #Population 2 y = as.table(matrix(c(40,64,52,61,44,39), nrow = 3)) rownames(y) = c(0,1,2) colnames(y) = c(0,1) dimnames(y) = list(Meds = c(0,1,2) ,Outcome = c(0,1)) y = as.data.frame.table(y) %>% mutate(Population = 2) data = x %>% bind_rows(y) %>% as.tibble() %>% mutate(Population = factor(Population)) mod = glm(Outcome ~ Meds + Population, data = data, family = binomial(), weights = Freq) summary(mod) The variables in the model explain some of the variability observed in the data (this is evaluated by a deviance goodness of fit test), but a lot of residual variability remains. Again, the appropriateness of this approach depends on what hypothesis you are evaluating
