a.h and b.h will be part of precompiled header, and there is no need to include them later. All you need is to include stdafx.h where a.h or b.h are required. If you'll include a.h or b.h explicitly after stdafx.h (all code before stdafx.h include are ignored), then it'll not be compiled second time (just because they are usually protected by #pragma once directive or defines), but compiler will open that file on hard disk if you are asking about it, By the way, you should know, that you could use several precompiled header files (but no more than one in every cpp file).
