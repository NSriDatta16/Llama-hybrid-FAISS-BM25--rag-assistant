Not a complete answer from my side, but adding my 2 cents to Question 3: What happens if you change Noise to another type of distribution? Essentially you get a Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN) (Mirza & Osindero, 2014). CGAN's have been used in many applications including image super-resolution (which seems to be the case of the paper you might have referenced regarding astronomical image data), as well as image-to-image translation (Isola et. al. 2016). Superpixel resolution could be seen as a specific case of Image-to-Image translation; other applications include dense semantic labeling and image colorization.
