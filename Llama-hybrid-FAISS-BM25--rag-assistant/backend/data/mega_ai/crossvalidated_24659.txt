Least stupid way to forecast a short multivariate time series

I need to forecast the following 4 variables for the 29th unit of time. I have roughly 2 years worth of historical data, where 1 and 14 and 27 are all the same period (or time of year). In the end, I am doing a Oaxaca-Blinder style decomposition on $W$, $wd$, $wc$, and $p$. time W wd wc p 1 4.920725 4.684342 4.065288 .5962985 2 4.956172 4.73998 4.092179 .6151785 3 4.85532 4.725982 4.002519 .6028712 4 4.754887 4.674568 3.988028 .5943888 5 4.862039 4.758899 4.045568 .5925704 6 5.039032 4.791101 4.071131 .590314 7 4.612594 4.656253 4.136271 .529247 8 4.722339 4.631588 3.994956 .5801989 9 4.679251 4.647347 3.954906 .5832723 10 4.736177 4.679152 3.974465 .5843731 11 4.738954 4.759482 4.037036 .5868722 12 4.571325 4.707446 4.110281 .556147 13 4.883891 4.750031 4.168203 .602057 14 4.652408 4.703114 4.042872 .6059471 15 4.677363 4.744875 4.232081 .5672519 16 4.695732 4.614248 3.998735 .5838578 17 4.633575 4.6025 3.943488 .5914644 18 4.61025 4.67733 4.066427 .548952 19 4.678374 4.741046 4.060458 .5416393 20 4.48309 4.609238 4.000201 .5372143 21 4.477549 4.583907 3.94821 .5515663 22 4.555191 4.627404 3.93675 .5542806 23 4.508585 4.595927 3.881685 .5572687 24 4.467037 4.619762 3.909551 .5645944 25 4.326283 4.544351 3.877583 .5738906 26 4.672741 4.599463 3.953772 .5769604 27 4.53551 4.506167 3.808779 .5831352 28 4.528004 4.622972 3.90481 .5968299 I believe that $W$ can be approximated by $p\cdot wd + (1 - p)\cdot wc$ plus measurement error, but you can see that $W$ always considerably exceeds that quantity because of waste, approximation error, or theft. Here are my 2 questions. My first thought was to try vector autoregression on these variables with 1 lag and an exogenous time and period variable, but that seems like a bad idea given how little data I have. Are there any time-series methods that (1) perform better in the face of "micro-numerosity" and (2) would be able to exploit the link between the variables? On the other hand, the moduli of the eigenvalues for the VAR are all less than 1, so I don't think I need to worry about non-stationarity (though the Dickey-Fuller test suggest otherwise). The predictions seem mostly in line with projections from a flexible univariate model with a time trend, except for $W$ and $p$, which are lower. The coefficients on the lags seem mostly reasonable, though they are insignificant for the most part. The linear trend coefficient is significant, as are some of the period dummies. Still, are there any theoretical reasons to prefer this simpler approach over the VAR model? Full disclosure: I asked a similar question on Statalist with no response.
