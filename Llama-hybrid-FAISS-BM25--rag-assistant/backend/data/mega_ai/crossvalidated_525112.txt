What are `rms::orm`, `wilcox.test`, and `kruskal.test` (in R) doing differently?

Much like the two-sample (equal variance, not Welch) t-test is a special case of ANOVA, and ANOVA is a special case of linear regression, the Wilcoxon Mann-Whitney U test is a special case of Kruskal-Wallis, and Kruskal-Wallis is a special case of proportional odds logistic regression. Let's simulate that claim about Wilcoxon, KW, and proportional odds logit. library(rms) library(MASS) set.seed(2021) N $stats[7] # There are two p-values in the output p3[i] stats[9] # There are two p-values in the output p4[i] Au contraire! While the differences in p-values are small, they are not small enough for me to attribute them to floating point arithmetic. What is going on? For instance, is the equivalence only asymptotic?
