Coding the likelihood function for logistic regression

I would appreciate help in understanding if I made a correct interpretation and coding of the likelihood function for logistic regression. Background : For a task I am going to write a function in R of the likelihood function for a logistic regression model. It has been given that $p(x_i)=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-x_i\beta)}$ where $\beta=(\beta_1,...,\beta_k)$ and $x_i=(x_{i,1},...,x_{i,k})$ and that the design matrix $\mathbf{x}$ is an $N \times k$ matrix. My understanding : I did some research and found that the likelihood function for a logistic regression is given by $L(\beta)=\prod p_i(\beta)^{y_i}(1-p_i(\beta))^{1-y_i}$ so I wrote the following code for this formula: L I first retrieved all p the values ​​from the rows in the matrix X with the help of a for loop, and saved these in p . This allowed me to then insert all the vectors into the likelihood function given above. Observe that $\mathbf{y}=(y_1,...,y_N)^T$ and that $\mathbf{p}=(p_1,...,p_N)^T.$ Question : I have no way to check if my function is correct, and have based my code for likelihood in logistic regression from the course literature, so I would really appreciate help with whether my interpretation is correct. Is it true that a logistic regression has the given likelihood function? And is my code a correct way to implement this?
