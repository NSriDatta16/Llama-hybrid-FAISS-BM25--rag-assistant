About indexes, MySQL stores the data within the index which makes them huge. Postgres doesn't. This means that the storage size of a b-tree index in Postgres doesn't depend on the number of the column it spans or which data type the column has. Postgres also supports partial indexes (e.g. WHERE status=0) which is a very powerful feature to prevent building indexes over millions of rows when only a few hundred is needed. Since you're going to put a lot of data in Postgres you will probably find it practical to be able to create indexes without locking the table. Sent from my iPhone.
