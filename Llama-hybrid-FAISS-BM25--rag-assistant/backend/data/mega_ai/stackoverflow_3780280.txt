My iPhone app crashes after returning from background. Cause: UIImage problem

First off, I want to say this site is AWESOME! and it helped me do lots of stuff while creating my iPhone app. Now, my problem is: When I launch my app, I have a UIImageView that loads an image depending on an if/else statements in -(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event method. These images are assigned as follows: BG.image = someImage; of course, BG is the UIImageView, and someImage is an iVar with @property, @synthesis. someImage is initialized with an image from the main bundle in viewDidLoad: - (void)viewDidLoad { //init stuff from file someImage = [UIImage imageNamed:@"FirstViewBG_5N.png"]; [super viewDidLoad];} My app runs happily, loading images according to touchBegan (as mentioned), BUT! When my app is sent to background and comes back, it crashes upon first touch. When I replaced: BG.image = someImage with: BG.image = [UIImage imageNamed:@"FirstViewBG_5N.png"]; it runs happily?! I think the someImage is flushed or corrupts? I don't want to leave it like this because imageNamed method reads from disk every time, which will cause performance problems, i think? I think my question is clear? It is that: 1- Why will my app crash after returning from backgroud 2- How do I solve this? All your help is appreciated! Thanks!
