The choice of analysis to be performed depends on your goals. Any choice is relevant if it is justified in your hypotheses and driven theoretically. If you have a specific hypothesis on this particular city (i.e., reasons to expect, before viewing your data, that the average score of subjects in the city A differs from the average score of subjects in other cities - all together), you can perform an independent samples t-test to test whether the difference is significant. If you don't have specific hypotheses on this particular city before viewing the data, I find it more logical to test whether the samples of the different cities are from the same population, and thus perform an ANOVA with post-hoc tests, hoping that the number of cities is not too large (the larger the number of groups to compare, the greater is the chance of incorrect inference). In both cases, a first step would be to make a boxplot of the distribution of the score according to the city, to see what is going on.
