Pro ASP.net MVC Framework sample code not working

This is from a very good book by Steven Sanderson I am trying to follow the chapter 4 and trying to setup IOC on my mvc code from the code sample of the book but its not working. I follow the code from page 97 to page 101 where I set up Inversion of Control and run the code but I get the following error. A dialog box opens trying to search the following file: c:\TeamCity\buildAgent\work\1ab5e0b25b145b19\src\Castle.Windsor\Windsor\WindsorContainer.cs It seems like controllertype is null in the following line of code: protected override IController GetControllerInstance( System.Web.Routing.RequestContext requestContext, Type controllerType) { return (IController)container.Resolve(controllerType); } The exception happens at the above return statement saying " {"Value cannot be null.\r\nParameter name: service"}" This happens to be in WindsorContainerFactory. Routes looks as follows: public class MvcApplication : System.Web.HttpApplication { public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes) { routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}"); routes.MapRoute( "Default", // Route name "{controller}/{action}/{id}", // URL with parameters new { controller = "Products", action = "List", id = ""} // Parameter defaults ); } protected void Application_Start() { RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes); ControllerBuilder.Current.SetControllerFactory(new WindsorControllerFactory()); } } Please help.. Thanks..
