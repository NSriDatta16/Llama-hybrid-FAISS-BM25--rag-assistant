What is the way to modify a neural network classifier to deal with sample points from outside of the label set?

I am solving an image classification problem. However some photos may not belong to any category, and I'd like not to give any fake information, rather to capture this situation. What are the ways to do it. One idea I have in mind is to give an extra category "OTHER" but then I need to have some data for this category which would be difficult to gather as it's too general.
