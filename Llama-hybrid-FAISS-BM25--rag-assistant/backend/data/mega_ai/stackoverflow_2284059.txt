SVM Classification - minimum number of input sets for each class

I'm trying to build an app to detect images which are advertisements from the webpages. Once I detect those I`ll not be allowing those to be displayed on the client side. From the help that I got on this Stackoverflow question , I thought SVM is the best approach to my aim. So, I have coded SVM and an SMO myself. The dataset which I have got from UCI data repository has 3280 instances ( Link to Dataset ) where around 400 of them are from class representing Advertisement images and rest of them representing non-advertisement images. Right now I'm taking the first 2800 input sets and training the SVM. But after looking at the accuracy rate I realised that most of those 2800 input sets are from non-advertisement image class. So I`m getting very good accuracy for that class. So what can I do here? About how many input set shall I give to SVM to train and how many of them for each class? Thanks. Cheers. ( Basically made a new question because the context was different from my previous question. Optimization of Neural Network input data ) Thanks for the reply. I want to check whether I`m deriving the C values for ad and non-ad class correctly or not. Please give me feedback on this. Or you u can see the doc version here . You can see graph of y1 eqaul to y2 here and y1 not equal to y2 here
