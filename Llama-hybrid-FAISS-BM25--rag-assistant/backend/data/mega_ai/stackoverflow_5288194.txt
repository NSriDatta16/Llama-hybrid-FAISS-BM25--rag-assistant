.NET Library for Google Maps API support

I'm looking for a .NET library or wrapper for Google Maps, that contains all the types of responses as C# classes. I want to be able to do something like: var url = "http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=Wellington&sensor=false"; //Utility functions would be ideal string jsonResponse = GoogleMaps.GetJson(url); string jsonResponse = GoogleMaps.GeocodeAddress("Wellington"); I would like to be able to use the results like: GeocodeResponse r = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject (jsonResponse); //I am using Json.NET if(r.status.Equals("OK")) { DoSomethingWith(r.result.formatted_address); //intellisense documentation for all the bits in the result would be great } Does such a thing exist? This is sort of like these questions: which is the best .net library for google maps api? Best .NET Wrapper for Google Maps or Yahoo Maps? However the answers there are not what I am meaning, I'm not looking for a drag and drop map control.
