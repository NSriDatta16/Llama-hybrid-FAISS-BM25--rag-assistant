Standardisation with respect to controls

When performing analyses using polygenic risk scores (PRS), Why is it important to standardise/normalise PRSes using mean and sd derived from control samples, before performing analyses, such as logistic regression? How would results change if we simply normalised the entire dataset (viz. wrt entire sample's mean and SD)? In the PRSice software there is the option to standardize the effect size using mean and sd derived from control samples before calculating the PRS, even. When is this beneficial? How does it compare with standardising the PRS wrt controls afterwards? I presume in usual survival analyses, we would only standardisecovariate values wrt the entire sampl, otherwise we would be using future information (i.e. whether they have an event in the followup)? Thank you!
