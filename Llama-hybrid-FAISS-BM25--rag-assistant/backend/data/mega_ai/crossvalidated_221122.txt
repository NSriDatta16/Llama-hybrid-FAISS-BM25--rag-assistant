You could use both Markov chains/hidden Markov models and recurrent neural networks to predict future values in such time series. As you explicitly ask for state of the art models: some newer and more advanced forms of recurrent neural nets, like a long-short-term-memory net might be interesting to you. Be aware that a) those tend to need huge computation power and b) (though this is undergoing a strong change at the moment) there are still no/very few ready-to-use-out-of-the-box implementations of such models. Most evolved from research prototypes that have been made available to the public. Take a look at e.g. Keras , or http://lstm.iupr.com/ or http://deeplearning4j.org/lstm.html for hints on other open source implementations.
