WPF MVVM: View information in the model

Let's assume I have dragable nodes in an WPF MVVM application. I need to load and save the position of a node as well as its logic. The simplest approach would be to save the position along with the logic in one xml file through a repository. However, that would mean I have view information in the model and view model. Is there a best practice approach regarding this scenario, maybe one that I have not considered so far?
