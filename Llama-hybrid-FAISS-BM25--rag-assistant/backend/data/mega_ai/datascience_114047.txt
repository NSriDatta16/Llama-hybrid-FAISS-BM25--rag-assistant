From sklearns random forest documentation : random_state int, RandomState instance or None, default=None Controls both the randomness of the bootstrapping of the samples used when building trees (if bootstrap=True ) and the sampling of the features to consider when looking for the best split at each node (if max_features ). See Glossary for details. Each time you re-run this with random_state = None it runs different models. Set random_state to 0 (or any number) and see consistent results.
