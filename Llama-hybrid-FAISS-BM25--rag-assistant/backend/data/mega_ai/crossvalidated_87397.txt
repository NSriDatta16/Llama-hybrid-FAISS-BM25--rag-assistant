Logistic regression models the probability of a binary response. We use some sigmoidal function to predict a value that lies between 0 and 1. The logit function is just one popular link function. Why? It goes between zero and one. Probit is another link function. $\Phi(X\beta)$ uses the cumulative distribution function of a normal to do the same job as logit. AUC is another function(al?) that goes between zero and one. You could also look at it as a variable between 0 and 1 that is to be predicted. Having had a look at the paper you mentioned I think they are using logistic regression to model the AUC, e.g. from the following quote: When the logit link is used, exponentiated parameters have interpretations as AUC odds, where AUC odds are defined as [...]
