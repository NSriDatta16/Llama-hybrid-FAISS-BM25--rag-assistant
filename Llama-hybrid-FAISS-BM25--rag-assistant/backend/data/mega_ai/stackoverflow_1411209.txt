Automatic proportionate resizing of Windows Form Components?

I have a Windows Forms form in C#. It is just like a regular Windows GUI application. However I am facing problems making the different components on the form resize themselves according to the window size. I mean I do not exactly know which property of the component is to be changed. I have a tabPage in the form. The tabPage contains a splitcontainer which has 2 panels in it. The left panel contains a treeView and the right panel has components like radio buttons, textboxes, comboBox and buttons,etc When I run my application and resize the window (either by dragging a corner of the window or by hitting the maximize button on top right corner) the Windows Forms form and the tabPage expand but the split container doesn't. It stays where it was. Also I want to anchor the split container so that if I shrink my window, the split cointainer still remain on top left. I am sorry I cannot put screenshots here.
