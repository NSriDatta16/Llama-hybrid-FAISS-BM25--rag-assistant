Odd behaviour in web page when page uses 'localhost' vs machine's name

I have a web page which I am developing where I can drag divs on the page. It works fine in all the browsers except IE6 & IE7 where when I drag a div the div shows beneath the dropped on div instead of on top of it. This is not the problem at hand per se. I know IE6 & IE7 have issues with z-index settings. This is a complicated page with different divs have different z-index values. The page works fine in IE8 IF the url on my machine uses 'localhost'. If I switch the url to use my machine's name, the page exhibits the behavior where the div shows beneath the other div as explained earlier. I don't know why this is happening when it's the same machine, the same page coming from the same file. The only variable is the url for domain name place. I am supporting IE8 only as its the standard at the company. If I use the machine ip address the page works. In short, if I use localhost or ip address it works fine. If I use my machine's name it misbehaves. I cleared IE8's cache and rebooted the machine. The page exists only on my machine because I am creating it so there's no chance it's coming from anywhere else. I can't think of why this is happening. IE8 is behaving differently for the same page when the server name is different in the url. Any hints?
