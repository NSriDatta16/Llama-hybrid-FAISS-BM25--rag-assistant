How to implement multiple fragments in single Activity

I am trying to implement 2 fragments in a single activity, one beside other. The problem here is when I click an item in Fragment1, fragment should be updated in the same place where it is placed previous. But when I click an item in Fragment1, fragment is displayed over Fragment1. How can I sort out this issue?
