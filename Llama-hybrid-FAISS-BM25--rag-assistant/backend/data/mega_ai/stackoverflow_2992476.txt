jQuery + ajax livesearch

I am doing a mysql database search and retrieving some results via ajax livesearch using the example on w3schools and i want to manipulate those results (drag and drop them) but im having a problem because the script loads before you enter the search and get the results so it does absolutely nothing no the search results. Any thoughts on this matter ?
