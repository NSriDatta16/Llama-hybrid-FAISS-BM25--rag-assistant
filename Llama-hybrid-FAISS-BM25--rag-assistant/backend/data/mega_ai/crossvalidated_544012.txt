Survival function as output label for supervised dimensionality reduction

I would like to do supervised dimensionality reduction with UMAP for survival analysis. As both the time to event as well as the event itself are of interest for survival analysis, I calculated the survival function through the Kaplan-Meier estimator. I then use the function's value at survival time $t$ of each sample as the output labels. Is it safe to do this? Or do I have to additionally take into consideration censored data?
