Assuming your logistic regression model is named 'fit', you can create groups based on the quantile of the predicted probability using quantcut() in the gtools package as follows: library(gtools) dd_test$pred dd_test$grp You can adjust the number of risk groups - just look at the quantcut() documentation and change the 'q' parameter accordingly.
