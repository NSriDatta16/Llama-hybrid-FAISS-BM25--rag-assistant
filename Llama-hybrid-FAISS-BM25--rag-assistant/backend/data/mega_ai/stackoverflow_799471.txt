Ok I found how to fix my issue. I'm using Chrome Drop Down Menu : http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex1/chrome/index.htm The code is simple, pretty and works perfectly. I had some hard time customizing it but now it's done and my life is much better : Home Resources News Dynamic Drive CSS Drive JavaScript Kit CNN MSNBC BBC News cssdropdown.startchrome("chromemenu")
