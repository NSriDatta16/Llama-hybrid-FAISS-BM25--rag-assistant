I am not aware of meta-analysis of median survival. There are some approaches that meta-analyze the ratio of medians, under the (questionable) assumption that this ratio approximates the hazard ratio. If you want to obtain a "pooled" median (for group A), you will need two ingredients: reference survival function (very well characterized population with individuals treated/exposed to B - it can be a pragmatic trial, large cohort study with good representativeness and low risk of bias). summary HR from your meta-analysis. You will basically convert the survival function from the reference population into a hazard function, and then multiply the hazard function by the summary HR, and convert it back to survival function. For more details, check this question: Is it possible to apply a hazard ratio estimated from one survival distribution to another
