This page, Parsing C++ , mentions a couple of ANTLR grammars for C++. Since ANTLR has a Python API this seems like a reasonable way to proceed. Even though parsing may seem a lot more complex that regular expressions, this is a case where someone else has done almost all the work for you and you just need to interface to it from Python. Another alternative, where someone else has done the work of parsing C++ for you, is pygccxml which leverages GCCXML , an output extension for GCC to produce XML from the compilers internal representation. Since Python has great XML support, you just need to extract the information of interest to you.
