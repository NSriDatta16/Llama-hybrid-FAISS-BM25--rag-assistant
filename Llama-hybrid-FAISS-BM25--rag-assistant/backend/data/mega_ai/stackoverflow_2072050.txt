Note that if you have the numbers with index 20 to 40, you don't have 20 numbers, you have 21 numbers. You can use the Range method to create an IEnumerable for the indexes, then you can use the Average method to get the average of the numbers: double average = Enumerable.Range(20, 21).Select(i => numbers[i]).Average();
