Alternate Gothic No. 2 not embedding properly

I'm writing a Pure AS3 app, embedding a font using the Embed metatag like so: [Embed(source="assets/fonts.swf", fontName="AlternateGothic No2")] public static const ALTERNATE_GOTHIC_2:Class; This has always worked for me, but Alternate Gothic No. 2 gives me issues. In Flash, the font is labeled as AlternateGothic and the style is No2 . I typically combine these with a space in between as the fontName , but it's not working. The font is Postscript Type 1, so I can't embed the file and fontFamily , unless I spend $100+ on a font converter. I also tried creating a font symbol, but that didn't work either. Any ideas?
