In my opinion, it depends on scale and is very subjective. The larger a system becomes, the more advantageous it is to build-up the meta data around it. If you expect it to grow, it's possible these usage scenarios change and will make it worth the time to implement. But, perl is generally geared toward pragmatic programming, code only what's needed and nothing more. In your case, knowing what little i know, i'd say leave it as is. If this were java, i'd tend to lean the other direction since java benefits far more from interface usage from the start.
