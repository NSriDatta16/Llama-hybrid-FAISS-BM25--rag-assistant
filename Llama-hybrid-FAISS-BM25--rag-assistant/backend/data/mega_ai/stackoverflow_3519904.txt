Hover effects using sprites and fades in jQuery

I would love to know how this is being achieved. I use sprites for the hover to change the look and feel of a button background by shifting the background position of the image on hover of an tag. How though, would I get this right using jQuery? http://dragoninteractive.com/ Many thanks!
