Email the authors. Without some serious guesswork, there's no way I can think of to pull the unweighted data back out of a weighted data set like this without knowing the weights. For reference, here's what happened in that study: Each patient has an exposure X, and outcome Y, and a set of confounding covariates Z A model is built to estimate the probability of X given Z for each patient, usually using something like logistic regression. 1/the probability in the last step is that individuals "weight" in the model - this gives you a dataset with the same overall number of patients as the original dataset, but the influence of any given patient is modified by their weight. There's some adjustments you can do from here to handle really absurd weights. You run your analysis on the weighted data set, and theoretically get an estimate of the marginal effect of X on Y, having controlled for Z. This does assume you haven't missed anything, your weighting model isn't misspecified, etc. This technique provides several nice properties, which are mentioned in your snippet: You get adjusted, marginal effect estimates, and when you plot survival curves for the weighted data, those survival curves are adjusted for covariates. But unless you know the underlying weights, I don't think it will be trivial to extract the unweighted data. As I said in the beginning, it's likely much faster and less error prone to drop the authors an email.
