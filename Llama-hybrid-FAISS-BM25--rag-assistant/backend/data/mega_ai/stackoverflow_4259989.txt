ASP.NET MVC: Best Way To Call Stored Procedure

I'm trying to decide which is the best way to call a stored procedure. I'm new to ASP.NET MVC and I've been reading a lot about Linq to SQL and Entity Framework, as well as the Repository Pattern. To be honest, I'm having a hard time understanding the real differences between L2S and EF... but I want to make sure that what I'm building within my application is right. For right now, I need to properly call stored procedures to: a) save some user information and get a response and, b) grab some inforation for a catalog of products. So far, I've created a Linq to SQL .dbml file, selected the sotred procedure from the Server Explorer and dragged that instance into the .dbml. I'm currently calling the Stored Procedure like so: MyLinqModel _db = new MyLinqModel(); _db.MyStoredProcedure(args); I know there's got to be more involved... plus I'm doing this within my controller, which I understand to be not a good practice. Can someone recognize what my issues are here?
