AlexK's is probably the best idea all around. The only thing I would worry about is performance of using functions in the predicate. You should consider adding a column called searchdate, or something similar, to your table to contain the date without the time. I'd also suggest indexing this column, especially if you're going to be searching against the column's data a lot. When you query on this column you will not have any scalar functions in your SQL to rob your indexes of their performance. The con... well, additional storage space, time during insert to write the data (not much here though). SQL Server 2008 has better support for date only data types. You could also check in on it.
