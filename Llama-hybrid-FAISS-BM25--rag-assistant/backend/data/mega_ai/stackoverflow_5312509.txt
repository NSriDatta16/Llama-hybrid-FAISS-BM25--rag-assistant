Showing 2 matrix reports one after another

I have report which has 2 matrix reports. One shows details and other one shows total becuase total is not just sum. I had placed second matrix exactly below the first matrix so that there hardly any difference found. But the second matrix is shown in first page but not in last page. Appreciate your help. Regards, Raghavendra
