The network topology to solve the XNOR problem is no different than the topology for the XOR problem. The only difference is the output labels to achieve desired results, i.e., the truth table for XNOR is only slightly different than for XOR. You could simply use a 2-2-1 feedfoward topology with random weights in the unit interval (0,1), no bias terms, ReLU or Sigmoid activation in the first dense layer and sigmoid activation in the second dense layer. See http://dx.doi.org/10.13140/RG.2.2.13734.91206 which gives a good intro to XNOR problem and provides a solution to the slightly more challenging XNOR-type nonlinear distribution problem in 2D using a single layer neural network. The solution includes code in Python. Best of Luck.
