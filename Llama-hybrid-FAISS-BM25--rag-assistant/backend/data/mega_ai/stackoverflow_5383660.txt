It sounds like you want a dynamic web page. To make a dymaic webpage I'd suggest using PHP which would interact with the mysql server. For example, a user would visit 'mysite.com/info.php?image=367' and the php script would get the information 'image=367'. Your PHP script could do a select query against the mysql database 'SELECT paragraph FROM table WHERE image_id = 367' and then write that data out to the user's web browser. As far as the user is concerned they just visited 'mysite.com/info.php?image=367', but in the background, PHP dynamically created the webpage content after it got that request.

As for the second part of your question, it can also be done with PHP $specifictime) { echo " its after 3pm on tuesday"; } else { echo " not 3pm on tuesday yet"; } ?>
