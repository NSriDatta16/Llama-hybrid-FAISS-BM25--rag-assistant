Function spectrum in R on a bi-variate time series will produce both coherency and phase with confidence intervals. Regarding your last paragraph: you want to "prove" that US cycles strongly influence Eusope cycles. You must bear in mind that coherency is a sort of correlation coefficient among frequency components aligned . How large the alignment is, you can see in the phase estimate: but phase is modulo $2 \pi$. In other words, you cannot tell a lead of $\omega$ radians from a lag of $2\pi - \omega$ radians. Thus, from a bi-variate spectral analysis you may find that US cycles of a certain frequency are quite coherent with European cycles of the same frequency; but which one leads (which I assume is a requisite for "influencing") the other, you will have to decide on other grounds.
