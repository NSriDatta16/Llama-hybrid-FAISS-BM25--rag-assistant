I suggest you take a look at the following: the ususal nlp libraries like Open NLP , LingPipe , NLTK , Gate , UIMA . All of these provide parsers and word stemmers (i.e. they don't give you back the root of a word, but its stem). Some also provide lemmatizers. websites which collect NLP tools. These are but a few of them: the wiki of the Association of Computational Linguistics, Language Technology World , the website of the compling dep. at Heidelberg University I'm not aware of a tool which returns the root of a word, but, as I said, there are stemmers and lemmatizers. For lemmatization, try Tree Tagger or Morpha . Morphophonemic analysis is a term not specific enough to get you what you want. Once you know more specifically what you need, you could search the archives of the Corpora List or post a question there.
