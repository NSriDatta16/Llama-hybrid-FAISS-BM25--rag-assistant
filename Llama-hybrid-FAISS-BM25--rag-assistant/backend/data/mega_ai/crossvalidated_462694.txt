If your likelihood function is a Gamma with known shape, $a$ , and the parameter of interest is the rate, $b$ , then the Gamma distribution is a conjugate prior - see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_prior#When_likelihood_function_is_a_continuous_distribution The choice of a (Gamma) conjugate prior means that your posterior will also have a (Gamma) probability distribution, this is the definition of a conjugate prior. This simple form of the posterior distribution is precisely the reason to choose such a prior. Yes, therefore, one can have all three of prior, likelihood and posterior Gamma distributed. In Bayesian analysis the parameters are uncertain, the data is not - i.e. we are interested in $P[parameters | data]$ . Having chosen a conjugate prior there is normally a simple formula to update the parameters in the posterior distribution from the prior - see the wikipedia table examples above. As you correctly say, any Gamma distribution is uniquely specified my its mean and variance: you can calculate these from $a$ , $b$ using the formula you give, or you can use the mean and variance to estimate $a$ , $b$ by reversing the equations you quote.
