Random forest model predict better on the test than on the train

I computed a random forest model after determining the optimized parameters of ntree and mtry, than I evaluated its performance in the train and on the test. I obtained the following results: On the train: Sensibility: 78% Sensitivity: 81% Accuracy : 80% On the test set: Sensibility: 98% Sensitivity: 99% Accuracy : 99% How is this possible? Is that means that my model is good? How can I interprete these results. Thank you in advance for your help
