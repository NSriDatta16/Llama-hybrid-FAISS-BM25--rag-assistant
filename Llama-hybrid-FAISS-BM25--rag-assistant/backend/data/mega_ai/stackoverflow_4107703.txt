Unfamiliar trac warning message

I'm currently trying to configure Subversion/Apache/Trac and I've run into an error that I have never seen before and that google has not yet indexed: 2010-11-03 11:49:50,335 Trac[api] WARNING: Found no repositories matching '/path/to/repos/tests/' base. Does anyone know what this could be about? Thank you very much for your time and attention.
