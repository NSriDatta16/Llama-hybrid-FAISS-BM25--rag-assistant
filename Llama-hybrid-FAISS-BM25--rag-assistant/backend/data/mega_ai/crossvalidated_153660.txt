markov chain - probability question

Transition matrix has been written like that; $$\mathcal P = \begin{bmatrix} 1/3 & 0 & 2/3 \\ 1/3 & 1/3 & 1/3 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ the initial vector is that $$\pi_0 = \begin{bmatrix} 1/5 & 4/5 &0\end{bmatrix}$$ what is the probability of null at step 5=? 0 and 1 is transition statement when we look at the P matrix. 2 is the null statement when we look at the P matrix. the asked probability is equal to $ P_0 f_{02}^5 + P_1 f_{12}^5$ where $f_{02}^5 $ means that by starting in 0, the probability of being in 2 at first time and with 5 steps. this equal to $(1/3)^4Ã—(2/3)$ but i cannot calculate $f_{12}^5$. please help me calculating this. thank you
