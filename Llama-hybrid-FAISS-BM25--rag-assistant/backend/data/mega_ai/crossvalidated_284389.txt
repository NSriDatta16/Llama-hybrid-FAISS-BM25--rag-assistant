AUC vs accuracy for model accuracy evaluation

In R I tried to measure the accuracy by performing a classification analysis using logistic regression analysis. I found that there are two ways to measure accuracy. One is AUC measurement using ROC curve and the other is accuracy using confusionMatrix. When confusionMatrix is used, the probability exceeding 0.5 is regarded as 1, the value less than 0.5 is regarded as 0, and it is judged whether or not it matches the actual value. If so, what should be considered as the model accuracy? Obviously, the values of AUC and confusionMatrix obtained from one algorithm are different. What is the different?
