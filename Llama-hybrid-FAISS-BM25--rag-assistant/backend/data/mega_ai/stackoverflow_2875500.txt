The DataGrid does not support horizontal item scrolling. One very mad idea would be to use the Toolkit's LayoutTransformer to rotate the whole grid by 90degrees then template all the headers and cells with a LayoutTransfomer to rotate their contents back. One issue (likely of many, if it's even possible) would be the scrollbar would appear on the top rather than the bottom. You might be able to sort that out with further templating.
