Using Multiple Fragments in an single activity

I want to develop an android application using Honey Comb 3.0 in which I want to display a list , clicking on any item in a list should display another list beside that list item in the form of Fragment. Can any one provide me sample code in sorting out this issue? Thanks in Advance,
