Are you using the 'load' event to initialize the page? When a user presses the back button, the 'load' event doesn't fire but the 'dom content ready' event does. See: Is there a cross-browser onload event when clicking the back button? If you are using jQuery, try to put your page initialization logic in ready event and you should be good. If you are not using jQuery, find the appropriate way to hook up to the DOM Content Loaded/Ready event and use it to initialize your page. If it still doesn't work, please post your code so that we can debug the problem. EDIT: Looks like you want to set appropriate Expires header so that browser will reload the page when back button is clicked. Try code from following page: http://www.352media.com/rantingandraving/rave.aspx?raveid=325&id=212
