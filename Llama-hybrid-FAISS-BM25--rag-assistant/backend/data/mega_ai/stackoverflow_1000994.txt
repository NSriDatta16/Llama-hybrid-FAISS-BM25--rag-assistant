ANN for decompiler?

Has there ever been any attempts at utilizing artificial neural networks in decompilation? It would be nice if it was possible to provide the trimmed semantics of source along with the code in to a neural network so it could learn the connection between the two. I assume this would likely lose it's effectiveness when there is optimizations and maybe work better for high level languages too but I'm interested in hearing any attempts anyone has had at this.
