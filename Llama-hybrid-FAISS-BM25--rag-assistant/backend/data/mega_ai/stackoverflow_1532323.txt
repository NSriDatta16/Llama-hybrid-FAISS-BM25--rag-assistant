Visual Studio Database Professional GDR R2 takes a long time to serialize DBMDL file

The amount of time it takes to completely serialize the DBMDL (to finish "Your project will be available after 10000 operations are completed) is becoming a hindrance to productivity. I've done what I can to optimize disk activity (excluding my personal TEMP folder from the virus scanner, along with my local source repository). Short of getting a SSD I'm not sure what else I can do along those lines. I believe it has something to do with how the project is organized. The finished DBMDL file is roughly 150MB. Others throughout our organization do not seem to have this issue. Anyone had to deal with this?
