Calling a JavaScript function named in a variable

I have a JavaScript variable which contains the name of a JavaScript function. This function exists on the page by having been loaded in and placed using $.ajax, etc. Can anyone tell me how I would call the javascript function named in the variable, please? The name of the function is in a variable because the URL used to load the page fragment (which gets inserted into the current page) contains the name of the function to call. I am open to other suggestions on how to implement this solution.
