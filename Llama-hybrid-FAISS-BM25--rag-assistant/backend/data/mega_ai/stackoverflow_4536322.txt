Probably the best thing you can look into is table partitioning, which will allow you to quickly remove data when it needs age out. Also, make sure that you cluster your index on a monotonically increasing value (either a surrogate identity value or a datetime column, like dateofreciept); this will reduce fragmentation on the clustered index.
