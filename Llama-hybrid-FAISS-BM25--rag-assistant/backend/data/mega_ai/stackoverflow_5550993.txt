neural cryptography in C#

Hello Dears I'm developing a communication protocol to secure data transfer over a tcp network. I want to use neural networks to e change the keys. I found a protocol specification in wikipedia : http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neural_cryptography#Tree_parity_machine and an implementation in Delphi : http://www.codeproject.com/KB/security/Neural_Cryptography1.aspx and recently A new project in F# : http://neuralcryptography.codeplex.com I tried to implement it n C# using aforge But I think it does not have some necessary features to implement a neural cryptography protocol Can you help me to implement it in C#? Thanks
