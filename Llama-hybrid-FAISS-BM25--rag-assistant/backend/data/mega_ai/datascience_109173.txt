If you want to see how much the prediction is off from the actual value as a percentage you should look into using the mean average percentage error (MAPE). The scikit-learn library has this loss implemented in the metrics package. You can simply call the mean_absolute_percentage_error function instead of the mean_squared_error you're currently using: mean_absolute_percentage_error(y_true, y_pred)
