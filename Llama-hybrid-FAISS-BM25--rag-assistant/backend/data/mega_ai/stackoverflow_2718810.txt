SAX parsers are implemented by creating a ContentHandler object which implements certain callback functions that correspond to events that happen while parsing an XML document. For example, the startDocument method is called when the parser begins parsing the document, and startElement is called when it discovers a new tag; similarly, endElement , endDocument , and error are called when the parser finds the end of a tag or document, or when an invalid sequence is discovered. This example shows how to use a SAX parser. The key is that the MyHandler class extends the DefaultHandler class (which implements the ContentHandler interface) and overrides the empty implementations of each callback method. Think of it this way: the Java SAXParser class knows how to parse XML documents but when it discovers things of interest it relies on some handler class to know what to do with them. The DefaultHandler class is a helper implementation which you can extend to pay attention to the interesting things.
