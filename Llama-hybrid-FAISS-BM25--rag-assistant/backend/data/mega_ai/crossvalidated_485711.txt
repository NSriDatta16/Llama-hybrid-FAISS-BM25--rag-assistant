This is a good question, I would be interested in other answers. Random forests are more interpretable than may first appear see Obtaining knowledge from a random forest . As an example and as mentioned in one of the answers from that question, the random forest you can get the importance of variables, say using the importance function of the R randomForest package. Conversely, using a single logistic regression model may seem more interpretable than it actually is since unless there really are those exact regressors generating the output (unlikely) then probably a few slightly different models will be acceptable or plausible. Further, changing one regressor will often effect other regressors in the model if they are present, and how much to change a regressor (one unit, one percent?) may not even make sense for a given regressor, with a further complication being the variability of regressors is unlikely to be the same. I would fit both a logistic regression and a random forest and look for similarities and differences in their results, augmenting this with any other domain knowledge or plots that help elucidate the data.
