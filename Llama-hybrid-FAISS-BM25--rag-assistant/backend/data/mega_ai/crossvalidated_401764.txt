Logistic regression - effect analysis vs parameter estimates

I'm doing logistic regression with binary target and one categorical variable as input, but struggling to interpret how the test values and significance are so different (red on the picture below). Does it make sense to conclude there is an effect for a categorical variable but when looking at the parameter estimate, nothing is significant? How do I interpret the results in this scenario?
