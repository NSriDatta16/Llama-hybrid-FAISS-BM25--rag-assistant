Since HTML 5 those things are possible, thanks to the File Object , File Reader and the ´files´ property of the input element. See here for more information: http://demos.hacks.mozilla.org/openweb/ & http://hacks.mozilla.org/2009/12/file-drag-and-drop-in-firefox-3-6/ . Example (only for demonstration, requires FF 3.5+): See here: http://gist.github.com/536024 In case you wonder, File.url is brand new, with it you dont anymore need to read the whole file into the memory, and assign the whole DataUrl (data:image/src,base64;DF15EDFE86..) to the src property.
