As you have suggested yourself, the normal way to do this is to make your guard identifiers unique, by appending a GUID, or a complete path, or what have you. In VC++ there's also a pragma to take care of multiple inclusion for you, so you don't need to write the #if defined(HUMPTYDUMPTY) bit yourself, it goes like #pragma once Has been around for a few iterations of VC++ now, but for other compilers you'd need to check. This also saves you the trouble of looking for unique names. Edited: Just had a look and the Internet thinks that this is also in GCC. Seems like the #include style guards are very much 20th Century...
