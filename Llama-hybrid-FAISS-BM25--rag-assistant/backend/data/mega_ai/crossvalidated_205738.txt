What is the difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning?

OK, I know there is a lot of topic regarding this in the internet, and trust me, I've googled it. But things are getting more and more confused for me. From my understanding, Deep Learning (DL) is kind of a subset of Machine Learning (ML) where ML can consist of something like Support Vector Machines and DL can be consists of something like Convolutional Neural Network. Is this correct? If I want to getting start at this, what should I read first? What kind of research paper that can I read?
