Any good jQuery caching plugin?

When I log-in to my Gmail Inbox it starts caching the mails one-by-one in JavaScript. When I click on a mail in the Inbox, it doesn't send an Ajax request then to fetch the mail contents. Instead it serves from an already cached JavaScript array. Is there any good jQuery plugin to implement this? I came across a few but they don't seem to be under active development. http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jCache http://plugins.jquery.com/project/jCacher Any better plugin? Edit1: My requirement is exactly same as what Gmail is doing. There is a ticket management system which shows a list of open tickets(say 100 tickets on a page) and once you click on a ticket its details are displayed. I want to cache the details of all 100 tickets displayed on the page. I am planning to implement the cache as object of key-value pairs only. But I am looking for a plugin which takes care of tasks like setting/getting values from cache, auto-updating the cache periodically etc. Storing in JS object shall be enogh for me. I don't see any advantages of using HTML5 local storage as * No offline browsing is required and * I wan't to load fresh data every time a new window is opened * I won't need huge amount of memory
