Flex 3 PopUpMenuButton and ReferenceError #1069

I've got a PopUpMenuButton in a Flex 3 application. If someone clicks on the pulldown part, it works fine. But, if they click on the main button part, I get get ReferenceError: Error #1069. After the user dismisses the error, it then does what it's supposed to do. public function popUpMenuButtonClickHandler2(event:MenuEvent):void { mainViewStack.selectedChild = this[event.item.@chosen]; myPopUpMenuButton2.label = event.item.@label; neighborhoodPopUpMenuButton.label = "Neighborhoods"; } public function defaultpopUpMenuButtonClickHandler2():void { mainViewStack.selectedChild = home; myPopUpMenuButton2.label = 'Adams Morgan'; flipperPhotoSearcher1(2,1); neighborhoodPopUpMenuButton.label = "Neighborhoods"; } Any ideas as to what I'm doing wrong? Thank you. -Laxmidi
