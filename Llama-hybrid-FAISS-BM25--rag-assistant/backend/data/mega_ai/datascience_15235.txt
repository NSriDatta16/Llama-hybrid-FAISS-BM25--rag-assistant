Correlation between examples

I'm training a Neural Network for pattern recognition. I have a matrix of examples of size ($N$x$4$) with $N$ examples and $4$ variables. When I train the Network the Number of examples used for training vs. Cross-entropy, the performance of the Network it's not improving when adding new examples. I suspect that the examples are highly correlated between them and adding new examples is not giving new information to the network, but I don't figure how to measure that correlation. Each row of the matrix can be labeled $\mathbf{X}_{i}$. Suppose zero mean, the covariance matrix between examples would be $\mathbf{R}_{ij} = E[\mathbf{X}_{i} \mathbf{X}_{j}^T]$. I can also calculate the covariance matrix of $\mathbf{X}$, whose elements are $\mathbf{R}_{ij}$ but in that case I would have a matrix of $\sim 300000$x$300000$. Is there a way of calculate some average correlation or an other measure of correlation between examples?. Thanks. EDIT: I don't want to know the correlation matrix of variables, I want to know the correlation between examples. EDIT2: This is the learning curve:
