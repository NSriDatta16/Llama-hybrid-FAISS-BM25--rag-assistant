Regarding the intuition for the falsehood of Question 5, I obtain the following discussion on this topic from here It is correct to say that there is a 95% chance that the confidence interval you calculated contains the true population mean. It is not quite correct to say that there is a 95% chance that the population mean lies within the interval. What's the difference? The population mean has one value. You don't know what it is (unless you are doing simulations) but it has one value. If you repeated the experiment, that value wouldn't change (and you still wouldn't know what it is). Therefore it isn't strictly correct to ask about the probability that the population mean lies within a certain range. In contrast, the confidence interval you compute depends on the data you happened to collect. If you repeated the experiment, your confidence interval would almost certainly be different. So it is OK to ask about the probability that the interval contains the population mean. Now to your specific questions about 5. Why is it wrong... Is it because we might have some special information about the sample we just took that would make us think it's likely to be one of the 5% that does not contain the true mean? No, rather, I think it is because the true mean is not a random variable, but the confidence interval is a function of the data. What does confidence mean in this context, anyway? A confidence interval enables (confidently - if you trust your assumptions) you to make a claim that the interval covers the true parameter. The interpretation reflects the uncertainty in the sampling procedure; a confidence interval of $100(1-\alpha)$ % asserts that [you can be confident that], in the long run, $100(1-\alpha)$ % of the realized confidence intervals cover the true parameter. As a side note (mentioned in other answers to this question), a credible interval , a concept from Bayesian statistics, do predict that the true value of the parameter has a particular probability of being in the confidence interval given the data actually obtained. Perhaps you can obtain more background on this from Gelman's blog.
