There are a lot of different paths you can go down. Assuming a MS environment you can leverage some of the team system tools such as MS Team Tester to record tests and perform load testing against your site. These can be set to run as part of an automated build process. A list of tools is located at: http://www.softwareqatest.com/qatweb1.html#LOAD Now, you might start off simple. In this case install two firefox plugins: Firebug and YSlow for Firebug. These will give stats and point out issues such as page size, the number of requests made to get the page, etc. They will also make recommendations on some things to fix. Further, you can use unit tests to execute a lot of the code behind to see what functions are hurting you.
