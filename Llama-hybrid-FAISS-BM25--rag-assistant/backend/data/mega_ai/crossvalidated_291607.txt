Is the mean of my two time series data significantly different?

I have two stationary time series and want to know if the mean values are different. One practical application would be there are two motors and I want to know which one needs less energy in average - or I have one motor and make some maintenance work and want to know if the average energy consumption decreased afterwards. I did some research on the internet but couldn't find a significance test for that case. Of course the observations of my time series are not independent and I can also chose which sampling rate I want (e.g. 1 minutes intervals or 10 minutes intervals), so I guess a t-test can't be used here. What would be a correct significance test? Thanks
