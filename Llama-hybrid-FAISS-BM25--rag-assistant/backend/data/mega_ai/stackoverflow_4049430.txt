How big are your constant strings? The memory used by the strings is of the order of 8 * 300 * 2 * average-length = ~5k * average-length. It doesn't seem like enough to use all your memory. It is indeed good practice to declare constants as static, and also final. e.g. public static final String A_STRING = "this String is constant"; Note, it is the reference that is made constant by the 'final' modifier, not the object itself.
