Setting meta:resourcekey on page load

I have a label on a page which gets localized text through the meta:resourcekey attribute. The issue I have is that I want it to display different text depending on which view of a multiview they're on. I tried adding the attribute though label.Attributes.Add("meta:resourcekey", "label") , but that doesn't seem to load any text. I tried it on PreRender , and same deal. The attribute appears when I look at the source, but no text is displayed. Is this possible to do? The other option is to have 2 labels and change the visibility on page load, but that seems like the less elegant solution. Thanks.
