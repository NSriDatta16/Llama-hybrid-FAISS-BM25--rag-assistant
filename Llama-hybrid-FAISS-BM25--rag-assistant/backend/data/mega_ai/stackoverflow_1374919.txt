gcc will link to libassuan.a if it doesn't find libassuan.so It's probably the order symbols are looked up in the static library when you link. The order matters. ) Assuming gcc can find libassuan.a and it actually provides the functions the linker complains about, try: cc -I/usr/include/libmirage -I/usr/include/glib-2.0 -I/usr/lib64/glib-2.0/include -lmirage -lglib-2.0 -L/usr/lib64 -o mirage2iso mirage2iso.c mirage-getopt.o mirage-wrapper.o mirage-password.o -lassuan Since you say libassuan is under /usr/lib64 it's probably a 64 bit library, are your app and the other libraries 64 bit as well ?
