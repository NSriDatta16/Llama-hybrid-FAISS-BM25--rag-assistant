You need to have the raw data, so that the response variable is 0/1 (not smoke, smoke). Then you can use binary logistic regression. It is not correct to group BMI into intervals. The cutpoints are not correct, probably don't exist, and you are not officially testing whether BMI is associated with smoking. You are currently testing whether BMI with much of its information discarded is associated with smoking. You'll find that especially the outer BMI intervals are quite heterogeneous.
