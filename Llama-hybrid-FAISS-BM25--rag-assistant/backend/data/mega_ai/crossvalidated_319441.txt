capture relationships between high-level concepts It's not clear what you mean by this. Do you have these relationships or do you want to learn them (from what?)? If you mean encoding using existing structure, then you can use node2vec on your knowledge base (for example WordNet, you can also search for ontology/taxonomy). Poincare embeddings also come to mind, but they encode points in hyperbolic space, so it might not be what you want (hyperbolic structure is different than Euclidean space, which is used for most word embeddings).
