Training a face recognition model takes longer than expected

I am doing a small project with the basic idea of recognizing a face. I made a version that uses face_recognition library. And, although I am quite satisfied with the results I am not happy with the time it takes for the program to finish. I am quite sure that this is due to face_recognition does not use GPU/CUDA despite me having GPU on my machine. in particular the function face_recognition.face_locations(picture, model="cnn") does all the computation on CPU. In the docs of this function it says that it will use CPU if it cannot use GPU. However, I used GPU with another library and it was fine. I would be happy for any help that you can give me. P.S. Probably you know other libraries that I probably should pay attention to. Edit: the link to the face_recognition library .
