Embeded Flash in asp.net accordian performs poorly

I'm using the ajax toolkit accordion extender and I notice it performs a little "funky" when I try to embed some flash in the content sections. You can see what I have working now at : http://kristinsconfections.com/gallery.aspx . As you can see when you toggle the accordion it's a little choppy. I'm pulling the flash slideshow from flickr so I can't control that at all. The site is only for a friend who is trying to become a baker so it's not high priority just highly frustrating!! Anything I can do using javascript, .net or even jquery?? Here is the exact code I am using on that page: Cakes Cookies Cupcakes
