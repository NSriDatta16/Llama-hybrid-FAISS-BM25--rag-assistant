Logistic regression: Fisher's scoring iterations do not match the selected iterations in glm

it happened to me that in a logistic regression in R with glm the Fisher scoring iterations in the output are less than the iterations selected with the argument control=glm.control(maxit=25) in glm itself. I see this as the effect of divergence in the iteratively reweighted least squares algorithm behind glm . My question is: under which criteria does glm stop the iterations and provides with a partial output? I was thinking about something like "when the new coefficients-old coefficients glm stop? Thanks, Avitus
