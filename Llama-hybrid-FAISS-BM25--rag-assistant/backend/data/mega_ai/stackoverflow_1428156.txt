I ended up finding another snippet in my library that did it as well. This was the end solution: var w:Number = stage.stageWidth; var h:Number = stage.stageHeight; var xDiff:Number = transform.matrix.tx - transform.concatenatedMatrix.tx; var yDiff:Number = transform.matrix.ty - transform.concatenatedMatrix.ty; var x = w / 2 + xDiff; var y = h / 2 + yDiff; var ratH:Number = image.height / h; var ratW:Number = image.width / w; this.x = w / 2 + xDiff; this.y = h / 2 + yDiff; if (ratH > ratW) { image.width = w; image.scaleY = image.scaleX; } else { image.height = h; image.scaleX = image.scaleY; } image.x = -image.width / 2; image.y = -image.height / 2; It's not as elegant or correct as the solutions provided, but it seems to work. I've also re factored what is returned by the function to manipulate the image directly.
