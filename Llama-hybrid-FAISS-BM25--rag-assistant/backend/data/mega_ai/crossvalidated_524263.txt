Prior/Posterior of the Proxy

I am trying to understand a sentence from Caldara and Herbst (2019), who develop a baysian proxy SVAR model. The paragraph is: "In case of weak identification, the prior plays an important role in inference. But in our framework comparing prior to posterior distributions, a standard diagnostic to detect identification issues, is trivial. The reason is that, as already shown by equation (12), when it comes to identification, the relevant prior distributions are those implied by the model before observing M1:T but after observing Y1:T. Finally, lack of identification or weak identification, which manifests itself in flat or nearly flat likelihood profiles, could pose practical issues when sampling the posterior." I am confused about what "trivial" means in this case. I am used to seeing plots of the prior vs posterior distributions in Bayesian papers, and it seems this is omitted here because such a plot would not be informative. Is this the correct understanding? I understand that this question is probably super difficult to answer even for people much more familiar with Baysian econometrics than I am. So in case it helps, here is a bride summary of the Baysian proxy SVAR: The SVAR in compact form is: Take the reduced-form to be: where the structural and the reduced form are linked through: . The proxy m_t is linked to the structural shock e_mp,t by: . The likelihood (which is the equation (12) the paragraph above refers to) is given by: where the paragraph posted above is footnote 6 of the last sentence. I understand that this question is probably way to long and requires too much reading of the paper for an easy answer, but I would be very thankful for any help with understanding this.
