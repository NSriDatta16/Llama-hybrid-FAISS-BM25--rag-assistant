Writing a select statement inside an Oracle user-defined function

I'm quite new to Oracle SQL (though I've written a fair bit of SQL) and am having trouble embedding a simple SELECT statement in a function. It feels like SQL ABC but I can't seem to get it :( I think I'm using PL-SQL Here's what I have so far: create or replace FUNCTION GET_GROUP_BY_ID RETURN VARCHAR2 AS my_result BEGIN SELECT fav_group.name INTO my_result FROM fav_group WHERE fav_group.id = 12345 RETURN my_result; END GET_GROUP_BY_ID; As I said, I've tried a LOT of variations on the above code by looking at code examples on google but can't seem to get it right.
