It seems like the elegant way to ensure the ItemsSource is initialized before I set the SelectedItem from VM is to have the binding source of ItemsSource (whatever it is) declared in my view resources. I'm sure someone can lead me to the light now that I've pointed that out. I have tried with a CollectionViewSource but didn't find the way to use its Filter capability without breaking the MVVM pattern. Plus I don't know how to re-raise the Filter as I used to with ICollectionView.Filter (filtered-out items depend on another combobox selection, nothing really fanciful imo). Perhaps the resource declared in the view and used as ItemsSource has not necessarily to be a CVS, I'm looking for suggestions here. --Edit-- I found out that the IsSynchronizedWithCurrentItem="True" solution spread all over the web is actually working. I was mislead because it didn't fix my problem at first try due to a remaining SelectedValuePath that wasn't used anymore on my control.
