How to approach a real machine learning problem?

As a ML beginner, I don't how to begin with this problem, or more generally, are there any typical steps to take when approaching a real problem? If I have some domain relevant knowledge, then I could make use of it to analyze the data and do the modelling. But if I don't, then all I have is just the data, a matrix of input and a vector of response (if supervised). My question is if I don't have domain knowledge, what to do before I randomly try out some learning algorithms and tune the parameters? Am I supposed to analyze the data per se to find out any clue and how?
