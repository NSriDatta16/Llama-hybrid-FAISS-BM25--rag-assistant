File Input Java Mac

I'm writing up a program that goes into a basic .txt file and prints certain things. It is a comma-delimited file. The file includes 7 first and last names, and also 4 numbers after. Each of the seven on a separate line. Each line looks like this: George Washington, 7, 15, 20, 14 The program has to grab the last name and then average the 4 numbers, but also average the first from all seven, second from all seven, etc. I'm not sure on how to start approaching this and get it to keep grabbing and printing what's necessary. Thanks for any help. I appreciate it. I'm using a Mac to do all of this programming and it needs to run on Windows so I'm using : File Grades = new File(System.getProperty("user.home"), "grades.txt"); so how would I use that to read from the file?
