As others have mentioned, simply quoting with single-quotes is a big security risk. Use mysql_real_escape_string on the data beforehand or else use an extension like PDO with parameterized statements that will automatically be quoted. And while sanitizing (with htmlspecialchars) is not necessary before storage (and I don't recommend it in case you need it reverted to its inputted state) you should sanitize it before output so that HTML/script tags won't be parsed.
