MySQL - select count(*), group by, but maintain separation

I've got a table recording views of programs. Each program can have two different types (1=video, 2=audio) My table to record the views: TABLE views view_id user_agent created_at type program_id (which related to table programs) My current MySQL call: SELECT COUNT(*) as views, `mp`.`title`, `mp`.`program_date` as date FROM (`applications_media_views` as v) JOIN `media_programs` as mp ON `v`.`program_id` = `mp`.`program_id` GROUP BY `v`.`program_id` ORDER BY `views` desc The trouble is, this does not keep the types separated. I need to report on views by program_id, but I need to keep the types separate. What am I missing?
