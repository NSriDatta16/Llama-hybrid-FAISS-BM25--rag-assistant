I'm not totally sure about this, but it's possible that what's happening is that when jQuery builds up the fragment from $(data) , the script tags are lost at that point. If you can arrange for the included page to really be just a fragment: var x = 'hello world'; without any other surrounding stuff, then your success callback can do this: success: function(data) { $('#mydiv').html(data); } Now those script tags will be noticed by the jQuery html() function, which explicitly looks for them and strips them out. It does however hold onto those script blocks, and it executes them after it finishes updating the target contents.
