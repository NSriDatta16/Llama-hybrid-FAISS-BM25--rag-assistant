I doubt you will find a very elegant solution, since COM interop with non-trivial managed types is always going to involve custom code. Since your recipient COM client has to know the semantics of the data, you could just marshal to a single SafeArray whose entries are Key1, Value1, Key2, Value2, and so on. Maybe that's just a restatement of the first option you described above, though?
