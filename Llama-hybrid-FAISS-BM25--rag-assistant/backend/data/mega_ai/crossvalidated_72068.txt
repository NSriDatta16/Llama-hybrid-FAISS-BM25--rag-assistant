Document classification question

I've got a tricky document classification question. Each document in my collection can be assigned a label. In my training set the average is about 3 different labels assigned to each document. What I have learned in the training set is $P(\text{label}|\text{doc_word})$ for many label/doc_word pairs. I want to calculate $P(\text{label}|\text{word}_1,\ldots,\text{word}_n)$ but I cannot simply calculate it by $$P(\text{label}|\text{word}_1,\ldots,\text{word}_n)=P(\text{label}|\text{word}_1)\cdot \ldots \cdot P(\text{label}|\text{word}_n)$$ because there are many words where $P(\text{label}|\text{word}_i)=0$. Furthermore, if there are two words in the document where $P(\text{label}|\text{word})>0$, their product would be less than the individual probabilities thus making the label less likely. This is counter-intuitive to me because I would think that having two words where $P(\text{label}|\text{word})>0$ should make the label more likely. So maybe the independence assumption does not hold. Perhaps I should just use these probabilities as association rules in order to assign labels?
