Value Networks : The value network assigns value/score to the state of the game by calculating an expected cumulative score for the current state s . Every state goes through the value network. The states which get more reward obviously get more value in the network. Better understanding with Animations Go here: Policy Networks vs Value Networks in Reinforcement Learning
