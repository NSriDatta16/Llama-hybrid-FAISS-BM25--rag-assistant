This code is kind of a mess and not doing what you expect it to do. For example, the code Age doesn't round Age to whole numbers. You need Age to do that. That said, the reason you're getting this message is that the variable Post_DBP perfectly predicts Trt_Grp . This line of code ifelse(Post_DBP 80, 0, Trt_Grp) which would be more clearly written as Trt_Grp 80, 0, 1) means that Trt_grp is perfectly determined by Post_DBP . There is no overlap between your treated and control groups on this variable. There is a perfect discontinuity at Post_DBP==80 . The warning message you get is from the logistic regression that matchit() runs using glm() .
