Time series data: How I measure influence of new product sales on existing product sales (statistically)?

Here my goal is… Find Product 5 (New Product) is really influencing other product sales (product 1 to 4) or not? If it is influencing other product sales, how much? New to R and tried several related posts but didn’t find exact answer to my question. I love R and learning every day something new which helping us in taking data driven decisions. My sample Dataset is like below (Week and Product 1 to Product 5 Sales per each week) Here my new product is Product 5 and launched on Week 5. Week Product-1 Product-2 Product-3 Product-4 Product-5 1 2 4 5 5 2 4 4 6 4 3 4 4 6 5 4 4 4 6 6 4 5 4 6 5 3 5 6 2 7 6 4 3 7 3 8 7 5 6 8 2 9 9 3 6 Here my questions are What is the best process or model to show the influence of product 5 (statistically)? Do I need to run co-integration tests before I run correlation? Example some of these products are never be correlated with Product 5 (example: growth in cockle growth vs. growth in electricity demand) How I know correlation vs. causation in this mix? Since my new product launched on week 5, where I can start my correlations? Is it from week 5 or from earlier weeks? Do I need to test for stationarity first? and bring the data to stationary?
