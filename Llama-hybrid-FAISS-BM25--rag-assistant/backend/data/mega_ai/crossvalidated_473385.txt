Understanding Cochran-Armitage Trend Test in R

I'm trying to understand how to interpret the Cochran-Armitrage test in R. This is my data cochrane_rady_table_copy I'm trying to tell if the number of people with insurance increased across the years of data I have. I run the test with this if (!require('DescTools')) {install.packages('DescTools'); library('DescTools')} CochranArmitageTest(cochrane_rady_table_copy, alternative = c("increasing")) The output is data: cochrane_rady_table_copy Z = -11.237, dim = 8, p-value Is the interpretation here that the proportion of people with insurance is increasing compared to those without insurance? I'm new to this analysis so I'm a little unsure.
