While opening and reading the header of a file on a local filesystem should not be too expensive, it can be expensive if the file is on a remote (networked) file system. Even worse, if you are accessing files saved with hierarchical storage management , reading the file can be very expensive. If this app is just for you, then you can decide not to worry about those issues. But if you are distributing your app to the public, reading the file before you absolutely have to will cause problems for some users. Raymond Chen wrote an article about this for his blog The Old New Thing .
