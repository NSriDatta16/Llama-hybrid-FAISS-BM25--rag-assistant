Can I pass std::string to a DLL?

I separated a code fragment into a DLL because it will be frequently updated and in this way it should be easier to deploy. But I have questions about what I can do and what I cannot do with a DLL . Can I pass a std:string or a CString to a DLL ? Can I pass a pointer to a struct with std::string members and fill it in a DLL ? Can a DLL return a pointer to a struct allocated there? Will it be valid? Can I delete it after? What should better to pass, a std::String or a Cstring ? Thanks !
