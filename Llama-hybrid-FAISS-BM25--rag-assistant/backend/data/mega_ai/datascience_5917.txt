I have not worked with such a dataset myself but I think you can model this problem as a graph where the pages form the node and then you have directed edges based on transition. Add weights to nodes based on time spent on them and then use graph clustering algorithms. If you choose to use this, you can use the networkx library in python for graph based analysis. Edit : We can use the information about different possible paths and how frequently they are use to classify the users. Let's take example of Google search app. Suppose I want to search for images. One option is that I use the image search option, make the query and reach the results page. Other is that I make the query first and then switch to image option after getting the results. In both the cases I did up at the same page. I can use this information to classify my users. Now there can be quite a lot of paths possible so which all do I consider? The graph can be used to leveraged here along with the information about how you want to classify your users. Modeling it as a graph looks very intuitive to me as it lends itself to the concept of path.
