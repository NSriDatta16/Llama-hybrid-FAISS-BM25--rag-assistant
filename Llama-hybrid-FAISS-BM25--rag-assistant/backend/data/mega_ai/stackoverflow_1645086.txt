I'd recommend just using a plain string, and not embedding variable values into it. Use placeholders instead. sql I'm not sure if the double-quote is the best way to embed multi-line strings in R code (is there something like here-docs?), but it does work, unlike in Java. Is there some reason you don't want to send "\n" or "\t" to your database? They should be fine in the SQL.
