Unfortunately you have given no reproducible code for us to investigate what is leading you to the results you have found. You also state that you want to reconstruct the function which neither random sampling nor Monte Carlo will perform. Bayesian active sampling and Gaussian processes more generally perform well in regression when the priors over function spaces encoded in the kernel place sufficient probability mass over the function which you are hoping to infer. Mismatches in prior information can indeed hinder performance. If I was to diagnose your results I would start there and ask is the kernel appropriate and what is happening to the hyper parameters during optimisation. Bayesian optimisation however is used to find global maxima or minima. It is generally speaking used when the optimisation surface is assumed multimodal and it is desirable to both explore the space and exploit modes under a limited budget. Once again this is only useful when the kernel uses in BO incorporates some a priori knowledge of the space such as smoothness.
