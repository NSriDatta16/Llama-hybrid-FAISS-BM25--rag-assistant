Jaynes reasons that, given only this information, the most reasonable way to assign these probabilities is to choose the most uncertain probability distribution that satisfies all the requirements (i.e. observations, in this case the sample mean). Now, this is quite arbitrary, but I accept it as an intuitively compelling method. You say that you accept this method, but then you immediately reject it in the next paragraph. Of course it is true that the expected value of the probability distribution need not match the sample mean, but the whole content of the method just described (which you at first say you accept) is that he is matching the distribution moments to the sample moments in his constraints and then seeking the most uncertain distribution under those constraints . If you don't use this moment constraint, and just use a uniform distribution, then you are not using the method he just described. What is it about his method that you imagine you accept if not that?
