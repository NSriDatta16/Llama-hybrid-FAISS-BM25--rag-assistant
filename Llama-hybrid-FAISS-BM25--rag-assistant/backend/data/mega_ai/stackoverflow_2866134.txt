Even so, I agree with Andomar. Use two colums, low limit and high limit. If either value could be unknown, make those columns nullable. Alternatively, designate a default arbitrary minimum and maximum values, and use those values instead of nulls. (Doing this means you never have to mess with trinary logic, e.g. having to wrap everything with ISNULL or COALESCE.) Once you define your schema, there are tricks you can use to reduce storage space (such as compression and sparce columns).
