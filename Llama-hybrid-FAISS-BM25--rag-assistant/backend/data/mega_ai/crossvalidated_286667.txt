A vector autoregression (VAR) intends to model existing linear relationships in set of time series. On the other hand, Granger-causality is a concept (related to the relevance of other variables in forecasting another one), that can be tested, for two variables (for example, since it can be multivariate), using the linear models you cited. Specifically, the set up in a Granger-causality test you presented do not correspond to a VAR, since the latter must contain - in its reduced form - lags of both variables in a symmetric fashion. For example, a VAR(1) on your variables $a$ and $b$, would look like: $$ a_t=c_a+\beta_1^a a_{t-1}+\beta^a_2b_{t-1}+e^a_t\\ b_t=c_b+\beta_1^b b_{t-1}+\beta^b_2a_{t-1}+e^b_t $$ The system above together with some assumptions regarding the error terms completely defines a VAR(1) model. Now compare this with the set up you presented and the difference should be better illustrated.
