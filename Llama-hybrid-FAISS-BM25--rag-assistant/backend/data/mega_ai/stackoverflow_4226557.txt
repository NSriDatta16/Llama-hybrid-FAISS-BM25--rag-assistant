GoogleAppEngine Java WebService security

I'm working on small game in Java(using JApplet) and I want to implement highscores and achievements. I don't have dedicated server, so I decided to use GoogleAppEngine for storage of player data and after generation of highscores and achievements. I have already found out how to create WebServices on GoogleAppEngine, but I have a question regarding security... I don't want unathorized people to make calls to my WS... What kind of security I can implement to prevent other people to use this WS, only athorized client(which is my Applet) could post there. My Applet probably will be hosted on my personal web page and WS is going to run on GoogleAppEngine. Thanks in advance, Serhiy.
