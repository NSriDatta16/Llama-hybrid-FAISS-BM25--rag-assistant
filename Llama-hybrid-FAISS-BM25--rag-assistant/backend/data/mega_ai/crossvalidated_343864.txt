In a GARCH model, standardized residuals and raw residuals are not the same. Consider a GARCH(1,1) model for a time series $x_t$ with conditional mean $\mu_t$ and conditional variance $\sigma_t^2$: \begin{aligned} x_t &= \mu_t+u_t, \\ u_t &= \sigma_t \varepsilon_t, \\ \sigma_t^2 &= \omega + \alpha_1 u_{t-1}^2 + \beta_1 \sigma_{t-1}^2, \\ \varepsilon_t &\sim i.i.d.(0,1). \end{aligned} Raw residuals are empirical counterparts (estimates) of $u_t$ while standardized residuals are empirical counterparts of $\varepsilon_t$. You would expect the kurtosis of raw residuals to be higher than that of standardized residuals. This is why in GARCH models, standardized innovations (theoretical counterparts of standardized residuals) may be assumed to be normal even though raw innovations are heavy-tailed. When a heavy-tailed distribution is assumed for standardized innovations, the implied distribution of raw innovations has even heavier tails.
