How do I hide Mail Merge Row Results in MS Word?

I have a set of survey responses (scored 1-5) grouped by question. Right now I have the items being displayed with the respondent ID, the value of the response and a Sum at the bottom. I would love to be able to hide the results row and just show the question and the average (while hiding all of the individual responses). Here is how I have the Merge setup «TableGroup:ReportData:Description:Show» Fellow Response «TableStart:ReportData»«Responder_ID» «Response»«TableEnd:ReportData» Average 0.0 Sorry the table formatting was lost, but the Description is displayed on the top row, then you have 2 columns Fellow and Response. A single row which contains everything from the TableStart to the TableEnd and a row with the average. The formula that is currently showing the 0.0 is: =SUM(ABOVE)/COUNT(ABOVE) My hope is to hide the information between TableStart and TableEnd so I can show a question and the average without the individual responses displaying.
