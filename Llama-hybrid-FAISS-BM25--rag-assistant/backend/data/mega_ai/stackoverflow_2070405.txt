I found this article describing a very easy way to write coloured texts to the console. The article describes this little example which seems to do the trick (I took the liberty to improve it slightly): def colorize(text, color_code) "\e[#{color_code}m#{text}\e[0m" end def red(text); colorize(text, 31); end def green(text); colorize(text, 32); end # Actual example puts 'Importing categories [ ' + green('DONE') + ' ]' puts 'Importing tags [' + red('FAILED') + ']' Best seems to define some of the colours. You can extent the example when you need also different background colours (see bottom of article). When using Window XP, the author mentions the requirement of a gem called win32console .
