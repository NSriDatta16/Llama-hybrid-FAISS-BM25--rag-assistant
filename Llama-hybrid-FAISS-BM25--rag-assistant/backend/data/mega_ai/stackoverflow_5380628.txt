Let's get terms straight to make sure I understand your question. RSA is an algorithm for encryption. What you have asked for is authentication and authentication. RSA Inc., the company, provides products including 2-factor authentication. Encryption : a means of preventing anyone without the proper key from reading a message or channel Authentication : evidence that an agent is acting on behalf of a particular real user Authorization : evidence that a user or agent at the other end of the channel can legitimately request an exercise of power 2-factor authentication : proof of authenticity by two channels. This can be stronger evidence if the two channels are independent. There are a few ways to gain a level of confidence that the machine sending you messages is acting on behalf of the user (and not just malware installed on their computer or someone peeking over their shoulder) and that the user is who they say they are. Multiple independent channels are a good way. If you can reliably get the user's cell phone number then having them provide one set of credentials via a webpage, and then sending them a confirmation SMS with a link with an embedded secret, will establish a second channel. Malware on their computer can spoof one channel, but only if an attacker can get malware on both devices, would you get an authentication false positive.
