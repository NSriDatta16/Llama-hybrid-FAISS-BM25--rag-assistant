I haven't tried your script yet but it looks like you could solve this problem by removing the -w from the shebang line, which turns on global warnings, and adding in use warnings; , which only turns on warnings in its scope. See Should I turn on Perl warnings with the command-line switch or pragma? for details. Update: I have tried it and I cannot reproduce it either.
