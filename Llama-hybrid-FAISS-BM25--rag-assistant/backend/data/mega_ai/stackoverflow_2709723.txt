To make a union work for this you need to make sure you have the endianess issues correct, and you need to make sure that padding issues are correct (which will require non-standard #pragma statements or such). Even if you're not interested in portability (DirectX being Windows only), I'd still suggest that you use the inline functions for this purpose. You may need to have several very similar ones, but I might argue that the added complexity of those several functions is still less than the union . They're probably easier to get right, will have less chance of breaking (especially breaking silently) if you change compilers, and will be easier for the next guy reading the code to be confident that they're doing what he expects. As an aside - why did you use #pragma pack(2) instead of #pragma pack(1) ? And if you do use #pragma pack don't forget to 'save & restore' the original pack settings so other stuff doesn't behave unexpectedly: #pragma pack(push) #pragma pack(2) //... #pragma pack(pop)
