Unit of work/repository managers for NHibernate?

I'm a .NET developer by day, but have been working with Rails and Merb for the past year on my own side projects, so when it comes to MVC and ORMs, I'm more used to them and using ActiveRecord and DataMapper. I'm getting started with ASP.NET MVC, and I like what I see in NHibernate and Fluent NHibernate, but looking for a little bit more around how to best handle the unit of work or repository type model. I'd like something that is not huge on architecture. I've seen some projects like S#arp Architecture, but it looks kind of bloated. All I am really after is a simple way to manage connections and handling data retrieval/storage. A simple guide or sample application would even suffice.
