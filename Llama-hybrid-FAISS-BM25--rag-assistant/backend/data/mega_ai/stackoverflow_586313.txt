How do I trigger a change in JQuery?

I'm new to JQuery, so this is probably a very dumb question. I've used JQuery to make the elements in a table draggable. I asked a question about how to make it faster, and the best response I had so far was to disable droppable for all the cells, and only enable them when something is being dragged. Actually, for me, this makes a lot of sense as I only want to be able to drag a cell onto another cell in the same row. So I only need to apply droppable to the cells in the same row. So, I do this: $(document).ready ( function() { $('.draggable_div').draggable ( { addClasses: false, scroll: false, axis: 'x', start: function(event, ui) { $(this).css('background-color','#ddddff'); var $cells = $(this).parent().parent().children(); $cells.addClass("droppable_td"); } } ); ... Firebug is telling me that I've successfully added the "draggable_td" class to the cells in the right row. But how do I make that trigger the change? The way I have the code set up at the moment, droppable is attached like this: $('.droppable_td').droppable ( { addClasses: false, over: function(event, ui) { $(this).css('background-color', '#ccffcc'); }, out: function(event, ui) { $(this).css('background-color', null); }, drop: function(event, ui) { etc... I know that code works, because if I put that class in the appropriate elements in the HTML it all works (just very slowly). In other words: If I have all cells droppable from the start, it works. How can I dynamically change a cell to make it droppable as a result of an event?
