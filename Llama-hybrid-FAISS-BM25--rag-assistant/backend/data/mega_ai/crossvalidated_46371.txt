Dummy interaction variables are always non-stationary?

I want to know why we can include dummy interaction terms into time series models if they're always non-stationary? For example let $X_t$ be $I(0)$, $X_t \sim N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ and $D_t \in \{0,1\}$. Suppose the estimation window is $200$ and $D_t =0$ for $t=1,...,100$ and $D_t =1$ for $t=101,...,200$. The interaction is $D_tX_t$. We know that $E[D_tX_t|t\in\{1,...,100\}]=0$ $E[D_tX_t|t\in\{101,...,200\}]=\mu$ Therefore it's non-stationary? The variance also changes for this variable at $t=101$. This of course holds for intercept dummy variables ($D_t$ by themselves); however in this case the variance is stationary (but the mean changes).
