Sounds like a classic data mining task: Y_i = whether person i gets the question right, X_i (vector) = set of past performance of person i. Using a set of past data on n people (i=1,...,n), you can fit a predictive model of the sort Y = function of X. A variety of models can be used to predict the performance of a new person on this question. If you are short of data, then logistic regression and discriminant analysis would be good choices. If you have data on lots of people, then you could try more data-driven methods such as classification trees, k-nearest neighbors, or neural nets.
