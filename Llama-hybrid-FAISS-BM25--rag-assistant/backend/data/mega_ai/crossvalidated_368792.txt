why is calibration of my logistic regression s shaped?

I am simulating data to compare real and predicted probabilities from logistic regression like this: set.seed(2) library(simstudy) def however when I plot real vs. predicted probabilities, the relationship is not linear, but S-shaped. I think I assume linearity somewhere where I shouldn't. Why is this relationship s-shaped, and how can I get data where it is linear?
