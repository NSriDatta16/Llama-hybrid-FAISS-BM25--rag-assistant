It depends on which storage engine you're using. For most, BTREE is the default so specifying it doesn't really change anything. For storage engines such as MEMORY/HEAP and NDB, the default is to use HASH indexes by default. More information can be found here. Whether or not a B-tree or a HASH index is advantageous for you from a performance perspective depends on the data and how you're accessing it. If you know you're queries are going to target exactly one row or scattered individual rows, then a HASH index may be useful. Anything other than that, I generally prefer a BTREE index as the data is sorted and thus makes range queries and those that return multi-rows more efficient.
