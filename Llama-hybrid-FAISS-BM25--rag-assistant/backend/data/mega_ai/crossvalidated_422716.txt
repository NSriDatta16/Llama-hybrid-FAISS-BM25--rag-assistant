How to use just one tree in a random forest with the R package randomForest?

With the R package randomForest, I can get a forest for classification. With the function getTree(), I can get each tree of the forest. Now, my question is how to do classification for a new input data point x with just a specific tree, say the first tree of the forest. Thanks for your help.
