Quickest way to represent array in mysql for retrieval

I have an array of php objects that I want to store into a mysql database table. The only way I can think of is just have a table to represent the object with a unique id and a separate table to store the array (there could be a column array_id and an object_id) but retrieving would require a join I believe which could get expensive. Is there a better way? I don't care much about storage space or insertion time as much as retrieval time. I don't necessarily need this to work for associative arrays but if the solution could, that would be preferred.
