Is covariate significant in logistic regression

Im going to investigate if a disease have a negative impact on the development of children. The disease is the independent variable with additionally confounders. Tests from the study have shown that birth weight is significant different between the control group and group with the disease. If I do a logistic regression with the disease and birth weight as independent variables, I get birth weight as a significant variable. My question is that if birth weight differs between the groups, can that affect or be the reason that it is significant for the outcome? Can some bias have occurred?
