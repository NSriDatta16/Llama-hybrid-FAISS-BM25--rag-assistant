My advice sidesteps your efforts a bit, but I've been using Mercurial in exactly the same approach you've described here, and if it's not too much of a plan change, I'd encourage you to give using TortoiseHg a try. Mercurial works with file path based repositories exactly the same way it works with "served" repositories (e.g. it will recognize \\server\shared_repo\repo_path as a valid repository path to clone from.) As an additional point, from what I can tell, Mercurial's Windows support is pretty far along, whereas git still has some fringe compatibility issues (although it appears that you've addressed many of the biggest challenges to using git on Windows already)
