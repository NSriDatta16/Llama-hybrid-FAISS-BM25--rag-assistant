I do not know the answer for sure. But here are some thoughts. First, Java internally stores strings as char [] arrays containing the UTF-16 encoding of the string. This means that every character in the strings takes at least two bytes. So just in terms of raw storage, Java would have to copy around twice as much data as python strings. Python unicode strings are therefore the better test because they are similarly capable . Perhaps python stores unicode strings as UTF-8 encoded bytes. In that case, if all you are storing in these are ASCII characters, then again you'd have Java using twice as much space and therefore doing twice as much copying. To get a better comparison you should concatenate strings containing more interesting characters that require two or more bytes in their UTF-8 encoding.
