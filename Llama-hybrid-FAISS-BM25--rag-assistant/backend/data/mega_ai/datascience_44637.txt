Machine learning algorithm to classify matrices

I want to know what could be first choice for a machine learning algorithm to classify matrices. Each matrix belongs to either class A or class B. The classification problem is: To classify each matrix into either class A or class B (say signal matrix or noise matrix). Each matrix is arranged in a fashion where each row contains certain features of an object associated with the matrix. I obviously have thousands of such class A and class B matrices to train on. I will be really obliged if you could help. Thanks.
