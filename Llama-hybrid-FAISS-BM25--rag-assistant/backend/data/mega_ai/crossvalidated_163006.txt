Random forest: how to derive the characteristics of the predicted classes?

Decision Trees stratify the feature space into different regions and fit a basic model to each region (average for regression, most frequent class for classification). With this method it's not difficult to derive the characteristics of the individuals falling in each predicted class or even (I'm not sure) to derive the characteristics of the group of individuals that are missed. The problem for the decision trees is its accuracy. Random Forest can resolve this problem efficiently but is there any way to derive the 2 points above as in Decision Trees?
