In this scenario, you're going to use a one-sample t-test to determine if your sample mean of 7.1 is significantly different from your population mean of 6.8. Your response to Part A is correct. For Part B, calculate the following: t = [(sample mean - population mean)/sample standard deviation]*√n where n = number of observations in the sample, or 150 t = [(7.1 - 6.8)/0.23]*√150 t = 1.304*√150 = 15.97 Now, to determine if the answer is statistically significant, calculate degrees of freedom (df): df = n - 1 df = 149 Now see if 15.97 is greater than the critical value of .05. You'll need a t-distribution table to do this. In most cases, tables don't have specific values above 100, so go with the number closest to your df. However, never choose a number greater than your df. For example, if your table has critical values for df = 100 and df = 150, you'd need to choose 100 in this case as it is more conservative. (Some may probably disagree on this point and call me too stringent.) The critical value of t at .05 (two-tailed) for df = 100 is 1.984 (I'm referencing this table: http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/gerstman/StatPrimer/t-table.pdf ). 15.97 > 1.984 Reject H0. The sample suggests students sleep more than 6.8 hours per day on average.
