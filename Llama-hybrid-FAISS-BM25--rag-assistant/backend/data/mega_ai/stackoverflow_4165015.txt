Copy records to another recordset using Active Server Page

I'm programming in Classic ASP. I'm trying to do the paging. My backend is SQL CE 3.5. Unfortunetly, it doesn't support paging in SQL Query (Like row_number() in sql server). So I go with ASP Paging. But when i ask to the recordset, give me the first 10 records by setting the rs.PageSize and rs.AbsolutePage and all, it gives me all records. So I planned to copy only first 10 rows from the resultant recordset to another new recordset. So I coded like below: Set rsTemp = CopyRecordsetStructure(objRs) rsTemp.Open iRecordsShown = 0 Set objFields = objRs.Fields intFieldsCount = objFields.Count-1 Do While iRecordsShown Public Function CopyRecordsetStructure(ByVal rs) Dim rsTemp Set rsTemp = CreateObject("ADODB.Recordset") Set objFields = rsTemp.Fields intFieldCount = objFields.Count - 1 For Idx = 0 To intFieldCount rsTemp.Fields.Append objFields(Idx).Name, _ objFields(Idx).Type, _ objFields(Idx).DefinedSize Next Set CopyRecordsetStructure = rsTemp End Function The issue is i could not open the" rsTemp". It throws me error The connection cannot be used to perform this operation. It is either closed or invalid in this context. If I use some dummy query and connection it doesn't work. Please help to copy the records from one recordset to another new record set. Thanks in advance Ganesh.
