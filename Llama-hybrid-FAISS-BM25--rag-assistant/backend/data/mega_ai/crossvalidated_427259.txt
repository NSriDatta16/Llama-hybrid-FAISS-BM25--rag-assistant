Image classification with an associated matrix

I have a dataset of images with 9 different classes. However, there are different categories with the same type of associated image and only can be differentiated with an associated matrix in my specific problem. I want to train a neural network with the images and the associated matrix as inputs. What type of architecture is good to use? Or where can I find bibliography about it? Thanks for the help. regards.
