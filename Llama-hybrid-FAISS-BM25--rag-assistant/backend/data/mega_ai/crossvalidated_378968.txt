If you want to minimize a function, we use Gradient Descent. For eg. in Deep learning we want to minimize the loss hence we use Gradient Descent. If you want to maximize a function, we use Gradient Ascent. For eg. in Reinforcement Learning - Policy Gradient methods our goal is to maximize the reward function hence we use Gradient Ascent.
