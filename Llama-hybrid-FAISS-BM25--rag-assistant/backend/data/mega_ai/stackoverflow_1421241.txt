Using accordion and "sexy combo" plugin

I am pretty new and got a following problem... case: We got an accordion and within this accordion we got an sexy-combo-box $(document).ready(function(){ $("#accordion").accordion(); $("#basic-combo").sexyCombo(); }); Form A Please fill out the following: 1. What cookies do you like? jelly biscuit chocolate 2. What ice cream do you like? strawberry chocolate vanilla 3. please tell us, how did you get attention to this site? Form B 4. Please tell us the minimum and max amount of chocolate that you eat: min max required time (in minutes) that you take to eat the amount problem: - accordion works fine, but sexy combo does not, you can just see the "normal" selection-box already tried/strange phenomenon: - removing $("#accordion").accordion(); causes that sexy combo works possible reason: - accordion starts before the sexy combo object ...after all the sexy combo object is not being loaded or some sort of "hidden" by the accordion object does someone has an idea what the reason for this behavior could be ? or how to fix it ? After reading some topics here I found smth. out like a jQuery live plugin, and that maybe I do need this plugin in order to handle it that when accordion is loaded, the sexy-combo plugin loads too. best regards leejin
