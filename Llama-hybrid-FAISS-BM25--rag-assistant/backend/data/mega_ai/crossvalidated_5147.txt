Finding the mode of a function by MCMC sampling

When trying to find the mode of a nonnegative function $f$ (i.e. maximize the function), one way to do it is to sampling the function viewed as an unnormalized density of some distribution via MCMC. Suppose we have had a sufficiently long sequence of samples via this method, I was wondering how to determine the mode from the samples? Specifically, as we know that a part taken from the end of the sequence will be assumed to be approximately subject to the distribution corresponding to the target function $f$. As far as I have thought already, there might be two choices for the estimation of the mode of the function: take the last sample in the original sequence, take a small subsequence from the end of the original sequence and evaluate the function f on every sample in the subsequence and pick the one with the maximal function value. I saw the first choice from my class note, but the second was my first thought before looking at the note. So I was wondering what choice for the mode of the target function might be reasonable or better and why? Possible to have any references on this? You don't have to limit your scope to the two I just mentioned. Thanks and regards!
