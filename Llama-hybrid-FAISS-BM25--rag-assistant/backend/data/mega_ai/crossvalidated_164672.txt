How to analyze skewed and unskewed data on SPSS?

Study design: I have shown participants a series of photos of themselves vs. other people's bodies (original and manipulated), and asked them to find the original. Their responses were recorded and they filled out body image questionnaires. IV: - Body Image Anxiety (questionnaire scores) - Self vs. Other body stimuli DV: - Error Rate (magnitude of error from 0 to 1) Participants were shown a series of photos one at a time, and pressed space bar when they think they see the original photo. 10 manipulated photos (5 fatter and 5 skinnier manipulations) and the original were shown in each trial. The photos manipulated the most were coded as 1 and 11, and the original photo was coded as 6. Error rate = |actual - entered|/actual -> so if a participant chose photo 5 (a manipulation), the error rate would be |5-6|/6 = .1667 Error rates were separated into 1) error rate of seeing own photos; 2) error rate of other people's photos; 3) combined error rate from averaging the self and other error rates Problem: I was about to use repeated-measure ANOVA to analyze the data, but found that the error rate for self failed the normal distribution assumption (it's positively skewed). I was taught in lectures that I should only use repeated-measure ANOVA given the distribution was normal. Should I transform the self error rate using the log10 function and analyze it as such? If not, how should I go about analyzing the data?
