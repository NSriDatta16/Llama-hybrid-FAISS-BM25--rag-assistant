Set included PHP and HTML content to a variable

I am working on a small MVC "framework", which will simply provide a more organized workspace for me, as I've found I love CakePHP but only for it's organization. Now, I'm trying to replicate the layouts (which contain and ,) and I'm curious how I would be able to load a mixed PHP and HTML file... save what would normally be outputted to the browser to a variable... set the variables mentioned inside the variable, and then output the layout variable and have PHP use the variables inside it to setup the layout exactly how I want it. Any ideas?
