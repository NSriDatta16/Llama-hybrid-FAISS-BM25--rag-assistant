Some ecology might help answer the "Why" behind this question. The reason why exponential distribution is used for modeling survival is due to the life strategies involved in organisms living in nature. There's essentially two extremes with regard to survival strategy with some room for the middle ground. Here's an image that illustrates what I mean (courtesy of Khan Academy): This graph plots surviving individuals on the Y axis, and "percentage of maximum life expectancy" (a.k.a. approximation of the individual's age) on the X axis. Type I is humans, which model organisms which have an extreme level of care of their offspring ensuring very low infant mortality. Often these species have very few offspring because each one takes a large amount of the parents time and effort. The majority of what kills Type I organisms is the type of complications that arise in old age. The strategy here is high investment for high payoff in long, productive lives, if at the cost of sheer numbers. Conversely, Type III is modeled by trees (but could also be plankton, corals, spawning fish, many types of insects, etc) where the parent invests relatively little in each offspring, but produces a ton of them in the hopes that a few will survive. The strategy here is "spray and pray" hoping that while most offspring will be destroyed relatively quickly by predators taking advantage of easy pickings, the few that survive long enough to grow will become increasingly difficult to kill, eventually becoming (practically) impossible to be eaten. All the while these individuals produce huge numbers of offspring hoping that a few will likewise survive to their own age. Type II is a middling strategy with moderate parental investment for moderate survivability at all ages. I had an ecology professor who put it this way: "Type III (trees) is the 'Curve of Hope', because the longer an individual survives, the more likely it becomes that it will continue to survive. Meanwhile Type I (humans) is the 'Curve of Despair', because the longer you live, the more likely it becomes that you will die."
