timeseries analysis with changing correlations between independent and dependent variables

In multivariate timeseries analysis where the correlation between independent variables and the dependent variable changes (different variables have changing explanatory power) over time what methods are typically used to account for the changing relationship aside from reoptimizing? Is there a way to pair the rolling correlation $(x_n, y)$ with the strength of the signal $x_n$ especially in modern machine learning methods? Is the use of regime switching useful (I think this might be difficult if there are a large number of independents due to segmentation)? Regards
