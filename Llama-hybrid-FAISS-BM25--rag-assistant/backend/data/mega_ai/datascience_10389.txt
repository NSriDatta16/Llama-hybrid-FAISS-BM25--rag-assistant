How do we know Kernels are successful in making data linearly Separable?

When we have linearly inseparable datasets and we are using machine learning algorithms such as SVMs, we use kernels to implicitly map datapoints into a feature space that makes them linearly separable. But how do we know if a kernel has indeed, implicitly , been successful in making the datapoints linearly separable in the new feature space? What is the guarantee?
