There is no reason accounting for the use of convex linear combinations of coefficients in order to "average" two models. At best, you could consider the three coefficients for each dataset are realizations of the same three random variables, and you would be interested in the distribution of each random variable. What I would do would be to fit the model again with a new dataset (of size $n$) consisting of a random sample of size $\lambda\times n$ taken from the B dataset, and $\left(1-\lambda\right)\times n$ of the A dataset. You could use $\lambda=\frac{2}{3}$ for instance.
