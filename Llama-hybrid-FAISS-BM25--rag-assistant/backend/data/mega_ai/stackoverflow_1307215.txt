Algorithm that takes 2 'similar' matrices and 'aligns' one to another

First of all, the title is very bad, due to my lack of a concise vocabulary. I'll try to describe what I'm doing and then ask my question again. Background Info Let's say I have 2 matrices of size n x m , where n is the number of experimental observation vectors, each of length m (the time series over which the observations were collected). One of these matrices is the original matrix, called S , the other which is a reconstructed version of S , called Y . Let's assume that Y properly reconstructs S . However due to the limitations of the reconstruction algorithm, Y can't determine the true amplitude of the vectors in S , nor is it guaranteed to provide the proper sign for those vectors (the vectors might be flipped). Also, the order of the observation vectors in Y might not match the original ordering of the corresponding vectors in S . My Question Is there an algorithm or technique to generate a new matrix which is a 'realignment' of Y to S , so that when Y and S are normalized, the algorithm can (1) find the vectors in Y that match the vectors in S and restore the original ordering of the vectors and (2) likewise match the signs of the vectors? As always, I really appreciate all help given. Thanks!
