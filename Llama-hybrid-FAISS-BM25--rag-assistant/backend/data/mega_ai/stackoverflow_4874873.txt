DBGhost settings xml

I am working on a demo build server that will automate build and deployment processes. I am attempting to automate the merging of database changes to an existing database without compromising static seed data in the target database. Therefore the approach I am taking is to build the new database without the reference data only and the seed data from the target database. Then compare and sync this. The issue arises with the tool I am using DBGhost. To facilitate the merging of static data I need the agent(microsoft service) that is running the tool to check the setting "Automatically Select Tables". After speaking with tech support with Innovartis I was told there is a settings.xml file that reflects setting changes made in the GUI. However it not apparent where this is located and also how to incorporate this into an MSBuild/TeamCity automated build process. Anybody have an experience of this or does anybody have any suggestions on this? Thank you in advance for your help.
