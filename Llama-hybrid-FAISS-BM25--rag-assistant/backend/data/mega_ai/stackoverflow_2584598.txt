Linq SqlMethods.Like fails

I'm following the tips here , trying to leverage the statement that the sql doesn't get created until the enumerator is tripped. However I get the following error on the code below. I'm using Linq2Entities, not linq2sql. Is there a way to do this in Linq2entities? Method 'Boolean Like(System.String, System.String)' cannot be used on the client; it is only for translation to SQL. query = db.MyTables.Where(x => astringvar.Contains(x.Field1)); if (!String.IsNullOrEmpty(typeFilter)) { if (typeFilter.Contains('*')) { typeFilter = typeFilter.Replace('*', '%'); query = query.Where(x=> SqlMethods.Like(x.Type, typeFilter)); } else { query = query.Where(x => x.Type == typeFilter); } } Notes: db is a entity mapping to a sql server.
