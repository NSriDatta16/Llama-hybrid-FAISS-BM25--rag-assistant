Determining the lag order of an autoregression model

I'm trying to fit my time series data, which have 37 entries, with an autoregression model. The data look like: I just loop over 1 to 18, each of which is used as the order of AR model.

To choose the best order, shall I use 4 or 18? The autocorrelation function is like: And the partial autocorrelation function is like:
