Calculating Probability in Bayesian Networks

I'm trying to work out how to calculate the outcome probability $\Pr(Y)$ for the following BN: I know the joint probability $\Pr(a,b,c,Y) = \Pr(a) \Pr(b \mid a) \Pr(c) \Pr(Y \mid b,c)$ (which I'll call $J$ from now on for ease) and then I applied Bayes' theorem (steps included here) to $\Pr(Y \mid b,c)$ to get $\frac{\Pr(b \mid Y,c)\Pr(c \mid Y) \Pr(Y)}{\Pr(b \mid c) \Pr(c)}$ which can then be inserted into the joint probability equation and used to find $\Pr(Y)$ . Is this correct? Are there any further steps I can take to simplify this solution? Thank you!
