Predictive models with data that have elements inside them?

I'm getting more experience in building predictive models like trees and random forests, but most of my experience is using data that is basically single observations (rows) with many variables (columns). How do I deal with making predictions about things that could potentially have a variable number of objects inside of it. Here is an example: Say I want to predict if an insurance claim is fraudulent. That claim could contain several items inside of it. One claim could be one for theft of an Xbox and a television. Another claim could be for theft of 12 individual pieces of jewelry. The claims have claim level data like total amounts of losses to be paid, but there are also several individual level data elements inside with their own values and attributes. What is the best way to structure the data or model to make a prediction about the entire claim? Do I need a claim level variable called HasXbox? or HasJewelry? Do I need a variable like that for every possible item that could be in the claim?
