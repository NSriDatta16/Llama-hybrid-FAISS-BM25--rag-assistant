As the previous answer suggested, the varchar field makes things a little more difficult as it only uses enough storage for the string it contains in each row. After entering some sample data, a database such as MySQL (i assume others do this too) will be able to tell you the average size of each row. Also, you need to keep in mind any indexes you create which will take up additional space. Again, using a range of sample data should give a rough indication to extrapolate the size estimates. Edit: As many of the answers here suggest using sample data, please see my answer to and older questions relating to this: PHP Script to populate MySQL tables
