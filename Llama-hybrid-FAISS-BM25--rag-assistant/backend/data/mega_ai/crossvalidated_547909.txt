Statistical model for quantities that add up to 1

I want to create a model for quantities $z$ that live in a probability simplex, that is, they are nonnegative and always add up to 1: $$ S = \left\{z \in \mathbb{R}^{k} : z_1 + \dots + z_{k} = 1, z_i \ge 0 \text{ for } i = 1, \dots, k \right\},$$ where $k$ is relatively small, let's say $k \leq 5$ . Additionally, I know these values come from a black box process where I only know some details about it, e.g. an input array of the form: $(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ with additional features $(\theta_1, \ldots, \theta_k)$ where again, $(x_1, \ldots, x_k)$ are nonnegative and add up to one (notice it's also of dimension $k$ ). For modelling purposes let's assume we got samples of all these arrays ( $x$ , $z$ and $\theta$ ) as time series (always all values measured at the same time), and additionally we know that: There's a dependence of the $z$ array from the $x$ 's and $\theta$ 's, but with a lag, that is, $z_t$ depends on the previous time values of $x$ and $\theta$ . This lag is not constant over time but it can't grow indefinitely either, let's say it's a maximum of $N$ previous timestamps where $N$ The $z$ and $x$ quantities are relative rates, not really probabilities The output $z$ is somehow a mixture of the input $x$ of previous timestamps, e.g. $z_i^T$ will depend strongly on the respective $x_i^{t}$ for recent values $T-N \leq t \leq T-1$ , and their associated parameters inside $\theta_i^{t}$ (that correspond to the $i$ t-h quantity). But it won't be necessarily inside their convex combination, i.e. it could happen that the $z_i^{T}$ lies outside the minimum and maximum values of the recent $x_i^{t}$ values I think that taking ideas from the following fields can be useful: Graphical models - with $k$ (or $k-1$ ) output nodes Neural networks - use a multilayer perceptron using an idea similar to the softmax activation function Generalized additive models (create something similar to the multinomial logit model but with a response variable that isn't a classification response but probabilities) Multivariate time series - but I'm not familiar with ways to impose the bounds that the series are between 0 and 1 and also the add-up-to-1 condition into the modelling framework And I wonder if there's already some literature or known model for this kind of processes (nonnegative continuous variables that add up to a fixed quantity), but my search hasn't brought results yet. Do you have any pointers to relevant modelling approaches?
