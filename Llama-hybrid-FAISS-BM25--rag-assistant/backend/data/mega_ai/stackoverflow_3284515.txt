Improving your coverage is a good goal. Don't get too focused on the 100% number: it can be very misleading. More coverage is better than less, but even at 100%, you could be missing many aspects of your code (see http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200710/flaws_in_coverage_measurement.html for examples in Python). And the last 5% of coverage may not tell you as much as you would like. As for your exceptions, you'll need a way to force an exception to be thrown from one of your methods. A common way to do this is to mock out the implementation so you can decide what the sub-objects will actually do during the test, without being tied to a particular implementation.
