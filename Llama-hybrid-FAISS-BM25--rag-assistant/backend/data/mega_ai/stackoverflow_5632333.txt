If I understand you correctly, you want to have a main page that contains a list of data, and then a details page whose contents are dependent on the item that you clicked in the main page. The answer to your question is then "yes". There are a number of ways to achieve this, some of which include global variables, a custom navigation service, storing a value in isolated storage and so on. My personal preference is to use the context of the NavigationService and to pass an ID or an index in the query string for the target page. Your call to navigate to the details page then looks like this: Application.Current.Navigate(string.Format("/Views/DetailsView.xaml?id={0}", id)); In the target page, you override the OnNavigatedTo handler to retrieve the value that you passed and then process it accordingly (i.e. look up the value from your database, or retrieve it from a data collection). protected override void OnNavigatedTo(NavigationEventArgs e) { if (this.NavigationContext.QueryString.ContainsKey("id")) { var id = this.NavigationContext.QueryString["id"]; // TODO: Do what you need to with the ID. } else { // I use this condition to handle creating new items. } }
