AJAX ComboBox Control

Can anyone suggest an AJAX ComboBox control that will allow the dropdown to suggest items where the string typed in appears anywhere in the string not just at the beginning. Most of the controls I have found only search at the beginning. Infragistics is supposed to work by searching anywhere, but the performance is poor, and I haven't gotten any help from their tech support.
