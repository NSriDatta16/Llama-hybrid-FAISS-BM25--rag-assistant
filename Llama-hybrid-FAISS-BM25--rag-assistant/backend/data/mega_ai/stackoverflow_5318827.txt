how important is it that libraries treat utf16xx and utf32xx as equal peers to utf8?

does any signifigant interchange take place in formats other than ascii/utf8? are there any fields where utf16xx and utf32xx are used heavily? i ask as a writer of multiple libraries that work on unicode text, and the burden of supporting all five major variants is quite high compared to the perceived utility.
