Organization of simple project

I want to create a simple mvc application. It's typical task and very simular with phpmyadmin. I have a table and a few operations delete, edit, create new row. Name Gender Age [delete] [edit] Alex Male 20 [delete] [edit] Elza Female 23 [New person] When edit or New person clicked by user application show the following page Name [........] Gender [........] Age [........] [Save] I'm very new in asp.net and mvc, can anyone suggest a right project organization or give links to simular applications?
