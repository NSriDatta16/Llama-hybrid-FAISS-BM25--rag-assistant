The only way I'm aware of to do this is to use a DLL with a shared section... // This goes in a DLL loaded by all apps that want to share the data #pragma data_seg (".sharedseg") long long myShared8Bytes = 0; // has to be initialized or this fails #pragma data_seg() Then, you add the following to the link command for the dll: /SECTION:sharedseg,RWS I am also curious why you want this...
