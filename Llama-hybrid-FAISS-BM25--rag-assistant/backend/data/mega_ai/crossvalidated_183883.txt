In general, random forest is not an additive model (see http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/ISLR%20Sixth%20Printing.pdf chapter 8 for a special case when it is) so the influence of a single variable can't be properly assessed independently of the others. You might try, for example, the Generalized Additive Models (GAM) approach if you want to separately describe influence of every predictor, but the model's performance might not be as good as with RF. However, you might fix the other predictors on some selected levels, and - using e.g. the predict function - see how insulin affects the risk of diabetes "conditionally" on those other variables. By considering several different combinations of predictors other than insulin, you might get some approximate knowledge about insulin's influence and its interaction with other variables.
