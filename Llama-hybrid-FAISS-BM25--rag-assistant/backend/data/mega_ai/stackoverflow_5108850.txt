Unable to resolve drawable in attribute "src"

I'm having a problem when trying to load various images to an image button using an xml file in the drawable-mdpi folder. It worked for one button but doesn't work for the other. The code works for the second image button but not the first, I get the error, " main.xml: Unable to resolve drawable "C:...workspace\AndroidAlarm\res\drawable-mdpi\keyEntry.xml" in attribute "src". I did the exact same thing in the first imageButton that I did for the second. The xml file for the second button (working one) looks like: and for the one that doesn't work, it looks like: The only difference between the two is the images being passed in. All the images are found in the drawabl-mdpi folder. I can't figure out why it works for the second image button but not the first. the xml code for the two buttons looks like: Thanks in advance!
