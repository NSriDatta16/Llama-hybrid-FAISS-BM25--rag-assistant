For logistic regression you use the asymptotic distribution of the log of likelihood ratio test statistic for variable selection (testing hypotheses or model selection). In the case of linear regression, due to the assumed normality for the error distribution, there is no need to use asymptotics, and the likelihood ratio test static trivially reduces to a ratio of chi-squares, that is, F-distribution.
