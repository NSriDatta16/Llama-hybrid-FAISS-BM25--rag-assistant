Store XML fragment in Project Resources

I'm trying to follow a tutorial on openXML here . I don't follow the bit where he talks about storing an XML fragment in project resources . He can then obtain a copy of the XML fragment easily with String content = Properties.Resources.XmlContentForEmbedImage; I don't know how to do this, and I've googled without finding anything? What does store the XML fragment in project resources mean?
