Javascript does not work in Opera - strange

have a javascript code to exec on a page - all works fine in Firefox, IE, Chrome but does not work in Opera 10+. Strange is that this javascript works fine in previous versions of Opera (9.xx is fine) and even more strange is that when I lunch Dragonfly on Opera 10+ the javascript works also fine (and Dragonfly does not throw any errors). Have anyone experienced this behavior and found any solution/workaround? As the js code is quite complicated, huge and part of it dynamically generated I am not posting any sample of it - my question is just about the behavior and if someone has any experiencies with debuging/resolving. Thanks, Jan
