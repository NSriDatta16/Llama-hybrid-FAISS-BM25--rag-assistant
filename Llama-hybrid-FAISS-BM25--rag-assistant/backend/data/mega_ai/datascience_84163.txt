How to set a class_weight Dictionary for Random Forest?

I'm dealing with an unbalanced dataset, so I decided to use a weight dictionary for classification. Documentation says that a weight dict must be defined as shown below: https://imbalanced-learn.org/stable/generated/imblearn.ensemble.BalancedRandomForestClassifier.html weight_dict = [{0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 5}, {0: 1, 1: 1}, {0: 1, 1: 1}] So, since I want to predict 12 classes which are located in the last column. I assume that the setting would be like: weight_dict = [{0: 1, 1: 5.77390289e-01}, {0: 1, 1: 6.48317326e-01}, {0: 1, 1: 1.35324885e-01}, {0: 1, 1: 2.92665797e+00}, {0: 1, 1: 5.77858906e+01}, {0: 1, 1: 1.73193507e+00}, {0: 1, 1: 9.27828244e+00}, {0: 1, 1: 1.18766082e+01}, {0: 1, 1: 8.99009985e+01}, {0: 1, 1: 6.39833279e+00}, {0: 1, 1: 2.55347077e+01}, {0: 1, 1: 9.47015372e+02}] Honestly, I don't clearly understand the notation of the first indicators, I mean the: 0:1 of {0: 1, 1: 1} or the: 1: value. Do they represent column position, label order? What is the right way to set it? I'll be grateful for your insights.
