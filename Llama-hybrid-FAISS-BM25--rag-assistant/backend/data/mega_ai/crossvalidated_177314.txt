Factor extraction methods: Harris and Image extraction

Is Harris's (1962) extraction method considered a form of principal component analysis (PCA) or factor analysis (FA)? What about image extraction? I am using SAS and the documentation says : HARRIS | H yields Harris component analysis of $\mathbf{S}^{-1}\mathbf{RS}^{-1}$ (Harris 1962), a noniterative approximation to canonical component analysis. IMAGE | I yields principal component analysis of the image covariance matrix, not the image analysis of Kaiser (1963, 1970) or Kaiser and Rice (1974). A nonsingular correlation matrix is required. I also found an additional reference in an outdated SAS technical manual that says: The problem of factor score indeterminacy has led several factor analysts to propose methods yielding components that can be considered approximations to common factors. Since these components are defined as linear combinations, they are computable. The methods include Harris component analysis and image component analysis. The advantage of producing determinate component scores is offset by the fact that, even if the data fit the common factor model perfectly, component methods do not generally recover the correct factor solution. You should not use any type of component analysis if you really want a common factor analysis (Dziuban and Harris 1973; Lee and Comrey 1979). Based on the labeling of the methods in the documentation and the description in the tech manual, I would be inclined to assume they are PCA methods. However, after doing some reading it appears that both methods attempt to decompose the shared or common variance (a distinguishing characteristic of FA). I am currently not concerned about picking the best method but just want to understand the roots of these two methods. Unfortunately I do not have access to the journals where the original papers about the methods were published.
