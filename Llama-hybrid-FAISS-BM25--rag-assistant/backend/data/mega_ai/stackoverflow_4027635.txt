Do browsers preserve order of inputs with same name on GET/POST?

I have this HTML code with multiple input s with the same name: The order of the values is important. Does the HTML spec define that user agents have to preserve this order, and if yes, do the common (market share > 1%) browsers follow this definition? Bonus points if someone knows if WSGI and especially Django preserve the order server-side :-) Thanks!
