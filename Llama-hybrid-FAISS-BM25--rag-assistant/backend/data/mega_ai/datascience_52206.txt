Which animal has similar brain complexity to VGGNet

I know that it sounds weird, but I read somewhere that VGGnet has roughly 14.5k neurons and 138/144M parameters depending on the exact architecture as it's one of the biggest. Also I read here , that the biggest neural networks trained on super computers have roughly 80M neurons, which is similar to frog's brain. If we had to compare the complexity of VGGNet to brain of some kind of animal (even simple one) what would it be?
