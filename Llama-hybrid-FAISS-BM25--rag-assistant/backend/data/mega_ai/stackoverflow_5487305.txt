WebService non-standard Authorization Type

I have a service provider that requires a non-standard Authorization Type for their web service. Instead of Basic, Digest, NTLM, etc., they require "Basic API Access.". I have tried the code below and used Fiddler to check the web service request. It does not seem that any custom strings can be used Binding avail = new Binding(); avail.Url = "https://amer.webservicesxx.com/Availability"; NetworkCredential netCredential = new NetworkCredential("abc", "def"); Uri uri = new Uri(avail.Url); CredentialCache cred = new CredentialCache(); cred.Add(uri, "Basic API Access", netCredential); avail.Credentials = cred; SearchRsp response = avail.service(request); POST https://amer.webservicesxx.com/Availability HTTP/1.1 User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; MS Web Services Client Protocol 4.0.30319.1) VsDebuggerCausalityData: uIDPo+CJPwpspBxKp939c...

Authorization: Basic API Access/dUFQSS04NDA0NTk2MDk6WiFyYzBuZDg0... ...line in the header. If I just use "Basic" it adds the Authorization line properly, but is rejected by the service provider. Is this the correct syntax to add an Authorization: header to the Soap transaction?
