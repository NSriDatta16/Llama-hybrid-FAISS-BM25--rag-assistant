Is there a way of obtaining 95% confidence intervals for the bias-corrected estimate of the c statistic?

I ran a binary logistic regression and then used the boostrap internal validation procedure, implemented in Frank Harrel's RMS package in R. I saw a couple of studies having used boostrap validation and then given the 95%CI of their optimism corrected c-index. I was wondering if there was a way to obtain it. Thanks!
