What is LDAP? What are the scenarios where LDAP is the right choice? At its core, LDAP is a protocol for accessing objects that are suitable for storage in a directory. Whether something is "suitable" is an entirely subjective determination that's left up to implementers, but typically this means collections of many objects that each have infrequently (or never) updated data , where each object has an obvious or canonical way to be looked up: a phone book (look up by name or by phone number) titles in a library (look up by title, author, etc.) tenants in a building (look up by floor, suite, name, etc.) and so on. Note that LDAP itself is just a protocol and doesn't provide any actual storage -- in much the same way, HTTP doesn't imply anything about whether you're using Apache, Jetty, Tomcat, Mongrel, et al. as a web server. (One problem with LDAP in general is the confusing reuse of names to mean different things. Wikipedia has a good section on this.)
