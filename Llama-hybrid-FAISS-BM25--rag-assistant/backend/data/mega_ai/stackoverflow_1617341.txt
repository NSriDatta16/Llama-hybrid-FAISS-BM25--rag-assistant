Use webstorage (you can client-side store around 5MB of text or binary data) Firefox demo: http://codebase.es/test/webstorage.html DOM Storage is supported in these web browsers: Internet Explorer 8 Firefox 2 for sessionStorage, 3.5 for localStorage Safari 4 Just google for sessionStorage and localStorage objects. Also modern webkit browsers supports client-side sql. Edit: I'm not sure about what you want to do but using AJAX you can store everything in javascript variables and serverside databases or sessions are a good choice.
