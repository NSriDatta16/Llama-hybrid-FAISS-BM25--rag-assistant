File upload with temp iframe and Prototype event handlers

I'm working on a script that will submit form files (images) through a temporary iFrame and then return thumbnails of the images, which are then moved from the iFrame to the main document. This works fine. But I am also embedding a link which the user can click to remove the image if desired. This link uses Prototype to send a request to delete the image: X // When I load this, however, the event listener is always ignored. If I load the same code via ajax without using the iframe, it works fine. I'm assuming this is because the event handler is not being registered when it is moved from the iframe to the main document. But I'm not sure how to get around that... Any tips on making something like this work?
