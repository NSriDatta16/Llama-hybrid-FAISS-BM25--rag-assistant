That more comments are better. I've always tried to make my code as readable as possible--mainly because I'm almost certainly the guy that's going to fix the bug that I let slip by. So in years past, I used to have paragraphs after paragraphs of comments. Eventually it dawned on me that there's a point where more comments--no matter how neatly structured--add no value and actually becomes a hassle to maintain. These days, I take the table-of-contents + footnotes approach and everyone's happier for it.
