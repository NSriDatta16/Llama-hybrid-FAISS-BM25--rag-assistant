First of all, Trapping Ctrl-Alt-Del (Secure Attention Sequence) and disabling it are two different things. Despite misconceptions of many it is possible to disable SAS. Here are 3 ways to do it: Set HKCU/Software/Microsoft/Windows/CurrentVersion/Policies/System/DisableTaskMgr = 1 Replace msgina.dll with your own or write a keyboard driver. Go to the Start menu, select Run, and type "gpedit.msc" to run the Group Policy editor. Look in User Configuration | Administrative Templates | System and you'll find a section called Ctrl+Alt+Del Options - "Remove Task Manager" In order to trap SAS, you could write a GINA stub, create a keyboard driver or replace TaskMgr.exe These requirements arise mainly for embedded systems and you have control over how the WinXP image is made.
