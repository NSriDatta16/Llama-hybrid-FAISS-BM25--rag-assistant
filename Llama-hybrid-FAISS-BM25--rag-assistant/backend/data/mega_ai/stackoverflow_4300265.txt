IMO the best way to have an EAR/WAR deployed on any application server is to use Maven to build an EAR and Cargo Maven plugin for redeploying. The reason why I would use it is that it's totally IDE-independent and can use it both in development and my continuous integration server. pom.xml fragment of EAR/WAR module for Glassfish: org.codehaus.cargo cargo-maven2-plugin 1.0.2 glassfish2x installed ${glassfish.home} ${glassfish.password} installed ${project.build.directory}/${project.build.finalName}.${project.packaging} Redeploy command: mvn cargo:redeploy -Dglassfish.home=/path/to/glassfish/-Dglassfish.password=adminadmin -DskipTests=true -o You should learn about Maven 2 if you don't know what it is.
