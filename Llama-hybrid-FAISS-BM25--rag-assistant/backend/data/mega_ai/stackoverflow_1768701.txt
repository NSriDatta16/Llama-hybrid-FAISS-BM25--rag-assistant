Submitting causes "Validation Error: Value is not valid"

Pals, I got stuck again while my web development, I am providing multiple selection list to user for selecting many option. A Fragment of JSF Page but the problem is that when submit the page I am getting error on console sourceId=maintainForm:associatedAS[severity=(ERROR 2), summary=(maintainForm:associatedAS: Validation Error: Value is not valid), detail=(maintainForm:associatedAS: Validation Error: Value is not valid)] I am not able to figure out why this is happening, the item I am displaying in list is not string so I have written converter 'asConverter' for converting values from other objects to string and vice-versa. Also the Value I given above in tag ' #{maintainForm.selectedAS} ' is of type List (selectedAS). Any kind of help appreciated. Thank you.
