When you are forecasting , you typically aim at minimizing some loss function with your point forecast. One very popular such loss function is the MSE. Again in forecasting, you often have rather weak signals. For instance, yes, there will be a seasonal pattern to sales of certain products, but the seasonal effect may be weak compared to noise, e.g, for slow movers. In such a case, it may make sense to use a non-seasonal model. You will miss out on the (present, but weak) seasonal signal, but you may get a lower MSE. I wrote a little paper illustrating this effect with simulated time series ( "Sometimes It's Better to Be Simple than Correct", Kolassa, 2016, Foresight , 40:20-26 ). Also, here is a little presentation of mine on the paper .
