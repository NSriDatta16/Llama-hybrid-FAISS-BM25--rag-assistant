Actually, it's usually called incremental learning. The question has come up before and is pretty well answered here : A few implementation details for a Support-Vector Machine (SVM) . In brief, it's possible but not easy, you would have to change the library you are using or implement the training algorithm yourself. I found two possible solutions, SVMHeavy and LaSVM , that supports incremental training. But I haven't used either and don't know anything about them.
