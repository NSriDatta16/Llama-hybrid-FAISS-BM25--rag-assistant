Using standard datasets is good practice when you can. Here's an example where I will test the hypothesis that the average predicted price of cars--given mileage, weight, and length--is less or equal to \$5,500 (or $H_0: \mathbb E[Y \vert X] \le 5,500$): sysuse auto, clear reg price mpg weight length margins, post test _cons==5500 display "Ho: E[Y|X] Here's is the intuition. First, run the regression and calculate the average expected price with margins . Do the the corresponding two-sided Wald test and use the results to calculate the test statistic and p -value for the one-sided test. Here's the nitty gritty. The Wald test is an F test with 1 numerator degree of freedom and 70 denominator degrees of freedom (since we have 74 observations and 4 coefficients). The Studentâ€™s t distribution with d degrees of freedom squared is equivalent to the F distribution with 1 numerator degree of freedom and d denominator degrees of freedom. Since the original F test has 1 numerator degree of freedom, the square root of the F statistic is the absolute value of the t statistic for the one-sided test. We just need to determine whether this t statistic is positive or negative, which you can do with the sign() function applied to the differences. Then, using the ttail() function on the F statistic from the test command, you can calculate the p -value for the one-sided test. For completeness, if you want to test $H_0: \mathbb E[Y \vert X] \ge 5,500$, you can use display "Ho: E[Y|X] >= 5500 p-value ="1-ttail(r(df_r),sign(_b[_cons]-5500)*sqrt(r(F)))
