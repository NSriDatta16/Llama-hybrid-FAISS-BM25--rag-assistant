I am not sure if it could work but I have seen this approach in: https://github.com/chickenbestlover/RNN-Time-series-Anomaly-Detection It uses a RNN autoencoder for prediction and the it finds out anomalies. Before training the autoencoder it augments data adding many different levels of noise. Please check it.
