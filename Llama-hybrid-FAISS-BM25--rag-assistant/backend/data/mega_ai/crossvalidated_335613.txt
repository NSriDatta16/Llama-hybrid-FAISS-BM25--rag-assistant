If I understood the question right, your task is more Information Retrieval than Machine Learning, So word2vec does not help you. What you are looking for is called Knowledge-Base . But why? First of all, the knowledge stored in the system should be as huge as possible as you can imagine "Gibraltar" is not the most famous place. So something in the scale of web works e.g. Wikipedia (if it is a place most probably it has a Wikipedia page). Second of all this data should be in the form of an Ontology which stores the relation between concepts and answer the question " What is X? " e.g. Wikipedia is an ontology which tells you Lionel Messi is an Argentinian football player , Lionel Messi is a player of Barcelona , etc. Third of all this information should be structured in a graph as you need to relate every entity and it's category (parent) e.g. like how Wikipedia links the category of its pages in "Categories" section at the bottom of the page. Ontologies are usually stored in knowledge graphs (knowledge graph as a general term. do not confuse by specific knowledge-base used by google). Solution After this introduction I can simply give you some keywords to search. Then you will easily find the best practices for answering your question: Semantic Web , WordNet , DBpedia , Google Knowledge Graph , RDF
