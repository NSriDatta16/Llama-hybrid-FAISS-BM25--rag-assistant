This sounds like a problem of mismatched APIs. If your code and the Python runtime were compiled with different compilers, or even different compiler options, then accessing the FILE* could result in an access violation. Can you double-check that you've build your C code properly? You mention that you're embedding Python into your C++ application. Keep in mind that Python is C code, compiled as C code. Perhaps that is the source of the problem?
