A statistical model can be seen as a procedure/story describing how some data came to be. A Bayesian model is a statistical model where you use probability to represent all uncertainty within the model, both the uncertainty regarding the output but also the uncertainty regarding the input (aka parameters) to the model. The whole prior/posterior/Bayes theorem thing follows on this, but in my opinion, using probability for everything is what makes it Bayesian (and indeed a better word would perhaps just be something like probabilistic model ). That means that most other statistical models can be "cast into" a Bayesian model by modifying them to be using probability everywhere. This is especially true for models that rely on maximum likelihood, as maximum likelihood model fitting is a strict subset to Bayesian model fitting.
