I don't think there is a consensus on terminology here, but the following is what I think most people have in mind when someone says "average partial effect" or "average marginal effect". Suppose, for concreteness, that we are analyzing a population of people. Consider the linear model $$ Y = \beta X + U, $$ where $(Y,X)$ are observed scalar random variables, and $U$ is an unobserved scalar random variable. Suppose that $\beta$ is an unknown constant. Suppose this is a structural model, meaning that it has a causal interpretation. So, if we could pick a person out of the population and increase their value of $X$ by 1 unit, then their value of $Y$ would increase by $\beta$ . Then $\beta$ is called the marginal or causal effect of $X$ on $Y$ . Now, assuming that $\beta$ is a constant means that no matter which person we pick out of the population, a one unit increase in $X$ has the same effect on $Y$ --- it increases $Y$ by $\beta$ . This is clearly restrictive. We can relax this constant effect assumption by supposing that $\beta$ itself a random variable --- each person has a different value of $\beta$ . Consequently, there is an entire distribution of marginal effects, the distribution of $\beta$ . The mean of this distribution, $E(\beta)$ , is called the average marginal effect (AME), or average partial effect. If we were to increase everyone's value of $X$ by one unit, then the average change in $Y$ is given by the AME. Alternatively, consider the nonlinear model $$ Y = m(X,U), $$ where again $(Y,X)$ are scalar observables and $U$ is a scalar unobservable, and $m$ is some unknown function (assume it is differentiable for simplicity). Here the causal/marginal effect of $X$ on $Y$ is $\partial m(x,u)/\partial x$ . This value may depend on the value of $U$ . Thus, even if we look at people who all have the same observed value of $X$ , a small increase in $X$ will not necessarily increase $Y$ by the same amount, because each person may have a different value of $U$ . Thus there is a distribution of marginal effects, just as in the linear model above. And, again, we can look at the mean of this distribution: $$ E_{U \mid X} \left[ \frac{\partial m(x,U)}{\partial x} \mid X=x \right]. $$ This mean is called the average marginal effect, given $X=x$ . If we assume $U$ is independent of $X$ , as is sometimes done, then the AME at $X=x$ is simply $$ E_{U} \left[ \frac{\partial m(x,U)}{\partial x} \right]. $$ In general, an average marginal effect is just a derivative (or sometimes a finite difference), of a structural function (such as $m(x,u)$ or $\beta x + u$ ) with respect to an observed variable $X$ , averaged over an unobserved variable $U$ , perhaps within a particular subgroup of people with $X=x$ . The precise form of this effect depends on the specific model under consideration. Also note that these objects might also be called average treatment effects, especially when considering a finite difference. For example, the difference of the structural function at $X=1$ ('treated') and at $X=0$ ('untreated'), averaged over the unobservables. Finally, to be clear, note that when I refer to 'distributions' above, I mean distributions over the population of people . Each person in the population has a value of $U$ , of $X$ , and of $Y$ . Hence there is a distribution of these values if I look over all people in the population. The thought experiment here is the following. Take all people with $X=x$ . Now take one of these people, and increase their $X$ value by a small amount, but keep their $U$ value the same, and we write down the change in their $Y$ value. We do this for each person with $X=x$ , and then average the values. This is what it means to average over $U \mid X=x$ .
