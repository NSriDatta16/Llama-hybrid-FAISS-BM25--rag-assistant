Modeling multivariate Time Series Count Data in R

I'm dealing with sales forecast for products in same category (f.i. all products belonging to $wine$ category). Data are time series with a daily frequency, $Y_{product_i} \in {0,1,2,..}$ . After some inspection I found out that time series models like Arima or Arimax do not fit particularly well my data and so I would like to try a new way. I was considering, having count data, a Poisson Regression Model, which for a single product would look like this: $Y_t|F_{t-1} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{t})$ $\lambda_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1*Y_{t-1} + \alpha_1*\lambda_{t-1} + \eta*X_t$ where $Y_t $ = sales at day t, $X_t$ = Exogenous regressors at day t. My first question is: Is there any package in $R$ implementing this? Is $glm$ sufficient? Furthermore some products have very sparse time series while others sell always at least a couple of decades of items: would it be proper to consider log linear models in the second case and Hurdle models in the first one? I was then considering the fact that I probably will need a more complex model which models a covariance structure between the sales of different products. Unfortunately I don't have much theoretical and Rpackages background in this case. I'm thinking about mixed effects models but I'm just wondering.. Basically I would like a Poisson Regression model with an autoregressive term for each of my products, but I don't know how to insert a covariance structure over the products. Should I go Bayesian? $Y_{i_t} \sim Poisson(\lambda_{i_t})$ $\lambda_{i_t} = \beta_{0_i} + \beta_{i_1}*Y_{i_{t-1}} +\alpha_{1_i}*\lambda_{i_{t-1}} + \eta_i*X_{i_t}$ $i=1,..,numberofproducts$ So my second question is about finding theoretical perspective about multivariate time series count data together with packages in R.
