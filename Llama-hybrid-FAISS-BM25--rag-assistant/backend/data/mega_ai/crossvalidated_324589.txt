Isn't the NFL concerned with algorithms which are data-independent? Feature engineering is completely data-dependent, because it's not a rigorous, well-defined algorithm, expecially in the sense meant by Kagglers. For different data sets they choose different features based on expertise, Intuition and a lot of hand-waving. It's not like they use a principled, well-defined a priori approach. In other words, they don't always use the same feature engineering algorithm for different competitions.
