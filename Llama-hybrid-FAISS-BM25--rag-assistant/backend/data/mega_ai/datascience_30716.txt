Keras VAE example loss function

The code here: https://github.com/keras-team/keras/blob/master/examples/variational_autoencoder.py Specifically line 53: xent_loss = original_dim * metrics.binary_crossentropy(x, x_decoded_mean) Why is the cross entropy multiplied by original_dim ? Also, does this function calculate cross entropy only across the batch dimension (I noticed there is no axis input)? It's hard to tell from the documentation...
