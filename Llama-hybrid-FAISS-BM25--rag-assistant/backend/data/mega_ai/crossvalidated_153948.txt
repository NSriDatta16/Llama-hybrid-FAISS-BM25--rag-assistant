Estimate latent states for a Bernoulli stace space model, when the latent states follow an AR(1) process

I am dealing with this model $$y_t|\alpha_t \sim Bernoulli \left( \frac{\exp (\alpha_t)}{ 1+ \exp(\alpha_t)} \right) $$ with $\alpha_t = \phi \alpha_{t-1} + \epsilon_t,$ where $\epsilon_t \sim Normal\left(0, \frac{1}{\tau}\right)$. My goal is the estimation of: $\alpha_t|y_{1:T}$, where $T$ is the sample size. I have estimated this model using MCMC. The problem is that I think that my results are suspicious (see please the image)! My question is: Is there a routine that I could use for this goal? Thank you in advance.
