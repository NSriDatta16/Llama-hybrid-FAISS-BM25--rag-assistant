Deep learning: Training from COCO/imagenet weights or from a class-specific trained weights when classify 2 similar objects

I have a question about the possible outcome of a trained model. Imagine that I would like to classify 2 different models of Ferrari and the dataset of these 2 models is small (for example, a few hundred images per model). In the Keras blog , the issue was discussed but in the example, they are classifying dogs and cats, 2 class that are very general, distinct between them, and there are many cats and dogs already included in the original imagenet model (lets say the car/bus/truck are not included in the imagenet output classes). Will it be better start training the model from Coco/Imagenet weights or start training using the weights of a model previously trained to classify cars only?
