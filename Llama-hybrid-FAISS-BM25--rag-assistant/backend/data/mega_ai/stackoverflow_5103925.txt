Start your second download from within your first onPostExecute-method. protected void onPostExecute(String unused) { dismissDialog(DIALOG_DOWNLOAD_PROGRESS); tv.append("\n\nFile Download Completed!"); sendBroadcast(new Intent(Intent.ACTION_MEDIA_MOUNTED, Uri.parse("file://"+ Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()))); // Here you start your new AsyncTask... } This code: if(d1.getStatus()==AsyncTask.Status.FINISHED) { d1 = null; DownloadFileAsync d2 = new DownloadFileAsync(); d2.execute(videoPath+fileNames[1],fileNames[1]); } ...will execute once, and immediately after the first AsyncTask is executed, thus it will always be false. If you want to go that route, you need to do it in a while loop - which kind of defeats the point of making the task Async in the first place.
