As you don't want to use a String (though I urge you to reconsider, after all that's what it is and easier to parse too), I guess you can do regular old division to extract parts. i.e. int tmp = date; // unboxing int year = tmp / 10000; int month = (tmp % 10000) / 100; int day = tmp % 100; That's not very elegant either. The best way to handle this would be to instruct whatever you're using to deserialize to give you back a String for date instead of an Integer . Then you can just take the first four characters for your, next two for month and last two for day. SimpleDateFormat can do the heavy lifting here.
