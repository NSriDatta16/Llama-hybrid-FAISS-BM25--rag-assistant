The more I read about Java NIO, the more it gives me the willies. Anyway, I think this article answers your problem... http://weblogs.java.net/blog/2006/05/30/tricks-and-tips-nio-part-i-why-you-must-handle-opwrite It sounds like this guy has a more elegant solution than the sleep loop. Also I'm fast coming to the conclusion that using Java NIO by itself is too dangerous. Where I can, I think I'll probably use Apache MINA which provides a nice abstraction above Java NIO and its little 'surprises'.
