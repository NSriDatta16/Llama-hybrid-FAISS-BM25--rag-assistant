What distributions can be choosen for C, gamma and k? To reproduce results from other methods, define a box and sample uniformly in the box. This will parallel the procedure of grid search, or any other tuning method, since each point is equally likely a priori . But if you want some distributions more informative than these, then you'll have to work that out for the problem at hand because that is inherently a context-dependent question: some problems have larger/smaller $\gamma$ and $C$ than others, which is why we tune hyper-parameters in the first place. If you decide to make this a fully Bayesian problem with informative probabilities over hyper-parameters, embedding the problem as a logistic regression can create a direct path to probability models. Second, let's assume a random search optimization over parameters which have to sum to one. How could one incorporate this constraint into the search? Use a stick-breaking process . You start with a unit interval, and pick a point in the interval according to a probabiltiy distribution over the unit interval. Then you iterate $k-1$ times the process for the interval "to the right" (or left) of the chosen point. At the end, you'll have $k$ value which sum to 1. You could also review the stan documentation pertaining to sampling of simplex random variables for an alternative presentation of the concept.
