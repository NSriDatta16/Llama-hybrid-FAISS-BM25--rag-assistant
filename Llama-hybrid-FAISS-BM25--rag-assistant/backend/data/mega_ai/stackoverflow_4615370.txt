get data from page that a url points to

Given a Url, I'd like to be able to capture the Title of the page this url points to, as well as other info - eg a snippet of text from the first paragraph on a page? - maybe even an image from the page. Digg.com does this nicely when you submit a url. How could something like this be done in .Net c#?
