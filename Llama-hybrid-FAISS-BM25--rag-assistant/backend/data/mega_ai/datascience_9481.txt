What kind of statistical analyses can I do with my data?

I'm trying to analyze human intentions in clicking google ad word keywords . In this dataset I have the usual adword details, for example CTR = Clicks / Impressions CPC = Cost / Clicks CPA = Cost / Converted Clicks ROI = Total Conversion Value / Cost CVR = Converted Clicks / Clicks Weighted Avg Pos = WAP / Impressions and Ad position placement. Basically, I can imagine a relationship between Keywords and CTR. I can do some psychological analysis, like opinion mining and emotion detection, like a vice. Still, I need to show different types of analysis. So what kind of advanced statistical analysis methods can be applied to this data set? My data looks like this: Keyword |Average Position| Average CPC| Clicks| CTR| Cost| Impressions android app developers ,1 ,0.5, 21.79, 8.7%, 10.99, 250
