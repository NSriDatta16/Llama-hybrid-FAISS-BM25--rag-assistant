You can launch the user's email program using a mailto link along with several paramaters: mailto:foo@example.com?subject=hi&body=hello,%20world! However, a lot of people use webmail nowadays, for which it won't work - so the best option is to avoid using email. If you want feedback and don't want to host such a script on your own server, you can use a service such as PollDaddy or SurveyMonkey for this. If you want to encourage users to share a page with friends, ShareThis supports email.
