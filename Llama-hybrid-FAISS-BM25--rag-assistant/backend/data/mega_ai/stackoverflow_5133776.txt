JQuery Plugin won't work inside modal

I am having trouble getting a jquery plugin called ui multiselect to show up properly inside a modal (using jqmodal). I actually have tried another modal called simplemodal and a different multiselect plugin as well with no luck. From what I can gather, it appears the CSS of the for uimultiselect is not being applied because the multiselect resides inside the modal div, which has display: none at page load. I have tried a number of different things suggested by others having this issue and none have worked. Perhaps I am doing it wrong. In my code, I displayed the multiselect inside and outside of the modal. It works perfectly fine outside. here is my html: jQuery UI Multiselect $().ready(function() { $('#addShortCodes').jqm({ trigger: '#addShortCodesTrigger', overlay: 30, /* 0-100 (int) : 0 is off/transparent, 100 is opaque */ overlayClass: 'whiteOverlay' }) .jqDrag('.jqDrag'); /* make dialog draggable, assign handle to title */ // Close Button Highlighting. IE doesn't support :hover. Surprise? $('input.jqmdX') .hover(function(){ $(this).addClass('jqmdXFocus'); },function(){ $(this).removeClass('jqmdXFocus'); }) .focus(function(){ this.hideFocus=true; $(this).addClass('jqmdXFocus'); }) .blur(function(){ $(this).removeClass('jqmdXFocus'); }); }); Afghanistan Albania France Add $(function(){ $.localise('ui-multiselect', {/*language: 'en',*/ path: 'js/locale/'}); $(".multiselect").multiselect(); $('#switcher').themeswitcher(); }); Add Short Codes Short Codes: Afghanistan Albania France Features Search within available options, if there are a lots of them Displaying counts of selected and available items Select All / Deselect All Buttons Dragging items from the available list to the selected list directly Contributors Michael Aufreiter Yanick Rochon Misc There are no limitations. Do whatever you want with this plugin. If you did some nice modifications, just let me know (via Github). I'd be happy to include them. Elsewhere DONUT? - Radial Navigator NEW!
