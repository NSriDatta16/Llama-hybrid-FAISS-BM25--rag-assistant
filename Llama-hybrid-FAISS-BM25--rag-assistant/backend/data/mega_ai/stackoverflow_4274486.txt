strip_tags() doesn't work that way you want it to behave. If supplied with a second argument, the tags listed are allowed to be part of the resulting string - except those which are not listed. And it will not filter out inner text. If you want to extract elements only, don't even think about using a regex. Use a DOM parser for that: libxml_use_internal_errors(true); $doc=new DOMDocument; $html=$doc->loadHTML(' This is a detailed paragraph about Fawaz and his mates. '); $path=new DOMXPath($doc); foreach ($path->query('//img') as $found) var_dump($doc->saveXML($found));
