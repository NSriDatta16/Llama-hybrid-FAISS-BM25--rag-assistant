How to calculate prediction interval in GLM (Gamma) / TweedieRegression in Python?

I have checked much source from webs about conducting the prediciton interval, especially in GLM function. One of the approaches is about Prediction Intervals for Machine Learning https://machinelearningmastery.com/prediction-intervals-for-machine-learning/ from Jason Brownlee. However,his method targets to the linear regression, and it might not be appropriate to the GLM (Gamma) to some degrees. Another approach I found is to use bootstrapping method to conduct the prediction interval. However, the computation was so time-consuming, and my computer's memory was killed when running the function from the article https://saattrupdan.github.io/2020-03-01-bootstrap-prediction/ . I am confused how to conduct the prediction interval in an appropriate way in GLM (Gamma most probably) in Python instead in R. I have found a related package in R, but I do not want to use R to conduct the interval. Another related information I found from the web is Gamma GLM - Derive prediction intervals for new x_i : Gamma GLM - Derive prediction intervals for new x_i .
