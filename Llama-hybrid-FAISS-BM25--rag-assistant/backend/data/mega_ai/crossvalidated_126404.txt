If there was no errors during data collection and cleaning, and you did all the statistics stuff correctly then that is what your data "say". If you insist that your prior knowledge suggests that there is a high probability of the opposite result and you want to incorporate this prior knowledge in your statistical model, then we are talking Bayesian ... But seriously: I would use few Bayesian models with different informative and uninformative priors to check if the results hold. You could use a prior pointing in positive direction, an uninformative one, and/or others - if results under different priors would be roughly the same then it would suggest that this is your result. Check a paper by Spiegelhalter et al. (2004) (or book ) for hints about using different priors for this kind of analysis.
