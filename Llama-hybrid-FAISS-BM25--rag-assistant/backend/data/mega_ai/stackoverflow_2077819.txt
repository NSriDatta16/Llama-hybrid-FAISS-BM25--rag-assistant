display:block; Block-level elements are those elements of the source document that are formatted visually as blocks (e.g., paragraphs). Several values of the 'display' property make an element block-level: 'block', 'list-item', and 'run-in' (part of the time; see run-in boxes), and 'table'. Block-level elements (except for display 'table' elements, which are described in a later chapter) generate a principal block box that contains either only block boxes or only inline boxes. The principal block box establishes the containing block for descendant boxes and generated content and is also the box involved in any positioning scheme. Principal block boxes participate in a block formatting context. http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/visuren.html
