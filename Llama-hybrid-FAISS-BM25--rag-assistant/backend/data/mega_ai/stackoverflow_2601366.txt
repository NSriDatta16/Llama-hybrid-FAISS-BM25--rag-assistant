If you don't know anything else about the input, then a reasonable assumption is that it's random. If so, and if the space of possible choices is large (e.g. the set of all real numbers), then the likelihood of two elements being the same is vanishingly small. (Mathematically, we say that the event of two randomly selected real numbers being distinct is almost sure .) That means that your average case is equal to your worst case: you'll have to scan every element in the array to be sure that each one is distinct. Then the number of comparisons is n * (n - 1) / 2 , or the sum of 1 ... n .
