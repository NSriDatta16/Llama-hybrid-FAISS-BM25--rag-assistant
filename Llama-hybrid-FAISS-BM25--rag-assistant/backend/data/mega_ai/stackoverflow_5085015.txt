Sort and shuffle optimization in Hadoop MapReduce

I'm looking for a research/implementation based project on Hadoop and I came across the list posted on the wiki page - http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/ProjectSuggestions . But, this page was last updated in September, 2009. So, I'm not sure if some of these ideas have already been implemented or not. I was particularly interested in "Sort and Shuffle optimization in the MR framework" which talks about "combining the results of several maps on rack or node before the shuffle. This can reduce seek work and intermediate storage". Has anyone tried this before? Is this implemented in the current version of Hadoop?
