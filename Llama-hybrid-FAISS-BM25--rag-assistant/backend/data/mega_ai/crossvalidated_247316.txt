Decide whether to scale or standardize the data Having some variables with a very different range/scale can often create problems: most of the “results” may be driven by a few large values, more so that we would like. To avoid such issues, one has to consider whether or not to standardize the data by making some of the initial raw attributes have, for example, mean 0 and standard deviation 1. Decide which variables to use for clustering The decision about which variables to use for clustering is a critically important decision that will have a big impact on the clustering solution. So we need to think carefully about the variables we will choose for clustering. Good exploratory research that gives us a good sense of what variables may distinguish people or products or assets or regions is critical. Clearly this is a step where a lot of contextual knowledge, creativity, and experimentation/iterations are needed. Define similarity or dissimilarity measures between observations Most statistical methods for clustering and segmentation use common mathematical measures of distance. Typical measures are, for example, the Euclidean distance or the Manhattan distance (see help(dist) in R for more examples). Visualize individual attributes and pair-wise distances between the observations Plotting a histogram should help you understand the distribution well. Select the clustering method to use and decide how many clusters to have The Hierarchial Clustering method, as we do not know for now how many segments there are in our data. Hierarchical clustering is a method that also helps us visualise how the data may be clustering together. It generates a plot called the Dendrogram which is often helpful for visualization. As always, much like Hierarchical Clustering can be performed using various distance metrics, so can Kmeans. Profile and interpret the clusters Having decided (for now) how many clusters to use, we would like to get a better understanding of who the customers in those clusters are and interpret the segments.use snake plots to help your self understand the clusters. Assess the robustness of our clusters Two basic tests to perform are: How much overlap is there between the clusters found using different approaches? Specifically, for what percentage of our observations the clusters they belong to are the same across different clustering solutions? How similar are the profiles of the segments found? Specifically, how similar are the averages of the profiling attributes of the clusters found using different approaches?
