Assuming the following from your question: Data population has only 3 classes (A,B and C) You have tagged data for two classes only (say A and B). What you can do for the third class (assuming you have no tagged data for A and B) is outlier detection. You can train One-Class SVMs on A+B data and if your model says its an outlier, its class C. You still have to run a standard classifier for detection of class A and class B.
