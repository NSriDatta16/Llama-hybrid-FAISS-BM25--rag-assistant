jQuery Drag & Drop automatically open link inside drag element

I'm making a drag and drop shopping cart using jQuery and FoxyCart, the drag and drop work but I don't know how to automatically open a link (inside the drag element) once item is dropped into the cart. Basically I have a list with and inside I have and Add to cart . The link for adding to cart is hidden using css, but I need it such that when I drop an item in the shopping cart, it will open this hidden link (because the link opens a modal box and add the item in the real shopping cart provided by FoxyCart). The problem for me is that I don't know jquery that well and I don't know how filter the link from the rest and then open it.
