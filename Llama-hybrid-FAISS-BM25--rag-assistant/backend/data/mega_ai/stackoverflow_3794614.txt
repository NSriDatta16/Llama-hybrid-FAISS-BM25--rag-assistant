InnoDB tables do take up more space when compared to MyISAM. Whether the trade-off between storage use and the features offered by InnoDB (crash-safety, transactions, and foreign keys) favours InnoDB is something you will have to decide on. Having myself switched from MyISAM to InnoDB, I wouldn't go back. It's worth noting that if you are going to go ahead and use InnoDB, you will definitely want to define a primary key (and ideally a short one). This is due to the way InnoDB behaves wrt storage and other indices. See this page .
