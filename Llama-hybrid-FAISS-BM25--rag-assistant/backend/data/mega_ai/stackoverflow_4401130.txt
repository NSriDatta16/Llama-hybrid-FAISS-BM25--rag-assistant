In specific answer to your question, TinyOS provides a lot of what you'll need. There's quite a large body of academic work on getting these up and running, especially combining agent-based infrastructures with sensor networks -- take a look on Google Scholar for example. There are also some very good links on Wikipedia . Are you specifically interested in an OS to run on your sensors, or something at higher level that plugs into some sensor infra you already have? Are you intending to build your own kit, or work on something that already exists (e.g. BTNode )?
