PCA on Binary Data

I having binary data set (yes/no), so can I apply PCA on that. Is it mathematically correct to do that. In my opinion Binary variable can only be subjected to logical operations, so how it can be legal to apply PCA on the binary varaibles . Previously Question similar questions have been asked Doing principal component analysis or factor analysis on binary data (using SPSS) but I could not clear my doubt.
