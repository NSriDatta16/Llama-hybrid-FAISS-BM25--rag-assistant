When you add a stored proc to the design, if you don't drag it onto an entity, it creates it the default way, which is to return the integer result of the proc. If you've done any select statements in that procedure, you need to drop the procedure on top of an entity in the designer, instead of into the method pane, this will allow the designer to generate the appropriate method that returns an IQueryable of your entity type, instead of int.
