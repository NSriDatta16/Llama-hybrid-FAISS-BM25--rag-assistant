Bayesian vs MLE, overfitting problem

In Bishop's PRML book, he says that, overfitting is a problem with Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), and Bayesian can avoid it. But I think, overfitting is a problem more about model selection, not about the method used to do parameter estimation. That is, suppose I have a data set $D$, which is generated via $$f(x)=sin(x),\;x\in[0,1]$$, now I might choose different models $H_i$ to fit the data and find out which one is the best. And the models under consideration are polynomial ones with different orders, $H_1$ is order 1, $H_2$ is order 2, $H_3$ is order 9. Now I try to fit the data $D$ with each of the 3 models, each model has its paramters, denoted as $w_i$ for $H_i$. Using ML, I will have a point estimate of the model parameters $w$, and $H_1$ is too simple and will always underfit the data, whereas $H_3$ is too complex and will overfit the data, only $H_2$ will fit the data well. My questions are, 1) Model $H_3$ will overfit the data, but I don't think it's the problem of ML, but the problem of the model per se. Because, using ML for $H_1,H_2$ doesn't result into overfitting. Am I right? 2) Compared to Bayesian, ML does have some disadvantages, since it just gives the point estimate of the model parameters $w$, and it's overconfident. Whereas Bayesian doesn't rely on just the most probable value of the parameter, but all the possible values of the parameters given the observed data $D$, right? 3) Why can Bayesian avoid or decrease overfitting? As I understand it, we can use Bayesian for model comparison, that is, given data $D$, we could find out the marginal likelihood (or model evidence) for each model under consideration, and then pick the one with the highest marginal likelihood, right? If so, why is that?
