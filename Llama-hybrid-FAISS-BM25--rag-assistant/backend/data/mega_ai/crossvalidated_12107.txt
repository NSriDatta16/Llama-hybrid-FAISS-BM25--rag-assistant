What is a null conjunction analysis in an fMRI study?

I'm reading an article, The commonality of neural networks for verbal and visual short-term memory (Majerus et al., J Cogn Neurosci 2010 22(11): 2570), about brain imaging in which the results are analysed with multiple analyses. One of them is a null conjunction analysis . I've tried googling a bit but I didn't come up with something useful. I did find some results on 'conjunction analysis', but I'm not sure if that's the exact same thing. Can anyone explain to me what this analysis is (Goals, method...)?
