Behaviour of static variables in dynamically linked libraries (C/C++)

As discussed here , a static variable is stored in the .BSS or .DATA segment. Where is this memory stored if the static variable is inside a function that's in a dynamically linked library ? Does storage for this variable get allocated in the .BSS or .DATA segment of the linking process at the time of linkage ?
