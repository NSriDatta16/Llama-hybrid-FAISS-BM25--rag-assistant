Mysql application which involves analytics of an ad network: table design

Now, I am recording impressions, clicks, ctr. impressions are the ad impressions, clicks are the ad clicks and ctr is the click through rate worked out by = clicks/impressions Currently I have three tables-> in_table(in_imp, in_clks, in_ctr) for advertisers out_table(out_imp, out_clks, out_ctr) for publishers Now I was wondering what would be a better way to reorganise this table structure.
