Is is possible to make a text generator with sklearn?

So recently I made a Tensorflow model using RNN (Recurrent neural networks) and I was wondering if it was possible with sklearn too, through the usage of SVMs or Naive bayes. I searched up many articles on google but didn't find a feasible solution to it. So is it even possible to build a text generator with sklearn? If so, whats the base code to make that model?
