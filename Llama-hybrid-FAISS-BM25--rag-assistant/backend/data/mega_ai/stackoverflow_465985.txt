Its a UI metaphor thing. What you Drag and Drop it should be a "something" a file, document or whatever to another "something" a container, bin, shredder, printer or whatever. Dragging and dropping thread/task to a timer loses the basic mataphor and feels wrong. Right clicks and pulldowns are much better for "verbs" like "start timer".
