Optimal threshlds for continous varibles in order to predict yes/no outcome

I have some trouble finding the best ML approach to solve the following problem: I have a set of continuous variables representing how a specific medical procedure is conducted. I need to find the optimal threshold value for each variable to maximize the probability of a positive outcome. I already created a Random Forest model for variable selection and a second model predicting the outcome using the variables as continuous but I have no idea how to proceed from here.
