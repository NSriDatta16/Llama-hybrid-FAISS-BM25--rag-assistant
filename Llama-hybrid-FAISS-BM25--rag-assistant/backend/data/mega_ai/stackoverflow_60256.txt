How do you balance fun feature creep with time constraints?

I enjoy programming, usually. Tedious stuff is easy to get done as quickly and correctly as possible so I can get through it and not have to see it again. But a lot of my coding is fun and when I get in the 'zone' I just really enjoy myself. Which is where I make the mistake of spending too much time, perhaps adding features, perhaps writing it in a cool or elegant manner, or just doing neat prototypes. How do you recognize this is happening before it exceeds your time frame? What do you do before starting a potentially fun piece of code, or during, to get back on track? When is it ok to let yourself go "hog wild" and just enjoy it without worrying about consequences? -Adam
