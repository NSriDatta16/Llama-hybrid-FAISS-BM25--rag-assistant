Yes. The Modell will still overfit if you use too many features. When you use your modell with many predictors for an out-of-sample prediction (e.g. future outcomes or out-of-sample data) you will likely have an increased prediction error. You should apply a feature selection algorithm or dimensionality reduction to select the most important features.
