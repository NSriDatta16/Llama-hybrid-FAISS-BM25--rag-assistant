Putting Copyright Symbol into a Python File

I need to include a copyright statement at the top of every Python source file I produce: # Copyright: Â© 2008 etc. However, when I then run such a file I get this message: SyntaxError: Non-ASCII character '\xa9' in file MyFile.py on line 3, but no encoding declared; see http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0263.html for details. Apparently Python isn't happy about the copyright symbol because it assumes the source file is all in ASCII. Either I need to make my first line be: # -*- coding: iso-8859-1 -*- to tell Python I'm using Latin encoding, or I can change the copyright statement to: # Copyright: \xa9 2008 etc. which just possibly doesn't have the same legal standing. Is there a more elegant solution?
