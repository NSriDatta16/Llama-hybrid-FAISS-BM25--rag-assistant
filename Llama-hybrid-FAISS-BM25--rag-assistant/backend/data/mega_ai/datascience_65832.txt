Which metric to choose for tracking model performance?

I am working on a binary classification problem with class proportion of 33:67. Currently what I am doing is running multiple models like LR , SVM , RF , XgBoost for classification. RF and Xgboost models perform better. However I am reading online that AUC , F1-score or Accuracy comparison between models may not be a good metric (as they are sensitive) to measure the model performance. I see these are the mostly used scoring metrics but can you let me know which metric should I look for measuring binary classification model performance ? Can you let me know why should we choose a different metric? These are the metrics that I see in scikit-learn
