You could disable mouse interaction for the clip that is being dragged eg. On your MOUSE_DOWN event: displayObject.startDrag(); // Disable mouse interactions for this object displayObject.mouseEnabled = false; // Disable mouse interactions for this objects children. displayObject.mouseChildren = false; Then in your MOUSE_UP event where you call stopDrag() you can enable it again: displayObject.mouseEnabled = true; displayObject.mouseChildren = true; I haven't tried this but it should stop the clip that you are dragging from receiving any mouse events. *Just one thing though is that since the clip itself doesn't receive mouse events, the MOUSE_UP event cannot be placed directly onto it but will have to be placed on it's parent or the stage.
