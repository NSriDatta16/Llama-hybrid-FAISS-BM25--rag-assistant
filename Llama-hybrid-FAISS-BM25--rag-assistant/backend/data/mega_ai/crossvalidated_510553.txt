In machine learning, we generally want to learn about a process or system which will be useful to us in a real world scenario. We train our model on a train set and then check our performance on the hold out test set. By checking how our model performs on previously unseen data, we get an idea of how our model might perform in the real world. We can also compare our train and test performance metrics to check for overfitting. By fitting our preprocessing to both the train and test datasets, we might be leaking some information into our modelling process which should be unseen. If we only use the train set for figuring out which processing to do on our data, the test set truely remains unseen. After fitting our preprocessor to the train set, we can then transform the train and test datasets.
