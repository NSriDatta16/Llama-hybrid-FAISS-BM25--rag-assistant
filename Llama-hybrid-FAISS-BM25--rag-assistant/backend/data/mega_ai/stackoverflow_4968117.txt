The answer is that you use a big expensive credit card processing system... HTTPS, secure data storage, the works. Otherwise the credit card companies will take away your right to process credit cards, because they demand that level of security. Or you use a system like PayPal. They'll handle the credit cards for you, and just give you the money (minus a small fee).
