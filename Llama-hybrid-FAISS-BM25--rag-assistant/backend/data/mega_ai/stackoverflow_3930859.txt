Lets's sat that respositories are entry point for entities in DDD. you can create abstract one and then specialize it to each entity. So you can ask a repository every time you need to get an entity. The datamapper is a solution to map entities with their database representations or any other storages. So I guess that datamapper has to be hidden behind the repository pattern.
