The thing that gets my attention is Win2008R2 and Cassini. I'm just guessing, but it makes me think that it could be a permission issue. Is it possible that your Win2008R2 machine is locked down more than your average developer machine (the average developer machine being XP / Vista / Win7 etc). Perhaps Cassini when launched under your user account on Win2008R2 does not have enough permission to do its thing. Perhaps it cannot open ports? But I wouldn't think a port issue would cause a crash. Or perhaps it doesn't have access to the temporary directories it needs? Perhaps your user account is denied the permission to debug on the local security policy? But i'm not an admin, so i'm not certain on this. Maybe try launching visual studio as an Administrator (just incase, to help you investigate the problem). Or perhaps try starting your site without debugging to help see if it's some sort of permission issue with debugging processes. I came across this, it's from some time ago talking about Windows 7 and Cassini. http://msmvps.com/blogs/rfennell/archive/2009/01/24/problem-hosting-wcf-using-cassini-on-windows-7.aspx But it may not of been fixed.
