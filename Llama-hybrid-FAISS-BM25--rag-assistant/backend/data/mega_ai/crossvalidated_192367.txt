If you have data for the $Y$, and you assume further that $X$ is a beta random variable, the unconditional distribution of $Y $ is a beta-binomial distribution. Also, the posterior distribution for $X $ is beta as well, if you're doing inference on that. This sounds like what you want. From $p (x|y) $ you can make Bayesian credible intervals. If you don't assume anything about the distribution of $X $ you can still do something Bayesian. Just keep in mind that you don't think of it as a threshold random variable like $Y $, but rather as a random probability on the unit interval. Edit: ehh, I misunderstood the question. See comments below.
