the problem when you use PCA is that you can't interpret your coefficients anymore. PCA reduces dimensions and combines 2 variables into 1 new variable. For that it uses the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the covariance matrix. In that way two highly correlated variables can be decorrelated and used together in one model. The disadvantage is that after in your linear regression you will have a new variable that you can't interpret. That's also the reason why you have less variables after PCA, because PCA combines variables into a new one. If two variables are highly correlated you don't need to include both. Just include one of the two, as adding the second one will not explain more of the variance in Y. Have you tried lasso regression?
