If you have a fixed set of subclasses then you can put the data in the superclass. If you subclasses can be added, then there is no way to list them all. You might get subclasses let the superclass know of their existence from the static initialiser (or use an agent!). Generally superclasses should not be aware of their subclasses. However you might want to think (or better refactor) your superclass into a supertype and some other class responsible for your subclasses.
