Remember that $p(\theta, \mathcal D) = p(\theta \mid \mathcal D) p(\mathcal D)$. Thus your expression is actually the same as the one $\mathbb E_{\mathcal D}[\mathbb E_{\theta}[\theta \mid \mathcal D]]$. The mean of any random variable is $\mathbb E X = \int x p(x)\,\mathrm{d}x$. The first equation is just that for $\theta$, in terms of the prior $p(\theta)$ which does not depend on the dataset $\mathcal D$. The relationship is saying that, if you marginalize over all possible datasets $\mathcal D$, your belief about the average $\theta$ given a dataset $\mathcal D$ is the same.
