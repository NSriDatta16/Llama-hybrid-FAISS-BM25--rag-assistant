Residuals Diagnosis and its Covariance - Timeseries

I need some clarification about Residual Diagnosis and its covariance. I read this article . A residual in forecasting is the difference between an observed value and its forecast based on other observations: ei=yi−y^iei=yi−y^i. For time series forecasting, a residual is based on one-step forecasts; that is y^ty^t is the forecast of ytyt based on observations y1,…,yt−1. My first question is which period should I use to calculate the residual. My assumption is to use all the data (Learning Data and Test Data) to calculate it. Is that correct? According to the example in the article. The second question is about its covariance. Which other variable should I choose to calculate his covariance? The sales of each day? The forecast for each day? I have really no idea of the right data.
