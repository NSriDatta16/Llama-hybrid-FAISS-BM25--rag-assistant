Hyper-V WMI: Import virtual machine and create snapshot

I'm using the Hyper-V WMI Provider to import virtual machines in Hyper-V, specifically using the ImportVirtualSystemEx method of the Msvm_VirtualSystemManagementService class, largely using the C# code snippets provided by MS. I need to create a snapshot immediately after import, using the CreateVirtualSystemSnapshot method, but I can't figure out how to identify the newly imported virtual machine among all the other virtual machines that have already been imported in Hyper-V. I was hoping to get something back from the ImportVirtualSystemEx method, but that doesn't seem to be the case. Any clues?
