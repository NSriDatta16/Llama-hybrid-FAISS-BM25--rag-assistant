I would be inclined to have a flyout div or window for this, showing only unselected fields, with a remove facility on each header. Sorry if this does not add much to Avitus' idea, however I am suggesting a hybrid of the 2 suggested ideas, i.e the flyout list only contains unselected columns (like in Outlook say). The list would have to build on each flyout, or on each delete / add. Additionally I suggest that the user only has their selection stored on request, to allow experimental column selection prior to committing to get that layout next time, and to minimise storage access.
