What is the best way to make a simple Perl config file?

I am trying to make a simple config file for my Perl script, I originally was going to use Config::INIPlus but I don't think it is going to work. The config file does not need to be anything special. I just need to be able to read and write to it. I would like to use a module to accomplish this. Update: The reason I don't think Config::INIPlus will work for me might sound stupid, but I want to have the config file maintain a specific order of values. The problem I keep running into is the Config::INIPlus module insists on erasing the entire file and then reinserting all of the values in alphabetical order regardless of there subject they pertain to so it messes up the order which I would like to keep the config file ordered. Also it erases my empty variables that I had left for place holders. I had made a test of my idea using registry as the config storage and it was great! The problem is though I am trying to make my script a platform independent as possible mainly Windows and Linux not so much Mac as I don't own one. Maybe I just need to rethink my view on the config file maybe I am ask for something that cannot be done until I grasp more the finer points of perl.
