How to call a method inside a javascript object

I'm just learning about how to best organize my javascript code, and I had a question regarding this small piece of code I wrote: var reportsControllerIndex = { plotMapPoints: function(data) { //plots points }, drawMap: function() { $.getJSON('/reports.json', function(data) { reportsControllerIndex.plotMapPoints(data); }); }, run: function() { reportsControllerIndex.drawMap(); } }; The question is regarding calling another function of reportsControllerIndex from within the reportsControllerIndex object. I had first tried the following piece of code for the run function: run: function() { this.drawMap(); } which worked perfectly. However, I then quickly found doing this for the drawMap function: drawMap: function() { $.getJSON('/reports.json', function(data) { this.plotMapPoints(data); }); } does not work, since "this" would now refer to the callback function of the getJSON call. My solution was to just place reportsControllerIndex in front of all of the methods I want to call, but I was curious: is there a more relative way for calling functions within an overall object like this (much like you'd do with a class in a standard OO language)? Or am I forced to do it as I am currently, just calling the methods through the name of the object?
