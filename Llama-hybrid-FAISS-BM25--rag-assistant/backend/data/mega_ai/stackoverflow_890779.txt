On the .net side of things does it, OpenRasta does it, so does Ado.net Data services (albeit limited to xml and json). Conneg is not only about content-types though, it also includes language and character sets. It'll become more prevalent when more frameworks support it, but those frameworks are there now, so why not use them and leverage it now? As for conneg being YAGNI, people already expect to have both json and xml representations for some of their resources, and with rdfa looming, they all become more and more important. That said, conneg is not about REST, it's about HTTP and using it properly.
