I don't know if homework counts... During my studies we rolled our own program to solve the Traveling Salesman problem. The idea was to make a comparison on several criteria (difficulty to map the problem, performance, etc) and we also used other techniques such as Simulated annealing . It worked pretty well, but it took us a while to understand how to do the 'reproduction' phase correctly: modeling the problem at hand into something suitable for Genetic programming really struck me as the hardest part... It was an interesting course since we also dabbled with neural networks and the like. I'd like to know if anyone used this kind of programming in 'production' code.
