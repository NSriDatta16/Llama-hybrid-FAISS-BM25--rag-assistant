It has been a while since I have done any PHP but this is probably similar to what you expect in other programming environments. It is likely that the static method requires some construction of a SomeClass object behind the scenes each time that it is called, whereas the function can just be executed without any startup cost. Creating an object could be costly depending on a number of things: destruction of existing objects by a garbage collector/reference counter, memory pressure causing fragmentation, suboptimal memory allocation policies in the C runtime etc. It would be interesting to compare the method performance of an existing object. To do this create an instance of SomeClass and then call an instance method repeatedly.
