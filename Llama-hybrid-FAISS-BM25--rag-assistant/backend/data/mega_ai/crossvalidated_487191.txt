Testing if time series generated by one subject at different points in time can be analyzed as interdependent

I have 100+ weight time series that were collected during a treatment. Subjects who were submitted to several treatments along the years have more than one time series. By visual inspection, the time series within the same subject are rather different in terms of starting weight, finishing weight, slope and sinusoidal variations (my interest points). Given that my objective is to 'cluster' similar trends during the treatment, I think that averaging within the same subject is wrong with such high variability. Now, I am not sure either if it is correct to analyze them as completely different subjects. I am thinking about applying an independence test (Mutual information) and decide what to do based on the result. Would you say this is a correct way to handle the situation? Is mutual information the correct test? Btw, I am using linear mixed models in the analysis, so I can use the treatment number as an effect.
