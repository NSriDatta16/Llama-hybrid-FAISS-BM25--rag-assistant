Cold start problem can be partly solved by considering the observed features about a user. This information can then be considered together with user preferences in a probabilistic collaborative filtering model. The Infer.NET has a number of (advanced) examples where it shown how to use the features (as priors for a parameter). As @psycharo has pointed out, this requires quite substantial expertise with Bayesian approaches to learning to leverage the Infer.NET to its full potential. It is not too complicated but will take some time.
