AutoCad EndPlot event firing too soon in (C#, API)

i am leveraging the AutoCad API's to do the following... 1] open autocad 2] load a document 3] print the document 4] close autocad All this is working fine except for the fact that autocad is closing too quickly before the document has finished spooling off. To get around this i have subscribed to the EndPlot event (printing has finished) and then tried to get my app to close. The problem i am having is that endPlot fires WELL BEFORE the document has spooled off to the printer - and so i get no output. Does anyone have any suggestions??
