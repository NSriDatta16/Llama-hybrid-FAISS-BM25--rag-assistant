You really want to look up logistic regression . A simple example of how you would do it in R might be the following: m Note that I'm assuming when you say you have "a million of those vectors" you mean that for the predictor variable you have a million measures. If you really have over a million predictors you likely need to do some reduction first. There are some other ways to address this problem, like doing analyses of the numbers of 0s and 1s in the various categories. You will run into a problem regardless of what technique you select if you're just looking for what's "significant". You're getting into a number of measures where almost anything will be statistically significant . In that case you really need to focus on what's meaningful in the data.
