Pruning in Decision Trees?

Pruning is a technique in machine learning and search algorithms that reduces the size of decision trees by removing sections of the tree that provide little power to classify instances. I know what is decision trees and how it works. I am having trouble understanding how the pruning technique works and implemented. Could anyone explain in simple words (and maybe with an example) how the pruning technique works and implemented in Decision Trees?
