Tips on applying for an open source license

I want to use Fisheye to host my codebase online in a secure manner. As my portfolio is open source (I publish code to it via a file explorer control and also parts of the site's code, plus the rest of the site code soon), I need a more scalable and organised manner of storing the code. I checked out Atlassian Fisheye and its requirements to get an open source edition are as follows: "Using an approved open source license" I went to http://www.opensource.org/licenses to look at licenses. Has anyone got any experience of applying to this? What was the outcome? Thanks
