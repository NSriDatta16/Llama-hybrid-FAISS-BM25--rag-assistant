Yes, having a single container is a great way to manage large number of files (and no, SQLite won't help here! ;). We have a product, named SolFS , which is a virtual file system, that lets you keep your data in custom storage (resource DLL is one of the options) and provides file API for accessing the files. We even implemented asynchronous pluggable protocol for IE (on the client side, but the task is very similar to yours). SolFS includes a manager application that lets you easily create container files and import files into container.
