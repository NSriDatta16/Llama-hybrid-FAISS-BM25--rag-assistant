How entropy is calculated when a non categorical feature is available when using Decision tree or random forest algorithms?

How an entropy is calculated on non-categorical feature containing big amount of unique numbers? Let me give you an example: When we're having a categorical feature, we take the unique values, so if it contains 20 users with their respective countries, we would have only 5 unique countries: These countries, then used to calculate the entropy related to the dependent feature. However, when we have a non categorical data, how it would be calculated? Does the algorithm do the same and take the unique values and do its regular calculations?
