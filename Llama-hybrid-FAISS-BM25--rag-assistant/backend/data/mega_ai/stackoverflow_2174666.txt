There's nothing wrong with having rules for that specific page embedded in the page header, instead of having different files for everything. If your forms are so different that you say they are, then there's no other way to do it than to make custom rules for each... Whether or not you want to put all form styles in a huge file, or just include in the page header those that are relevant, depends on how many forms your users will access on an average visit. A few forms per visit; put them in the header. A lot of forms per average visit; put them all in a separate file so it can be cached by the user.
