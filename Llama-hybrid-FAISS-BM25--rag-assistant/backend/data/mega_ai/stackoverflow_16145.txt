What's the best way to report errors from a SharePoint workflow?

I have a custom action in a workflow and would like to report an error to the user when something goes wrong. What's the best way of doing that? UPD: Ideally I would like to put the workflow in the error state and log a message to the workflow log. That doesn't seem possible. What's the closest I can get to it? I want to a reusable solution,something that's easy for users to set up when using my custom action in SharePoint Designer. Added more details to the question. @mauro that takes care of storing the error, but how do I display the error to the user in a way which makes sense? @AdamSane That's seems like a rather fragile solution. It's not a matter of setting this up once on a single site. I need something others can add using SPD.
