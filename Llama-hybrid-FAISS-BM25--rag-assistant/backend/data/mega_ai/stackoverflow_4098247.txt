Magento checkout.xml file not being recognised

I've recently been building a Magento theme from scratch and have encountered a problem with the checkout.xml file. It doesn't seem to be recognised by the system. The reason I say this is that I was trying to comment out the following code to remove the My Cart and Checkout links from the top menu. This should remove the links but wouldn't. I even deleted all the code from the file and saved it to see if it would break the system or bring up any errors, to no avail. I managed to remove the links using the following code in the customer.xml file, but still feel I should know why the problematic file is not being recognised to develop an understanding of Magento. I will add that these layout files were added to the layout folder after I initially installed the theme, but this shouldn't be a problem as all worked fine in the customer.xml file, yet not the checkout.xml. I also cleared the cache in the backend. This did not work. Any ideas would be seriously appreciated. Thanks.
