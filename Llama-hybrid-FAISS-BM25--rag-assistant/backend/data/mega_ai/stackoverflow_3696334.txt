I joined an organization that used both Informatica PowerCenter 8.1.1. Although I can't speak for general Informatica setups, I can say that at this company Informatica was exceedingly inefficient. The main problem is that Informatica generated some really henious SQL code in the back-end. When I watched what it was doing with profiler and from reviewing the text logs, it generated separate insert, update, and delete statements for each row that needed to be inserted/updated/deleted. Instead of trying to fix the Informatica implementation, I simply replaced it with SSIS 2008. Another problem I had with Informatica was managing parallelization. In both DTS and SSIS, parallelizing tasks was pretty simple -- don't define precedence constraints and your tasks will run in parallel. In Informatica, you define a starting point and then define the branches for running processes in parallel. I couldn't find a way for it to limit the number of parallel processes unless I explicitly defined them by chaining the worklets or tasks. In my case, SSIS substantially outperformed Informatica. Our load process with Informatica took about 8-12 hours. Our load process with SSIS and SQL Server Agent Jobs was about 1-2 hours. I am certain had we properly tuned Informatica we could have reduced the load to 3-4 hours, but I still don't think it would have done much better.
