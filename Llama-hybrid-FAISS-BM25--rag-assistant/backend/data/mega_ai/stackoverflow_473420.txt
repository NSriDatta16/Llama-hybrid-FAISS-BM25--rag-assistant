SORTING Hierarchical Queries in SQL Server 2005

I have following issue: I have a table for maintaining the hierarchical data. I'd like to use CTE from SQL 2005. WITH tree (id, parentid, code, name) AS ( SELECT id, ofs.ParentID, ofs.code, ofs.name FROM OrganizationFeatures ofs WHERE ofs.ParentID IS NULL UNION ALL SELECT ofs.id, ofs.ParentID, ofs.code, ofs.name FROM OrganizationFeatures ofs JOIN tree ON tree.ID = ofs.ParentID ) select * from tree But I'd like to sort by code and the result shold be as following: 1 1/1 1/1/1 1/1/2 1/2/1 1/2/2 2 4/1 etc. Any ideas?
