Your "highly significant" estimates likely aren't. After all, any approach to inferring unknown predictors (you are copy-pasting, which could be fill-forward or fill-backward) is fraught with uncertainty - but your Poisson regression does not know about this. I'd recommend you try to incorporate this uncertainty in your parameter estimates. At the very least, you should try different ways of inferring your unknown predictors, like fill-forward, fill-backward, linear or spline interpolation. Even better: bootstrap the entire procedure. Bootstrap your original data, then perform whatever inferring algorithm you want to use on the bootstrapped data , then estimate your Poisson regression and save the parameter estimates. I suspect that they will come out a lot more variable than your original approach would suggest. Finally, use the averages of these bootstrapped parameter estimates - and check how many of these are on one side of zero to get a bootstrap measure of significance.
