It sounds as if you want to use unsupervized learning to create a training set. Am I right? You use your cluster analysis to determine which docs come from UK, US or Oz -- or which docs are talking about Soccer, Football or Australian football respectively? Then feed those tagged docs into a supervized learning algorithm of some sort? How well this works will depend entirely on how well you can distinguish UK, US and OZ. I would have thought it would be fairly straightforward to find documents where national origin was known, so that you could build a supervized algorithm for detecting language variant. You wouldn't even need a corpus that talked about football, since dialectical differences show up in other ways that are subject matter independent. (For example, I am clearly from North America, since I just wrote "in ways that are subject matter independent" rather than "Since dialectical differences do not depend on subject matter"). However, the answer to your question, "can I use unsupervized learning and then supervized learning" is No, if you are looking for supervized learning. If the results of an unsupervized learning algorithm are fed to a supervized learning algorithm, the net result is unsupervized --- there are still no grown-ups in the room. And the classification errors of the resulting process will contain error terms from both stages. You won't get the same performance as you would if you did a SVM with properly tagged training data. This doesn't mean you shouldn't use the method you propose ... it might still work well ... but it won't be a supervized learning algorithm.
