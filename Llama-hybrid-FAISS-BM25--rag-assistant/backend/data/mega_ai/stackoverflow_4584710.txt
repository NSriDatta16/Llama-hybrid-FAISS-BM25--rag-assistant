Linq error - does not contain a property with the name 'COname'

In the data binding process I get the following error when binding to a field in a formview: DataBinding: 'System.Data.Linq.EntitySet`1[[LinqClassLibrary.dbml.OrderAgency, LinqClassLibrary, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null]]' does not contain a property with the name 'COname'. code snippet: ' /> Looking at the object browser it shows: From my "Order" table: public System.Data.Linq.EntitySet OrderAgencies { set; get; } Member of LinqClassLibrary.dbml.Order and From my "OrderAgency" table: public string COname { set; get; } Member of LinqClassLibrary.dbml.OrderAgency This used to work. And from my understanding of Linq2Sql this is the correct way to reference the field in the OrderAgency table from the Order table. I'm still fairly new at linq2sql so maybe I've missed something obvious here.
