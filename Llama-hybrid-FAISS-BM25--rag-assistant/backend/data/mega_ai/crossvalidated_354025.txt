The average deviation from the mean is $0$, that is $E[X-\mu]=0$, and so, taken literally, the absolute average deviation is also $0$. Changing your question slightly to Can you interpret the standard deviation as the average absolute deviation from the mean? No, $E[|X-\mu|]$ is not the standard deviation, that is, $$\sigma = \sqrt{E[(X-\mu)^2]} \neq E[|X-\mu|].$$
