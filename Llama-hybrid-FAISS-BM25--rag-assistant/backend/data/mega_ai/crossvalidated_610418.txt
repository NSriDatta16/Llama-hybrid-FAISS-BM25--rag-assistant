There are cases where frequentist and Bayesian inference converge on the same answer, so within these limits, one could argue that the distinctions are only philosophical. I feel that the wording "incorporating prior beliefs" already implies that the parameter you are infering is a random variable. Your "prior belief" has to be a probability distribution rather than a fixed value, otherwise it would be a "present certainty" rather than "prior belief," and it wouldn't make sense to perform inference if you already know what the answer is. "Incorporating" implies that it needs to contribute to your answer. If I thought 1+1=3 and observe that it is 2, my original 3 is entirely discarded and not incorporated into my observation of 2. Our prior beliefs are "incorporated" via multiplication in Bayes' theorem. A probability distribution, whether multiplied by another probability distribution or a fixed value, equals another probability distribution. Hence, our answer is in the form of a probability distribution and is therefore a random variable by definition. If we insist that the answer is a fixed value in some way, how can we claim that we've multiplied in our prior beliefs as defined above? I am having trouble understanding your "concrete scenario" because I don't know how you could actually "use a prior that reflects our uncertainty" in practice, other than via Bayes' theorem. Allow me to ignore that for the time being. You then propose that "the resulting probability distribution of the inferred parameter is simply arising because of uncertainty, not inherent randomness in the parameter." Allow me to be even less rigorous in my mathematical terminology... I would say that "the resulting distribution" you speak of has some variance, and this final variance consists of two components: A) the variance originating from your prior probability distribution, and B) the variance originating from your sampling distribution. Your claim about variance "simply arising because of uncertainty, not inherent randomness in the parameter" can only apply component B of the final variance but not component A. Since there is some component of variance remaining in your final answer, even assuming your claim is true, your final answer must still be a random variable.
