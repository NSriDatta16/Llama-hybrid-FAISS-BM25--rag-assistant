Smoothing with keeping min/max values

I want to smooth GPS elevation data to reliably sum the ascents of my hikes and training runs. For example, it registers these elevation values: 602, 602, 601, 602, 601, 602, 614, 607, 602 I can smooth out the flukes ( 602 --> 601 --> 602 --> 601 --> 602 ) with a moving median (or average) value - with rounding, if necessary. But then, the elevation of 614 will be discarded. Is there a reliable way to smooth a data series while keeping local minimums and maximums?
