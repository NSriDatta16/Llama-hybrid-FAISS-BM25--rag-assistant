Caret and randomForest number of trees

I am puzzled as to why the caret package in R does not allow tuning on the number of trees (ntree) in a random forest (specifically in the randomForest package)? I cant imagine this is an oversight on the part of the package author - so there must be a reason for it? Can anyone shed light?
