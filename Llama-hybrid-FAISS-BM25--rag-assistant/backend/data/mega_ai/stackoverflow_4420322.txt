Not very elegant but you can trim the result on the client if you have no access to the server script. Example: $.get("countItems.php?cid=draftCount", function(data) { $('#draftCount').html($.trim(data)); }); By the way, the whitespace on server-side script result may occur from: There actually is a whitespace before the interpreted part of the script utf8 with BOM is used server software is buggy (use apache with no modules if none of the above works)
