Application of Machine learning in modelling experimental system as a PhD topic

I am working as a control Engineer in a high energy physics lab. I am looking for a PhD thesis topic. Our experimental system is highly non linear and can't be modeled using standard white box approach. I am thinking of developing Neural Net models of the sensors attached to the experimental system. Also in this way I can model the system with primary inputs and outputs. So the basic idea is to have a data driven system identification and data driven sensor model. I wanted your feedback if this can be potential thesis problem. Thanks.
