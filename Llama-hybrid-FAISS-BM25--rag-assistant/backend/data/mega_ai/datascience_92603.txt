The average lifetime is calculated simply by using the geometric distribution 's mean formula. If probability of churn in any month (or simply percent churned in a month) is 0.2, then the expected life time of a customer is 1/0.2 = 5 months. Here you are filtering the unchurned customer at the first step ( filter(Cancelled == "TRUE") ) and therefore you get the average lifetime of the churned customers in your sample rather than the average lifetime of any customer.
