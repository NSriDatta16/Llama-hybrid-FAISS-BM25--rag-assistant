How to deal with the standard error of fixed-effect in lmer using r?

I have a time series data across different locations with pre-post indicator. Also there are some locations belong to one intervention group and some other belong to a different intervention group. I am using lmer with random intercept and some fixed effects. Here is the code, model_alcohol Note that I use sin(2*pi*Time/6) and cos(2*pi*Time/6) to adjust for seasonality. The interaction terms here is the difference-in-difference coefficient, is my main interest. Here is the fitted coefficients for fixed effects, I concern that some of the fixed-effects have a very high standard error (e.g. interaction term has standard error 4.74), because I am going to interpret the coefficients. Is there any way I can fix the issue? I found a post here asking about the correlations among the coefficients.
