The system cache is used for anything that comes off disk. That includes file metadata, so if you are using applications that open a large number of files (say, directory scanners), then you can easily flush the cache if you also have applications running that eat up a lot of memory. For the stuff I use, I prefer to use a small number of large files (>64 MB to 1 GB) and asynchronous un-bufferred I/O. And a good ol' defrag every once in a while.
