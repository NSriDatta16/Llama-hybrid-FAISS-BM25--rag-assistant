When to use the (|) in Bellman's equation

I was reading the Reinforcement Learning book by Sutton and Barto but I have problems in understanding when to include the term $\sum_{a}^{} \pi (a|s) $ , because they handle the different evaluation policy in two parts of the book when updating V(s). Thank you in advance
