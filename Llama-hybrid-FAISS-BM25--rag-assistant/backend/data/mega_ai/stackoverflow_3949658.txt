Have come up with the following, which works, but would be interested in any more elegant solutions private Player GetNextPlayer() { var players = Players.AsEnumerable(); if (Direction.Equals(Direction.Backwards)) { players = players.Reverse(); } bool selectNextPlayer = false; foreach (Player player in players) { if (selectNextPlayer && !player.PlayerState.Equals(PlayerState.HasNoCards)) { return player; } if (player.IsThisPlayersTurn) { selectNextPlayer = true; } } return players.First(o => !o.PlayerState.Equals(PlayerState.HasNoCards)); }
