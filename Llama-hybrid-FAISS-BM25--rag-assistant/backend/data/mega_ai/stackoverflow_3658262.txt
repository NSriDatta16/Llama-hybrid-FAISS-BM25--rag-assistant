First of all, my condolences. Is Clearcase that difficult to learn? If yes, I'd consider that a strike against it. If not, you might be better off just going with the flow and learning it. The 3 people on your team aren't likely to be the ones that maintain the code over its software life, so that argument goes against you as well. How big is the organization? It's easier for 3 people to learn Clearcase than for X to learn Subversion. It would depend a lot on your boss and his/her willingness to consider alternatives. Subversion would certainly be easy to set up and use. I'd hate to be using Clearcase myself. But there are a lot of factors against you. Good luck.
