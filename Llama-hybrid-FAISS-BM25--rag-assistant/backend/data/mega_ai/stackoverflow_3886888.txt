If you don't want (or have the risk of) students overwriting each other's work then - Create a separate site per student (use HTTP host headers to share the server's IP address across multiple sites) Uploading Method 1: Add FTP Publishing to each site - doesn't require a windows account but does need a separate user id if you want to keep students from interfering with each other Uploading Method 2: Enable WebDAV on each site. Again if you want to keep students from botching each others work you'll need a separate windows account for each one (WebDAV requires Windows accounts). If this is not a concern then just create a single site and give each one their own application and use a shared username/password to allow them to upload their projects. WebDAV makes life a bit easier because each student can just drag & drop copy their site directly to their own folder instead of having to fire up an FTP client.
