How to make a Ruby string safe for a filesystem?

I have user entries as filenames. Of course this is not a good idea, so I want to drop everything except [a-z] , [A-Z] , [0-9] , _ and - . For instance: my§document$is°° very&interesting___thisIs%nice445.doc.pdf should become my_document_is_____very_interesting___thisIs_nice445_doc.pdf and then ideally my_document_is_very_interesting_thisIs_nice445_doc.pdf Is there a nice and elegant way for doing this?
