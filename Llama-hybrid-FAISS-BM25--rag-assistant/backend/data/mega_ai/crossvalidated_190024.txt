The outcomes were "assigned other to positive" or "assigned self to positive" but these need to be recorded in some convenient way. Indeed, some packages will require you to record these as numbers before putting them into some statistical analysis. Whether required or simply for convenience, the transformation from those text categories to some numerical values on which analysis can be done is often called "coding". No doubt $r$ means the statistic being tested for significance is the correlation coefficient , $r$ (The null presumably being that the population correlation is $0$ against the two tailed alternative that it differs from $0$). Indeed, the word "correlation" occurs in the sentence you highlighted in green. While it wasn't mentioned in the previous sentence, $r$ is a common symbol for the sample correlation, and both sentences mention the statistic $r$. The $18$ presumably refers to the degrees of freedom in the t-test for correlation . (It's annoying to me the degree to which authors - typically encouraged or even forced by journal editors or even journal standards - tend to abbreviate the statistics information so much that the reader is forced to make guesses at what they decided to do. How many more characters would it take to make it explicit in context?) However in this case, from your second image, we do see the confirmation that it is indeed correlation that is being examined: So all those numbers in your second excerpt are correlations and presumably would be interpreted as correlations would generally be understood.
