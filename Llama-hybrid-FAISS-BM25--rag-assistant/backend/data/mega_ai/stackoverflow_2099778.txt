I had the same problem with the PartCover reports. So I have been trying to make it work right and I just discovered that the problem was the two XSLT files that come with the PartCover distribution. I fixed these files and now everything is working fine for me: report by assembly Coverage by assembly background:ghostwhite; padding: 5px 30px 5px 5px; 0]/@len)+0"/> 0% % report by class Coverage by class background:ghostwhite; padding: 5px 30px 5px 5px; 0]/@len)+0"/> 0% % I hope you find this useful. Also, any feedback about this files is welcomed, so we can provide the commutiy with correct files. See this related question
