In AS3, how do I set an object passed as a function parameter to null?

Right now, this code var gridArray:Array = [[],[],[],[],[],[]]; gridArray[0][0] = new gridProperties; //gridProperties has gridX and gridY i.e. gridArray[0][0].gridX function clearGridSquare(gridSquare:gridProperties):void { gridSquare = null; } function test():void { clearGridSquare(gridArray[0][0]); trace (gridArray[0][0]); } produces [object gridProperties] instead of null. I understand that since an object is a reference, even though it technically is passed as a value to the function, it acts like it is passed as a reference. In this way I can alter say, the gridX or gridY properties of the original object from within the function (gridSquare.gridX=1), but I cannot actually make the object itself null. I have found that I can make it null if I do this in the function instead: gridArray[gridSquare.gridY][gridSquare.gridX] = null; but that seems like I really bad and roundabout way of doing it. Is there a more elegant solution?
