Strictly speaking it isn't the only option; you could put an argument that "remoting" meets the meaning inthe text; here a fake object is created at the receiver that contains no state . All calls (methods, properties etc) are intercepted and only the call and result are transferred. This avoids the need to transfer the object itself, but can get very expensive if overly "chatty" usage is involved (I.e. Lots of calls)as each has the latency of the speed of light (which adds up). However, "remoting" is now rather out of fashion. Most often, yes: the object will need to be serialised and deserialized in some way (there are lots of options here). The paragraph is then pretty-much correct.
