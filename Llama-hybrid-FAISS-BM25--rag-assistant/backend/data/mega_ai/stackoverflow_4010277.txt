xslt - adding every n node?

I found an elegant solution for that problem here: xsl for-each: add code block every n rows? I'd like to understand the xslt code and I was wondering if you could help me to understand it by taking a look at the link provided above. Basically there are 3 . To me the first 2 ones are enough to achieve the purpose. However I tried with only 2 and it doesn't work. In short the third one is required. Here it is: The second template has a mode while the last one has not. I have no idea when the last one is executed. Could you please help me to figure out it? Thanks for your help. Regards, Roland
