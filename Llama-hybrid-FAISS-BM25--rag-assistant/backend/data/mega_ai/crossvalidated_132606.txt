Negative Constant Positive Beta in Binary logistics

I have a dichotomous dependent variable as 0 and 1 and a continuous covariate. I went for a binary logistic regression and it came up with a positive B but negative constant. So is it a problem? How can i interpret this B efficiently and accurately? Thanks a lot .
