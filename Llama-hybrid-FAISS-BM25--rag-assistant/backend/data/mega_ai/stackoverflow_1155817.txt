Run login script from .NET application

I am writing a small utility that, among other things, will allow the user to run his/her logon script. It is a .NET application that will run on Windows XP/Vista/7 PCs that are joined to an active directory domain. The PCs belong to different organizational units and will be running different scripts. Is there an environment variable that I can query that will tell me the script that ran when the user logged on? Or will I have to include it in the config file and make sure that every PC is pointed to the correct script?
