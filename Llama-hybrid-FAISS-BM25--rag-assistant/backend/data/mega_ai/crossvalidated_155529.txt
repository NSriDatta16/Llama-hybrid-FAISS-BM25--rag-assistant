In this case, is it still justified to run a pooled regression with interactions thrown in? Or, do we assume that two samples are really from two different populations and hence the models should be estimated separately? The key is to apply the same causal modeling framework that rationalized the model without consideration for URBAN/RURAL designation, but then apply rurality as a causal factor. For instance, you know that rural people have less access to health care, so if it is a study of prevalence of disease versus, say, family history of disease, you may choose to adjust for rurality as a confounder. If you adjust for a model controlling for rurality and its interaction with all other model effects, you obtain inference that is equivalent to just fitting two separate models for rural and urban observations. Systematically testing interactions in a stepwise fashion does not make any sense here. Is there any way to test (frequentist or bayesian) if the two samples came from the same underlying population? No, this is a common theme and it is a rabbit hole. It is the scientist's notion of how the samples were collected that should determine whether they are okay to be "pooled" in any sense. You will tend to rule that samples are different more often than when they are the same. Calibrating "homogeneity" tests is a nightmare. Plus once you make a decision, you would need some very complicated way to account for your structural testing to obtain the "right" p-values... because when you test a bunch of things, then decide on a model, that model's default p-value does not represent the right p-value. This is a multiplicity issue. If it is any reassurance, it will not be incorrect in any way to estimate two separate models except for a possible hit to power.
