Well, I just saw this question, and you already accepted an answer, but I'm going to leave one anyway. The point of the question seems to be concerned with incrementing a counter. The fact is that jQuery's .each() method takes care of this for you. The first parameter for .each() is an incrementing counter, so you don't need to do it yourself. $('#accordian li').each(function(index) { // index has the count of the current iteration console.log( index ); }); So as you can see, there is an elegant solution built in for you.
