Read the CRAN Task View on Time Series - you might want to try storing your data as a zoo object, or an xts object (these allow irregularly-spaced time series). As for the analysis, well you should figure out what question you want to ask and then work from there. Don't run the functions you've got (decompose) and then say 'ooh what does that tell me' (okay, maybe when working in exploratory mode, but at some point you might have to write a model down). http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/TimeSeries.html
