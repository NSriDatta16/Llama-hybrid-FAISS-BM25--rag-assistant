random forest package of R - curious behavior of node size parameter

I have used the random forest package of R for supervised classification with no stopping criteria defined by the user. Well, the default of the node size is one, but many end nodes contain more than one sample. What make the algorithm stops while the node size is not still one? I have set mtry , the number of variables sampled at each split, with training the RF.
