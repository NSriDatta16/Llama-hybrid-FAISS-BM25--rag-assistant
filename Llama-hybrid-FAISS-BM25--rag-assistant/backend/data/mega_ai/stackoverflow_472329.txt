How can I synchronize two processes accessing a file on a NAS?

Here's the thing: I have two applications, written in C++ and running on two machines with different OS (one Linux and one Windows). One of this process is in charge of updating an XML file on a NAS (Network Attached Storage) while the other one reads this file. Is it possible to synchronize these two processes in order to avoid reading of the file at the same time it's being modified?
