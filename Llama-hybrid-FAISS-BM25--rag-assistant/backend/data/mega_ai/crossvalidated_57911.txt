What are statistical methods for comparing different brackets

I am not particularly familiar with statistics and am looking at methods for analysing numbers that have been broken into different "brackets" or "groups" for different entities. Consider three companies. A announces that they have 10 factories generating between 10,000 and 20,000 widgets per year and 15 factories generating between 20,000 to 40,000 B announces that they have 7 factories generating between 15,000 and 25,000 widgets and 5 factories generating between 25,000 and 35,000 C announces they have 5 factories generating between 10,000 and 23,000 widgets and 14 between 23,000 and 40,000 To be clear all widget production is included in my simplified example above. What statistical methods can be used (and do any exist) that would allow you to aggregate this data together and make generalised predictions (all companies have on average x factories that generate 15,000 widgets per year and y factories that generate 40,000)?
