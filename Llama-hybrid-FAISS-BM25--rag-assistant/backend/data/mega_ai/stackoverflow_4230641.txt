Interdev, try running the debug version on your device; from your description, it seems like there may be some difference between simulator and device, rather than the ad hoc and debug versions. If that doesn't give you the answer, and it is actually some issue with the ad hoc version, you can always access the crash logs for the device from the Xcode Organizer (Window > Organizer). Good luck!
