Every decision boundary that can be found by linear SVM can be found by a perceptron. Concerning 4: In the case where your classes are linearly separable: There are usually infinitely many decision boundaries that achieve perfect classification. The Perceptron is guaranteed to find one of them, but it is virtually impossible to predict which one. (That will depend on the initial weights and the learning rate). The SVM (without slack variables) is also guaranteed to find a perfect decision boundary; but not an arbitrary one. It finds one of the boundaries with maximal distance to the closest observations. You can think of the SVM (without slack variables) picking the 'best' decision boundary among those that the Perceptron could find.
