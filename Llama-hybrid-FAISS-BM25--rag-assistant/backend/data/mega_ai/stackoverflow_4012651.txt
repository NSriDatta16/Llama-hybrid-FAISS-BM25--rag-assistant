Targeting iPad via Google Ad Manager/ DFP

I am using Google Ad Manager to publish ads on my websites, most of my ads are flash banners which wont work on ipads so I want to custom target my ads so that they wont be displayed for ipads, but how to do this in DFP ? I found out the user agent for ipad from here but I have no idea how to use this to target my ads.
