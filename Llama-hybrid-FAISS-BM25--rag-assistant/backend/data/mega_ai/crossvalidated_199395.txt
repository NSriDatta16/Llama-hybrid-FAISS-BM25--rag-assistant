One way to check your work is with simulation. For instance, your answer to (1) can be checked in R with a command like mean(rpois(1e6, 10.515) > 5) which simulates one million ( 1e6 ) trials where the true mean number of defects is $10.515$ and reports the proportion with more than $5$ defects. The idea behind a confidence limit is that when the true mean is greater than this, you are unlikely to see as few as just $5$ defects. This situation should be right on the borderline where there is a 95% chance of observing more than $5$ defects. Compare the output with the intended confidence level of $0.95$. (I obtain $95.0005\%$, which is satisfactorily close.) As another example, general rules of thumb suggest the UCL for $u$ should be somewhere around $$\frac{15 + 2\sqrt{15}}{5} \approx 4.55.$$ A comparable simulation confirms this value is a little low, but not by much, because its coverage of $94.24\%$ is a tiny bit lower than the intended $95\%$. u 15) After you work out a more precise value of $u$, plug that into this simulation to see what the coverage is.
