I think your best bet is going to be GPLEX/GPPG, it's the closest thing to Yacc/Lex for C# that I know of, and you will need to port your actions into C# regardless. I have also used Coco/R, ANTLR (of course), and have more recently played with Irony.net, fslex/fsyacc (F#), and fparsec (F#). Here are some links Fparsec Coco/R Irony.net Gardens Point Parser Generator Gardens Point Lex I don't have a technical reason for using one versus another: I play around with these mostly for fun. I did create some DSLs for work projects a good number of years ago, but I hand rolled the scanners/parsers on those (back then I was working mostly in Pascal, and I found that TP Lex/Yacc did not suit my tastes, and the DSLs were simple enough). I have found that FParsec and Irony suit my tastes the best, as I find the other somewhat "messy" (lacking in elegance).
