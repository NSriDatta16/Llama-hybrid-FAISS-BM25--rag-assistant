How to get NUnit information into CruiseControl.Net 1.5 after NCover has run NUnit?

I've installed NCover 3.4 on my CruiseControl 1.5 and after some tinking, I've got the coverage reports shown in my cleanly installed CC. I can't see the test results however (and never could after installing CC Net 1.5, as I recall 1.4 it 'just worked'). How do I get the unit test results from NCover displayed in CC.net? (NUnit details and NUnit timings) Thanks, Anders, Denmark
