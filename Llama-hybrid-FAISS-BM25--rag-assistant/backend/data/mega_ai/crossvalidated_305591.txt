From wikipedia - " Because we are never working directly in the feature space, the kernel-formulation of PCA is restricted in that it computes not the principal components themselves, but the projections of our data onto those components. " . So kernel PCA only computes the final step which is the projection onto the a subspace. There is never a unique way to recover a vector from it's projection.
