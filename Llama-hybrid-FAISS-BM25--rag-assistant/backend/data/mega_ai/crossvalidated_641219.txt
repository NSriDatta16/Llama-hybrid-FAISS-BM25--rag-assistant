This is a well-studied problem. Given the vagaries of time series data, there is no one-size-fits-all technique. If the purpose is to test whether there is a changepoint at a KNOWN location/time, a common method is the Chow test. But if the location of the changepoint is unknown, there are some methods like the Quandt Likelihood Ratio test and the Pettitt test for that purpose. All these procedures are available in R. Further if the purpose is to explicitly test whether there is a shift in the mean, some model-based approaches may be more flexible. There are numerous packages available in the statistical program R for that, such as the changepoint and bcp packages. If somebody cares a Bayesian method, one choice is the Rbeast package developed by my group, available in R , Python , and Matlab (To indulge myself in self-prompting: https://github.com/zhaokg/Rbeast ). Here is a quick example in R library(Rbeast) data(Nile) # the annual streamflow of the River Nile o1 = beast(Nile) # A full Bayesian model o2 = beast(Nile,method='bic') # based on the Bayesian information criterion plot(o1) plot(o2)
