Q-mode vs. R-mode PCA

I have some doubts on Q-mode and R-mode principal component analysis (PCA). I've read from different sources that: Q-mode PCA is equivalent to R-mode PCA of the transposed data matrix! Q-mode PCA (with squared Euclidean distance) is equivalent to R-mode PCA (of the covariance matrix)! It seems to me that these two are not equivalent statements. Can someone clarify that? Q-mode(SEuclid) = R-mode(covar) is the only instance where (proper) Q-mode and R-mode PCAs give the same results? If I perform an R-mode PCA on the transposed data matrix, wouldn't I work on a $n
