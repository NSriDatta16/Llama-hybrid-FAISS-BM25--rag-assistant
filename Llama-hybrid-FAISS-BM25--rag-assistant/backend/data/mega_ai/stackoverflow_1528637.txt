There are two ways to use OCX/DLLs: code reusability vs. fragmentation of an over-large project. Those meant for re-use would be absurd to build, build, and rebuild, and almost never should be customized to fit a new application. These are your crown jewels, and most people should have no ability to modify the source. They are the domain of your organization's "library writers" because that's what they are: libraries. If you simply have large, monolithic, unweildy applications you may have to go the other route. Then OCXs and DLLs simply become an awkward extension of the "module" concept. This is why we have Project Groups. Your library users should not be fiddling with libraries though. I'm sure they all fancy themselves able to "ensure they are up to date and performant" but that's a different debate entirely.
