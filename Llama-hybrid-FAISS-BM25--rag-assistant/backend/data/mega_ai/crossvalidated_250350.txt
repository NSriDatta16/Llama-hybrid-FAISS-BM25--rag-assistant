How do I avoid computationally singular matrices in R?

I'm fitting a logistic regression model (with R 's caret package) to data here . I aim to predict whether Hillary or Trump will win a given county. The relevant code: logisticSettings electTrain is my training dataset; the first column is the column of classes and the rest is features. When I run this, I get the following error: Error in solve.default(ddf) : system is computationally singular: reciprocal condition number = 9.55304e-17 I think this stems at least in part from the data being highly correlated. For example, one column is 2010 population, and another is 2010 population estimate. To remedy this, I removed some columns from my training set so that no features were correlated at above .92 (arbitrary cutoff). But the error persists. What's wrong? Some ideas: The error cutoff is still too high. One column is approximately a linear combination of two or more others. I've made a mistake in the code.
