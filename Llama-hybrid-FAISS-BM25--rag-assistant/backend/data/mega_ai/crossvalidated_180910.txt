Can ARIMA be used to forecast trend in time series data?

I am new to ARIMA. I have a time series data that has a negative trend.I need to predict its value for the upcoming time period. I know that one of the steps in ARIMA is to de-trend data through differencing. My question is that wouldn't the forecast be wrong, since this method assumes there is no trend in the data, when in fact there is a negative trend? How would the forecast be different from a forecast on a similar data with no trend? And in general, why is de trending even done? If the data had trend, why would you ignore that and do a forecast after removing the trend?
