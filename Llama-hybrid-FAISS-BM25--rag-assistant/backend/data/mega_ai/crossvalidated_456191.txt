How AR model parameters are estimated?

I know that AR(p) is defined like this: $$ y_{t} = c + \phi_{1}y_{t-1} + \phi_{2}y_{t-2} + \dots + \phi_{p}y_{t-p} + \varepsilon_{t}, $$ From what I understood, this means $y_{t}$ value is predicted using the $p$ past values of the time series, and each value is given a weight (coefficient) $ \phi_{p}$ , and this weight varies according how much this $y_{t-p}$ is correlated with $y_{t}$ . Using statsmodel library, after fitting a AR(4) model, and printing model.summary() I got: Are AR.1, AR.2 ... values the same as $\phi$ , if so how are they computed? And what are the meaning of Real, Imaginary, Modulus, Frequency? And after plotting the PACF of my time series, it doesn't seem to match AR values I got in the summary (ex: AR.2 , it is negatively correlated in the graph meanwhile the $\phi$ value is positive).
