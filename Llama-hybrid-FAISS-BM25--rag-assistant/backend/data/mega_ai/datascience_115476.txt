The problem seems too complex for being solved in one shot. I suggest first starting with a small case of 3 routes and trying to optimize them correctly. Then you can increase the routes until reaching the totality. Then, you can try algorithms like a random forest to explore many scenarios and find good solutions. https://stackabuse.com/random-forest-algorithm-with-python-and-scikit-learn/ But I'm not sure if an optimization solution like Genetic Algorithms is better. https://github.com/Yaaximus/genetic-algorithm-path-planning If there is some sample data, it would be easier to know which solution could work best.
