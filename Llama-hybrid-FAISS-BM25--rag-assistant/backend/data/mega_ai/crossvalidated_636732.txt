Principal Component Analysis (PCA) the constant sum constraint

I have data that sums to 100 % +/- 5%, and I was reading that data that sums to 100% should be altered before doing PCA. A method that I found others have done is to use the centered log-ratio (clr) transformation. I'm not sure if I should do this on my data set, since some samples have a sum of 105%, but an increase in one value causes a decrease in another value, so that the sum is near 100%. Let me know if anyone has any feedback. Thanks!
