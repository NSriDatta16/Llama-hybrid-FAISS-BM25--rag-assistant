Attention: In Java java property files should be encoded in ISO 8859-1! ISO 8859-1 character encoding. Characters that cannot be directly represented in this encoding can be written using Unicode escapes ; only a single 'u' character is allowed in an escape sequence. @see Properties Java Doc If you still really want to do this: have a look at: Java properties UTF-8 encoding in Eclipse -- there are some code samples Since Java 9: property files are encoded in UTF-8, so there should be no problem/doubt In Java SE 9, properties files are loaded in UTF-8 encoding. In previous releases, ISO-8859-1 encoding was used for loading property resource bundles.
