You should not be combining libraries in such a way that the same code ends up getting linked into a program more than once. Isolate your metrics class in one library, along with whatever other classes it should be packaged with (see the six packaging principles published by Robert Martin for guidance). Put your other classes that depend on it in other libraries (or put it all in one library if those packaging principles reveal that they belong together). When linking a program, link in all of the libraries required, including libraries that depend on the metrics class and the (one) library that contains the metric class.
