Input array is longer than the number of columns in this table

I've recently started to use SQLite and began to integrate it into a C# project I'm working on. However, randomly my project will throw the exception: Input array is longer than the number of columns in this table I'm having a hard time trying the trace the problem because it seems to be thrown on a random basis. DataTable table = new DataTable(); //exception is thrown here table = Global.db.ExecuteQuery("SELECT * FROM vm_manager"); Some of the data that gets returned from this query is as follows: https://i.stack.imgur.com/9rlLN.png If anyone has any advice, I'd be grateful. EDIT: I'm unable to show the execute query function as it resides inside a dll from the following sql lite wrapper http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/cs_sqlitewrapper.aspx EDIT 2 Problem stems from the new record array function inside this particular sql lite wrapper.
