Wordpress Theme Developer "Workspace"

I am a Wordpress Theme Developer (Freelancer) and I make somewhere between 1-2 Themes / Week so I need a Quick way to make this happen. Examples: I use twentyten every time, delete the functions that I don't need, the CSS, images etc. I kinda let it "naked". (Not a quick way, maybe a personal framework?) I search for Wordpress functions (since I can't remember all of them), on Wordpress Codex and again, not a quick way. So, do you guys think that a personal Function DB would be ok for me? And more other stuff that I can't remember right now. How do you guys organize your workspace?
