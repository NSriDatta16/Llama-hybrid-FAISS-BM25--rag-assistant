K-fold Cross validation in Transformer-like model with epoch

I'm new to Transformer and am building a Transformer model for classification. Before I added the k-fold validation, I needed 3 epochs to train the model . Here comes the question: say, if I use 5-fold cross validation, do I train 5 models in total, one for every 3 epochs. OR Do I use 5-fold cross validation under every epoch ? How do I aggregate the test loss if I was training 5 different models ? After the k-fold is done, how do I know which model to save, I am quite confused here.. Please explain the things in English...
