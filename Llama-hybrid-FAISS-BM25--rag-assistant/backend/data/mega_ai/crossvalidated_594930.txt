I can reverse engineer the computation of ED50 in the case of the drc package. With the code below I recreated the plot from the drc package using the nls function to fit the 4 parameter log-logistic model that the drc package uses. It seems like the package uses as ED50 value the concentration where the estimated effect is 50% of the entire curve. library(tidyverse) library(drc) ### DRM stuff toxdata $conc,toxdata$ rootl, log = "", pch = 20, cex = 0.7) cs =seq(0,40,0.1) y = c + (d-c)/(1+exp(b*(cs-e))) lines(cs,y) c50 = 3.05795 y50 = c + (d-c)/(1+exp(b*(c50-e))) points(c50,y50, pch = 21, col = 1, bg = 2) lines(c(-10,40),c(1,1)*(d+c)/2, lty = 2) I haven't used ED50 a lot and I had to search for it. According to Wikipedia it is the dose at which a certain effect is appearing in 50% of the population. An open question is 'what effect' are we talking about. That might relate to the 'inflection point' and the '50%' as definitions of an effect. In the example above, if we would give a dose with a concentration of 3.05795 then the estimated distribution of the effect in the rye plants would be a normal distribution with a mean rootl around 4.360447 which is the 50% level of the curve. So at a concentration of 3.05795 the median effect will be 4.360447 which is an effect at 50% of the dose-response curve. Whether you can get the inflection point via drc I am not sure, but it seems to me that in the four parameter logistic function the 50% value and the inflection point are the same because the function is symmetric. Related to your comment how to get ED90 and your first link ( Logistic Regression and Inflection Point ). In those cases the modelled variable is a probability for some predifined effect ( binomial regression ), instead of a numerical response. The use of ED values relate directly to the values of the curve which goes from 0 to 1. Values like ED90 make probably more sense in those cases. In the case of modelling a numerical value, people also seem to use the term EC50 , the 50% effective concentration. The dose where thee effect is at 50% (on average). Possibly that is what you meant by ED50 at 50%.
