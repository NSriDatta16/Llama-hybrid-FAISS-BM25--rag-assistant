Why not just create a DomDocumentFragment ? function innerHTML($node){ $fragment = $node->ownerDocument->createDocumentFragment(); foreach ($node->childNodes as $child) { $fragment->appendChild($child); } return $node->ownerDocument->saveXml($fragment); } It has better semantic meaning IMHO, and also saves you from having to import the nodes into a new document (Which likely will be expensive depending on the number of children the node has). As far as performance levels are concerned, each call took about 0.00005 seconds independent of which function was used (they were with a margin of error from each other)(based on a quick test). So don't worry too much about it, but also don't do it more than necessary...
