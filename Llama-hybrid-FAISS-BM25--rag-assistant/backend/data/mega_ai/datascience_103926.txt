Multi-label classification deep learning

I have a multi-label classification problem where I have more than one target and each of them is a list. The prediction for each target can be either a list of one or more items (one or more vegetables and one or more fruits) Features lables : A B C Vegetable fruits 1 3 8 [carrot, corn, carrot] [Apricot, Cherry] 1 3 8 [eggplant, pepper] [Mango ] 1 3 8 [carrot] [Banana, Cherry, Mango] I was wondering what is the correct approach to take for example what could be the right model to begin with or is there a predefined models or pre-trinted model for similar problem?
