Your question implies that you want to find "latent (unobserved) variable(s)" in your data. An example of a latent variable could be a class variable. For example, social scientists may attempt to identify the political party membership (class) of a sample of the population where this variable is unknown. A traditional approach would be: Construct a dataset of numeric data that describes the population under study (e.g. - income, education level, age of individuals in a census area). Arbitrarily set the number of political classes to study (e.g. republican, democrat, independent). Run a "Latent Class Analysis" or KNN clustering algorithm against this data set in order to separate each record (individual) into 3 separate classes. Study the classes to determine how well the algorithm grouped members by attribute (income, education level, age). Example: a heatmap of average values by class. Your problem is made more complex by the types of input data in your spreadsheet. You will need to convert this data into numeric inputs. For example, a one-hot encoding of "calltype" before running a clustering algorithm against your dataset. If you're up for a challenge, and you have a large (100k+) dataset, you might find interesting clusters by implementing the following algorithms: Autoencoder --> KNN or Gaussian Mixture Model Autoencoder --> UMAP --> KNN or Gaussian Mixture Model ...some other deep approach + clustering algorithm If you're up for the latter approach you'll want to study the Python Keras library. Otherwise, if you are inexperienced with this problem you should start with: converting your text inputs into numeric data Run KNN with your chosen K-classes
