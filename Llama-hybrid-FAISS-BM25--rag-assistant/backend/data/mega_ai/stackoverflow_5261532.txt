HTML5 markup for list of specifications

I am struggling a bit to understand what would be the proper markup for the following information it would be a specifications list for a wine: soil : The soild is a mixture of limestone and clay... appelation : st. emilion areas under vine : 7.3 hectares grape varieties : merlot : 50% cabernet franc : 50% ageing : aged in new oak barrels for 24 months top vintages : 1929 ... 2009 cellar value chart rebased : so firstly I thought: this would look nice if each one of the items is a section within the specifications section but then it looked that it isn't a section because it basically consists of key:value pairs. So I've changed for a definition list which would have some definition terms and few items with more than one definition. It looks good in markup but there's no way to style that properly if you need a block/flow element for earch one of the definitions and float them side by side. something like this: Then it occurred to me that I could use a unordered list too but I am not sure if this would be a good markup since it would practically have to create a header for each list item and them insert its value on a subsquent paragraph (seems too much for me) So perhaps a table?...well I am a bit confused after these many options available, the one which makes me feel more comfortable yet still the sub- section s alternative but I am not sure if this would be a good markup since the impression I have of sections is that they would include more content than just a single line in some cases. If someone could give a help here on how to make it work on a clean markup but at the same time consider the accessibility, it would be great :) Thanks in advance
