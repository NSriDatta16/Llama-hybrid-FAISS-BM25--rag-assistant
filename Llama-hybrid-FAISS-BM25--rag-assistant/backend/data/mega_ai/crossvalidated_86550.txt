cost 0.5) First, you have set a cut-off as 0.5. Your r is 0/1, but pi is probability. So individual cost is 1 if absolute error is greater than 0.5, otherwise 0. Then, this function calculates the average error rate. But remember, the cut-off has been set before you define your cost function. Actually, I think it makes more sense if the choice of cut-off is determined by cost function.
