 role as Thomas Wayne from Batman v Superman. In January 2018, Warner Bros. executive Walter Hamada was appointed to oversee the DCEU as the new president of DC Films. Later that month, the filmmaking duo of John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein entered negotiations to direct Flashpoint after the studio chose not to wait for Zemeckis's schedule to be free. Warner Bros. approached the duo about working on a DC property due to their work with that studio on the film Game Night (2018) as well as the MCU film Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). Daley and Goldstein read several scripts before selecting Flashpoint, because they were fans of the Flash character. They pitched depicting the Flash as a grounded, imperfect superhero who is just learning his powers. Negotiations with the duo continued through February, and they were confirmed as directors in March. The film's title reverted to The Flash the next month. Filming was expected to begin in Atlanta in February or March 2019, but Miller's commitments to Fantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore (2022) delayed filming again by October 2018, when it was expected to start later in 2019. The Flash was aiming for a 2021 release at that point. Daley and Goldstein were also set as the film's writers by the end of February 2019, when Michael Disco joined to produce the film through his newly formed production company the Disco Factory, after working with the pair on Game Night. In March 2019, Miller was revealed to be writing a new version of the film's script with comic book writer Grant Morrison. Miller was not pleased with earlier drafts and disagreed with the lighthearted approach to the film that Daley and Goldstein were taking, although that was Warner Bros.' preferred direction for the film, and they subsequently approached Morrison with their ideas. Warner Bros. gave the pair two weeks to write the script in Scotland. Morrison described their script as a science fiction Flash story similar to Zemeckis's film Back to the Future (1985) that incorporated dark aspects related to the Flashpoint story but did not have a dark tone. The new script could be submitted to the studio by the end of the month, and if the studio did not like Miller and Morrison's take, there was potential for the actor to leave the film; Miller's holding deal to star in the film was expected to end in May. The studio rejected Miller and Morrison's script in May, instead wanting the film to explore the DC multiverse and other DC characters, but asked Miller to remain as the star of the film. Daley and Goldstein left the project in June 2019, due to creative differences, and they chose to work on Dungeons & Dragons: Honor Among Thieves (2023) instead. The duo's exit was confirmed the following month when Warner Bros. chose Christina Hodson to write a new screenplay for The Flash after she wrote its DCEU film Birds of Prey (2020). She was set to write another DCEU film, Batgirl, after completing her work on The Flash. Andy Muschietti entered negotiations to direct The Flash, with his sister Barbara joining to produce alongside Disco. Muschietti intended for The Flash to be his next project after taking a short break following It Chapter Two (2019), and a January 2020 pre-production start was expected. He did not intend for the film to have horror elements and described his take as fun, emotional, and a "beautiful human story". The involvement of Muschietti and Hodson was confirmed in November 2019, and filming was expected to begin in 2021 after Miller finished filming The Secrets of Dumbledore. While the screenplay for The Flash was being written around this time, DC Comics president Jim Lee approached Miller about appearing alongside Grant Gustin as Barry Allen / The Flash from the Arrowverse in that franchise's television crossover event "Crisis on Infinite Earths" (2019â€“20), which acknowledges a wider DC multiverse, during editing of the event. Guggenheim wrote a brief scene featuring both actors while Mille
