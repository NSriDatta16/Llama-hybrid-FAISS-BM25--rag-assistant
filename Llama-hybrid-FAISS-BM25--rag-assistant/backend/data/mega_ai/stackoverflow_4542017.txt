Tricky. Have you tried document.write(' '); ? (2.0 being the scale than you would want to set if scripting is enabled) I can't find any binding info on whether this is legal, but it seems to be in HTML. The question is whether it'll be parsed correctly. Other than that, I can think of only two alternatives: Detecting Javascript support on server side, and serving two different pages, one with, one without the meta tag Always embedding the viewport tag, and removing it using Javascript - I have no idea whether this'll work, though.
