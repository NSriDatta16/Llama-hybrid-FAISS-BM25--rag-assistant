Could GARCH models be used to deal with serial correlation?

GARCH models are used to model heteroskedasticity (in variance). I was just wondering wheter they could be used to deal with serial correlation too. As we know in fact, sometimes it is sufficient to model a time series as a garch(1,1) in order to get a good explanatory model, free from autocorrelation and heterosk.
