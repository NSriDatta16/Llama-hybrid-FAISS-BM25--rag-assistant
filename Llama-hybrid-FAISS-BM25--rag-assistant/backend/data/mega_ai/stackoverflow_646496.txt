Note that Ruby has the English names for the days of the week already built into its date class. You should try to leverage that if you can. Here's the rdoc . Then as Can has suggested just do the following: select(:event, :day, Date::DAYNAMES) Keep in mind that this solution is NOT particularly i18n friendly. If i18n is an issue, I would also check out the localized dates plugin and the changes that were made in Rails 2.2 to support i18n.
