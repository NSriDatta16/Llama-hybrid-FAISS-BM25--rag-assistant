Time series data with a independent variable

I'm working on a time series data in python, which has sales at a day level. As expected, there a few peaks at holidays and long weekends. I would like to add a new binary class variable "Holiday" '1/0'. The values of the new variable change from year to year as the holiday calendar changes I would like to use this new variable in my time series sales forecast to improve the prediction. Could anyone please explain how I approach this problem or point me to relevant resources. Thanks
