In Oracle PL/SQL is there any way to import packages and their members?

Given a package: create or replace package foo as f1 number := 1; end; / Instead of: declare begin dbms_output.put_line('f1 = ' || foo.f1); end; / I'd like to write: declare begin -- pseudocode not a valid PL/SQL import dbms_output.*; import foo.*; put_line('f1 = ' || f1); end; / But how to do that ? EDIT by Jeff: (trying to stay in the spirit of how things are done in PL/SQL) DECLARE PRAGMA IMPORT dbms_output AS d; PRAGMA IMPORT foo AS f; BEGIN d.put_line('f1 = ' || f.f1); END; /
