Imagine you have a machine that can produce ham. You put a pig (sorry for this pig) in this machine, and you get slices of ham. You can get ham from this machine, but you cannot view this machine as ham. Now, think of this machine as a function, say y = f(x) = x^2 you can put a value in this function, x = 3 for instance, and then you get y = 9. you can get a value from a function, but you cannot view this function as a value. random variable is NOT a variable, it is a function Page 72 in the book “Introduction to Probability, 2nd Edition” says: a random variable is a real-value function of the experimental outcome based on the above, if you view "tossing 1 coins 2 times" as "2 repetitions" of E_1, you are really tossing the coin in the real world, what you get is value, not a function. so, the sample space is {,} for E_1. if you are considering the set {(,),(,),(,),(,)} you are viewing "2 repetitions" as another Experiment that has a sample space equal to this set. in conclusion, your Part_1 is clear, your Part_2 is answerd by the paragraph above.
