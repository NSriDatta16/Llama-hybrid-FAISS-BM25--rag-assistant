Data files storage approach on web servers

My web application stores product information in XML files on disk, on the web server. This is perfectly fine when it comes to a few products, however I have my worries that large amounts of files may cause problems. So let's say I'm gonna have 20,000 products, that would mean having 20,000 XML files inside a directory. I'm not familiar with web server disk storage infrastructure, would so many files cause problems like significant drop in access speed and/or excessive disk fragmentation? Do storage servers even fragment, is fragmentation an issue that I need to worry about on servers? I would prefer to keep my xml files individual because I can access them directly as static content via http giving me much faster access speed and caching. The alternative would be creating a big binary data file and storing each product data xml inside that file in binary mode, then use a server side script to extract the xmls from that big data file. (Yes I know I can just save them in a database but that is not the case I'm interested in.)
