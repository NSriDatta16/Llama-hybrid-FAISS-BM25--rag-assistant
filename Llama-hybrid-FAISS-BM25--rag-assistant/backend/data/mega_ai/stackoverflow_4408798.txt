To quote this article on IEBlog : IE8 will send the “MSIE 7.0” version information when viewing sites with Compatibility View enabled. (...) A new “Trident” token in the User-Agent string allows your code to detect Internet Explorer 8 clients even when they are using the Compatibility View feature. To wit, your page is displayed in Compatibility mode, hence the UA change.
