Dimensionality Reduction Techniques Ordinal Variables on different scales

I have a data set that is a mix between Ordinal variables and numerical variables. The problem is that the ordinal variables are on different scales, such as 0-2, 1-4. The data set has 35 variables. I want to perform some type of data reduction on the data set but am unsure of what to do given the different scales. Techniques such as: Random Forest Principal Component Analysis However, I am not sure if it's possible due to the different scales? I am using pandas.
