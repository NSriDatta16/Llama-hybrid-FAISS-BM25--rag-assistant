I don't like the Views to become too complex, and so far I have tended to have separate views for Edit and Add. I use a user control to store the common elements to avoid repetition. Both of the views will be centered around the same ViewData, and I have a marker on my data to say whether the object is new or an existing object. This isn't any more elegant than what you have stipulated, so I wonder if any of the Django or Rails guys can provide any input. I love asp.net mvc but it is still maturing, and still needs more sugar adding to take away some of the friction of creating websites.
