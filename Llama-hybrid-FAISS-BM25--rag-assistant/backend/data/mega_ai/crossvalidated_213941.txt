If you are looking to stretch your wings a bit you might try picking up a book on bayesian analysis, maybe even written in a different language and work through some examples. What immediately comes to mind would be: R: Doing Bayesian Data Analysis Python: Probabilistic-Programming-and-Bayesian-Methods-for-Hackers If you are looking for relevant Bayesian questions in your work I suppose you need to provide more detail about what you do/are trying to do. This would be more of evaluating if a Bayesian Approach is relevant though.
