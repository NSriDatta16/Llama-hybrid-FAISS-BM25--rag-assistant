HashMap De-Serialization

I have a server/client app where I retrieve data from the server via Hessian/hessdroid. The data is very complex with HashMaps containing other HashMaps and images stored in byte arrays. I can display the data perfectly. To not always query the server, I´m using a data structure as a cache. This data object I save to SD card using ObjectOutputStream when closing the app. When I restart it, I read it back to memory with an ObjectInputStream. I´m having problems with the app only after reading the data from SD card. LogCat gives me the following output (100 times): DEBUG/dalvikvm(4150): GetFieldID: unable to find field Ljava/util/HashMap;.loadFactor:F and this in between the other messages: INFO/dalvikvm-heap(4150): Grow heap (frag case) to 10.775MB for 281173-byte allocation When the heap grows upon ~17 MB the app crashes. I read several threads about HashMap Serialization and that there seems to be a bug when serializing between architectures, but for me the data transfer via Hessian works perfectly and I´m having the described problems only when reading the HashMaps from disk. Any ideas?
