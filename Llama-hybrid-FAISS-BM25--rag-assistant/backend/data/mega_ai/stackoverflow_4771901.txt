A low end dedicated server, or a mid-range VPS will handle this no matter what language and platform you choose. 1000 simultaneous users requesting a chart every 10 seconds is an average of only 100 requests per second. I generate over 1000 dynamic images per second on a standard LAMP/PHP stack and it doesn't really generate much load at all.
