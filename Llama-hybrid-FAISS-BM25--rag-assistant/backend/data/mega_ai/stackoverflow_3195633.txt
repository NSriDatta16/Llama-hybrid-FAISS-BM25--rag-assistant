Trying to move a circle with Touch

I'm trying to move a circle inside a custom component, and it only moves when I click a button outside of the custom component. I touch and drag the circle, it does nothing, but as soon as I click on the button (that has nothing to do with the custom component) it gets updated (drawn) to the location where I stopped touching... Should I be calling some draw update thing on the custom component? I have Override the onTouchEvent and, among others, the onDraw. The onTouch checks for DOWN, MOVE (updates circle position) and UP just updates the beingDragged boolean. The onDraw draws a circle at the position captured on the MOVE event.. What am I missing?? Thanks!
