The question is ill-posed. If you are trying to optimise some function of specificity and sensitivity (other than accuracy) for a logistic regression model by altering the classification threshold, you are favouring one class over another (i.e. giving unequal misclassification costs to the two classes). The 0.5 threshold optimises accuracy (i.e. the expected misclassification cost for equal misclassification costs), not specificity + sensitivity or minimise abs(specificity - sensitivity). When you maximise specificity + sensitivity, you are doing so by emphasising one class over the other (giving them extra weight). To clarify, specificity + sensitivity is the balanced error rate, so if your dataset has more patterns of one class than another, you are downweighting that class when you look at the balanced error rate (which is the error rate if both classes are equally likely a-priori). So for more than two classes, you can just use cost-sensitive approaches to make the decision based on the probabilities estimated by the model, but you can't do so without "favour[ing] any class", for the same reason you can't do that for a logistic regression model. Let the risk of classifying pattern $x$ as belonging to class $i$ be $$R(C_i|x) = \sum_{c=1}^CL_{ij}P(C_j|x)$$ Where $L_{ij}$ is the penalty (loss) suffered when classifying a pattern as belonging to class $i$ when it actually belongs to class $j$ . Simply classify the pattern as belonging to the class that minimises the risk. That is the equivalent procedure for multiple classes.
