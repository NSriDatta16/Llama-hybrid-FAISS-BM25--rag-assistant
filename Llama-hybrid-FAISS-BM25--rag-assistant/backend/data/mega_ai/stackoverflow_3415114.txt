Setting bash aliases for IRB?

So every morning to boot up my server , I need to do the following tasks.. >> sunspot-solr stop >> sunspot-solr start >> script/console >> Organization.reindex >> Event.reindex >> Deal.reindex >> exit >> script/server Is there any way I can make a shortcut in my ~/.profile as an alias to perform all this for me without me typing it everyday? Like this though it doesn't work ? alias blam='cur && sunspot-solr stop && sunspot-solr start && script/console && Organization.reindex && Event.reindex && Deal.reindex && exit && script/server'
