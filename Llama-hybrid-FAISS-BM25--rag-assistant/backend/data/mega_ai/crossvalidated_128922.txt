The following book addresses model selection and averaging , including frequentist and Bayesian approaches, use of AIC and BIC (an alternative to R2 in your case?) and more: http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/statistics-probability/statistical-theory-and-methods/model-selection-and-model-averaging . I may be wrong, but I assume that your question, possibly indirectly, is related to ensemble methods ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ensemble_learning ) and associated topics and methods. I was curious about your question and did some brief research. I'm not sure whether Bayesian approach can be applied to your models, but I hope that the following resources will be helpful for you in regard to your question.
