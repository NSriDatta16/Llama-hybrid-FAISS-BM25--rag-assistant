An obscure corner of the CSS spec actually points out that display: block is an unnecessary companion to float: left . The reason for the pointless padding is... inline elements. Interesting fact: inline elements will take padding values, but that padding won't affect the layout of surrounding content. To get the desired results given the markup and styles above, I would suggest simply changing the display value of the li elements to inline-block and using a line-height value or position: relative etc. to control the vertical composition of the links while confining all of your box values to the list items. The older the browser, the buggier these styles will be; details on that could go on for several paragraphs. There are three support issues to remember when working with solutions like these: In IE6 display: inline-block is only applied to elements that have a runtime display value of inline . The HTML4 spec can help you tell the sheep from the goats on that one. Firefox 2.x doesn't support the inline-block value, but does have a -moz-inline-block CSS extension. Interstitial source whitespace is rendered between inline-block elements as it is between inline elements, which might bring undesirable results in the absence of careful source markup formatting.
