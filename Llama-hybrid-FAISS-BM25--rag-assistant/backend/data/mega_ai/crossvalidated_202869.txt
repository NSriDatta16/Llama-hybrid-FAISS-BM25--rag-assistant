This question can also be extended to the so-called super-culture of data science in 2015 David Donoho paper 50 years of Data Science , where he confronts different points of view from statistics and computer science (including machine learning), for instance direct standpoints (from different persons) such that: Why Do We Need Data Science When We've Had Statistics for Centuries? Data Science is statistics. Data Science without statistics is possible, even desirable. Statistics is the least important part of data science. and assorted with historical, philosophical considerations, for instance: It is striking how, when I review a presentation on today's data science, in which statistics is supercially given pretty short shrift, I can't avoid noticing that the underlying tools, examples, and ideas which are being taught as data science were all literally invented by someone trained in Ph.D. statistics, and in many cases the actual software being used was developed by someone with an MA or Ph.D. in statistics. The accumulated eorts of statisticians over centuries are just too overwhelming to be papered over completely, and can't be hidden in the teaching, research, and exercise of Data Science. This essay has generated many responses and contributions to the debate.
