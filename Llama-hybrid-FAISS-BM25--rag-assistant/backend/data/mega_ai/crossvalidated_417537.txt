My intercept is negative for a logit prob regression and I can't interpret

This is my first time building a model outside of school. I cleaned the data and ran Cohen's Kappa and cutoffs/ROC as well as did random forest. The accuracy of predicting the 1 outcome is about 37% which is not great. The data is unbalanced at 2% of the data being a 1 outcome. Since I am new I do not know any complex codes to handle imbalanced data so I am working with what I have learned in school. My biggest issue is that when trying to deploy this model because of the -15 intercept and very small coefficients for the ind variables it isn't even possible to get a probability at 50%. Predicting probability of getting a 1 outcome is the main point of this. Does anybody have any recommendations on what I may be doing wrong/can fix?
