LINQ Foreign Key Relationship Naming (Address, Address1, Address2)

is it possible to change the foreign key relationship object naming of LINQ to SQL generated objects? For example, I have a Demo table which has the fields ItemMinId, ItemMaxId, ItemExlId which are all foreign key references to my Item table. LINQ generates now Demo.Item, Demo.Item2, Demo.Item3 fields which makes it difficult in code to distinguish between the actual items. How can I change this naming, outside of the DBML as I'm usually refreshing the entire model by deleting everything and dragging the updated SQL tables onto the LINQ designer surface.
