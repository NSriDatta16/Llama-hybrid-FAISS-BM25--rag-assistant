PCA has nothing to do with the normality of your data. The principle is that you have a bunch of data points in a (high-dimensional) space and you want to see which directions or principal vectors can describe your data in an optimal way. It is virtually the same as the singular value decomposition and can be applied to any matrix (here the matrix of your data points).
