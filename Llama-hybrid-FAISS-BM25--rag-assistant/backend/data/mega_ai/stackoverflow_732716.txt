It'd be helpful to know a little more about what you're trying to do. Is this for a single type? Or set of relatively uniform types? Memory pools are a tried-and-true technique if you need to speed up allocs for a give type (one possible downside is you can be hopping all over memory, affecting cache performance) Application-wide allocation techniques usually include rounding all allocs up to profile-driven bucket sizes so that you keep fragmentation down. Multi-threaded apps usually have per-thread pools that can be alloc'd from without risking contention with other threads The doc's for tcmalloc are pretty good at describing the current state of the art for these techniques. There isn't too much complicated stuff here, but you're probably reinventing the wheel. There are a few open source libraries that do this.
