This can be done cleanly using the built-in Infragistics grid. Set the Grid.DisplayLayout.AutoFitStyle = AutoFitStyle.ResizeAllColumns. Set the Width, MinWidth and MaxWidth properties of the columns that you want to remain within a fixed boundary (in my case, the column with the button is set to 150 wide) All columns that have a fixed Min and Max width will float their width between the Min and Max you provide, and once they reach their Max they will stop growing, at which point all other columns that do not have a Max applied will keep growing and fill the remaining horizontal space.
