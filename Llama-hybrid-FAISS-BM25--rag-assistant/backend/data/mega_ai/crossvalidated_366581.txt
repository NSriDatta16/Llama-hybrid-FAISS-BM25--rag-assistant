What can Deep Neural Networks do that Support Vector Machines can't?

When I started studying machine learning in 2002, Neural Networks were on their way out and Support Vector Machines were becoming more and more popular. At the time my understating was that SVM could do anything that a NNet could, and they were based on a more solid theoretical grounding (Vapnikâ€“Chervonenkis theory). Now NNets have made a come back with Deep Neural Nets and nobody seems to use SVM anymore. So what can DNN do that SVM can't ? Is there any reason other than hype to choose DNN over SVM?
