Construct the likelihood with asymmetric uncertainties

I want to study the correlation between 2 parameters, this is done by fitting a straight line. I have uncertainties on both parameters. I want to solve my problem using the Bayesian approach, i.e. I construct my likelihood, assume some prior information on the slope and $y$-intercept, and then I will get my posterior distribution. Then I would sample from my posterior distribution using MCMC. The first step would be to construct my likelihood: Assume the data come from a line of equation $y = mx + b$. Then the likelihood would be: $$P(D|\theta, I) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi \sigma^2}} \exp(-\frac{(y - mx - b)^2}{2\sigma^2}) $$ However, in my case the uncertainties are asymmetric, how can I construct my likelihood? For example, my data look something like this: $x^{\sigma +}_{\sigma -}$ and $y^{\sigma +}_{\sigma -}$ One way to solve this out is to calculate the average of the lower and upper uncertainties, so that: $$ \sigma = \frac{\sigma^+ + \sigma^-}{2} $$ Now I have symmetric uncertainties, and then I will be able to construct my likelihood. Is there another method to solve this out?
