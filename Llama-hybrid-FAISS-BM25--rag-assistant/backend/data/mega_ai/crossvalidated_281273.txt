Is logstic regression with elasticnet penalty a convex optimization problem?

Logistic regression is a convex optimization problem and adding elastic net penalties is adding convex elements. So am I right if I conclude that logistic regression with elastic net penalties is also convex, and does this only hold in the special cases of the L1 and L2 penalties?
