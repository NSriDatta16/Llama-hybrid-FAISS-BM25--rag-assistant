Parallelizing Random Forest learning in R changes the class of the RF object

I am using the function randomForest::randomForest() in R to learn my RF. First, I learned them without parallelizing and I obtain a RF object which was basically a list (and I worked pretty well when I learned the partial plots etc) rf_full But then I realized it took too long. So I parallelized the script with the foreach package like this: #Try to parallelize cl Problem: now, the output is of class Large randomForest.formula (16 elements) and producing the partial plots seems soooooo long while it was quite quick before. Note that the metrics (RÂ², MSE...) are the same for the 2 methods. Thus, I really think it is a matter of class of the RF rather than the quality of it. Did someone experience this already? Do you know how to greatly decrease the producing time of the partial plots from a Large randomForest.formula ? Or how to have the former output out of the parallelized learning?
