Retrain Tensorflow CNN Model on additional Images

So I've created a model to classify images of traffic signs. I'm currently using this model to predict classes of images I've gotten from the internet. However, I would like to be able to re-classify or correctly label images in which the model failed to correctly predict their classes. One way would be to place the images in their correct classes and retrain the model from the last saved checkpoint. I don't think this is a good approach as the model should overfit over time. Hence, I'd like to know if there's a better way to achieve this.
