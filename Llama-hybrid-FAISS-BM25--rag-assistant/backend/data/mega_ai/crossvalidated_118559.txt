Is the random forest solution for regression interpretable and sparse?

I have a regression problem scenario. Basically, I want to model a certain biological problem with regression models and at the end my model should be interpretable. I need to have a sparse model. So I'm trying Lasso and Elastic Nets. But the performance of these methods in my data set is not good. I'm thinking about using a random forest for the regression. Would someone give me the name of the most useful R package for random forest for regression? Also, is the random forest solution for regression sparse and interpretable?
