Here's one in jQuery: $("#my_container img").mousedown(function () { return false; }); http://www.google.com/search?q=cross+browser+event+hooking will probably teach you everything you need to know about cross browser event hooking. I don't know how to hook events without a framework, because that's an edge case IMHO. In The Real World (tm), you'll always use a framework. The core here is that you have to stop the mousedown event from running. This will make drag and drop impossible, if you hook the event on text you won't be able to select that text, and so on.
