I would suggest omitting everything what is unnecessary for given slide from the diagram before export. The problem with slides is, that you cannot work with enough space, attention and also the time is often limited. The best way to get around this is to stay focused as much as it gets. Another way you might try could be splitting the diagram and showing a small rectangle of it at the time, however this can be confusing especially when your diagram is not layed out well. Third option which comes in mind is presenting using the tool with zoom - this can enable quick jumps, but will be distracting as you will navigate the diagram.
