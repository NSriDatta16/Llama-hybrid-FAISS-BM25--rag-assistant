Questions not related to programming are off-topic on Stack Overflow. General Magento questions may be asked on Magento.SE , a site dedicated to Magento questions Magento is an e-commerce platform written in php atop the zend-framework , available under both open-source and commercial licenses. It is written in an advanced object-oriented idiom that uses the mvc pattern and xml configuration files, aiming for flexibility and extensibility. It is owned and maintained by Adobe . Magento is aimed at merchants who need an online presence, but who find that a completely bespoke storefront does not suit their needs, budget, or scale. Magento's features include baked-in support of multiple languages and currencies, search engine optimization techniques, and automated email marketing. Basic Magento configuration and administration can be performed by end-users with minimal technical background, and the third-party ecosystem around Magento offers extensive customization of appearance and functionality for storefronts. Magento offers a developer certification program to help store owners find partners in the Magento ecosystem, and to help developers consolidate their grasp of Magento internals. A central feature of Magento is the templating and extension system, based on OOP inheritance and composition principles and largely configured by XML files, it provides a plugin API, it allows developers to modify almost any feature of Magento by working with the abstraction layers provided by the framework. Several subsystems (Layout and DataFlow) employ meta-programming facilities via XML, and the MVC pattern is supported by factory methods for instantiation of helper classes (Models, Helpers, and Blocks). Magento is a heavily abstracted software system. Most of Magento's code, and nearly all third-party code, is organized into modules, and the functionality of modules is programmatically exposed. Modules can be enabled or disabled individually, easing integration into existing stores. Magento's persistent storage is usually MySQL, and its data about a store's products are based on the Entity-Attribute-Value model .
