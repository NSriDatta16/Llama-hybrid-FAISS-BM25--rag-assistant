Thereâ€™s nothing special about your neural network. It is a function of some inputs. You know from (multivariable) calculus how to find the points giving maxima and minima of functions. The fact that your function is a deep neural network is basically irrelevant. Note that there is no guarantee that a maximum exists. It might be that, the bigger you make some feature, the better the predicted outcome. If you just want to know which observed combination of features gives the best predicted outcome, then run your observations through the predictive model and note which one gives the best prediction (much faster than training the network).
