Machine learning regressor for cyclic values

I have a question regarding training a Machine Learning regressor for cyclic values. For instance, consider phase values. We cannot use conventional regression methods for this as for example the difference between 1 degree and 359 degrees is not in fact 358 degrees! What tricks should one use to train the machine learning regressors for cyclic values? Should we consider sin or cos of the angle instead of the angle itself for instance? Any ideas/references are greatly appreciated.
