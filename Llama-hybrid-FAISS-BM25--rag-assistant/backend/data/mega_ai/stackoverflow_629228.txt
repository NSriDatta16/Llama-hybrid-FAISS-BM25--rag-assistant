Readers should be able to read 50% of the article for FREE after which a CAPTCHA should be entered to read the rest of the article Have your PHP programmer output 50% of the article. On the bottom, add a captcha. If the user types in the correct captcha, output 100% of the article. Any pointers on how to implment this ? The content is in HTML and programming experience in Perl, PHP. Can hire others if required. As a PHP programmer, I use http://www.phpcaptcha.org to implement captcha. Aditionally, search engine will crawl half of the article and wondering if it will penalize the site for not being able to crawl the rest of the article since it won't be able to crack the CAPTCHA ? No, it won't penalize you but that particular section will not be shown on the search results.
