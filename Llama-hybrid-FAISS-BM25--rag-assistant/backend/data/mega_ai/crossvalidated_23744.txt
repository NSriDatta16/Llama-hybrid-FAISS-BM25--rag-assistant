Parameter Search for SVM on the whole data

I am trying to implement SVM and i did my parameter selection(grid search) on the whole data and used the best values of C and gamma from that search to test on the testing data. Sometimes, the cross-validation accuracy, i get is 100%. Is this method wrong? What is the correct way of doing? How should i go about to do my parameter selection? Shld i divide the data(100%) into 10% for grid search and remaining 90% into training and testing? Need some guidance on it.. Thanks.
