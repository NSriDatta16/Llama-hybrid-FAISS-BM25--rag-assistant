You're looking for a pipeline of machine learning methods. As a first step you're looking forward to segment the image in 4 equal parts, each one isolating a letter: this is easily achievable trough the use of the sliding windows technique, with windows of arbitrarily large sizes if the sizes of the captchas vary. As a second step you should train a neuronal network to learn to recognize single letters. Here the hard part is data collection: you might need a large sample to properly train your model. A trick you can use to boost your training set value is to apply transformations to already collected samples, likely rotations and distortions for example. This process is widely used in text recognition.
