You could use the touchesBegan + touchesMoved + touchesEnded methods, to create a list of the buttons touched by the user, from start to finish. I wrote this on the fly and didn't test it, but it could look something like this: - (void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // interactions is the NSMutableArray where you store the pressed/dragged buttons // we need to clear it when we start a new checkForInteractions [interactions removeAllObjects]; UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; [self checkForInteractions:touch]; } - (void)touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; [self checkForInteractions:touch]; } - (void)touchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; [self checkForInteractions:touch]; // here you'd call a function that'd use the buttons on the array, // to do whatever you wanted with them // it can also be copied to touchesMoved, to trigger the interactions // as the user's finger is moving, rather than only when it stops [self useInteractions]; } - (void)touchesCancelled:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // if the touch was cancelled, clear the interactions [interactions removeAllObjects]; } - (void) checkForInteractions : (UITouch *) touch { if ([touch view] == myButton1 || [touch view] == myButton2) { // check if the object had already been added to the array if ( ![interactions containsObject:[touch view]] ) { [interactions addObject:[touch view]]; } } } I hope this helps :)
