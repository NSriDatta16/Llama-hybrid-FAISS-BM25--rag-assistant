A simple (and obvious) substitution solves this immediately. Simply by looking at the integral, the substitution $u=F(x)$ leaps out from the page and tugs at our locks. The result (the remainder of which is even simpler, and which I leave for you) follows. (Keep in mind this is a definite integral. Pay attention to the limits.) As JohnK explains in comments, this result will be valid for continuous distributions.
