Getting the first and last item in a python for loop

Is there an elegant and pythonic way to trap the first and last item in a for loop which is iterating over a generator? from calendar import Calendar cal = Calendar(6) month_dates = cal.itermonthdates(year, month) for date in month_dates: if (is first item): # this is fake month_start = date if (is last item): # so is this month_end = date This code is attempting to get the first day of the week the month ends on, and the last day of the week the month ends on. Example: for June, month-start should evaluate to 5/31/09. Even though it's technically a day in May, it's the first day of the week that June begins on. Month-dates is a generator so i can't do the [:-1] thing. What's a better way to handle this?
