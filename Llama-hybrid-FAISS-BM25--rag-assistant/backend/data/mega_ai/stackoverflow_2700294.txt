The problem is in this code : This applies templates to all children of the current user element -- not to the user element. As result, the template matching user is not selected.

Solution : Quite some cleanup is necessary, but the first obvious step is to replace the above code with: You'll also have to move the div from the deleted body of into the template matching folktask/member/user . The corrected XSLT code is: Registered Members Registered Members USER ID: NAME: ADDRESS: CITY: COUNTY: POSTCODE: TELEPHONE: MOBILE: EMAIL: mailto: SEX: USERNAME: ACCOUNT TYPE: Normal User Volunteer Organiser Administrator Running the corrected transformation now produces the intended results : Registered Members Registered Members USER ID: 1 NAME: Abbie Hunt ADDRESS: 108 Access Road CITY: Wells COUNTY: Somerset POSTCODE: BA5 8GH TELEPHONE: 01528927616 MOBILE: 07085252492 EMAIL: adrock@gmail.com SEX: Female USERNAME: AdRock ACCOUNT TYPE: Administrator USER ID: 2 NAME: Aidan Harris ADDRESS: 103 Aiken Street CITY: Chichester COUNTY: Sussex POSTCODE: PO19 4DS TELEPHONE: 01905149894 MOBILE: 07784467941 EMAIL: ambientexpert@yahoo.co.uk SEX: Male USERNAME: AmbientExpert ACCOUNT TYPE: Volunteer
