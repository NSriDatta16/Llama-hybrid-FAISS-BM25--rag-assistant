I have tried markovify, a markov chain library in python for automatic text summarization for text documents. You can check that out for a simple unsupervised approach. For me it did not give satisfactory results as I was using abstracts from medical journals as my dataset, but if you try to use it on a different themed dataset, it may help you.
