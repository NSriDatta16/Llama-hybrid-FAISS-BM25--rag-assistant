Multiple languages can interact with: Piped input/output (ANY language can do this because input and output must by necessity be implemented in every non-toy language) Having code in one language compile to a native library while the other supports calling native code. Communicating over a loopback network connection. You can run into difficulties with firewall interference this way. Databases. These can be thought of as a "universal" data storage format, and hence can be accessed by most languages with database extensions. This generally requires one program to finish operation before the next program can access the database. In addition, all 'communications' are generally written to disk. If the languages involved run on the same runtime (i.e. .NET, JVM), then you generally can pass object data from one language directly to the other with little impedence. In almost every case, you have to convert any communication to a common format before it can be exchanged (the exception is languages on the same runtime). This is why multiple languages are rarely used in one project.
