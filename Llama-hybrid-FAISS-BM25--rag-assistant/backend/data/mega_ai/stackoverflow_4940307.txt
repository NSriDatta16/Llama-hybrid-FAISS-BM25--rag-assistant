How to 'force' Magento to load a different layout

Background: I need to be able to load upsell / crosssell products in a lightbox complete with add-to-cart functionality. My idea for achieving this was to 'force' Magento to load products in a different layout. I thought of using an observer on the controller_action_layout_generate_xml_before event (code below). Unfortunately what I have is not working. Any pointers (or completely different / better ideas) are much appreciated. getEvent()->getAction(); $layout = $observer->getEvent()->getLayout(); if($action->getRequest()->getControllerName() == 'product' && $action->getRequest()->getActionName() == 'view') { $update = $layout->getUpdate(); $update->load('popup'); // for testing only $layout->generateXml(); } } }
