LSTM Multivariate time series forecasting with multiple inputs for each time step

I want to predict an output variable for the next day, for each of the users in my dataset. I was thinking of using LSTMs for achieving this. The dataset The dataset I am using has multiple inputs for each time step and it is dependent on the value from one of the inputs. Each user_id has multiple features for each day and gives an output in the range of [1, 10]. Not all users have data for each day. ----------------------------------------------------------------- | day | user_id | feature_1 | feature_n | output | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | 2020-02-11 | 1 | 20 | 9 | 8 | | 2020-02-11 | 2 | 15 | 8 | 4 | | 2020-02-12 | 1 | 10 | 2 | 6 | | 2020-02-13 | 2 | 16 | 9 | 5 | | 2020-02-13 | 3 | 19 | 1 | 7 | | 2020-02-13 | 1 | 14 | 4 | 9 | I want to forecast the output for each of the users for the next day. I was thinking to split the dataset in multiple datasets for each of the users and use only the data for the user to predict the output, the problem is that my dataset isn't big. Is there any way to use the whole dataset and after training the model to get as output the output value for each of the users for the next day?
