Sending a message to an application started by a different windows' user session

A desktop app (made in Delphi) is started by User A. Let's call it "Instance A". User A does a "switch user" and User B logs in. User B runs the same application. Let's call it "Instance B" What I want now, is a way for the Instance B to send messages to Instance A. I tried the following: Instance A writes its handle in a file, so Instance B can open that file, read the handle, and use it to post a message to Instance A, but it doesn't work -- perhaps for security reasons Windows doesn't give one user access to handles of running processes of another user... A "bad" way to do this would be to have Instance A check a particular file or registry location every few seconds, so Instance B can write something there and Instance A will get it... but this is obviously a burdensome and unelegant solution. Instead what I need is a way for Instance B of user B to send a harmless message to Instance A of user A, after which Instance A wakes up and decides what to to about it. Thanks for any suggestions!
