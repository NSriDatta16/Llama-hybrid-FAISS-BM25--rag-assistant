class HotPoint:Thumb, IDraggable { ... } IDraggable hotpoint = VisualTreeHelper.GetParent(result.VisualHit) as IDraggable; Where IDraggable is an Interface I inherit from with the thumb. I remembered that every hotpoint has a custom control template so when I do hit tests the search will be on the primitive types, so when I get the parent of that object it will solve my request.
