I thought Petzold explains in this paragraph; The ScatterPlotVisual class works by creating a DrawingVisual object for each DataPoint. When the properties of a DataPoint object change, the class only needs to alter the DrawingVisual associated with that DataPoint. Which builds on an earlier explanation; Whenever the ItemsSource property changes, or the collection changes, or a property of the DataPoint objects in the collection changes, ScatterPlotRender calls InvalidateVisual. This generates a call to OnRender, which draws the entire scatter plot . Is this what your asking about? By the way, this is a fairly recent high-performance WPF tutorial, many tens of thousands of points in that plot, it is 3D rendered and animated also (even uses mouse input to drive some of the transforms).
