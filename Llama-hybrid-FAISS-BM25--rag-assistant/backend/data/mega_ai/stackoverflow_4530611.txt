Saving and loading objects and using pickle

I´m trying to save and load objects using pickle module. First I declare my objects: >>> class Fruits:pass ... >>> banana = Fruits() >>> banana.color = 'yellow' >>> banana.value = 30 After that I open a file called 'Fruits.obj'(previously I created a new .txt file and I renamed 'Fruits.obj'): >>> import pickle >>> filehandler = open(b"Fruits.obj","wb") >>> pickle.dump(banana,filehandler) After do this I close my session and I began a new one and I put the next (trying to access to the object that it supposed to be saved): file = open("Fruits.obj",'r') object_file = pickle.load(file) But I have this message: Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in File "C:\Python31\lib\pickle.py", line 1365, in load encoding=encoding, errors=errors).load() ValueError: read() from the underlying stream did notreturn bytes I don´t know what to do because I don´t understand this message. Does anyone know How I can load my object 'banana'? Thank you! EDIT: As some of you have sugested I put: >>> import pickle >>> file = open("Fruits.obj",'rb') There were no problem, but the next I put was: >>> object_file = pickle.load(file) And I have error: Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in File "C:\Python31\lib\pickle.py", line 1365, in load encoding=encoding, errors=errors).load() EOFError
