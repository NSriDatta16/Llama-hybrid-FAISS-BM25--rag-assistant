I do it straight on php. Pseudo code: if (session is logged in) display menu_item_1 ... menu_item_n display menu_logged_in_item_1 .... M else display menu_item_1 ... menu_item_n I don't think you need anything special with css, html, or ajax. I strongly suggest you do it from your scripting language especially if you have different user privileges (user, admin, editor ...), as you can set them up quiet elegantly in relationship to your database
