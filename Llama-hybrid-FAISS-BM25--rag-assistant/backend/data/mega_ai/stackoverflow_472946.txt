Tomcat & Eclipse integration

I'm developing on a Ubuntu 8.04 machine using Eclipse Ganymede. I installed Tomcat 5.5 using sudo apt-get install tomcat5.5 tomcat5.5-admin and using an Ant script I deploy my WAR file by copying it to $CATALINA_HOME/webapps . I then created an Eclipse project and I have it output compiled source in a similar but separate directory structure under $PROJECT_ROOT/target/ . I still deploy the WAR file by right clicking on the build.xml and choosing my deploy-war task. As Tomcat is running as a deamon, automatically started up on booting, I'm not instructing it when to start or exit. My problems with this setup are: Using this approach I do not get any output to the Eclipse console, as Tomcat is running under the tomcat55 user and I have a different login and no access to Stdout of tomcat55 . The logging which occurs is also directed to Stdout at the moment, which I find pretty nice during development. But it's not nice when I can't see it. :-) I don't have any servers under the Server tab and no Run configurations . This makes it impossible for me to use the Debug mode of Eclipse, which otherwise is quite convenient. What do you think I should do to integrate them and in turn make my development environment much better?
