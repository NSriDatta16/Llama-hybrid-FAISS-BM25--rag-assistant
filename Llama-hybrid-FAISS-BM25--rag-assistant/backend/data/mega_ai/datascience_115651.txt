If the feature is important such as return, you need missing value treatment. You have two options: Remove records with missing value Or build a unsupervised model to predict return. If you do not want to treat missing value, then fine tune parameters of random forest . Max features should be 1 . This will ensure return is included. An alternate better solution is to provide sample weight should be such that more weight to non null return records.
