Your linear recurrence relation for $\epsilon_t$ is unstable. If you know $\epsilon_1$ with some absolute error $\delta$, then the subsequent values for $\epsilon_t$ will have absolute error on the order of $\theta^t \delta$. Note that the error doesn't have to come from the estimation error for the parameters, it could also be the roundoff error coming from finite-precision floating-point arithmetic on your computer (then $\delta=O(10^{-16})$ in double precision). Note that $5^{30}\approx 10^{21}$. Thus this is what you would expect when $|\theta|>1$. This is a mathematical property of the linear recurrence relation you've written down and the value of $\theta$ that you chose. Moving average processes with $|\theta|>1$ are called non-invertible.
