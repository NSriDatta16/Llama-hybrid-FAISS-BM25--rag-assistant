How to know when user made change to settings bundle

I let the user make changes to their settings in the settings area of the iphone. During the next network sync i'd like to send the user changes to the server. But only if the changes are made. But how do I know when the user has made a change within the settings area? If I can, I'd like to avoid an option of always sending the information regardless if changed or not or getting the info from the server first and updating if different from the user defaults. Is there a nice and elegant way of resolving this problem? Thank you for your help! A week later and no answers... Is this question too hard or it doesn't make any sense at all?
