Conditional entropy and Spearman's correlation based lag in time series

I have two time series A, B. Both are seasonal and B primarily is A driven( other temporal causes may exist). B-Red, A- Green I want to calculate lag of red series with respect to green as clearly, it exists. Now, I am taking Spearman's correlation at different lags and choosing the max to decide the lag which gives satisfying answer. To confirm the confidence in lag, I am trying entropy based methods. I tried conditional entropy and here are the results. lag C-Entropy corr 0 1.0820745 -0.735406343 1 0.8978593 -0.830377446 2 1.1218689 -0.689623230 3 1.2412857 -0.336204576 4 1.2985196 0.054672496 5 1.2727747 0.485228731 6 1.1027205 0.771465042 7 0.9616463 0.839862100 8 1.1296509 0.677166842 9 1.2805970 0.396034333 10 1.3420290 0.005832166 I am confused over this. 1 0.8978593 -0.830377446 Correlation is highly negative while entropy is down? R code for entropy calculation: B_d= discretize(B) A_d= discretize( A) H Also, Any suggestions for entropy based methods or options which can be helpful for this situation. I have to find lags over several such pairs and need another metric to evaluate lag calculated from correlation.
