According to the Javadocs : Statement.close() Releases this Statement object's database and JDBC resources immediately instead of waiting for this to happen when it is automatically closed. It is generally good practice to release resources as soon as you are finished with them to avoid tying up database resources. Which means you should close it after you done and not planning to use it again. I would, actually pay more attention to closing your Connection. In your method which you say you call repeatedly you are calling Statement.close() which means that you can only use it once since after the first call you Statement is closed and cannot be used anymore. It would be nice to see some of your code if you want a better answer
