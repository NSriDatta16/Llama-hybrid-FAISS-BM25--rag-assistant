Why do you loose your time with Fujaba ? You have Topcased, Boul and Papyrus which are open source and can create diagrams from java code. The best reverse engineering tool if you have a budget is Omondo EclipseUML. This tool is for advanced and heavy java project developped by a team working together. If a single developer then open source is sufficient.
