Java Webstart intermittant JAR not updating

We use java Webstart to deploy a java application on our intranet. The application receives frequent updates. Once in awhile a user will launch the application from their desktop icon after we have updated the JARs / WAR on the webserver (timestamp changed) and Java Webstart will launch the old version instead of downloading a new one. Here is a paste of our JNLP, as you can see offline-allowed is on, but update check always and policy always. Also, download flag is eager. From my understanding these options should always result in a check of cache against timestamp on server and a download of the JAR file. I'm starting to get frustrated with Webstart! Has anyone seen similiar problems? Any solutions? I'm getting sick of walking people through clearing their webstart cache manually every third or fifth update.
