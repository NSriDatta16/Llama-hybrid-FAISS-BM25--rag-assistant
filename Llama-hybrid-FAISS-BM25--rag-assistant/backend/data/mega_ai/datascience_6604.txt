What does the Ip mean in the Bayesian Ridge Regression formula?

From http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/linear_model.html#bayesian-ridge-regression , they gave the bayesian ridge distribution as this: $p(w|\lambda) = \mathcal{N}(w|0,\lambda^{-1}{I_{p}})$ And there is a variable $I_p$ but it's unexplained what does the $I_p$ refer to? Also, the variable $\mathcal{N}$ is unexplained but I'm not sure whether I've guessed correctly but is that the Gaussian prior as described in the Bayesian regression section above the Bayesian Ridge?
