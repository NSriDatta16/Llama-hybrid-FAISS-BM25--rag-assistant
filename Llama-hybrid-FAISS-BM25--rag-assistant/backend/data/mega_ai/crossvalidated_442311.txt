This problem is usually called Novelty Detection, or Out of Distribution detection. Many of the techniques for Anomaly Detection can also be applied. Autoencoders are a very popular family of methods that work well for these kind of problems. Autoencoders consists of an Encoder followers by a Decoder, usually each some sort of neural network. The network can be feed-forward, convolutional or recurrent, depending on what suits the task best. The layers of the Encoder gradually compresses, and then the Decoder expands it back to the input dimensions again. This learns an efficient data-dependent compression, which reconstructs samples those to the training set well, and samples that are different more poorly. For Novelty/Anomaly Detection one calculates the reconstruction error for new samples. If this above a certain threshold, then the sample is considered novel/anomalous. This threshold can be set by observing the histogram on the training data.
