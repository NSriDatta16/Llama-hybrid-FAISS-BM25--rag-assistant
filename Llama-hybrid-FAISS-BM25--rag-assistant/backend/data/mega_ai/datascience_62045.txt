Answering the title of your question: autocorrelation means correlation of the response variable with lagged values of itself, whereas multicollinearity means correlation of the response variable with several other explanatory variables (i.e. to implement a multivariate regression, which afterall is the core of a time series forecast with several attributes). From what I see in your auto-correlation and partial auto-correlation plots, I would suggest you to try out (at least as a baseline model) a simple ARIMA grid search (to find out p,d,q values) with only the response variable, and from this, try out some other models. To try this approach, here you have a nice source: https://machinelearningmastery.com/grid-search-arima-hyperparameters-with-python/
