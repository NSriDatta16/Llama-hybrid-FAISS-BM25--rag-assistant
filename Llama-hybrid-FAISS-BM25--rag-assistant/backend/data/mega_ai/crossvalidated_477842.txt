You should not remove items of them is correlated highly with another unless you have good reason to believe that they are measuring exactly the same thing and the only difference in the scores for those items is measurement error. If they are measuring the same thing different ways, then by removing one (or using an average is another common mistake) then you are losing information. Be guided by the underlying theory of what is driving the data generating process along with expert knowledge.
