What is an XML processing instruction, and why is there so little information about them?

I couldn't google a good explanation about them. W3 only has a little paragraph about them . Can anybody explain them in a clear form please? What are they used for? What does the "Processing instructions (PIs) allow documents to contain instructions for applications" definition from W3 mean? Are they still useful or long forgotten and substituted by something else?
