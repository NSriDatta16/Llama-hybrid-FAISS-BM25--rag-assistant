The basic question here is how to translate this substantive question into a regression model. The model is satisfaction as a function of a bunch of input variables, which sound like they are measured as indicator variables (0 or 1). Assuming you have the data, you simply need to make some decisions about functional form and model specification and this becomes very straightforward in R. Are you willing to treat the outcome as continuous? Consider least squares regression. Do you want to model placement into the outcome as a set of ordered or discrete categories? Then consider ordered logit/probit or multinomial logit/probit. Do you want to make some other assumptions? You can start with Wikipedia on this: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Discrete_choice#Prominent_Types_of_Discrete_Choice_Models But you might find some other texts helpful, like: Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models by Gelman and Hill, for a general introduction to regression modelling Regression Models for Categorical or Limited Dependent Variables by J. Scott Long, for a focus on limited dependent variable models Discrete Choice Methods with Simulation by Kenneth Train, for a focus on a lot of the assumptions of those models In terms of executing this in R, you should be able to easily accomplish this (in a classical rather than Bayesian framework) using built-in functions lm and/or glm . If you decide to go with a slightly more advanced model or the Bayesian route, you'll find two CRAN Task Views helpful for summarizing available functions and packages: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/SocialSciences.html http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html
