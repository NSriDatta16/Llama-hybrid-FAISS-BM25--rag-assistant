You shouldn't view creating an implementation of a particular language as insignificant. Everyone probably wants to be a famous programmer and not many people achieve it. This is a great opportunity to be familiar with very cool uncommon languages. (Lisp, APL, etc) If this is your first time creating a compiler/interpreter then it will also be a better choice to go with an already existent language (so you can see what design elements are needed to create a successful language.) Significant ideas typically arise from necessity. People began using a language because they either needed it or it was a lot easier to accomplish the task they wanted to do. I don't think you will find the answer or the motivation to start a project from scratch here. That being said, I've always thought it would be cool to have a language that uses processor native byte code to create dynamic websites (without using something like cgi).
