Estimate class proportions of a feature, central limit theorem

haven't been feeling smart lately and this is probably the most trivial question ever but I really need to know. I'm trying to point estimate some population parameters. I sampled from 1000 randomly generated bootstrapped samples of 130000 observations and saved the frequency & percentile of each class of a categorical feature. If I were take an average of the percentile or frequency, would that be a good way to estimate a proportion for the classes of a feature? I know this issue seems easy.... but please help me.
