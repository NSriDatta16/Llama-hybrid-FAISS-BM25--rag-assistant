How can I read malformed XML (unencoded entities) with Perl?

I'm trying to parse an XML file I get from an external source but am having problems because there are unencoded XML entities in the text nodes. Essentially, I'm asking the same question as this , but for Perl instead of PHP. A & W Some Other Company with a I tried using something like this: my $readAllRecordsURI = "http://mycompany.com/CompanyOnline/GetRecord"; my @form_array = ("action" => "readAll", "table" => "QOPIDINF"); my $ua = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $cics_request = (POST $readAllRecordsURI, \@form_array); my $cics_response = $ua->request($cics_request); my $xmlfile = $cics_response->content; my $parser = XML::Parser->new( Handlers => {Char => \&handle_char}); $parser->parsefile( $xmlfile ); sub handle_char { my ($p, $string) = @_; #clean up text here... }
