The one exception where performance of an IoC container is unacceptable in my experience is when trying to integrate/wrap the IoC container as an IServiceProvider for use in the ComponentModel - a once common example of this was when creating your own hosted winforms designer (normally to build some kind of custom designer, i.e. workflow/flowchart etc.) Due to the way a number of winforms components behave, especially at design time, the cost of resolving a component will physically cause the mouse to "stutter" when dragging because the framework can make upwards of 30,000 service resolution calls a second - this is more a reflection on poor coding practices in the components themselves though I think, or at least due to assumptions being made about the service providers implementation being fast/simple. In practice I've never found component resolution times to be a problem in even heavily loaded commercial applications.
