Use WHERE to filter away the values you don't want to include in your average, for example to include all numbers in the average except for -1: SELECT (SELECT AVG(x) FROM table1 WHERE x >= 0) AS x, (SELECT AVG(y) FROM table1 WHERE y >= 0) AS y, (SELECT AVG(z) FROM table1 WHERE z >= 0) AS z Note that if you really want to include all numbers except -1 as you said in your question then you should change the WHERE clause to x <> -1 but I doubt that this is what you want.
