Factorization of conditional probability

I read a paper where the authors factorized a conditional probability as follows: $P(a|b, c)\propto P(a|b)P(a|c)$. They say that they can do that because $b$ and $c$ are causally independent (they are using graphical models), and cite the paper [1] to justify this. Under which assumptions can this be true? Honestly, I don't see how this statement is true. Thanks for your comments. [1]: Zhang, N. L., & Poole, D. (1996). Exploiting causal independence in Bayesian network inference.
