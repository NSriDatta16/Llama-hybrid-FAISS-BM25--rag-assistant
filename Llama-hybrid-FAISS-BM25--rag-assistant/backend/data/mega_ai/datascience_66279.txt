How to balance class weights correct for a CNN in Keras, given an unbalanced data set?

I want to use class weights for training a CNN with a imbalanced data set. The question arise if the sum of the weights of all examples have to stays the same? My previous plan was to use the function compute_class_weight('balanced , np.unique(y_train),y_train) function from scikit-learn. But I'm totally unsure if this is even suitable for the class weights of a CNN? Thank you in advance for each tip
