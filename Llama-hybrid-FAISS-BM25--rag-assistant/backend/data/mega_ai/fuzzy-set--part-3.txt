in(\mu _{A}(x),\mu _{A}(y))} . This definition can be extended to one for a general topological space U: we say the fuzzy set A {\displaystyle A} is convex when, for any subset Z of U, the condition ∀ z ∈ Z : μ A ( z ) ≥ inf ( μ A ( ∂ Z ) ) {\displaystyle \forall z\in Z:\mu _{A}(z)\geq \inf(\mu _{A}(\partial Z))} holds, where ∂ Z {\displaystyle \partial Z} denotes the boundary of Z and f ( X ) = { f ( x ) ∣ x ∈ X } {\displaystyle f(X)=\{f(x)\mid x\in X\}} denotes the image of a set X (here ∂ Z {\displaystyle \partial Z} ) under a function f (here μ A {\displaystyle \mu _{A}} ). Fuzzy set operations Although the complement of a fuzzy set has a single most common definition, the other main operations, union and intersection, do have some ambiguity. For a given fuzzy set A {\displaystyle A} , its complement ¬ A {\displaystyle \neg {A}} (sometimes denoted as A c {\displaystyle A^{c}} or c A {\displaystyle cA} ) is defined by the following membership function: ∀ x ∈ U : μ ¬ A ( x ) = 1 − μ A ( x ) {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{\neg {A}}(x)=1-\mu _{A}(x)} . Let t be a t-norm, and s the corresponding s-norm (aka t-conorm). Given a pair of fuzzy sets A , B {\displaystyle A,B} , their intersection A ∩ B {\displaystyle A\cap {B}} is defined by: ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ∩ B ( x ) = t ( μ A ( x ) , μ B ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A\cap {B}}(x)=t(\mu _{A}(x),\mu _{B}(x))} , and their union A ∪ B {\displaystyle A\cup {B}} is defined by: ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ∪ B ( x ) = s ( μ A ( x ) , μ B ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A\cup {B}}(x)=s(\mu _{A}(x),\mu _{B}(x))} . By the definition of the t-norm, we see that the union and intersection are commutative, monotonic, associative, and have both a null and an identity element. For the intersection, these are ∅ and U, respectively, while for the union, these are reversed. However, the union of a fuzzy set and its complement may not result in the full universe U, and the intersection of them may not give the empty set ∅. Since the intersection and union are associative, it is natural to define the intersection and union of a finite family of fuzzy sets recursively. It is noteworthy that the generally accepted standard operators for the union and intersection of fuzzy sets are the max and min operators: ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ∪ B ( x ) = max ( μ A ( x ) , μ B ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A\cup {B}}(x)=\max(\mu _{A}(x),\mu _{B}(x))} and μ A ∩ B ( x ) = min ( μ A ( x ) , μ B ( x ) ) {\displaystyle \mu _{A\cap {B}}(x)=\min(\mu _{A}(x),\mu _{B}(x))} . If the standard negator n ( α ) = 1 − α , α ∈ [ 0 , 1 ] {\displaystyle n(\alpha )=1-\alpha ,\alpha \in [0,1]} is replaced by another strong negator, the fuzzy set difference (defined below) may be generalized by ∀ x ∈ U : μ ¬ A ( x ) = n ( μ A ( x ) ) . {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{\neg {A}}(x)=n(\mu _{A}(x)).} The triple of fuzzy intersection, union and complement form a De Morgan Triplet. That is, De Morgan's laws extend to this triple. Examples for fuzzy intersection/union pairs with standard negator can be derived from samples provided in the article about t-norms. The fuzzy intersection is not idempotent in general, because the standard t-norm min is the only one which has this property. Indeed, if the arithmetic multiplication is used as the t-norm, the resulting fuzzy intersection operation is not idempotent. That is, iteratively taking the intersection of a fuzzy set with itself is not trivial. It instead defines the m-th power of a fuzzy set, which can be canonically generalized for non-integer exponents in the following way: For any fuzzy set A {\displaystyle A} and ν ∈ R + {\displaystyle \nu \in \mathbb {R} ^{+}} the ν-th power of A {\displaystyle A} is defined by the membership function: ∀ x ∈ U : μ A ν ( x ) = μ A ( x ) ν . {\displaystyle \forall x\in U:\mu _{A^{\nu }}(x)=\mu _{A}(x)^{\nu }.} The case of exponent two is special enough to be given a name. For any fuzzy set A {\displaystyle A} the concentration C O N (
