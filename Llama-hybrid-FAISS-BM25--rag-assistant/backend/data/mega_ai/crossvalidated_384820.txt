PCA: should standardization be applied on features or samples?

I am struggling a little bit with PCA. I understand that standardization is an important part of the algorithm but I do not understand which elements should be standardized. Let's say I have a 10x100 matrix X where the 10 rows are the samples and the 100 columns are the features. Each sample is a RGB image considered as an array (my real dataset has 1087 samples, each one with 154587 features). Should I standardize each feature or each sample? What if I do not take into account the rows and the columns and I simply do this: X_std = (X - X.mean()) / X.var() I can't figure out the reason why I should standardize with respect to the feature, to the sample or to the entire dataset. What I know is that the standard scaler from sklearn by default runs standardization feature-wise making each feature zero mean and unit variance. Thank you for your help
