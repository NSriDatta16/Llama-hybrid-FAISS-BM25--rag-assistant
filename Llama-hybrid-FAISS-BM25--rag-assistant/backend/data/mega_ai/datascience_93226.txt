Should I make single machine learning model for predicting price of house or 6 different models, given 6 datasets for different cities?

I am currently working on "Housing Prices in Metropolitan Areas of India" (kaggle dataset), with 6 different csv files for 6 different cities. All have same columns (40). Working on a real estate website project, I am confused, should I make separate model for each csv or merge all csv to form one model (after data cleaning) to predict house prices.
