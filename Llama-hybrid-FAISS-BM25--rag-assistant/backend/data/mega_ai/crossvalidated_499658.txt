Seems to be a lot of cherry-picking in this analysis. Massachusetts has 14 counties ( Wikipedia ), of which he has picked just one, Suffolk County, for his analysis. He concludes that the election there, and in 10 other counties which used "predominantly electronic voting systems", was weighted against him. He justifies choosing Suffolk County by saying "Given Boston, the largest city with the largest voter turnout, is in Suffolk County, we began by analyzing Suffolk County." Wikipedia says there are two other counties with higher population (though it's possible they had lower total turnout). As far as I can tell, he never applies the same analysis to any other county. He says that in Franklin County, which uses paper ballots, the reported data "closely track" with his "de-weighted" results from the 11 electronic voting counties. He doesn't analyze whether the results from the remaining counties (which presumably also don't use electronic voting), Dukes County and Nantucket County, also closely track with his de-weighted results. The "high-low pair" concept looks like his own invention. I couldn't find a definition. Your definition seems plausible but it doesn't match up with what he says about the histogram associated with O'Connor, his opponent: In Kevin O’Connor’s histogram and corresponding table chart, the incidence of “High-Low” pairs is much less pronounced According to your definition, O'Connor's histogram actually has more high-low pairs in the first 22 buckets: I count 11 buckets whose bar is higher than the previous bucket. Hard to say more here without being sure of the definition. He claims that his votes were reweighted by multiplying by 0.666 and rounding. Since this maps multiples of 3 to even numbers and everything else to odd numbers, he says it explains why among the first 22 buckets, the even buckets are smaller than the odd buckets. But it doesn't explain why the difference between even and odd vanishes for buckets above 22 (which make up more than half the x axis). Overall, it's a very unconvincing argument.
