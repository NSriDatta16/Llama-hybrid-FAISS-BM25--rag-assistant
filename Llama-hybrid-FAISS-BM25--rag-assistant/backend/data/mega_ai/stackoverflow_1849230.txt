Does Visual Studio 2008 have something like Delphi's structure view?

I use Delphi 2007 in my daily work and have now start to look at VS2008 and C#. One confusing thing compared to Delphi is the design editor in VS. Here is the Form Designer in Delphi Layout hierarchy in Delphi http://pp.kpnet.fi/bengtsson/temp/delphi.png As you see on the left I have a hierarchy of components. Some of them like TPanel and TGroupbox can contain other components. It is very easy to change a parent just by dragging and dropping in the tree view. Compare this with VS that has a flat structure. How can I reorganize the layout of components in VS? Is it something I have missed? Regards
