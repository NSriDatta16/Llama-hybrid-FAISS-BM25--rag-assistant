Multi-select from mouse-only: functional in FF and IE, nothing happens in Chrome

I have a question, regarding how the select text box is supposed to perform multiselect. Basically, for the below HTML, I'd like to know why Chrome won't allow me to select using only the mouse . There are no problems, using click + Ctrl/Shift, but when I try to select by left-click + dragging the mouse over items in the list, nothing happens. Both FF and IE support this kind of selection. What I would like to know, is if I could get around the problem without using ridiculous amounts of JavaScript to reinvent selection; secondly, why does this happen. A sample select: Teacher Assistants Teachers and Instructors, All Other Team Assemblers Technical Directors/Managers Technical Writers Telecommunications Equipment Installers and Repairers, Except Line Installers Telecommunications Line Installers and Repairers Telecommunications Specialists Telemarketers Telephone Operators Tellers Terrazzo Workers and Finishers Textile Bleaching and Dyeing Machine Operators and Tenders Textile Cutting Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders Textile Knitting and Weaving Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders Textile Winding, Twisting, and Drawing Out Machine Setters, Operators, and Tenders Textile, Apparel, and Furnishings Workers, All Other
