Unmanaged native C code to .NET compatible

The entire code for the dll has written using native C and one function is below for your reference. DllImport int32 FAR PASCAL swe_calc( double tjd, int ipl, int32 iflag, double *xx, char *serr); Most of the functions are written using FAR PASCAL and when I tried to convert this dll to compatible with .net I was endup with errors. I tried by changing the Comman Runtime Support property from "No Common Runtime Support" to Common Runtime Support (ie \clr). and Changed the \MD also. when I tried registering the dll using Regsvr32 from command prompt I got the error stating that "The Module "mydll.dll" was loaded by the entry point DllRegisterServer was not found". I like to use this dll from my C# application, It will be really great if any one help me out with this. Thanks in Advance. Gan
