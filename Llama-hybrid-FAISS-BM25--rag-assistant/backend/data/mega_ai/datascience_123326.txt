Here are a few hints: Your task might not be well-defined: to "separate" data point can be understood as to find the (four) different clusters that they belong to -- a problem of unsupervised machine learning. E.g., the algorithm is supposed to find the centers of regions that have a high density of data points. Taking a brief look at your data extract, I do not see such "clustering". Therefore, ... ... your task probably should be to find a reasonable criterion based on which you split the dataset, e.g., an unbiased approach is (as you probably did), to split it into quartiles according to the percentile rank. How about the "ambiguity" at the borders between two tiers? Well, this is something that you cannot avoid. But typically, your dataset should be large enough such that this one data point more or less should not be an issue. At the end of the day, there is no other way as your "splitting strategy" is arbitrary. If it is important that one point belongs to this tier and not to the other, then you just found your splitting criterion! I hope that helps getting you on the right track.
