As an extension of this question, specifically for .NET web apps, you also need to pay attention to SessionState handling. Assuming that sessions aren't "sticky" (user stays on one web server once session is established), you'll need to change SessionState to out-of-process. This can either be the ASP.NET session state server, or SQL Server, but the key point to remember is that SessionState isn't automatically shared across servers, unless you make it shared by going out-of-process. Also, anything you put in SessionState needs to be serializable; add the [Serializable] attribute to any classes you use in SessionState.
