Classification / prediction of multiple time series

I have a multiple-time series problem. I have a dataframe with regions in columns and dates in rows (which represents the week of the year). Each value is the number of events that occurred in that week for that region. I would like to classify if yes/no in the following (next) week, an event will occur in a given region (the probability, as in the case of a supervised classification) For the regions where it is yes, that there will be an enumeration the following (next) week, predict the number of events that will be used. df = pd.DataFrame([ ['2000-01', 0, 0, 1, 3], ['2000-03', 0, 1, 0, 5], ['2000-09', 0, 2, 0, 0], ['2000-14', 0, 0, 0, 1], ['2000-15', 1, 1, 0, 2], ['2000-18', 0, 2, 0, 3], ['2000-20', 3, 1, 2, 0], ['2000-21', 0, 1,10, 5], ['2000-22', 0, 3, 3, 4], ['2000-23', 15, 0, 0, 5], ['2000-35', 0, 1, 5, 3], ['2000-42', 12, 15, 2, 4] ], columns =['week_yr', 'Region_a', 'Region_b', 'Region_c', 'Region_d']) If possible an example of an application in python or r Thanks The same question and discussed here: Time series: probability to exceed a certain threshold by @Paolo and @IrishStat
