What is the impact of a dummy variables to boosted trees?

I am currently reading the book "Random Forests" by Yu. L. Pavlov. Then it came across my mind the question If I were to use ensembled tree, say XGBOOST, do I need to transform each categorical variable into a dummy variable. I have searched the internet and found mixed results People saying that dummy variables impacts performance: article 1 , article 2 . but majority of the articles I have read agrees with the notion that categorical variables needs to be encoded. I would like to hear your thoughts on this, and if you can also point to any journal article tackling this matter, that would be a very huge help.
