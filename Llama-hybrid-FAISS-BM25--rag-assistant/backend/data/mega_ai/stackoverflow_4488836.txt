BeautifulSoup: get contents[] as a single string

Anyone know an elegant way to get the entire contents of a soup object as a single string? At the moment I'm getting contents , which is of course a list, and then iterating over it: notices = soup.find("div", {"class" : "middlecontent"}) con = "" for content in notices.contents: con += str(content) print con Thanks!
