What is the relationship between: the first raw moment, location, expected value, mean in general, arithmetic mean for any sensible distribution?

I am a bit confused by the several sources telling that: the first raw moment is by definition the arithmetic mean expected value of any random variable is exactly the arithmetic mean The expected value and the arithmetic mean are the exact same thing. source: How does the expected value relate to mean, median, etc. in a non-normal distribution? at the same time, on Wikipedia, I can see that for a log-normal distribution, the " mean " (not specified which one), which is a link redirecting to " expected value " is different: exp{μ+σ^2/2} than the arithmetic mean I do not know, how the μ is expressed? In the normal distribution it is the arithmetic mean, but here? Then I read about the log-normal distribution, where the geometric mean is the exp(arithmetic_mean(log(normally_distributed_data))). Is this the expected value for log-normal? Is this the first raw moment? Is this something different? If the arithmetic mean is the first raw moment of any distribution (that has it defined) and is also the expected value (but look at point 3), then what is the point in using geometric mean for the log-normal distribution? What about the location parameter? Is this the first moment? The mean? Arithmetic mean? Geometric mean? Median? Expected value? Or maybe it can be characterized by them in certain distributions? Please, help me to organize my knowledge on the relationship between these terms.
