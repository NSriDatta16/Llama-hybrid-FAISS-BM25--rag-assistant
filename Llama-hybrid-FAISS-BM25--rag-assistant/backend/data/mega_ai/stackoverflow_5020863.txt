I think you should go with request parameters but only as long as there isn't an appropriate HTTP header to accomplish what you want to do. The HTTP specification does not explicitly say, that GET can not have a body. However this paper states: By convention, when GET method is used, all information required to identify the resource is encoded in the URI. There is no convention in HTTP/1.1 for a safe interaction (e.g., retrieval) where the client supplies data to the server in an HTTP entity body rather than in the query part of a URI. This means that for safe operations, URIs may be long.
