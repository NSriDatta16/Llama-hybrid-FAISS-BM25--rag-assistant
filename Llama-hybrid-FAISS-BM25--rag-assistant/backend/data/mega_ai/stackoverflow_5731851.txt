Change touch responder to other view in iPhone?

I want to make a drag and drop action in iPhone: when I touch down to a button A, a new view B appears at that location, and if I keep dragging my finger without lifting it, the new view B will be dragged around. The problem is, when I touch down to button A, it is the one that will respond to the touchesMoved method. I can of course pass it manually to the view B, but it's not definitive, and when my finger moves out of the bounds of button A, now it's the background view which will respond to touchesMoved. Is there any simple way to pass the "touch responder" definitively to view B?
