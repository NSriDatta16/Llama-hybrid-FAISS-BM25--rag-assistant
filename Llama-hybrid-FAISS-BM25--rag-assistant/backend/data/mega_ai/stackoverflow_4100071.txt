Why doesn't my Azure WCF service ever go from Busy to Ready?

I have a working WCF service and worker role that I have been debugging locally on the Azure Development Fabric. All is well, but now that I'm trying to deploy it to the cloud in a staging environment, I'm seeing some weird issues. My worker role, which is infinitely more complex than the service, works fine. It goes from Initializing -> Busy -> Ready. My service role, however, goes from Initializing -> Busy and then the status never changes again. I have read a few articles about Initialize -> Busy -> Stopping loops, but this is not the behavior I'm seeing. In fact, when I try to use IntelliTrace, I can't access any logs for the service because it never enters the Unresponsive status. I am able to access logs for the successfully-loaded worker role. How am I supposed to resolve this issue if I can't see any logs or attach a debugger to figure out what's going on? Again, this service works absolutely fine on my local environment. And before anyone suggests it, I have already done the following: Check the DiagnosticsConnectionString and make sure it is connected to my storage account Enable IntelliTrace on the deployment. Check all referenced assemblies to make sure non-.NET assemblies are "copy to local = true" It sure would be great if Azure exposed some kind of console so that I could see what's going on.
