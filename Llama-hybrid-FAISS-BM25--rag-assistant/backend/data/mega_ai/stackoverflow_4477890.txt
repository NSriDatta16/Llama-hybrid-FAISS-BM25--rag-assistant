In SNMP there is no string concepts. OCTET STRING is not a real string (compared to high level programming languages such as Java and C#), as this data structure has nowhere to store encoding information. Well, this is really horrible. The maximum string size is only limited by SNMP network packet size, so you should go to TCP/IP protocol for an answer. No SNMP RFC defines a maximum length. I personally consider OCTET STRING as an array of bytes, so any characters can be stored in it. If you want to restrict them, you should do it in your SNMP agent/engine implementation. When an "invalid" character is found, you can return an SNMP error. Details can be found in RFC 3416 4.2.1. or RFC 1157, 4.1.5.
