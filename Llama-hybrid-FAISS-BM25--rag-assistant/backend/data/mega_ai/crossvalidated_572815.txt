If by "taking the mean of these two quantities" you mean you are calculating the Final Points as the mean of the Total Points and the Average Points, then the graph you've labelled "Actual Variance" is exactly what you'd expect to see. If you think about the relationship between the total and the average then it should be easy to understand why (hint: look at the scales on the x-axis of your two graphs). If you are mainly interested in the Average Points, then why not just use this value? I'm not sure that combining the two values gives a meaningful result, but if you really want to do this, then you could weight one - e.g. calculate the Final Points (FP) by: either multiplying the Average Points (AP) by a constant: $FP_i = (TP_i + c \times AP_i) / 2$ or dividing the Total Points (TP) by a constant: $FP_i = (TP_i / c + AP_i) / 2$ The larger the value you pick for $c$ , the more weight you'll give to the Average Points.
