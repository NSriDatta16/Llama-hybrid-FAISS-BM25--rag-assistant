well crap, i think theoretically it depends on the site type. If people are going to hit the pages of the site one time, and one time only and theres a lot of pages and such, then having the broken up css files ends up working out better on a graph. Versus a site or web app where everything is getting hit constantly or often enough anyway, then having specialized/compiled css for each page might have a bigger hit at first (on a graph anyway), but then gets cached and you win in the long run b/c of fewer http requests. And then theres some overlap-age there somewhere in the nether regions of mass css hysteria. Now get away from the graphs and look at your average site, it probably doesn't matter unless you taking on some really serious traffic. But overall ima vote for the latter here.
