SWFObject redirectUrl not functional with ExpressInstall

How do you specify a redirect URL for the adobe flash express install? I'm using swfobject 2.2 , and while I thought MMredirectURL in the flashvars might be what I needed, this just doesn't work. I also tried setting redirectUrl in the attributes object before embedding the swf, but this doesn't work either. What is the proper way to specify a redirect URL to go through after the Express Install occurs with swfobject 2.2?
