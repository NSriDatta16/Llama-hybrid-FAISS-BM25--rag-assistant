Considering that you have 4 categorical variables, you could run a mosaic plot. There is a mosaic function in the vcd library. So, something like the following would give a simple plot (untested code): install.packages("vcd") library(vcd) mosaic(dataframename, main = "Title") It is relatively simple to add e.g. Pearson residuals, see the help page for mosaic. Alternatively, you could do logistic regression with "group" as the dependent variable and the demographic variables as independent variables. If you like, you could then include interactions.
