Should I use Jython, JRuby, Beanshell, Groovy, Rhino, or what for this small task?

I have some batch data-manipulation scripts which support a small business website. The scripts are a "rat's nest" of Perl, Java, and Stored Procedures, which run on a scheduled basis to update data based on various sources and algorithms. I want to get rid of the Perl so that I can at least take advantage of transaction management by containing the entire process in a JVM-managed database connection from start to finish. Which of the various Java dynamic/scripting language should I leverage which will meet the following criteria: Straightfoward to migrate Perl code by providing similar expressive power, I/O, regex's, etc. Good IDE support, including code completion and debugging preferably in Eclipse Easy to install. Preferably the entire scripting engine should be in a single jar file. Not an orphaned technology. I want to pick something that will still be around in 5 years. Of course - clean integration with the rest of the Java code that I already have. I hope my criteria are clear enough that this does not get tagged as a subjective question. For me this is definitely a programming question. I see all those languages as just "useful java libraries". Thanks!
