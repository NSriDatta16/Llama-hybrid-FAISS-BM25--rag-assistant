In prediction, when should I use rolling windows vs. nonoverlapping ones?

Suppose I have daily time series data and I want to predict a month in advance using a set of features. I have lots of them so I'll be using regularized linear regression. To create the response I can take nonoverlapping months or every day I can look forward a month. When is one appropriate vs. the other? My goal is solely to make better predictions.
