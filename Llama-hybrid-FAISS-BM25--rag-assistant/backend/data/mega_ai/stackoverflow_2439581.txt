HTML5: Can't drag on-the-fly created tag even though draggable='true' Do I need to "BLESS" it or something?

After creating a div on the fly with this markup: $('.circuit').prepend(" TRANSISTOR "); It is NOT draggable itself :( Is jQuery prepend() the correct way to create "live" tags in the DOM? Do I need to somehow bless it a different way to make draggable=true really work? How to I wire it up so that on-the-fly divs can be draggable? AFTER NOTE: I added a static div and that is draggable. INTERESTING: I view both the static and dynamic using FireFox F12 Firebug and they are identical . But one is draggable and one is not !!!
