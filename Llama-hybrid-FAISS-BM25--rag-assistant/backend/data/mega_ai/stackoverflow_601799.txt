According the the CDT Downloads page : As a minimum, you need to install the Eclipse Platform Runtime before installing the CDT So adding the CDT Ganymede update site to your current eclipse 3.4 configuration should be enough for you to install CDT. After that, do you have any error message ? For instance, there can be some eclipse.ini-related issues when using this package.
