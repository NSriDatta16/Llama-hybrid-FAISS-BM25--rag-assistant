So, after some digging around, I solved my problem. The solution was to utilize a Thumb . My UserControl XAML looks like this: We can see the addition of the Thumb with a different color, which covers up the orange header (letting me know the thumb is actually there). Code behind for the Thumb events looks like this: public partial class UserControl1 : UserControl { private bool _isDragging; private double _x; private double _y; public UserControl1() { InitializeComponent(); } private void OnDragComplete(object sender, DragCompletedEventArgs e) { _isDragging = false; } private void OnDragStarted(object sender, DragStartedEventArgs e) { _isDragging = true; _x = (double)GetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty); _y = (double)GetValue(Canvas.TopProperty); } private void OnDragDelta(object sender, DragDeltaEventArgs e) { if (!_isDragging) return; _x += e.HorizontalChange; _y += e.VerticalChange; SetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty,_x ); SetValue(Canvas.TopProperty,_y ); } } And this got me exactly what I wanted. One question did remain: I see some tearing of the usercontrol when I move it around. It's just not a smooth drawing effect, and I can't seem to find a way to eliminate that. Any clues?
