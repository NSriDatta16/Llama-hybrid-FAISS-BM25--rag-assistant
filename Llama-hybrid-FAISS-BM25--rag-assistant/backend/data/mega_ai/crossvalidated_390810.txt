If you bin, every result $R$ you report will be conditional on the set of bins you use. It is then up to you to average over these choices before you report any robust result. If you are ambitious (or if a reviewer gives you no choice), you may report the distribution of your results P(R) over the set of bin selection. More details: a result $R$ is obtained from a numerical experiment in which binning was used. Let the binning be defined as $\{b_1 \cdots b_N\}$ where $b_i=[l_i,u_i]$ is the choice of $l_i$ as the lower bound and $u_i$ as the upper bound for the $i$ th bin. For simplicity, let's say the set of bins is defined by the position $l=l_0$ of the first bin and a uniform width $w$ for every bin. The lower bound of the first bin $l_0$ can vary up the upper value of the first bin $u_0=l_0+w$ and $w$ can vary from some minimum to maximum values $(w_{min},w_{max})$ . To show robustness of R, we need to calculate $$ P(R) = \sum_{w=w_{min}}^{w_{max}}\sum_{l=l_0}^{l_0+w} P(R|l,w) P(l,w) \\ P(l,w) \sim \frac{2(u_0-l_0)}{w_{max}+w_{min}} \times (w_{max}-w_{min}) $$ Of course, now you've introduced $w_{max}, w_{min},$ and $l_0$ , so technically $P(R) \rightarrow P(R|w_{max}, w_{min},l_0)$ , but if we suspect (not unreasonably) that $P(R)$ is independent of these values, then $P(R|w_{max}, w_{min},l_0)=P(R)$ (whew!) which is usually the case, and you rarely have to prove that unless you are really very unlucky with your reviewer! In the context of the OP's question I would be satisfied if the arbitrary threshold 0.5 were set to a variety of values between credible min and max values, and to see that the basic results of his analysis are largely independent of the selection.
