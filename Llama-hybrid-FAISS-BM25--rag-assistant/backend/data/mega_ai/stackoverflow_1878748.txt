I use NHibernate with ASP.NET MVC for GarageCommerce.com and it is very fast even on pretty low budget hardware. The overhead of NHibernate is negligible compared to the raw cost of talking to a database. There is a strong community , proven patterns to follow and support tools like NHibernate Profiler . It's likely that you would end up with a more efficient application than if you had rolled your own database access. You have a better chance of solving scalability issues with a powerful tool like NH. You can turn on it's 2nd level cache and back it with memcache. There is also work on NHiberate.Shards to help you horizontally partition your data.
