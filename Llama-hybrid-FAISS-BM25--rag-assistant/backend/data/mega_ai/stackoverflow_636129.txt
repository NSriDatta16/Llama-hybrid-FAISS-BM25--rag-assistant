You could probably write an entire C# app and never pass any objects/structs by ref. I had a professor who told me this: The only place you'd use refs is where you either: Want to pass a large object (ie, the objects/struct has objects/structs inside it to multiple levels) and copying it would be expensive and You are calling a Framework, Windows API or other API that requires it. Don't do it just because you can. You can get bit in the ass by some nasty bugs if you start changing the values in a param and aren't paying attention. I agree with his advice, and in my five plus years since school, I've never had a need for it outside of calling the Framework or Windows API.
