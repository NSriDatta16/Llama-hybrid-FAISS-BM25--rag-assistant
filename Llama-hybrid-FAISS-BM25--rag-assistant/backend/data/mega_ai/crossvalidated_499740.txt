Neural Text Simplification with no appropriate dataset

I'm currently starting a research project focused on NLP. One of the steps involved in this project will be the development of a text simplification system, probably using a neural encoder-decoder architecture. For most Text Simplification research available, the most commonly used dataset is one derived from pairing Wikipedia entries in both English and Simplified English. My problem arises from the fact that the focus of my research is not on the English Language, but rather in Portuguese, specifically Portugal Portuguese. There exists no Simple Portuguese Wikipedia page and it seems that there exists no publicly available text simplification dataset in Portugal Portuguese at all. Due to this fact I'm curious if there would be any way of tackling this problem. Maybe having a dataset simply of complex Portuguese and simple portuguese, but with no pairings, although I'm not quite sure how that could be formulated to train a NN with. Thank you.
