The marginal effects from a logistic regression is the following: The partial derivative essentially tells you the effect of a unit change in some variable x The first part of the equation, , is always positive and would look like the curve below: First thing to notice is that the marginal effect will depend on X. So normally we would evaluate the marginal effects at the mean. Having said that, regardless of where you evaluate the marginal effects c > b implies that the balance has a higher effect on the probability of event than the age . (bcos the first part of that marginal effects equation is always positive)
