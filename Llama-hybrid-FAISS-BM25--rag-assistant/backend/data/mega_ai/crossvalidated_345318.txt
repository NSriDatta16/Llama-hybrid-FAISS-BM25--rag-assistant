The linkage criterion is a function of the distance metric that you choose. For instance, let's consider the average-linkage criterion. Here's the formula: Notice that the d in the above formula is the chosen distance metric. If you had chosen Euclidean distance, then that could provide a different value for the linkage function as compared to say, the Mahalanobis distance.
