Interpret coefficient of categorical variable for group with no observation in fixed effect regression

I have a hard time interpreting a coefficient from a fixed effect logistic regression, especially in the case where no observation has this value in a given group. Consider this model, where we regress mpg by gear and fix by am . fe |t|) factor(gear)4 4.943333 1.059e-15 4.670115e+15 Note however that there are zero observations of gear == 3 in am == 1, and of gear == 5 when am == 0. > table(mtcars $am, mtcars$ gear) 3 4 5 0 15 4 0 1 0 8 5 So, how is the gear coefficient computed in that case, and how should one interpret it? Is it an average of the coefficients from the within-group regressions where we observe at least once the category? Are some groups contributing more to the estimation of the coefficient?
