Doesn't really help you with your question, but perhaps some1 might be interested in it: I once wrote a R-function to create this kind of graph used to visualize clustering solutions. The code is available at https://github.com/neuhier/R-Stuff -> Netchart.R. And here is how you might use it: require(flexclust) d = data(dentitio) clustering = kcca(dentitio, 3) netchart(dentitio[,-1], clustering@cluster) Guess its not elegant, but it works. :-)
