Looking for a name for a "mean-influencing" statistic

I have been using a statistic to measure "influence" or some analogous concept in the following way: First calculate the mean for a given sample, then calculate the mean for the given sample excluding each observation in turn. Subtract the latter from the former. The result is a vector measuring the amount by which the sample mean is increased by the inclusion of each observation. Something like this (more or less): $$ \frac{\sum_{i = 1}^{n}}{n} - \frac{\sum_{i \neq 1}^{n}}{n - 1} $$ To me, this recalls the concept of " leverage " in regression, but I am wondering whether This specific measure has been used elsewhere -- especially in the statistical literature. This specific measure has a name Thanks in advance for your time.
