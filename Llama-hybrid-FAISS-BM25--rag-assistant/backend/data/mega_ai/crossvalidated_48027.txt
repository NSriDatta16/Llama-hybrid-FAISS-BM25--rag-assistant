Generating IMA(1,1) series

I'd like to generate a series that follows an IMA(1,1) process, where $θ$ is the moving average parameter. I generated the series based on different representations and I got different results, I'm wondering which one is correct? $$ \begin{aligned} d_1 &=μ+e_1 \\ d_t &=d_{t−1}−θ\cdot e_{t−1}+e_t \\ \\ \text{or} \\ \\ d_1 &=e_1 \\ d_t &=μ+d_{t−1}−θ\cdot e_{t−1}+e_t \end{aligned} $$
