I've successfully used GlusterFS for (a bit diffrent type of) storage: GlusterFS is a clustered file-system capable of scaling to several peta-bytes. It aggregates various storage bricks over Infiniband RDMA or TCP/IP interconnect into one large parallel network file system. See here: http://www.gluster.org/docs/index.php/GlusterFS It scales. Good luck (I think You will need it on this project).
