The non-existence of conjugate priors outside exponential families is related to the Fisher-Darmois-Piman-Koopman lemma . Which states that, for parameterised families with fixed support (hence excluding the Uniform counterexamples), there cannot exist a sufficient statistic $S_n$ of fixed dimension whatever the sample size $n$ is. Here is a version of the Lemma due to H. Jeffreys (1939) [and reproduced from Oban (2009) ): Fisher-Darmois-Pitman-Koopman Lemma Let the random quantities $X_1,X_2,...$ be conditionally i.i.d. given the value of some random quantity $\theta$ , and assume that the conditional distribution $P_X(X_i|\theta)$ is dominated by a measure ν. Let $p(\cdot|θ)$ be the corresponding conditional density. Assume further that the support of $f_{X|θ}$ is independent of the value of θ: $$∀θ_1,θ_2∈Ω_θ:\ \text{supp} p(.|θ_1) = \text{supp} p(.|θ_2)\quad ν-a.e.$$ Then if there is a sufficient statistic $S_n: Ω^n_x\mapsto Ω_s$ for each sample size $n\ge n_0$ , and if $Ω_s$ has finite dimension, $P_X(\cdot|Θ)$ is an exponential family model. Indeed, if there exists a conjugate family with a fixed and finite number $p$ of hyper-parameters, the posterior update of these hyper-parameters is sufficient (since Bayesian and classical sufficiencies are equivalent for dominated models ).
