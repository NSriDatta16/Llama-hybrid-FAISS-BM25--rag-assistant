Merge Statement (COBOL)

I was working on a program that needed to use a merge statement to put two files together and sort them. Of course though I would not be here if I didn't have a problem. When I run my program I have to do a little work afterward to add to the output. When it it goes to perform that paragraph it gives an error that says "Merge File out of sequences ORDER-FILE-SOR". Here is my code: 100-MAIN. MERGE ORDERS-FILE-SORT ON ASCENDING KEY REQUEST-DATE-S ON ASCENDING KEY CUST-NUMBER-S ON ASCENDING KEY CUST-ORDER-NUMBER-S ON ASCENDING KEY PART-NUMBER-S USING ORDERS-FILE-PRIOR-IN ORDERS-FILE-NEW-IN OUTPUT PROCEDURE 200-FILE-START STOP RUN. 200-FILE-START. OPEN OUTPUT ORDERS-FILE-OUT ACCEPT WS-DATE FROM DATE MOVE RUN-MONTH TO MONTH-1 MOVE RUN-DAY TO DAY-1 MOVE RUN-YEAR TO YEAR-1 PERFORM 300-NEXT-PAGE PERFORM UNTIL ARE-THERE-MORE-RECORDS = 'NO ' RETURN ORDERS-FILE-SORT AT END MOVE 'NO ' TO ARE-THERE-MORE-RECORDS NOT AT END PERFORM 400-PROCESS-FILE END-RETURN END-PERFORM. CLOSE ORDERS-FILE-OUT. The output it does show is the heading line and it seems to stop at the "RETURN ORDERS-FILE-SORT" line. Any help would be greatly appreciated as I feel the rest of the program will run just fine, but I can't check it till this is fixed.
