Would adding 0's to time slots that never have values improve the performance of any time series model?

So, we are modeling a time series problem based on evaluating something at time x. We have several days with y time slots for each day (all days have the same slots), but time slots doesn't cover the whole day . For example, we have 9-10am time slot, but we don't have 12-1pm time slot and we don't have time slots for the night time. I don't think that inserting 0's for the not slots will affect any modelling, specially convolutional neural networks are just a composition of functions and will find the pattern anyway. but can someone explain a bit better why or if there's any model that would benefit from adding 0's to the missing time slots?
