As a former analytics manager and a current lead data scientist, I am very leery of the need for data science certificates. The term data scientist is pretty vague and the field of data science is in it's infancy. A certificates implies some sort of uniform standard which is just lacking in data science, it is still very much the wild west. While a certificate is probably not going to hurt you, I think your time would be better spent developing the experience to know when to use a certain approach, and depth of understanding to be able to explain that approach to a non-technical audience.
