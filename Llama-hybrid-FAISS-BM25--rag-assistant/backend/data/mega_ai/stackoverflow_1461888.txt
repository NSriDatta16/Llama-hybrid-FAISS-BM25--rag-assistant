This function is very uncommon for Erlang and this is may be reason why it is not in standard library. No one of experienced Erlang programmers need it and is discourage to use algorithms using this function. When someone needs it, can write for own purpose but this very rare occasions are not reason to include it to stdlib . Design your data structures in proper way instead of ask for this function. In most cases need of this function indicates error in design.
