Can we use a linear mixed model to predict which group it comes from, e.g. use the linear mixed model as discriminative model? Linear mixed models can be used as the first step in a 2-stage process to perform classification, based on multivariate clustered data. The basis for such clustering is a mixture of multivariate generalized linear mixed models. This has been implemented in R, by the first-named author of the journal article you linked to, called mixAK utilising a Bayesian framework, and is based on prior work, published by the same author (Komarek & Komarkova, 2013). The package is documented as usual on CRAN and also has a paper available for free in the Journal of Statistical Software. Does this extend if we have more than one fixed effect? Yes, multiple fixed effects are supported. References : Komarek A & Komarkova L (2013). Clustering for Multivariate Continuous and Discrete Longitudinal Data."
