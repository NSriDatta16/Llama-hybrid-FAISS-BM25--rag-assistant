Finding touch point in Objective c/cocoa touch

I have a problem to find the touch point. I have a function loadView() where I set 16 tiles(16 UIImageView ). Then In function: - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet*)touches withEvent:(UIEvent*)event { // Retrieve the touch point UITouch *touch=[[event allTouches]anyObject]; CGPoint point= [touch locationInView:touch.view]; CGRect frame = [self frame]; // Error this Line } I have Used frame to identify which frame/tiles is pressed using frame-origin. But this line: CGRect frame = [self frame]; makes me crazy. Plz someone tell me What to do.(with explanation and why not working). Plz.
