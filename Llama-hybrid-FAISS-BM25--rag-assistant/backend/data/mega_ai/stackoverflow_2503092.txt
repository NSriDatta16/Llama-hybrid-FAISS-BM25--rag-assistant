The quick and dirty approach is to simply group_by the year and iterate over those: @all_books.group_by { |b| b.created_at.year }.each do |year, books| # All books for one year, so put heading here books.each do |book| # ... end end This requires sorting within the Rails application, so you will need to retrieve all relevant records in order to have the data properly organized. To do the sort on the server you will probably need to introduce a year column and keep it in sync with the created_at time.
