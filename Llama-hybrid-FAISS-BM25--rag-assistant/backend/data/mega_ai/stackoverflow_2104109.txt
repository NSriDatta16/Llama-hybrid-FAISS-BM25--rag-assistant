To start off, you need to grab ALL of the values from your query. PHP's library only returns results one row at a time so you need to loop over it and continue to get results until you have them all. So do this: $resource = mysqli_query($statement); while ($result = mysql_fetch_array($resource)) { $total_results_points[] = $result[0]; } From there, summing and averaging the array in PHP should be fairly simple: $average = array_sum($total_rating_points) / count($total_rating_points) In a nutshell, the array_sum() function returns all the elements in an array added together. The count() function tells you how many elements are in the array. So using the two, you can obtain the mean of the array quite easily.
