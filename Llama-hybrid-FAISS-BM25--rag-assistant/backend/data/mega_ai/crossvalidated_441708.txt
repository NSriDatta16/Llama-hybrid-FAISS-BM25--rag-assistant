Need to understand a statement for Random Walk Metropolis algorithm's proposal distribution?

I was told that the proposal distribution of Random Walk Metropolis needs to be symmetric. But today I was reading a book about Bayesian Analysis which contains the following statement: "The proposal distribution does not have to be a rotationally symmetric bivariate normal. For example, it could be a bivariate normal with nonzero covariances, so that proposals are more likely to be made in some diagonal directions more than others. The proposal distribution could even be nonnormal. It is only for the present illustrative purposes that we assume a simple symmetric proposal distribution." The above statements say that "the proposal distribution does not need to be rotationally symmetric bavariate normal". What does it mean?
