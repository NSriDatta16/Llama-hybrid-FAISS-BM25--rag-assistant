What does a ListViewSubtemCollection use for its keys?

I am trying to get the value of some ListViewSubItems, but I have no idea what values it uses for its keys. I have some simple code: protected override void OnItemDrag(ItemDragEventArgs e) { base.OnItemDrag(e); ListViewItem item = e.Item as ListViewItem; string val = item.SubItems[???].ToString(); } The ??? part is where I am having a problem. I cannot figure out what the keys are. I have tried the column names of the ListView with no luck. I would like to use this method instead of using numeric indices.
