Time Series Forecasting using Custom Representation

Let's assume that I have a background knowledge of some stochastic nondeterministic process and I identified the process to be autoregressive and follow some irregular pattern: $z_t = \sum_{i=1}^N \phi_iz_{(t-fib(i+1))}$ for some $N>0$ where $fib(i)$ returns $i$-th fibonacci number. Is there any model that can fit these kind of (custom?) models? Or should I just fit ARIMA ($N,d,0$) model and hope that $\phi_k$'s for $z_{t-k}$'s where $k\notin\{ fib(i) \,\, \forall i\in\mathrm{N} \}$ will turn out $0$?
