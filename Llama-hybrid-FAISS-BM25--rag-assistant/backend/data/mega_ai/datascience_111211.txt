Suggestion: One should never arbitrarily select an imputation based upon optimization unless you know (or have a hunch) WHY the data is missing. N/A data is either Missing at random, Missing not at random, or Missing completely at random . Ignoring this may help your optimization, but will miss the mark for choosing an appropriate model. There are also some statistical tests that can help you decide. Only exception might be if you are in a data science competition where the rules allow it, but that is still not best data science or statistical practice. Here is a Wikipedia article to help you get started. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Missing_data#Types
