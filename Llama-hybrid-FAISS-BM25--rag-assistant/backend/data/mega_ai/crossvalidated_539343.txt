The answer to this question is that we are not working with independent and identically distributed random variables. In most models the samples are assumed to be i.i.d. That is not the case in time-series data, proteins or other sequential data. The inputs and/or the outputs for any given part of the sequence are not independently drawn from the remaining sequence. We still assume that the different sequences are i.i.d., but the values within each sequence are not. Architectures like RNN's and Transformers try to capture this.
