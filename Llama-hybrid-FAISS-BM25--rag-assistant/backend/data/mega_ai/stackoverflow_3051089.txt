Adding new record to a VFP data table in VB.NET with ADO recordsets

I am trying to add a new record to a Visual FoxPro data table using an ADO dataset with no luck. The code runs fine with no exceptions but when I check the dbf after the fact there is no new record. The mDataPath variable shown in the code snippet is the path to the .dbc file for the entire database. A note about the For loop at the bottom; I am adding the body of incoming emails to this MEMO field so thought I needed to break the addition of this string into 256 character Chunks. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. cnn1.Open("Driver={Microsoft Visual FoxPro Driver};" & _ "SourceType=DBC;" & _ "SourceDB=" & mDataPath & ";Exclusive=No") Dim RS As ADODB.RecordsetS = New ADODB.Recordset RS.Open("select * from gennote", cnn1, 1, 3, 1) RS.AddNew() 'Assign values to the first three fields RS.Fields("ignnoteid").Value = NextIDI RS.Fields("cnotetitle").Value = "'" & mail.Subject & "'" RS.Fields("cfilename").Value = "''" 'Looping through 254 characters at a time and add the data 'to Ado Field buffer For i As Integer = 1 To Len(memo) Step liChunkSize liStartAt = i liWorkString = Mid(mail.Body, liStartAt, liChunkSize) RS.Fields("mnote").AppendChunk(liWorkString) Next 'Update the recordset RS.Update() RS.Requery() RS.Close()
