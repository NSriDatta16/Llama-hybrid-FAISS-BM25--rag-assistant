Given the Likelihood $X \sim{\cal N}(\mu (\theta ),\Sigma )$,and $\theta$ uniform rv,how do i compute the joint distribution $f({X})$ analytically?

I know the likelihood function to be $X \sim{\cal N}(\mu (\theta ),\Sigma )$ with $X$ a vector of two random normal variables $X = [{X_1},{X_2}]$ , with known var-cov matrix ${\Sigma }$ which is diagonal and ins't dependent on $\theta$ and the vector of means which are dependent on $\theta$ : $$\mu (\theta ) = [{\mu _1}(\theta ),{\mu _2}(\theta )]$$ with $$\begin{array}{l} {\mu _1}(\theta ) = d\sin \theta \\ {\mu _2}(\theta ) = d\cos \theta \end{array}$$ with $d$ a constant, and $\theta$ uniformly distributed: $\theta \sim U\left( {\frac{{ - \pi }}{2},\frac{{ \pi }}{2}} \right)$ . I want to compute the joint distribution $f({x_1},{x_2})$ (which is the function in the denominator of posterior distribution (e.g. in Bayesian estimator) $$f({x_1},{x_2}) = \int\limits_{ - \pi /2}^{\pi /2} f ({x_1},{x_2}|\theta )f(\theta )d\theta$$ How do I calculate the integral analytically? (PS I need to find this function not to find the Bayesian estimator) Thank you in advance
