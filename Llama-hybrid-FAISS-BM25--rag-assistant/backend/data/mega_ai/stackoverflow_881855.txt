Beware of linux, You will have some data cached in memory (and it's cool because it's fast, but this will break Your benchmarking). IMHO You shouldn't test the hdd throughput, as if the data will be accumulated closely on the physical disc, You will have more, fragmentation of data impacts result too... Use some other metric. In top, You have a "0.0%wa" statistic that tells You how much the processor is spending on waiting for data. If this gets high, You are in trouble (You could make a RAID array to increase the throughput). I don't know how top gets this info, but I bet You could get it too.
