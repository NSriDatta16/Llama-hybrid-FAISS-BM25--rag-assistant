Best tags to use to draw a legend for a chart in html?

I have a calendar control with various days as various colours. I want a legend at the bottom, basically three coloured boxes + text X bibble Y bibble Z bibble XYZ are different coloured boxes I am wondering what a nice way to do this is. Should I dive in with tables, or use divs or some other control with CSS applied? Any elegant solution is what I am looking for.
