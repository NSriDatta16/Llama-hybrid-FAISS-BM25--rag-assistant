Here's the @Mayank Sharma / @jball C# version converted to VB.NET. Thanks for the fix guys, been bugging me for months. My problem was every browser on MAC and PC worked except IE8 and Chrome. But then Chrome, much as I like it, often fails to run Google Docs - work that out!!! Protected Overrides Sub AddedControl(ByVal control As Control, ByVal index As Integer) If Request.ServerVariables("http_user_agent").IndexOf("fake_user_agent", StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase) <> -1 Then Me.Page.ClientTarget = "uplevel" End If MyBase.AddedControl(control, index) End Sub You'll note that I had to check for "fake_user_agent", not "Safari".
