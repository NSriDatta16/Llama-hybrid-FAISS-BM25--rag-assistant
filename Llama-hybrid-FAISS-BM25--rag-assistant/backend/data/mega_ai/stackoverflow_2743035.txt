Tex does have a caching facility, named format files, and I think, pace Alexey's valuable summary of the problems representing Tex's state, it should be possible to use them to allow resumption of editing after any page eject. The major issue is that pagebreaks will affect paragraphs or floats, and these may not occur at a particular point in the text, but may be occur in the execution of macros that were invoked dependent on the transient state passed to them when they were invoked. So to make the idea of creating "breakpoints" work, one would need to hack Tex internals to dump additional information, beyond that normaally dumped in format files, and package them up with the state of the auxiliary files. Given what Joseph says about Tex fragment previewers, why would anyone bother hacking Tex to do this?
