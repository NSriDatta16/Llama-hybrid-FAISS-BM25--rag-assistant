Visual Studio 2008/2010 SP1, how to jump back out of a catch?

I am using the debugger (vs2008). Once I've stepped into a catch statement, I would like to know if there is any way to set the execution cursor back to the beginning of the try. Just dragging it there doesn't seem to work, is there some setting I need to change? Example: try { //Want the cursor back here } catch { //some code, cursor is here... }
