Residuals Interpretation:Time Series Data

I am trying to use multiple regression for a time series dataset. I have values corresponding to a variable measured by 24 hrs for 4 months. Since there was a pattern which repeated every 24 hours I used 23 dummy variables for the hourly variations in values. I used log transformation of the dependent variable before performing multiple regression. The fitted coefficients were highly significant and the R-squared was around 0.99. However, when I look at the Residuals vs fitted plot, it seems sort of weird. According to the plots here , my plot is neither biased nor heteroskedastic, but it also doesn't look like random noise. Can someone help me find the issue here? Also please find below a plot of the observed and fitted model for first 500 hrs
