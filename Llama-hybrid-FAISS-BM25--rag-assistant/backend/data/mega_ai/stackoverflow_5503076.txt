It seems to me you are trying multiple things at the same time: extracting words/sentences by idling in IRC building a knowledge base listening to some chat, parsing keywords generate some sentence regarding keywords Those are basically very different tasks. Markov models are often used for machine learning. I don't see much learning in your tasks though. larsmans answer shows how you generate sentences from word-based markov-models. You can also train the weights to favor those word-pairs that other IRC users used. But nonetheless this will not generate keyword-related sentences, because building/refining a markov model is not the same as "driving" it. You might try hidden markov models (HMM) where the visible output is the keywords and the hidden states are made from those word-pairs. You could then favor sentences more appropriate to specific keywords dynamically.
