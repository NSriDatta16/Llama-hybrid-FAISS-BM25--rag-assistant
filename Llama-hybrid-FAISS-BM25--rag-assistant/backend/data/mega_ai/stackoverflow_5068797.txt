This problem is known as "authorship detection" (or sometimes, in a particular domain, "plagiarism detection"). It can be done using a variety of statistical algorithms, of which neural networks aren't the easiest. Check out the Cavnar & Trenkle algorithm for text classification. That may be made into a useful baseline algorithm for this task. Implementations in various languages are available on the web. You may want to turn it into a clustering algorithm instead of a classifier.
