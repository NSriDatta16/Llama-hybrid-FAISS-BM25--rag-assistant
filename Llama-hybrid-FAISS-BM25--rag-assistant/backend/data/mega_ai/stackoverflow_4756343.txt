The client I have just developed an app for has the requirement for users to login to their service before they can use the app. They place the app in the store with a clear indication a login is required. The app is free to download so no one gets caught paying for something they can't use. We have just submitted the latest app to the store and are waiting for approval * . When submitting we included a full login for the reviewers to test the app with. This was in the review notes and remains confidential. They have an existing app already approved which works the same way. As part of the app we also included a demo mode with static content bundled with the app which allowed access to all the functionality but only for that very limited set of data. The client has the Enterprise programme which allowed us to beta test the app with designated users but that was with the usual 100 device limit (with devices able to be removed at renewal time only). Both the individual developer and the company program are allowed the same number of devices but you want to be able to join the clients team as developer so they should go for the Company program. The client will need to be the Agent for the submission and that is fixed as the first account they sign up with. We're trying to change the agent for our company now and it's not something you can do online you have to send Apple a request. They should then add you as a developer for their program. You can be a member or an admin but only they, as the Agent, will get to sign the app for distribution. I sure hope you aren't correct about rejection because of the login service or I'm going to have a very disappointed client on my hands. * EDIT: Our application was approved by Apple at the first attempt so there was no problem with this approach.
