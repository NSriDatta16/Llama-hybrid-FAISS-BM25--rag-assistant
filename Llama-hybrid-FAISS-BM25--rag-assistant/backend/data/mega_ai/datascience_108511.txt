What's your ideal work environment?

I'm a founder in a data science heavy startup, and I'm currently functioning as the entire dev team. Before I know it we'll have people working together on a project I, currently, work on completely alone. So: What are some must have things data scientists need to work together in a production setting? Where are some things data scientist expect to have done outside their scope of work? What would make their lives easier and more productive? What are some things companies often do, which I should or shouldn't do? Which devs, which aren't data scientists, do you rely on the most, and how do you work together? These questions are to inspire thought, I'm open to (and would greatly appreciate) general feedback. Edit: I'll let the community decide who gets the Rep via votes. While I think we could all benefit from the discussion here, I invite you to vote for the answer(s) you think are the most helpful such that the writer can be rewarded.
