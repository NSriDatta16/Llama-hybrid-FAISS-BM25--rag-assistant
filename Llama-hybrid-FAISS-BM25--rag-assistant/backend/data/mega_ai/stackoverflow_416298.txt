Use a test-coverage tool. Make it very visible. That way everybody can easily see how much code in each area is passed, failed and untested. Then you may be able to start a culture where "untested" is a sign of bad coding, "failed" is a sign of work in progress and "passed" is a sign of finished code. This works best if you also do "test-first". Then "untested" becomes "you forgot step 1". Of course you don't need 100% test coverage. But of one area has 1% coverage and another has 30%, you have a metric for which area is most likely to fail in production.
