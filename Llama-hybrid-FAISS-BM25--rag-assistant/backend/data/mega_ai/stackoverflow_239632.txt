Also make sure that your database FILE is less prone to fragmentation. This is admittedly very tough to do, since you don't know what the layout of your customers' drives are, but I suggest starting your .MDB file off at a reasonably large initial size to prevent online rebuilds, which suck time and resources, and often lead to file level fragmentation as well. Your index design also impacts how fragmented your indexes are. You need to make sure indexes you're inserting to a lot have an appropriately low FILLFACTOR to prevent page splitting. Also get rid of any indexes which are not being used. To defrag your indexes, use the DBCC DBREINDEX command.
