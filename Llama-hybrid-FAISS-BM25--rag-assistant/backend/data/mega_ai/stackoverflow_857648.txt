My recommendation would be to use object oriented programming as the highest level of organization and procedural programming for implementation. OO is best at defining interfaces, contracts between components, partitioning code into coherent chunks, etc. When programmers first start learning about objects, there's a tendency to go nuts with objects, making everything in sight an object when a simple built-in type would do. Every number becomes a class, then methods proliferate on the classes, just in case they're needed. It can become a form of procrastination, delaying the point at which you finally get down to writing code that does some work.
