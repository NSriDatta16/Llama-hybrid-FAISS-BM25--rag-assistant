Fitting a Logistic Regression Without an Intercept

Based on the answer here: Significance of categorical predictor in logistic regression I tried adding a "-1" to my model to fit it without an intercept, and see the correlations directly. It looks like adding the "-1" only helps for the first of the variables, and doesn't help if there is more than one categorical value. I tried running it on "overweight ~ race + diet -1 " and then reversing the order of race and diet. If race is 1st in the formula, then all 4 races show up as significant. glm(formula = overweight ~ race + diet - 1, family = "binomial", data = data) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) race1 -1.17569 0.07916 -14.851 When diet is first race1 is not included in the model, and race4's z value is not significant. glm(formula = overweight ~ diet + race - 1, family = "binomial", data = data) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) diet1 -1.17569 0.07916 -14.851 I also tried subtracting 1 from each of the categorical variables, but that didn't add diet1 into the model glm(formula = overweight ~ race -1 + diet - 1, family = "binomial", data = data) Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) race1 -1.17330 0.07915 -14.823 Is there a way to fit multiple categorical variables while keeping all the "categories" in the model? Is there a reason why this shouldn't be done? In this case, I expect race4 to be statistically significant, but when race1 is being used as the reference race4 is not statistically significant. Is there a way to avoid this?
