Importance of the bias node in neural networks

I'm curious to know how important the bias node is for the effectiveness of modern neural networks. I can easily understand that it can be important in a shallow network with only a few input variables. However, modern neural nets such as in deep learning often have a large number of input variables to decide whether a certain neuron is triggered. Would simply removing them from, e.g., LeNet5 or ImageNet have any real impact at all?
