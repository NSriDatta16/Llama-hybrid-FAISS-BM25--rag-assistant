it is possible to use features maps of CNN to localised important areas in image?

I'm new in deep learning and CNN, I understand how convolutional and pooling layers work, I understand how and why feature maps are created. How I can localize from the feature maps important area in the original image? is that possible? I.e. I use my own data ( medical image ) Feeding those images to my neural network I can receive maps features and calculate from them the probability of each class. But how from that feature maps I can get know where exactly those areas are? how can I backtrack the weights? any idea?
