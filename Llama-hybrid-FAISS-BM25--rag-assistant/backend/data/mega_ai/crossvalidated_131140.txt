What exactly is the procedure to compute principal components in kernel PCA?

In kernel PCA (principal component analysis) you first choose a desired kernel, use it to find your $K$ matrix, center the feature space via the $K$ matrix, find its eigenvalues and eigenvectors, then multiply the centered kernel matrix by the desired eigenvectors corresponding to the largest eigenvalues. The result should be the projection of the feature space data onto a low dimensional subspace. To the best of my knowledge, you divide the eigenvalues by the number $n$ of original data points to scale them. So the question is, do the eigenvectors you choose to multiply the centered kernel matrix by need scaling as well and if so how do you do it?
