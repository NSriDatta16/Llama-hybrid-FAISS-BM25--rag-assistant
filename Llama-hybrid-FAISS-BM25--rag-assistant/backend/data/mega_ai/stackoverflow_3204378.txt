Unit testing messages

I have a web page that shows different messages according to different conditions. I want to unit test this so I configured my project to use MVVM and I'm testing my ViewModel. My ViewModel now format different messages. How can I test this? I don't want to reproduce all strings, it seems dirty... Now I'm doing this: void test() { string message = _viewModel.DoWork(); Assert.AreEqual(message, Resource.MyResourceText); } But this is a simple case. Now I have dynamic strings containing system date and other variables. How can I test this in an elegant way? Thanks!
