This proof is essentially the same as the previous one , up to further simplifications. The original Bayesian network is $$V\leftarrow Y\to X \to U.$$ By comparing $v$ -structures (immoralities) we see that this Bayesian network is Markov equivalent to the Markov chain $$V\to Y\to X\to U.$$ From this, the inequality $\mathrm{MI}(V, U) \le \mathrm{MI}(X; Y)$ follows easily â€“ the Markov chain can be only as strong as its strongest link .
