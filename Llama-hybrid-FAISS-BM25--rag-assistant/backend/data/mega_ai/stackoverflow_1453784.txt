You can't. PRAGMA INDEX_LIST('MyTable'); will give you a list of indices. This will include the automatically generated index for the primary key which will be called something like 'sqlite_autoindex_MyTable_1' . But unfortunately you cannot drop this index... sqlite> drop index sqlite_autoindex_MyTable_1; SQL error: index associated with UNIQUE or PRIMARY KEY constraint cannot be dropped All you can do is re-create the table without the primary key.
