My guess is that you don't have an outlet set to myTable. That would explain why datasource and delegate work, but not calls to reload data. Assuming this is the issue you need the following in your @interface: @property (nonatomic, retain) IBOutlet UITableView *myTable; and an instance variable UITableView *myTable . Then you need @synthesize myTable; in your implementation. Then you need to use interface builder to assign your table view to this outlet by dragging from the myTable entry in File's Owner > Connections tab to your table view in the layout. Assuming this was the problem , you will now be able to call methods such as reloadData on your table view.
