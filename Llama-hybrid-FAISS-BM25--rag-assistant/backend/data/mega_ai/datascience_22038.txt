If this is your first project start with something simple - e.g. linear regression, lm(sales ~ data) . Once you get it up and running you can try something more sophisticated. I suggest avoiding neural networks in sales prediction - neural networks are sexy, but require huge amounts of data to train properly. This is often not feasible in sales prediction environment.
