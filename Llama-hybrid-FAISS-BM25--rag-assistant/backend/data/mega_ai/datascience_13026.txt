Avoiding leakage on my random forest?

I am training a random forest model. I am wondering if it is safe (leakage?) to use on my training set the parameter average price of a car calculated using all my data points. The issue is that some of these data are used to test my model as well. I try to give an example: Say, the average for that car model is composed of 5 cars and it is 10,000 EUR. I used 3 of these cars to train my random forest. For each car, I provide (besides other parameters) the average price of all cars (10,000) and the price of that particular car (say 8,000) as input. For my testing, I would still provide the price of all cars (10,000) and the price of each particular car (13,000) as input. I want to know if that's leakage, since the 13,000 (now on the testing set) was also used to obtain the 10,000 average. I hope it is clear.
