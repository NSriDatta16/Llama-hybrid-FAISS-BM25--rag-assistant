What can I do with an Transformable attribute type in Core Data on the iPhone?

There's this Transformable data type for attributes. What is it good for? Are there good examples? I'd like to play around with this. So after searching a while I came across this: NSValueTransformer. Seems to be something I need for this. So how would I get started with this? For example, if I wanted to store an UIColor object, would I make an transformer for that? What exactly is this thing transforming to or from? An NSData? And must the object which I pass to the transformer follow any protocol?
