This is a middleware problem as old as the hills, and the short answer is: no. The two 'solutions' put the onus on the file-uploader: (1) upload the file in a staging directory and then move it into the destination directory (2) upload the file, and then create/upload a 'ready' file that indicates the state of the content file. The 1st one is the better, but both are inelegant. The truth is that better communication media exist than the filesystem. Consider using some IPC that involves only a push or a pull (and not both, as does the filesystem) such as an HTTP POST, a JMS or MSMQ queue, etc. Furthermore, this can also be synchronous, allowing the process receiving the file to acknowledge the content, even check it for worthiness, and hand the client a receipt - this is the righteous road to non-repudiation. Follow this, and you will never suffer arguments over whether a file was or was not delivered to your server for processing. M.
