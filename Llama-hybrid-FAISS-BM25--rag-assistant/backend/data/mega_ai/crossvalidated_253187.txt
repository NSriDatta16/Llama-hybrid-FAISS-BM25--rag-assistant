I'd encourage you to start with simple classification techniques. Typically a logistic regression. Very simple, runs fast, many examples in R online. A simple decision tree is also an option (don't go for random forests if you don't have to). Start with these, as they are simple to understand and have good implementations in R. That will give you the capacity to classify a new patient. If you then want to predict changes of states and thinks like that, then it gets more complicated and other techniques are required - but only with properly formulated questions.
