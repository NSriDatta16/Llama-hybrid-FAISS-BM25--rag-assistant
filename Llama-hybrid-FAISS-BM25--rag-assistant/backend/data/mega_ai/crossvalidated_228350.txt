How to combine different sample means?

Take the following situation. We believe that $X$ is drawn from a normal distribution with unknown mean and variance; we wish to estimate the population mean. Previously, several samples were drawn from the population of $X$, say $n$ of them. They were drawn appropriately and independently, and we have their sample means and sample variances. If we had their sample sizes as well, we could essentially do a weighted average of all the sample means and get a good estimate of the population mean (right?). However, in my context (essentially an online learning algorithm) we do not have the sample sizes. So how would we go about estimating the population mean? I thought about maximum-likelihood estimators, but it seems really hard - it seems like we need to estimate the population variance at the same time, and the result is a lot of calculus that (a) I can't solve analytically, and (b) doesn't look like it has a unique solution, due to an apparently lack of concavity. Is this a classical problem with a classical solution?
