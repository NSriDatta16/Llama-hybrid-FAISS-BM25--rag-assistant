Yes, fine. Mercifully it is still all there is SQL Server 2008. Robyn Page's article on Simple-Talk explains it all Robyn Page's SQL Server Data Validation Workbench (I have a feeling I helped her a bit with that one) Just create a Type , and bind defaults and rules to it. The deprecation issue is a bit of a shame. All that has happened is that rules , types and defaults have fallen foul of the SQL Standard. The preferred way now is to use constraint to do the same thing, but it is a lot less elegant if you need to do it uniformly in several tables. Also, it is only people like Joe Celko who understand constraints in their entirety. Sure as anything I don't.
