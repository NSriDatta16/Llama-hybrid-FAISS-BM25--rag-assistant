Is there a way to turn this query to regular inline SQL

I would like to turn this query to regular inline sql without using stored procedures declare @nod hierarchyid select @nod = DepartmentHierarchyNode from Organisation where DepartmentHierarchyNode = 0x6BDA select * from Organisation where @nod.IsDescendantOf(DepartmentHierarchyNode) = 1 Is there a way to do it?
