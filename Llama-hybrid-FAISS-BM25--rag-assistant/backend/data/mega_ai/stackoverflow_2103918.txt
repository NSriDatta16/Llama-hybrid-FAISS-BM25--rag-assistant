Tools for Building an OCA (Occasionally Connected Application)

I will be building an in-house, Occasionally Connected App (OCA). What technologies would you suggest I employ. Here are my parameters: .NET Shop( 3.5sp1 ) C# for code behind ( winform,wpf,silverlight ) SQL Server Backend ( 2005 or possibly 2008 pending approval ) Solo Developer Solo SQL Administrator Low Tech end users Low bandwidth to 5 Branch offices This is a LOB app but not a POS. Majority of users have laptops that they take to Member's Home The Data for this App is stored in 5 separate Databases, though in one SQL instance. I am looking for specific recommendations on which path to choose. Merge Replication or Sync Framework database synchronization providers? SQL Express or SQL CE at the Subscriber? Can I use LINQ to SQL for the DAL? Is a Silverlight 'Offline/Out of Browser App' Example Here , feasible? This is my first LARGE business application so any experienced comments are welcome. As requested here is some additional info on the type of Data. My users are Nurses and Social Workers who go to Member's homes and create "Plans" or "Health Assessment Reviews" for them. These are things like a Medication List or a List of there current "Providers". Steps to achieve members' goals or a list of there current/past Diagnosis's. Things like that. Also the typical Members Name, Address, Phone Number, etc. Mostly this is a Data Storage and Retrieval app that facilitates reporting. Very little "processing" takes place and Nurses and Social Workers work in teams that are assigned members so I usually have very little crossover or potential data conflicts. Nurses and SW's also are responsible for different area's of the MCP( Member Centered Plan ) Additional question; Is Sync Framework really only a viable option if I can use SQL 2008? Seems that way due to the Change Tracking etc....thoughts?
