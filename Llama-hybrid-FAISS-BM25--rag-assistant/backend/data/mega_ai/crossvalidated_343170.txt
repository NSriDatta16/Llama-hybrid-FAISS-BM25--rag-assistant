If one takes your statement of a "standard cross-sectional model" to imply that we can take a random sample from the underlying population, then $$ E(\epsilon_i|x_1,\ldots,x_n)=E(\epsilon_i|x_i) $$ because the random sampling/iid assumption implies that $\epsilon_i$ and $x_j$ are independent for $i\neq j$. Hence, $E(\epsilon_i|x_i)=0$ is enough to guarantee unbiasedness when coupled with an iid assumption. As explained in the answers the comments link to, the iid assumption fails in, e.g., time series applications so that, in general, $E(\epsilon_i|x_i)=0$ is not enough to guarantee unbiasedness: e.g., in an AR(1) model, $E(\epsilon_i|x_i)$ corresponds to $E(\epsilon_i|y_{i-1})$. Under standard assumptions (e.g., that of $\epsilon_i$ a pure "innovation" independent of what happened in the past), $E(\epsilon_i|y_{i-1})=0$ and yet OLS is not unbiased.
