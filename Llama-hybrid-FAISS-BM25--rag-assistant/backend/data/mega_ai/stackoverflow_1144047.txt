Use this instead : h3>a { text-decoration: none; } Doing so you target every 'a' childs of 'h3' Prefer the use of classes and tags selectors versus ids the most you can, as targeting ids tend to make your css code less flexible and extensible. Think inheritance as in OOP. For further reading and complete coverage of the CSS selectors you can refer to : http://www.w3.org/TR/2009/CR-CSS2-20090423/selector.html#child-selectors Cheers
