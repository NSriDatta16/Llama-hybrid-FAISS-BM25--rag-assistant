Did they get into your local repository? I suspect not, i.e. they were new files that were not added to the commit. Use hg add to add them to the changeset before committing or whatever the equivalent is for whatever mercurial interface you're using. Edit: Here's the help from Mercurial: C:\Users\Bert>hg add --help hg add [OPTION]... [FILE]... add the specified files on the next commit Schedule files to be version controlled and added to the repository. The files will be added to the repository at the next commit. To undo an add before that, see "hg forget". If no names are given, add all files to the repository. ... See Mercurial: The Definitive Guide (a.k.a. the hg "red book") for more info: http://hgbook.red-bean.com/read/mercurial-in-daily-use.html Telling Mercurial which files to track Mercurial does not work with files in your repository unless you tell it to manage them. The hg status command will tell you which files Mercurial doesn't know about; it uses a “?” to display such files. To tell Mercurial to track a file, use the hg add command. Once you have added a file, the entry in the output of hg status for that file changes from “?” to “A”. $ hg init add-example $ cd add-example $ echo a > myfile.txt $ hg status ? myfile.txt $ hg add myfile.txt $ hg status A myfile.txt $ hg commit -m 'Added one file' $ hg status use "hg -v help add" to show global options
