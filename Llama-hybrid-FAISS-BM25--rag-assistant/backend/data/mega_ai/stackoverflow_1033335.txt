I investigated SQLite recently for a similar application. The SQLite documentation states that SQLite databases can be terabytes in size, and that the primary limitation of SQLite is concurrency (many users at the same time). Although we didn't go this direction (we have our own binary storage format), I was pretty confident that SQLite could handle files of this size.
