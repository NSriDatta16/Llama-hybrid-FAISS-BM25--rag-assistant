If your logfiles fit easily in memory (this is, you have a reasonable rotation policy) you can easily do something like: log_lines = open('logfile','r').readlines() last_line = get_last_lineprocessed() #From some persistent storage last_line = parse_log(log_lines[last_line:]) store_last_lineprocessed(last_line) If you cannot do this, you can use something like (see accepted answer's use of seek and tell, in case you need to do it with them) Get last n lines of a file with Python, similar to tail
