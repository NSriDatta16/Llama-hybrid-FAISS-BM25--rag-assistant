DIY code escrow?

Rather than using a third party code escrow service, I was thinking about giving customers our source code in encrypted form and then have my attorney produce a document that contains the password for decrypting the source and the conditions under which it is released. The benifits of doing it this way are not just cost. Would you be shocked to hear if one of the big escrow services was hacked? The implementation could be very simple. A Win32 commandline program could be written that uses some obscure combination of AES, random nonces, etc to encrypt and decrypt a file using a password. This program is then packaged with the encrypted source file and instructions and made available to customers via any number of methods. So customers already have the source. All they need is the password to decrypt it. To obtain the password, the customer would simply contact the legal group acting as the escrow agent and claim that one of the conditions for releasing the code has been reached such as bankruptcy, the product was discontinued, etc. Has anyone done this or do you see a flaw in the system?
