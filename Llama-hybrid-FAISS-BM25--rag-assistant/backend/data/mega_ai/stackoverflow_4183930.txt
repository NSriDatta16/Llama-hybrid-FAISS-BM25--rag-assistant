ASP.NET. Hiding whole site structure. Is it possible?

I guess all everybody else would like the opposite but i need to hide the "directory" structure of an ASP.NET website. For this reason i am thinking of Use the robots.txt as follows... User-agent: * Disallow: / Use Url rewriting, to make ghost paths Disable directory browsing. (Directory listing denied...) Use .ashx to serve images. Other ways that you may suggest. In other words i would not like someone with a "downloader-structrure reader", strip my site. As you see the sekurity tag is missing :) P.S. I do not care about SEO
