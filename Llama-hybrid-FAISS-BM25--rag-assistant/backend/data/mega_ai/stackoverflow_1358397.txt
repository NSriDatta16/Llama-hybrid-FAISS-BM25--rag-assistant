Please see Bubble sort : Bubble sort has worst-case and average complexity both О(n²), where n is the number of items being sorted. There exist many sorting algorithms with substantially better worst-case or average complexity of O(n log n). Even other О(n²) sorting algorithms, such as insertion sort, tend to have better performance than bubble sort. Therefore bubble sort is not a practical sorting algorithm when n is large. Worst case performance O(n²) Best case performance O(n) Average case performance O(n²) Worst case space complexity O(n) total, O(1) auxiliary Optimal No
