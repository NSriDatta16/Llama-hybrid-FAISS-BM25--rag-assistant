The Normal Distribution (aka " Gaussian Distribution ") has a firm mathematical foundation. The Central Limit Theorem says that if you have a finite set of n independent and identically distributed random variables having a specific mean and variance, and you take the average of those random variables, the distribution of the result will converge to a Gaussian Distribution as n goes to infinity. There is no guesswork here, since the mathematical derivation leads to this specific distribution function and no other. To put this into more tangible terms, consider a single random variable, such as flipping a fair coin (2 equally possible outcomes). The odds of getting a particular outcome is 1/2 for heads and 1/2 for tails. If you increase the number of coins and keep track of the total number of heads obtained with each trial, then you will get a Binomial Distribution , which has a roughly bell shape. Just graph with the number of heads along the x-axis, and the number of times you flipped that many heads along the y-axis. The more coins you use, and the more times you flip the coins, the closer the graph will come to looking like a Gaussian bell curve. That's what the Central Limit Theorem asserts. The amazing thing is that the theorem does not depend on how the random variables are actually distributed, just so long as each of the random variables has the same distribution. One key idea in the theorem is that you are adding or averaging the random variables. Another key concept is that the theorem is describing the mathematical limit as the number of random variables becomes larger and larger. The more variables you use, the closer the distribution will approach a Normal Distribution. I recommend you take a class in Mathematical Statistics if you want to see how mathematicians determined that the Normal Distribution is actually the mathematically correct function for the bell curve.
