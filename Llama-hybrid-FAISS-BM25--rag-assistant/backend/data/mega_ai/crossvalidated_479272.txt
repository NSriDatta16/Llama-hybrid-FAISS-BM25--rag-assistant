What is the appropriate hypothesis test for the following scenario and the appropriate p value?

There is a restaurant that aims to introduce a new item, and the target price is USD 7.5. They've taken a sample of 40 randomly chosen customers and asked them to write down how much they were willing to pay for the item after a tasting. The average price came out to be USD 8.36 and the SD of the sampling distribution (standard error) is 2.836885. It wants to test whether or not there is statistical evidence that the average amount customers are willing to pay is greater than $7.50. Conduct the appropriate hypothesis test and identify the range the p value falls in. It also wants to test whether or not there is statistical evidence that the proportion of target customers who are willing to buy the sandwich by paying $7.50 or more is greater than 70%.** The answer is 0.0300 to 0.0499 My approach to part 1 was to find the sampling distribution mean which comes out to be 0.448551. Then I tried to find the Z value (Considering that the null hypotheses is H0 7.5). Z=(8.36-7.50)/(2.836885/sqrt(40)) which comes to be 1.92 and the corresponding p value is 0.97257 or rather on complementing the area the answer comes out to be 0.02743. **Where am I going wrong. Can anyone help clarify this problem for me? I've spent a whole evening and can't figure out the answer. I haven't tried part 2, so any hints to that would be really appreciated.**
