Tongue firmly in cheek: A Bayesian defines a "probability" in exactly the same way that most non-statisticians do - namely an indication of the plausibility of a proposition or a situation. If you ask them a question about a particular proposition or situation, they will give you a direct answer assigning probabilities describing the plausibilities of the possible outcomes for the particular situation (and state their prior assumptions). A Frequentist is someone that believes probabilities represent long run frequencies with which events occur; if needs be, they will invent a fictitious population from which your particular situation could be considered a random sample so that they can meaningfully talk about long run frequencies. If you ask them a question about a particular situation, they will not give a direct answer, but instead make a statement about this (possibly imaginary) population. Many non-frequentist statisticians will be easily confused by the answer and interpret it as Bayesian probability about the particular situation. However, it is important to note that most Frequentist methods have a Bayesian equivalent that in most circumstances will give essentially the same result, the difference is largely a matter of philosophy, and in practice it is a matter of "horses for courses". As you may have guessed, I am a Bayesian and an engineer. ;o)
