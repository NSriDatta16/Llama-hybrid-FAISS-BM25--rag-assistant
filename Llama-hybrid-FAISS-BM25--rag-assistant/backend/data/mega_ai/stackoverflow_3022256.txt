SimpleXML SOAP response Namespace issues

After spending SEVERAL frustrated hours on this I am asking for your help. I am trying to get the content of particular nodes from a SOAP response. The response is http://www.w3.org/2003/05/soap-envelope " http://soap.xxxxxx.co.uk/ "> 24 The+client+order+number+3002254+is+already+in+use 1 Aborting I am trying to get at the nodes and children of . Because of the XML containing namespaces $XmlArray = new SimpleXMLElement($XmlStr); foreach ($XmlArray->env:Envelope->env:Body->ns1:PlaceOrderResponse->ErrorArray->Error as $Error) { echo $Error->ErrorCode." "; } doesn't work. I have read a number of articles such as http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2005/10/20/simplexml-and-namespaces/ http://blog.stuartherbert.com/php/2007/01/07/using-simplexml-to-parse-rss-feeds/ and about 20 questions on this site, which unfortunately are not helping. Even writing, $XmlArray = new SimpleXMLElement($XmlStr); echo " \n"; print_r($XmlArray); echo " \n"; gives SimpleXMLElement Object ( ) which makes me wonder if the soap response ($XmlStr) is actually a valid input for SimpleXMLElement. It seems that the line $XmlArray = new SimpleXMLElement($XmlStr); is not doing what I expect it to. Any help on how to get the nodes from the XML above would be very welcome. Obviously getting it to work (having a working example) is what I need in the short term, but if someone could help me understand what I am doing wrong would be better in the long term. Cheers. Stu
