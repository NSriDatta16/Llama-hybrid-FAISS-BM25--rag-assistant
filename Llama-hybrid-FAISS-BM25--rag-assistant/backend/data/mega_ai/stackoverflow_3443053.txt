You could try using OperationContext.Current. This will enable you to store variables for the lifetime of the web service call. Edited to ad a possible No WCF Solution: Since you don't have WCF, you can create something like thread local storage by creating a static map of thread IDs to your object. Just make sure that you are correctly cleaning up this static map when requests are finished or else the next call that uses that thread will pick up your object. Also, make sure to lock the map when you are accessing it.
