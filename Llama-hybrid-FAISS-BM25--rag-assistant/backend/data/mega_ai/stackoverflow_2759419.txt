Detect which image with imagemap was clicked

When you have multiple images that share the same imagemap, is there any way to detect which image was clicked on when a user clicks on the image? I have created a little javascript app, where buildings (simple images) are placed on a map and can be dragged around. When a user clicks on a building, the building can be easily retrieved using e.target, then dragged around. When adding an imagemap (to increase click accuracy) however, e.target no longer works. Is there still a way to find out what image was clicked? It seems a bit weird that javascript can't detect that an image was clicked, when that image uses an imagemap? So, if you have two images, both using usemap="samemap", how to find out which of the two was clicked when the imagemap is triggered?
