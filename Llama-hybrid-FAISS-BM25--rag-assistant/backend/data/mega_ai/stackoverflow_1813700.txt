How to show all the sample principal component plots in R?

I noticed something in R, say pc is the result of applying PCA to a data matrix and pc$x is my sample principal component matrix. When trying plot(pc$x) , it will only plot the first principal component ( pc1 ) against the second ( pc2 ), but I actually have more than 2 principal components. How do I show all of them?
