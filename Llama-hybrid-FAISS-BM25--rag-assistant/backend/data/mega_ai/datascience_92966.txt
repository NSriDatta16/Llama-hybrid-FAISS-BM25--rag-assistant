How to have Multiple labels in a single video?

I am building a Tennis stroke classification system using CNN. I assume each stroke contains 3 steps/classes ('Ready', 'Impact', 'Finish'). I want to train a model which will predict whether the input video contains these steps/classes in it. I have tried training 3 models for each step as binary classification. Example of one step model classes : 1 - ready 0 - not-ready(other incorrect steps). But this method failed since there are more features in 'not-ready' class. I got only 4% accuracy. Can anyone help me to find a solution for this problem.
