In CART, and in tree-based algorithms such as Boosted trees and Random Forests, using irrelevant predictors is not an issue, because such variables are largely ignored during the tree-growing process, providing you do have some strong predictors in your data set (this is the way the CART algorithm works). See for instance this paper . In fact, it was even shown ( Elements of Statistical Learning , section 15.3.4, p. 596) that with 6 relevant and 100 noise variables, the probability of selecting a relevant variable at any split was still 0.46. This means that the noise variables are mostly discarded.
