Draw integers independently & uniformly at random from 1 to $N$ using fair d6?

I wish to draw integers from 1 to some specific $N$ by rolling some number of fair six-sided dice (d6). A good answer will explain why its method produces uniform and independent integers. As an illustrative example, it would be helpful to explain how a solution works for the case of $N=150$ . Furthermore, I wish for the procedure to be as efficient as possible: roll the least number of d6 on average for each number generated. Conversions from senary to decimal are permissible. This question was inspired by this Meta thread .
