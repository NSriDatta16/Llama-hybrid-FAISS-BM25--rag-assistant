Redundant Training Samples

I am building a prediction model based on SVM model with RBF kernel. The training samples represent features obtained from genome regions (called binding sites) that are targeted (regulated) by proteins. The model will learn to distinguish between regions targeted by proteins and regions that are not. (I created positive and negative data). My question is that the positive data contains redundant training samples (i.e. identical binding sites at different locations of the genome) so, shall I keep the redundant training samples (to make the model learn more about a specific pattern of targeted region) or I should keep only the unique training samples? For example: I have in the training samples 10,000 samples represent 10,000 different target regions (binding sites) of proteins. If I take the unique, it will be around 7,000 samples. (Because the binding sites might be identical in different locations)
