Model suggestion for zero-bounded dependent variable

I have a repeated measures dataset (8 measurements) with three experimental groups (Randomly generated). The dependent variable (Y) is on a continuous scale bounded inferiorly at 0. I am trying to model the effect of the different groups and time on Y. What would be the appropriate model here? - repeated ANOVA is compromised by the non-normal distribution of Y (see histogram - I tried adding a minuscule amount and logging, but still really to no help) Mixed linear models are not bounded inferiorly at 0. Perhaps one of the more advanced non-linear mixed models? Area under the curves for all timepoints stratified by group? Bayesian approaches? Raw Y Logged Y Histogram of logged Y
