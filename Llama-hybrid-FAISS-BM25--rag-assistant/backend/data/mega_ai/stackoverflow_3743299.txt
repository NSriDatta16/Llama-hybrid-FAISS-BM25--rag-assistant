Image created programmatically?

This is a beautiful image. I'm wondering how it can be generated programmatically with an image-processing library like imagemagick or gd? http://robertbasic.com/img/sign-letters.gif My general idea is that the frame itself could be defined separately, but is there way to fill that frame with letters in the same way they're doing it here but programmatically? question rephrased for clarity based on answers
