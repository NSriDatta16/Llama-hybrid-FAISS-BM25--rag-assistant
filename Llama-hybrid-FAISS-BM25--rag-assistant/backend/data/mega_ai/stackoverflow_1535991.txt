Links to ASP.NET application in MS Word document

I am observing a weird behavior when clicking links to my ASP.NET application in MS Word 2003 / 2007 document. I have IE8 installed. When I click a link in the document the request that is sent has the user-agent IE7(!?). A new session object is created. Right after that out of nowhere a second request appears this time having user-agent IE8. More over, when I click anything on the requested page, a new session object is once again created, so I cannot rely on anything that has been persisted in the session. Why is it like that?
