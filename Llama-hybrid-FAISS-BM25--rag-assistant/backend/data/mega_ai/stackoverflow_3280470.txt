to monitor local pc network and block ip's is winpcap is the tool?

i need to build network monitor that sniff the network and to hold ip policy that will enable me to block the network based on this policy for example: if im getting incoming http protocol from ip that is in my ip policy black list and now i like to block it and for example redirect this http request so it could contain now my http packet ( packet injection ? ) dose winpcap can do the job ? To be more to the point basically what i need is to build simple url blocking app .. Which approach should i use?
