Thanks to all for the answers. Finally I ended up with combining solutions from several answers. My final solution is following: I use BorderLayout, set West, Center and East panels and then manipulate their sizes by setting PreferredSize to West and East panels. The scheme of rendering is following: while laying out the components BorderLayout gives East and West panels their PreferredSize and rest of the space to Center panel. So with a bit of easy calculations I can manipulate size of each of three panels painlessly. I also added dividers(originally just JPanel components with fixed size) to West and East panels(their size is also considered while calculating). For dynamic resize I handle dragging events on this dividers and recalculate panel sizes. Refreshing is done with following snippet: container.setVisible(false); container.revalidate(); container.repaint(); container.setVisible(true); I'd like to put this code somewhere to be available for others, but don't know where exactly to do this. So if you know such place, please point me to it in the comments.
