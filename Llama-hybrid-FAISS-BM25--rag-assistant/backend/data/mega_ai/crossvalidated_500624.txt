Yes, you are fine. Please note that all your categorical vectors will have their first level absorbed within the intercept $\beta_0$ , therefore take note of the way the encoding of dummy variables is done. I would say that if anything your notation lends itself nicely to group lasso regularisation; standard lasso solution would only select individual dummy variables instead of whole factors. (check Meier et al.(2007) The group lasso for logistic regression for more information on that aspect.) If you are starting and have some queries about notations, standard textbooks on the use of matrices in Statistics are: Matrix Algebra Useful for Statistics by Searle and Matrix Algebra From a Statistician's Perspective by Harvill. Both are consider classics on the matter and you can use them as well-accepted references. (I also like: Matrix Algebra: Theory, Computations, and Applications in Statistics by Gentle, I have used it a lot).
