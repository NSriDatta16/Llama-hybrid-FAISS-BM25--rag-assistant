Fitting ARIMA model with seasonal data with very long period

I have the following time series: As you can see, there is a seasonal factor (those are daily data with a sampling frequency of 1 minute). Which we can see in this acf plot (4 days worth of data): I want to fit an ARIMA model on this data, but should I care of the seasonal component first (the data is stationary)? In R, the arima function does not support a period exceeding 350. Thank you all!
