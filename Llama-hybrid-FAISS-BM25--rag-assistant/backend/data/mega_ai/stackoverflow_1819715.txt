How do I change the amount of text a nested tag encompasses using jQuery?

What I'm trying to do is to take paragraph containing a link, e.g.: this is a link to something ... and modify it with jQuery so the link contains all the paragraph text, e.g.: this is a link to something I can't seem to get my head around this at the mo. Cheers, James
