How to test whether average of ten independent correlations is different from zero?

I have calculated the correlation between A and B for 10 different subjects. For averaging purposes, I've converted the r-values to z-values using Fisher's z-transformation. subj zvalue s1 -0.04 s2 -0.14 s3 -0.29 s4 -0.20 s5 -0.37 s6 -0.01 s7 -0.09 s8 0.20 s9 -0.15 s10 0.09 I want to test if the correlation between A and B is significantly different from zero. Do I use a paired sample t-test against 0 with the z-values, then report the r-value converted from the mean z-value? Or should I convert each subject's z-value back to an r-value before doing the t-test? Edit: Critically, is a paired t-test against 0 appropriate to test if this correlation is significant across subjects?
