What does the 'ar' parameter in arima.sim represent?

I want to generate a time series that follows an AR(1) process and thus has a certain overall level of autocorrelation. I'm using the arima.sim function (which is implemented as standard in R). I thought that for example the following command: arima.sim(model=list(Ar=-0.5),n=400) would generate a time series of length 400 and an autocorrelation of -0.5. However, I've noticed that the values you can give to the Ar parameter are not limited to [-1; 1]. For example, you could input 10 000 . Can anyone explain to me what the Ar parameter actually represents? Because it apparently is not a correlation coefficient. After reading on the internet it seems to me that there's not a lot of information there for people who want to simulate time series data using a model as opposed to people who want to fit data to a model.
