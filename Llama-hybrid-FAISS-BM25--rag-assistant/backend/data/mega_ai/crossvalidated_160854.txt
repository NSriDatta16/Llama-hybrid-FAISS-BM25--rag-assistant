It's often poorly explained. First of all, it's presented in terms of a 4D tensor, but one dimension is just the batch dimension for processing multiple images at a time, you can ignore it for the purpose of understanding the convolution. So images in a traditional CNN are three dimensional, channels x height x width The filters are four dimensional and have the structure: input_channels x height x width x output_channels. You can think of them as several (#output_channels of them) 3D linear filters applied to the image. In this image, the green box is a filter, it convolves by "gliding" in the x and y axis, but its height (#input_channels) is the same as the number of channels in the image, and so it does not move in that direction. There are #output_channels such boxes which end up producing the channels of the next layer.
