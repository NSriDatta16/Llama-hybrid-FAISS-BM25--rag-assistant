There's a question in the JQuery forum about it . It's not resolved at the time of writing, but may have more information in the future. EDIT: It was answered on the forum: I recommend you use the simulate plugin which is what jQuery UI uses for unit testing drag and drop: https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/external/jquery-simulate/jquery.simulate.js You can see examples of use by looking at the unit tests https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/draggable/core.js https://github.com/jquery/jquery-ui/blob/master/tests/unit/draggable/events.js Thanks to rdworth for that.
