Your complex type "text-with-layout-type" contains an "any" tag. This means that JAXB needs to be able to handle any type of data, therefore it typed the data as Object. With the code as is you will need to leverage getClass() or instanceof to figure out the type. If you have a particular way you want this property to look then let me know through an update to the question and we can discuss alternative mappings to enable that behaviour.
