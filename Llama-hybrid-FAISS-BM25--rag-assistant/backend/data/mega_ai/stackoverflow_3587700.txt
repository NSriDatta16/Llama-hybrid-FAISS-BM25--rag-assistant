You can use iconv for the string replacement... $string = iconv('UTF-8', 'ASCII//TRANSLIT//IGNORE', $string); Basically, it'll transliterate the characters it can, and drop those it can't (that are not in the ASCII character set)... Then, just replace the spaces with str_replace : $string = str_replace(' ', '-', $string); Or, if you want to get fancy, you can replace all consecutive white-space characters with a single dash using a simple regex: $string = preg_replace('/\\s+/', '-', $string); Edit As @Robert Ros points out, you need to set the locale prior to using iconv (Depending on the defaults of your system). Just execute this line prior to the iconv line: setlocale(LC_CTYPE, 'en_US.UTF8');
