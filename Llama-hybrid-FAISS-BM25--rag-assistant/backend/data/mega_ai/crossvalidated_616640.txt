I ended up buying "An Introduction to Bayesian Inference, Methods and Computation" by Nick Heard which I felt that it describes the theory quite nice (although some computations become really long). For practical ideas I first read "Probabilistic Programming and Bayesian Methods for Hackers" (see link above).
