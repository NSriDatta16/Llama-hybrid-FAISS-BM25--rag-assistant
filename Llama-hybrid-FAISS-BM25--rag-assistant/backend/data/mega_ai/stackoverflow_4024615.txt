How to achieve this effect with AS3

A client has asked for a spinning wheel as part of their navigation. The user is faced with the edge of the wheel with the various navigation items on there, and they spin it with a click/drag of their mouse. Whatever it stops on is what page they are presented with. The only example of this I could find to help illustrate what I want is on this website . I have no idea where to even begin with this effect. Is there anyone who could offer some assistance. I don't need code as I'm quite good with ActionScript 3, I just need a discussion about the way to do it as I'm stuck here. Cheers, Dan
