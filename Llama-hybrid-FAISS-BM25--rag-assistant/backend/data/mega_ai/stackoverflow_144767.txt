What are essential topics to have in a Web Services (semester) course?

I am in the process of designing a Web Services course for students in an Information Technology program. Some students stop after getting a two-year associates degree, but other students in the program go on to a four-year bachelor's degree. This course would be for students going on to the four-year degree. My initial thoughts for the course would be that it would cover: Some simple database concepts, with enough command line practice to allow students to create simple relational database backends. Enough PHP so students can create a web-interface that allows user to enter new data into the database backend, edit data in the database, and display fixed views of the database. Basic security practices for PHP and web services in general. Writing a barebones content management system using PHP and a database backend. Learning about and using existing content management software such as Zope/Plone or Drupal. Discuss feasibility of using existing content management software to provide ADA section 508 compliance for web pages. Contrast this with coming up with a simple framework to make ADA compliant pages using PHP. Our semesters are 16 weeks long. Are there other topics that you cover instead of the ones listed? If you had a chance to design such a course, what would be the most pragmatic things to cover? Edit: Based on the initial response, it is clear that the title of my question is misleading. It should be web programming instead of web services. The students taking this course will have already taken at least one programming course. The students would have all taken a course in Python. The Python course they take includes writing an XML parser that produces HTML with CSS. This course would also cover HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. XML would also be used (parsing XML using PHP, and possibly using converting XML into PHP code). Some of the students will also have taken an introductory course in Java, but that course will not cover JSP.
