TinyMCE Textarea Change Not Recognized by ASP.NET CodeBehind

I have several elements on a page. On load, I populate them (through the VB code behind), and then turn them into TinyMCE editors (through the jQuery TinyMCE plugin). Each text box also has a button associated with it, with the purpose of submitting the text back to the code behind for insertion into a database. I discovered earlier that when the submit button is clicked, I have to "save" the contents of the editor to the text box, but that is not my problem. Even after I've done so, the edits are not showing up in the code behind. As I've mentioned, I'm using jQuery. Here is my click handler. Keep in mind that all buttons are submit buttons in ASP.NET, hence the submit class: $('input.submit').live('click', function() { tinyMCE.EditorManager.triggerSave(); }); So, when any submit button is clicked all tinyMCE editors have their save event triggered. After this is executed, I have checked the value of the textarea I'm looking for, (again, through JavaScript) and it seems to have the edits (I'm using Chrome's Developer tools, and console.log): console.log($(this).parent().find('textarea').val()); On the server side, though, I see none of the edits in the click handler for the submit button: Dim paragraph As String = Me.myTextArea.Text ' Results in the original text, not the edited text Other Notes: Each editor is in its own update panel Due to the nature of the content being submitted (HTML), I've had to set EnableEventValidation="false" and ValidateRequest="false" (this is an internal application, and this recommendation came from a more experienced developer) I'm fairly new to .NET, but this behavior just seems ridiculous to me. I must be missing something critical.
