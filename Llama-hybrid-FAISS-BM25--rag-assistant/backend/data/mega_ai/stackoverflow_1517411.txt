How to run every script in a directory except itself?

I have a folder full of *.command files on my OS X workstation. (For those that don't know, *.command files are just shell scripts that launch and run in a dedicated Terminal window). I've dragged this folder onto my Dock to use a "stack" so I can access and launch these scripts conveniently via a couple clicks. I want to add a new "run-all.command" script to the stack that runs all the *.command files in the same stack with the obvious exception of itself. My Bash chops are too rusty to recall how you get a list of the *.command files, iterate them, skip the file that's running, and execute each (in this case I'd be using the "open" command so each *.command opens in its own dedicated Terminal window). Can somebody please help me out?
