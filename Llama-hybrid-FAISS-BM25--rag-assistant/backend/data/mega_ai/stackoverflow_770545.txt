Given a choice between rsh and telnet via expect , I would chose rsh . Expect scripts are fragile. All it takes to break one is someone changing the value of PS1 on the remote machine. Using rsh also prepares you for the day you will finally enter the '90s and start using ssh (since you can mostly just change rcp to scp and rsh to ssh and everything still works).
