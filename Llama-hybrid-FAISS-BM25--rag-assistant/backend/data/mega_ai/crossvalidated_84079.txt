Alternatives to Hypothesis Testing in R

I've been reading a number of articles and blog posts about issues relating to hypothesis testing. While these sources seem to put forth legit problems with hypothesis testing and it's interpretations, I'm not seeing anything in terms of alternatives to it (beyond bayesian hypothesis testing). What are some alternative to hypothesis testing in R? Problems with the hypothesis testing approach So-called Bayesian hypothesis testing is just as bad as regular hypothesis testing Alternatives to Statistical Hypothesis Testing EDIT: For example, let's consider the following situation. We have monthly data for one year where conversions_a is the control and conversions_b is the experimental data for conversion when using a different headline. df = data.frame(year_one_a = 1:12, conversions_a = rnorm(12), year_one_b = 1:12, conversions_b = rnorm(12)+5)
