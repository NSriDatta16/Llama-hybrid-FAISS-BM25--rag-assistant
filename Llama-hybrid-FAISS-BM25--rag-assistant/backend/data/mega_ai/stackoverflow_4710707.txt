My suggestion is to use value converters when the type being used by the view is view-specific, for example, if you are converting an enumeration of White and Black from your model into a Brush to be used for a background. In this case the converter is now part of your view. On the other hand, if you only need to reorganize the data structure or expose different properties, and all the resulting types are not view-specific, then I recommend using another view-model property or another view-model altogether. This would still be reusable if you were to switch to a different view framework.
