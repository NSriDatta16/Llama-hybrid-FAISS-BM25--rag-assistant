I am developing WPF application, with severals drag and drop support. In my application has several controls: listView_A, listView_B, and radioButtons. my drag and drop works if I drag item from listView_A -> listView_B, listView_A -> radioButtons etc. But I am unable to drag file from windows to all of these controls (listview and radiobuttons), it just display a "no entry" cursor. All of the controls has "AllowDrop" set to True. I had tried all options I had, please help.
