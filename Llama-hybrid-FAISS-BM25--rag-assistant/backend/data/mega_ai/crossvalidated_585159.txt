Deviance statistic vs Wald test

I have a question. I have run a logistic regression model with 5(X1,..., X5) continuous predictors. The predictor with the highest coefficient is X2, but the predictor that reduces the most deviance is X3 (no matter the order of the predictors in the model). How is that possible?
