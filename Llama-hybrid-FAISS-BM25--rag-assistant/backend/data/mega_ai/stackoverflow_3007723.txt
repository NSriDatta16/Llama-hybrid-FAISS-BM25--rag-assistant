Psyco does not speed up compilation (in fact, it would slow it down). However, if your problem is compilation speed in Python, there are some serious problems with your code. If you are trying to improve runtime performance, Psyco does work with 32bit operating systems and Python version 2.5. The latest version is the first Google result for Psyco: http://psyco.sourceforge.net/ Psyco is no longer an "interesting" project as Python 3.x has gained Unladen Swallow, and most of the developer attention is divided between that and PyPy. There are other ways of improving performance, not limited to Cython and Shed Skin
