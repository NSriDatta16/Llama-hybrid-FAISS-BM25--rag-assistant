Except estimation and testing, is there something else to statistics?

Statistical methods can be used for hypothesis testing in various forms, such as null hypothesis testing. They can also be used to estimate the value of some parameter plus an uncertainty of that value, be it using standard errors, confidence intervals, or credible intervals. Both of these goals can be achieved with some philosophical differences using frequentist or Bayesian methods. My question is, is there something else besides testing or estimation, that statistical methods are used for?
