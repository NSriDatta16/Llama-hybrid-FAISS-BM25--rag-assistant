git group development server setup

I want to deploy git for my organisation. I want users to have no access to the server and to make commits only to the repository. However I want the repository to be a real file system that I can use with an apache virtual host. What I have done is the following: cd /home/vhosts git init --shared {projectname} git config receive.denyCurrentBranch ignore I then want to run git reset --hard after every push back to the main repository. Is this a good idea? Should I have a second repository that does a git pull instead of a git reset --hard ... which is heavier? Can I set this up to be a hook ?? Thanks.
