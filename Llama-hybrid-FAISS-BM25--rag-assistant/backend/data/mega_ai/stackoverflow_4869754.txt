no suitable conversion function from "std::string" to "PVOID" exists

I am trying to use the SetParametersInfo function to change wallpapers.I would like to pass the filepath for the wallpaper as a variable, but whenever I try to do this, I get the error Error: no suitable conversion function from "std::string" to "PVOID" exists Here is the code I have thus far #include #include #include #include #pragma comment(lib, "user32.lib") using namespace std; #define _TEXT(x) L##x void main(){ string input =""; cout Do you guys have any suggestions for what I can do? I have looked all over to find a solution and haven't been able to find one. Perhaps I am not searching for the right terms. Extra info: I am running Windows 7 and using Visual Studio 2010 Ultimate. Edit: I finally got it to work. I had to change the "Character Set" setting to "Not Set" then it worked fine. Here is the updated code: #include #include #include #include #pragma comment(lib, "user32.lib") using namespace std; void main(){ string input =""; cout
