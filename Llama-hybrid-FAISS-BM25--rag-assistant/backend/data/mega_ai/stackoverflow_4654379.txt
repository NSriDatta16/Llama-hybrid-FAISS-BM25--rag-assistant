How to connect multiple external databases in Magento?

I need to connect to some external databases from Magento. I found one tutorial to Create an external database connection in Magento . This tutorial was helpful and it worked for connecting to one external database. But, I have to connect more than one external databases. How can I connect to more than one external databases (suppose 5 external databases) in Magento?
