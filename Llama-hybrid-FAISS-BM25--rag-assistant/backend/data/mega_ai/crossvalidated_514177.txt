I would change the problem slightly: $i$ = butterfly observation $j$ = butterfly class (A,B,C) $X_{i,j}$ = subjective probability that a butterfly is in class $j$ that is recorded by the observer $i$ $\rho$ = vector of true proportion of butterflies in the observation area of each class $\alpha_i$ vector of dirichlet parameters for butterfly $i$ Assume that $X_i \sim dirichlet(\alpha_i)$ so that $\alpha_i$ describes the underlying distribution of the recorded observations. Each butterfly might have a different $\alpha_i$ describing the difficulty of classifying that particular butterfly. In other words, if multiple people tried to classify that same butterfly and they all recorded probabilities of classes then their observations would form a dirichlet distribution. We only see one set of probabilities per butterfly. Now, to simplify, assume that all the $\alpha_i$ are coming from the same underlying distribution which is centered on the $\rho$ . As a Bayesian, you can put a prior on $\alpha$ and then update using MCMC $X_i \sim dirichlet(\alpha)$ As a frequentist, you can get the dirichlet distribution estimates directly. $\bar{X_j} = \alpha_j / \sum \alpha_j$ $s^2_{X_1} = \frac{z_1 (1 - z_1)}{1 + \sum \alpha_j}$ where $z_1 = \alpha_1 / \sum \alpha_j$ Note: you only need the second equation for one of the classes $j$ .
