I'm sure you could use the stop event to gain access to the recently dragged item, i.e.: $('.selector').draggable({ stop: function(event, ui) { $(event.target).addClass('justDragged'); } }); If you wish to see all functions/variables bound to event, you could use the following: var str = ''; for (i in event) { str += i + ', '; } alert(str); This should give you a good indication of what's available to you in any number of jQuery callback params.
