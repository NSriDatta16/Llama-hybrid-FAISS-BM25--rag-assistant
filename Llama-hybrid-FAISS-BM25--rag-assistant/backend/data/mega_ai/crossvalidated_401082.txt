This does not directly get at your question, but since you seem to be ultimately interested in controlling for this change in your main ITS model, have you considered applying a time-varying covariate approach by interacting monthly amount of contact with your "time since the start of the study" variable, perhaps only in the post-intervention period (if you only found an effect on the slope in the main model)? Then you will be able to test the significance of those variables and would not have to worry about how you've specified the change. So, if the original ITS model (without any covariates or random effects) took the form of: $$ Y_{t} = \beta _{0} + \beta _{1}T_{t} + \beta _{2}X_{t} + \beta _{3}X_{t}T_{t} + \epsilon _{t} $$ where $Y_{t}$ was monthly level of adverse outcome, $T_{t}$ was the time since the start of the study, $X_{t}$ was a dummy representing pre- and post-intervention periods, and $X_{t}T_{t}$ was the interaction term, the modified model that tested whether change in contact moderated the values of $\beta _{2}$ (change in the level of the outcome) and $\beta _{3}$ (difference in slopes of the outcome) would be this: $$ Y_{t} = \beta _{0} + \beta _{1}T_{t} + \beta _{2}X_{t} + \beta _{3}X_{t}T_{t} + \beta _{4}X_{t}C_{t} + \beta _{5}X_{t}C_{t}T_{t} + \epsilon _{t} $$ where $C_{t}$ measured monthly amount of contact, $\beta _{4}$ tested the difference in pre- and post-intervention periods by average level of contact in the two periods, and $\beta _{5}$ tested if the difference in slopes varied by level of contact. If you wanted, you could define $C_{t}$ not as monthly amount of contact but as monthly change in contact (in absolute or relative terms).
