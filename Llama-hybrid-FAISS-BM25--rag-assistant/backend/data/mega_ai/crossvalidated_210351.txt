Discrepancy measure for bayesian beta model

I fitted a beta model with a vector of Jaccard similarities as response variable and a vector of euclidean distances as predictor variable in JAGS. I coded the model as follows: model { b0 ~ dnorm(0.0,0.001) b1 ~ dnorm(0.0,0.001) b2 ~ dnorm(0.0,0.001) b3 ~ dnorm(0.0,0.001) phi ~ dgamma(0.1,0.1) for (i in 1:n) { Y[i] ~ dbeta(alpha[i],beta[i]) alpha[i] Deviance and DIC are both resulting in negative values. And the discrepancy measures, resulted from the comparison among Pearson's Chi-square residuals, show a perfect fit, which I suspect are unreal. In addition, standard deviations, and standard errors for that instance are too narrow. I would be glad if someone could point me to the right direction in modeling this regression and obtaining proper measures of deviance, DIC, Bayes-p and Lack of Fit.
