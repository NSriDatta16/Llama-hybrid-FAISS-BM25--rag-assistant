DotNetOpenAuth does indeed reference PresentationFramework. It turns out that this assembly is useful for more than just WPF applications. Namely, it's Xaml serialization capability, and a feature was added to DNOA 3.2 that leverages this. However, DNOA can use it slightly differently so that I think it will avoid this error for you. So I've filed Issue 119 on your behalf so that DNOA 3.2.1 will hopefully resolve this issue for you. In the meantime, you might try uploading PresentationFramework to your web site's Bin directory to see if that alleviates the problem.
