Why do these two jar files with identical contents have different file sizes?

I am reorganizing our java code base and wanted to compare our resultant jar files. When I build in the old source tree, I get a jar file size of 3360081. In the new source tree it is 3360128. I do a "jar tvf jarfile" and then strip the dates out of the file. The listing looks like this: 0 Mon Mar 16 10:41:16 EDT 2009 META-INF/ 102 Mon Mar 16 10:41:14 EDT 2009 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF 0 Mon Mar 16 10:41:14 EDT 2009 decodes/ After I strip the dates, the listing looks like this: 0 META-INF/ 102 META-INF/MANIFEST.MF 0 decodes/ The two jar listings are identical. What would cause a 47 byte difference in "identical" jar files? I am running the compile on RedHat Linux 4.
