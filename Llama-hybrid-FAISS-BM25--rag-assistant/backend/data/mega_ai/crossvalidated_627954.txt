Bayesian equivalent of the frequentist test of equal or given proportions

I am interested in comparing the prevalence of common mental disorders (CMDs) such as posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), anxiety, and depression. I would like to know whether the prevalence I obtained (Prev. 1) calculated with High * 100 / N is statistically different from the prevalence obtained by the WHO (Prev. 2). I have the following table where N, Low, and High are dummy data generated with some R code ( Prev 2 (%) numbers are real, though; WHO, 2017, 2013): N Low High Prev. 1 (%) Prev. 2 (%) X.Squared df p.Value PTSD 331 164 167 50.45 3.6 2080.279 1 0 ANX 313 157 156 49.84 4.4 1525.655 1 0 DEP 324 168 156 48.15 3.6 1839.970 1 0 The frequentist calculations involved is the test of equal or given proportion. What is the Bayesian equivalent of that test? For reproducibility purposes, please find the R code used to generate the table above: # Set the seed for reproducibility set.seed(123) # Generate random data n $PTSD) = expss::num_lab("1 Low 2 High") expss::val_lab(df$ ANX) = expss::num_lab("1 Low 2 High") expss::val_lab(df$DEP) = expss::num_lab("1 Low 2 High") # Create a list of tables for each variable to count 1s, 2s, and NAs count_results $PTSD, useNA = "ifany"), ANX = table(df$ ANX, useNA = "ifany"), DEP = table(df$DEP, useNA = "ifany") ) # Combine the count tables into a single table count_table $N Low + final_result$High final_result $Prevalence High / final_result$N * 100, 2) # Add the WHO column W_data $statistic) df_values parameter) p_values $X.Squared df References World Health Organization [WHO].
