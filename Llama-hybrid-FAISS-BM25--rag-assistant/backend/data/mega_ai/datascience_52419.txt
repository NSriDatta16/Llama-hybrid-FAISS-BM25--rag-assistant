How can I use a multivariable list of strings as a single X variable / feature in a Neural Network Model

Here is an example of what I am trying to do. I am using a bunch of X variables to predict a Y. X1 = Number of days since applying first medication X1.1 = Total times the medication should have been applied (calculated using frequency in prescription) X1.2 = Total times the medication was applied (calculated) X2 = Number of days since applying first medication X2.1 = Total times the medication should have been applied (calculated using frequency in prescription) X2.2 = Total times the medication was applied (calculated) X3 = Number of days since applying first medication X3.1 = Total times the medication should have been applied (calculated using frequency in prescription) X3.2 = Total times the medication was applied (calculated) Y = Skin clear 0 / 1 I have some sample data as below: Now, the X1.1 and 1.2 are descriptive of X1. As a separate input to the Neural Network, they are meaningless. I am trying to find, how I can tell the model that X1, X1.1 and X1.2 together is a single input with multiple dimensions. I use the below code: classifier = Sequential() classifier.add(Dense(units = 14, kernel_initializer = 'uniform', activation = 'relu', input_dim = 27)) classifier.add(Dense(units = 14, kernel_initializer = 'uniform', activation = 'relu')) classifier.add(Dense(units = 1, kernel_initializer = 'uniform', activation = 'sigmoid')) classifier.compile(optimizer = 'adam', loss = 'binary_crossentropy', metrics = ['accuracy']) classifier.fit(X_train, y_train, batch_size = 25, epochs = 500) Any help will be really appreciated.
