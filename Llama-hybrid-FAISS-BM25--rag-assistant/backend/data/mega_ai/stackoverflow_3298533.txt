I have evaluated many ORM modellers and code generators over the years, none of them gave me the code I wanted. Over the last few years in my spare time I have created my own stored procedure and C# code generator. The generator is very intuitive to use and generates CRUD stored procedures, Data Components, Business components and Business Entities. The generated code uses SqlDataReaders for it's data retrieval and no reflection. It will even generate a n-Unit test project. Caching support is available through business objects as well as IoC for Data Components. Performance benchmarks comparing it to the ADO.NET Entity Framework and Linq to SQL can be found on the site.
