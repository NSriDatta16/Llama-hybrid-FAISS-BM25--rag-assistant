How can I "catch" a subview during a swipe gesture on an iOS device?

I'm building an iOS board game (similar to scrabble or words) that involves moving around little tiles on the screen and I'm finding the user sometimes has a hard time touching and moving the tiles around because they're too small. Due to the design of the game, I can't increase the size of the tiles, so I've had to implement some little tricks that make touching and moving the tiles easier for the user and they work well. The only issue that remains is the user sometimes touches just barely outside the tile and when the user tries to move it, the tile stays where it is. I have two ideas for how I can fix this... If a tile isn't touched when the user touches the screen, I can use the parent view's touch location to find the closest tile to the touch location and somehow forward the touch event to that tile's view. If a tile isn't touched when the user touches the screen, I can somehow "catch" the tile when the user drags their finger over it as they attempt to move it. I'd prefer to implement solution #2 since solution #1 has too many problems associated with, not to mention solution #2 is a more realistic experience. That said, how can I "catch" a tile when the user drags their finger over it and send it touch events to move it where the finger is? Currently, my tiles are implemented as subclasses of the UIView and they handle the touch events (touchesBegain, touchesMoved, and touchesEnded) directly. So if the user touches just barely outside the view and drags their finger over the view, it doesn't receive any of the touch events since it didn't receive the initial touchesBegan event. Thanks in advance for all your wisdom!
