Local ASP.NET MVC Suddenly Very Slow; Load times > 1 minute

Over the last few weeks I've been subject to a sudden and significant performance deterioration when browsing locally hosted ASP.NET 3.5 MVC web applications (C#). Load times for a given page are on average 20 seconds (regardless of content); start up is usually over a minute. These applications run fast on production and even test systems (Test system is comparable to my development environment). I am running IIS 6.0, VS2008, Vista Ultimate, SQL2005, .NET 3.5, MVC 1.0, and we use VisualSVN 1.7. My SQL DB is local and IPv6 does not seem to be the cause. I browse in Firefox and IE8 outside of Debug mode using loopback, machine name, and 'localhost' and get the exact same results every time (hence DNS doesn't seem to be the issue either). Below are screen shots of my dotTrace output. http://www.glowfoto.com/static_image/28-100108L/3123/jpg/06/2010/img4/glowfoto This issue has made it near impossible to debug/test any web app. Any suggestions very much appreciated! SOLUTION: Complete re-installation of Windows, IIS, Visual Studio, etc. It wasn't the preferred solution, but it worked.
