This depends on your target PC hardware. If your application uses too much memory then it will be slow while windows pages. TEST! Try both options in your compromise, and some in between if it makes sense. Run the tests on a typical machine that your users would use and with a sensible number of other applications open. So for most people that is Outlook and probably an instance or 2 of Internet Explorer (or the mail client/browser of your choice). I work in an organistion where uses of my application are also likely to be running some other custom applications so we test with those running as well. We have found that our application used too much memory, and makes switching application painfully slow so we have slowed our application slightly to reduce its memory usage. If you are interested our target hardware was originally 512Mb machines becuase that was what our common standard spec workstation was. Several PC's had to be upgraded to 1Gb though becuase of this application. We have now trimmed its RAM usage a bit but it is written in VB .NET and most of the memory used seems to be the framework. PerfMon says the process is using aroung 200Mb (peak) but that the managed heap is only around 2Mb!
