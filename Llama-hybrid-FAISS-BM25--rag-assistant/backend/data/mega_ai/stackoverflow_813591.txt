How to get a weighted average for reviews in Excel?

So here's my challenge. I have a spreadsheet that looks like this: prod_id | pack | value | durable | feat | ease | grade | # of ratings 1 75 85 99 90 90 88 1 2 90 95 81 86 87 88 9 3 87 86 80 85 82 84 37 4 92 80 68 67 45 70 5 5 93 81 94 93 90 90 4 6 93 70 60 60 70 70 1 Each product has individual grade criteria (packaging - ease of use), an overall average grade, and number of ratings the product received. The entire data set I have places 68% of the products within the 80-89 grade range. I need to have the grades recalculated to take into account the number of ratings for the product, so products that fall far below the total average number of ratings are ranked lower (and receive a lower grade). Basically a product with a grade of 84 and 100 ratings should rank higher than a product with a grade of 95 with only 5 ratings. I hope this makes sense, thanks for any help in advance!
