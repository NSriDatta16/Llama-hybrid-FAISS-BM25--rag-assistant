Why the one-step prediction error in state space models are mutually independent?

I am reading the book "Time series analysis by state space methods" by J.Durbin and S.J. Koopman (second edition). On page 17, the book says, for local level models, the probability of one-step prediction error (of Kalman filter) $v_t$ at time $t$ is equal to the probability of observation $y_t$ at time $t$ conditioned on the previous observations. That is $p(v_t)=p(y_t|y_1,y_2,...,y_{t-1})$. This leads to that the prediction errors (or innovations) are mutually independent. But why the two probabilities are equal?
