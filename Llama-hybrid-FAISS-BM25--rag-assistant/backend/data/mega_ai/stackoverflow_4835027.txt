You do it using ssh's own tool: ssh-agent. $ eval $(ssh-agent) $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa $ ssh-add ~/.ssh/otherid_rsa Then you don't need ssh identify related anything in your .hgrc 's [ui] section at all. Alternately you could do: [ui] ssh = ssh -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa -i ~/.ssh/otherid_rsa -C but ssh-agent is useful in so many way's it's worth putting it your login scripts and calling it a day.
