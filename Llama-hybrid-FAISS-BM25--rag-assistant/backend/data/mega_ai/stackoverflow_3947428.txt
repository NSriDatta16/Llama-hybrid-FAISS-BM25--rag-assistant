How to read List<> passed to View via ViewData in ASP.Net MVC 2

I'm pretty new to ASP.Net MVC. I've created a model that fills a List<> with multiple custom objects called "Result". Then, in my controller, I get this List and put it into the ViewData. I am at a bit of a loss as to how to utilize this List in my view (aspx page). My first try was just to put ViewData["Results"] between the , but clearly this is not working, and I suspect I need to cast it somehow and also reference my original definition of the Result custom object. However, the aspx page does not really seem set-up for this type of coding...and there is no code-behind, and I've heard I'm supposed to keep the view "dumb". Most of the examples I've seen don't seem to cover this scenario of passing custom objects, just simple strings, etc. Can this be done elegantly using just the syntax? Do I need to create a code-behind page and handle it there? If so, how would one be created, as they are not provided by default.
