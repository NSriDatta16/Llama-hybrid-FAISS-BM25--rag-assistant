#pragma pack(x) can change the structure alignment restrictions on both GCC and MSVC. GCC uses the LP64 model for 64bit builds - which means longs and pointers are 64bits. You need to change to unsigned int for your 32bit fields, OR use and uint32_t and uint64_t for stable field sizes. #pragma pack(1) typedef struct{ unsigned long long offset; unsigned long long size; unsigned int type; unsigned int acpi; }memstruct; #pragma pack()
