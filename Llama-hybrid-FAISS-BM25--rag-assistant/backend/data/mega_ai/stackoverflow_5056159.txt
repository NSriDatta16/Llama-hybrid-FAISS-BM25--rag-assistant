MStest is installed only with Visual Studio, so like already was said. It's not bundled in Teamcity. Does the agent machine have VS installed? If you want to use that test framework runner then you need to have that. So that agent says that because it's not there. If that's a problem use nunit which Teamcity does come bundled with.
