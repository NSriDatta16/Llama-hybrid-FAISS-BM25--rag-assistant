The fact that you catch double-free bugs in D2007, even though it does appear to work fine in this version, means that you NEED to fix those because you are merely lucky that the D2007 version does not need to recycle the memory as aggressively as the D2009 version and the bugs do not show up due to "shadow persistence" in memory. I would use FastMM fulldebugmode to find the bad code and fix it as much as possible, then follow Barry's advice to trouble shoot memory usage. For how to use the features of the Integrated Debugger, and how to log info from non breaking breakpoints, you may want to look at this CodeRage 3 session: Delphi Debugging for Dummies
