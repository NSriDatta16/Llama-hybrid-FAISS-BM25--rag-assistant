TortoiseSVN - How to revert files marked for delete?

I was reorganizing some projects by copying (not moving) some folders under version control to a new structure. After that all my original files are marked for delete! I can't find any alternative to unmark them for delete. Added files have the option to "Revert Add", but nothing for deleted. I have tried "update" and "clean-up" but they refuse... // thanks.
