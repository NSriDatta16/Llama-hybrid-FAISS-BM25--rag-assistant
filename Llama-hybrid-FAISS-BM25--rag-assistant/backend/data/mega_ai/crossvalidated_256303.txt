PCA and K-means separation not precise for my data. What statistical method should I use?

I have a data set of 126 different protein parameters(X-variables)and 244 different CD proteins. I wanted test if PCA and K-means clustering could separate my 244 proteins into two different clusters ( Enzymes and binding proteins). Here is my result from PCA and K-means. ( I used their actual function to find out if the separation was accurate or not. I used K=3 because it was able to cluster the data more accurately than K=2 in k-means. However, the separation is not very accurate. We can see a cluster of enzymes ( 3 on the score plot), but there are many enzymes that are placed into number 2 and 1 clusters and vice versa. In that situation, Are there any methods that could determine how good my model is in predicting the result correctly? It seems to me that is is not very accurate. What kind of statistical method would be appropriate for my data to predict the function of protein, Enzyme or non-enzyme?
