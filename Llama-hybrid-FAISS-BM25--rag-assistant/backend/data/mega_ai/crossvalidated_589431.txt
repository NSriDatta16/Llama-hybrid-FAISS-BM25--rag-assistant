The probability will not hit 0% or 100% exactly, it approaches them asymptotically. The uncertainty increases towards the extremes, which you will see if you include confidence intervals in your plot. For these reasons, this is probably less of a problem than you think. But to answer your question: yes, there are alternatives to logistic regression. Probit regression is one, though it may actually be worse given your concerns, because the curve will approach the extremes more rapidly than with the logistic. GAMs can be used for binary data too . And even simpler, you can just use a moving-window mean .
