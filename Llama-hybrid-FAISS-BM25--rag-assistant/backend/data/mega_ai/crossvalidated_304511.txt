Can a random forest be used to predict all data in a sample?

I would like to create predictions for all outcomes in my sample of data. Typically with a random forest you would split the data in order to train on one part and predict on the other part. Is there any possible way to train the forest and predict on to that same data without the predictions being biased? I have been using SAS HP procedures and python Scikit-learn RandomForestClassifier, but have had little luck.
