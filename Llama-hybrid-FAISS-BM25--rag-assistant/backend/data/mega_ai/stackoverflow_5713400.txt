Changing not yet supported. this is a paragraph this is a new line XSL: 0"> So far so good. There are no problems for .. and ... lines. But third line has child node which is a . And somehow "paragraph" is the only text which is displayed, for this line. I have a mistake in choose statement. But I cannot figure it out. Thanks P.S : ht namespace is defined in xsl-stylesheet tag and it is 'xmlns:ht="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml"' P.S : What I try to do is, making it possible to apply html tags, styles on my specific xml nodes
