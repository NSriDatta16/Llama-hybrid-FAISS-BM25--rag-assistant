How to cross validate stepwise logistic regression?

I have a conceptual problem understanding how to cross validate stepwise logistic regression. Every time the training set is divided it is very likely that different features are chosen based on the the penter and premove criteria. Should I cross validate using different chosen model every time or Should I find a ground truth and proceed with cross validating over that? I think the latter sounds more reasonable, but I fear that somewhere I'm compromising the test blindness. Help is appreciated.
