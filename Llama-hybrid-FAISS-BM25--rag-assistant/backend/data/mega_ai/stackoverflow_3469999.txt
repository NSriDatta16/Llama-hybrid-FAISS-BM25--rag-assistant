Magento Column not found: Unknown column 'order_created_at' when accessing Sales Shipment API

Will appreciate any ideas on this error in Magento 1.4.1.1. I wonder why this happens but Magento 1.4.0 and Magento 1.3.2.4 works fine. The error is caused by accessing Magento Sales Shipment List API with "order_created_at filter. This filter worked in previous versions but with this version it fails. I wonder why this could happen. Also see Magento Issue for reference: http://www.magentocommerce.com/bug-tracking/issue/?issue=9556 there are some details of request sent to Magento webservice. Here is the actual request: bbb778755d046129c1c5df1cf4f0b119 order_created_at gt 2010-07-08 Here is the response: SQLSTATE[42S22]: Column not found: 1054 Unknown column 'order_created_at' in 'where clause'
