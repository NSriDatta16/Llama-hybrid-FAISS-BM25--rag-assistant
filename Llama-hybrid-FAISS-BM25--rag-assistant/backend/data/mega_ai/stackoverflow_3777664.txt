You could certainly do this with a neural network - I could easily see learning the correct state transitions for a given piece of bytecode. Input could be something like: Value at top of stack Value in current accumulator Byte code at current instruction pointer Byte value at current data pointer Previous flags Output could be something like: Change to instruction pointer Change to data pointer Change to accumulator Stack operation (push, pop, or nothing) Memory operation (read to accumulator, write accumulator or nothing) New flags However - I'm not sure why you would want to do this in the first place. A neural network would be much less efficient (and potentially make mistakes unless you trained it well enough) compared to just executing the bytecode directly. You'd probably need to write an accurate bytecode evaluator anyway just to create enough training data.... Also, in my experience neural networks tend to be good at pattern recognition but very bad at learning logical operations (like binary addition or XORs) once you get beyond a certain scale (i.e. more than a few bits). So depending on the complexity of your instruction set, the network could take a very large amount of time to train.
