Yes, you can get the predicted probability that an observation is yes from a logistic regression model. If you have the estimated coefficients from your model fit, you can use those to get the predicted probabilities thusly: $$ \widehat{p(y_i=1)} = \frac{\exp(\hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_AA_i + \hat\beta_BB_i + \hat\beta_CC_i)}{1+\exp(\hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_AA_i + \hat\beta_BB_i + \hat\beta_CC_i)} $$
