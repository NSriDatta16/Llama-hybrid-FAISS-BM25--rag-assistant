XML DocumentWriter - Stop empty elements appearing over two lines in .NET

I am using the XML document object in VB.NET to manipulate XML. My application creates a new XML fragment and updates the XML via the innerXML method: reasonFrag.InnerXml = String.Format(" {0} ", reason) This produces the correct XML output on most occasions, e.g. reason If the reason string is empty I get element spanning two lines in the XML as follows: I am looking for a way of keeping the element on a single line while maintaining the same format, e.g. The alternative is not acceptable (third party application wont accept it). Thanks Steven
