Disclaimer: I don't know what Facebook's API looks like, but I'm assuming it involves sending HTTP requests to their servers. I am also not 100% sure on your question. You can do that with the classes in the System.Net namespace, specifically WebRequest and WebResponse : using System.Net; using System.IO; ... HttpWebRequest req = WebRequest.Create("http://apiurl.com?args=go.here"); req.UserAgent = "The name of my program"; WebResponse resp = req.GetResponse(); string responseData = null; using(TextReader reader = new StreamReader(resp.GetResponseStream())) { responseData = reader.ReadToEnd(); } //do whatever with responseData You could put that in a method for easy access.
