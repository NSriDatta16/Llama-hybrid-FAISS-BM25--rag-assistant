Use exotic font-styles in AS3 styleSheet with CS5 new font embedding

I have some dynamic swf that used to retrieve its dynamic text values from an external .xml & style values from an external .css. Since FlashCS5 and its new font embedding technique, i can't find how to use exotic style anymore. Like for the font-family "HelveticaNeue LT Std", I want to use the style "45 Light" or "65 Medium", "85 Heavy"... But in my css, it seems i only have "font-family" support. And font-weight is either normal/bold & font-style is normal/italic. Is there a way to name my fonts like "HelveticaNeue45Light" & use this in my external css ?
