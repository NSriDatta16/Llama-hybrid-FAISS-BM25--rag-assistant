The one is general formula the other you get for Beta=1: The beta value greater than 1 means we want our model to pay more attention to the model Recall as compared to Precision. On the other, a value of less than 1 puts more emphasis on Precision. So you just want to generalise, and punish certain mistakes more. So to conclude: Correct in mathematical sense is always to generalise and derive special cases, in that sense the first one is preferable since setting beta to one you get the 'standard' F-1-harmonic-mean-formula. http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.fbeta_score.html
