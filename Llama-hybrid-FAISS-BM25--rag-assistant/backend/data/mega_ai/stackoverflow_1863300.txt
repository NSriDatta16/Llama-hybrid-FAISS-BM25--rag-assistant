What you could do is hook an XSL transformer to a SAX input source. Your processing will be sequential and the XSL preprocessor will make an attempt to catch the input as it comes to fiddle it into whatever result you specified. You can use this to pull a path's value out of the stream. This would come in especially handy if you wanted to produce a bunch of different XPATH results in one pass. You'll get (typically) an XML document as a result, but you could pull your expected output out of, say, a StreamResult with not too much hassle.
