Looking for an Elegant "Dont Show Me This Dialog Again" Dialog in C#

I've been looking for a dialog with a checkbox "Don's show me this dialog again" in C#. I googled and search a lot, but I just could not find an elegant solution. The dialog should work as similar as the native MessageBox.Show, but with a new property value (bool value) return to the caller. Thanks.
