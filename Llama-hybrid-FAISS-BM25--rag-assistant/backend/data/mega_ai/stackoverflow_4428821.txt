If you want to edit the form that is displayed when a task is added / edited, you should go for SharePoint designer instead of InfoPath and apply the required customizations to the relevant associated page of the targeted list (eg : newform.aspx) by playing with a dataform web part. Otherwise, you can create a user control and wrap it in a webpart to manage the task creation / edition the way you want. You can then place that webpart at the most relevant location(s). You can then make the "storage" list hidden so people will not fall back on the default form templates to add / edit items (unless they figure out the url, but you can remove all permissions and run with elevation if it's an issue).
