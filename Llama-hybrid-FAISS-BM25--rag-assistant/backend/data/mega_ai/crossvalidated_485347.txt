How to make sense of cluster with PCA which consist of more than two PCs?

I would need to use more than three principal components in order to have 80% information of my data set based on my plot below. Is there an effective way to do cluster analysis with more than three principal components? EDIT: Most of the examples on Internet are plots with just PCA1 vs PCA2 where the two components explains majority of the information. I don't believe that in commercial companies it is that easy.
