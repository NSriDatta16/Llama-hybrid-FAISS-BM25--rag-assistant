How do I determine if variables are correlated? Is it simply a mathematical calculation?

I'm self learning data science so bear with me as I try and make my question as clear as possible. Lets assume I have a dataset of a dependent variable y and some independent variables x1, x2 and x3 etc. Is the correlation between these variables simply a mathematical calculation? I mean if i ran a correlation test in R for example and the test came back with no correlation between the variables is that necessarily true? What if I knew or suspected that one of the variables is correlated to another how would I define that in my model or would relying on a correlation test be sufficient.
