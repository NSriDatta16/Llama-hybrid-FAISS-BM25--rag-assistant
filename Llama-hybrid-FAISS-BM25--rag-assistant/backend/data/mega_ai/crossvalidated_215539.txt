Study design using multinomial vs logistic regression?

Suppose that I have a categorical response variable that consists of group 1-3, and I hope to see if predictors can differentiate group 1 vs group 3 (group 2 not included). The response variable is ordered; for example groups are assigned based on blood pressure,heights, etc. One way is to fit a multinomial logistic regression and interpret the results, but what happens if I erase out group 2 variable and just fit a logistic regression using group 1 and group 3? I think the multinomial model makes sense, but I could not think of any drawbacks of using the binary model. Would the binary model be biased, or is it an incorrect study design? (One problem I faced when using the multinomial model is that I have tried to do feature selection using LASSO, but the model produces different sets of nonzero coefficients, and that's why I have leaning toward using logistic version. I don't want to compare group 1 vs group 2,3 or group 1,2 vs group 3)
