Looks like you found all of the Apple samples, so that's good. The Pragmatic Programmers have a book on Core Data , and several of the iPhone SDK books out (including theirs) touch on Core Data a little. See also this question . Edit: forgot to mention Three20 (the guts of the Facebook app, Open Sourced) as an example of a way to do this that isn't Core Data. Rather than re-constructing the downloaded data in some object graph that's persisted with Core Data, Three20 implements disk caching and freshness dating on top of the URL loading system. The app basically still works by making HTTP API calls, and parsing the responses, but doesn't have to talk to the cloud on every screen display, which speeds things up immensely. If you're only downloading this information to display in a big table view, and not anything else, perhaps this model might be easier.
