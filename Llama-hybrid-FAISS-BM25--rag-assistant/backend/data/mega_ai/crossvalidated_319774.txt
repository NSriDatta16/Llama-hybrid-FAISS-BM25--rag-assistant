Does AUC Area Under Curve ROC depend on the number of original variables used in logistic regression? Does this impact reliability?

okay so I am using R(programme) to create a landslide susceptibility map - this map considers several parameters to create the map i.e. slope angle, bedrock geology. So I wanted to test the ability of the model to correctly predict whether landslides occur in the identified areas or not (0=don't occur and 1=occur). From that I produced the AUC ROC curve which produced the 0.85 outcome. I then removed the "slope angle" factor from the map (by repeating the whole thing again but excluding slope angle), and produced another AUC ROC curve with a value of 0.76. What I want to find out is if this second calculation can be used as reliably as the first, based on the fact that I have used one less parameter
