Do models learn a test set after multiple predictions upon it?

In machine learning, when we train a model, such as vect = CountVectorizer(min_df=5, ngram_range=(1,2)).fit(X_train) X_train_vectorized = vect.transform(X_train) model = LogisticRegression() model.fit(X_train_vectorized, y_train) predictions = model.predict(vect.transform(X_test)) and make predictions with a test set, does our model learn the test set after multiple predictions are made?
