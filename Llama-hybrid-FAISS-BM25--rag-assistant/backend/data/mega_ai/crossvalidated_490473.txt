Combining Error Terms into a General Error Term

Lets say I have 4 error terms: $$e_1,e_2,e_3,e_4$$ Each of these error terms come from different simulations of data using different classification methods. Let $\gamma$ be the number of empirical data and $\delta$ be the number of simulated data and $d$ is the difference of the two. The error terms are $\frac{d}{\gamma}$ . An example is as follows (in this case the difference $d$ is always 5): $$\gamma = 500, \delta = 505 \implies e_1 = \frac{5}{500} =1\% $$ $$\gamma = 50, \delta = 45 \implies e_2 = \frac{5}{50} = 10\% $$ $$\gamma = 30, \delta = 35 \implies e_3 = \frac{5}{30} =16\% $$ $$\gamma = 1, \delta = 6 \implies e_4 = \frac{5}{1} = 500\% $$ I want to combine these error terms into one general error term, however I want to make an emphasis on certain error terms. Because, using the average of these terms would make an error result that is too susceptible to outliers. $e_3$ is the most accurate in my opinion. Is it suitable to create a linear combination of these error terms to define a general error term? If so, it would look like this: $$ E = \alpha_1 e_1 + \alpha_2 e_2 + \alpha_3 e_3 + \alpha_4 e_4 , \forall \alpha_i\in\mathbb{R}$$ If this is allowable, what would be the best way to define alpha values s.t. $0 OR $0\% ? (Note: This is not the same as using a regression model).
