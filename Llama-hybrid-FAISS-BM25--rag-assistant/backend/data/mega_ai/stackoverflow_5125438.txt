Why do Chrome and IE put "Mozilla 5.0" in the User-Agent they send to the server?

When I myself send many requests to the server I found it amazing that in IE if I choose opera user string that the value of user string was User-Agent Opera/9.80 (Windows NT 6.1; U; en) Presto/2.2.15 Version/10.00 But if I choose another browser in Internet Explorer that it puts Mozilla 5.0 in the user string first. When I send the ajax request from Chrome that I found same thing that they put user string Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/534.20 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/11.0.672.2 Safari/534.20 I found that Mozilla is an organization that doesn't have anything to do with Google and Microsoft. Perhaps it was a competitor for both. Why do MSFT and Google both put Mozilla in their user agent? Is there any reason for putting Mozilla in connection string? Why do chrome and IE both put Mozilla in the userstring when they send the request? I do not know why but is there any specific reason for that?
