My Android HTML application is losing values stored in localStorage when it shuts down. Anyone else see this issue?

I have a native Android 2.1 application that hosts a web view. I load up a site that contains javascript that uses the LocalStorage feature. When the application is running localStorage works fine. When some users exit the application and restart it, all the values are gone. I'm not seeing this problem in my Motrola Droid or Sprint EVO, but there is a report of users in the field with this issue. Does anyone know what I am missing? I'm setting the following flag to true. settings.setDomStorageEnabled(true);
