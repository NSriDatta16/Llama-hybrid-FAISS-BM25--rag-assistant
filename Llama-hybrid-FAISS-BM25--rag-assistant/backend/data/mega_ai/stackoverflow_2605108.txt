It is not possible since user always has an option to switch to another application. This is by design. Good link from Billy ONeal : How do I create a window that is never covered by any other windows, not even other topmost windows? Imagine if this were possible and imagine if two programs did this. Program A creates a window that is "super-topmost" and so does Program B. Now the user drags the two windows so that they overlap. What happens? You've created yourself a logical impossibility. One of those two windows must be above the other, contradicting the imaginary "super-topmost" feature.
