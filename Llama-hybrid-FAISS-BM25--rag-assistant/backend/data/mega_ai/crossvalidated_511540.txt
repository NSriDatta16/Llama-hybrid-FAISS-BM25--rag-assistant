Is there any possible value in performing principal component analysis to groups separately?

I have three different groups. I did a PCA and plotted PCA1 and PCA2 as a scatter. One of the groups looks different to the others. However, afterwards I realised that I applied PCA to each group separately, when it should be applied to all at the same time. If I apply to all at the same time, the groups look the same in the PCA plot - i.e. the blue is aligned with the red and green. Is there any possible value in applying PCA separately and the difference found here, or is this simply a random effect of incorrect application of PCA?
