Mercurial push, abort: authorization failed

I'm having problems with pushing to mercurial repository: $ hg push pushing to https://user:***@hg.domain.com/X_repo searching for changes abort: authorization failed The same URL (with the same credentials) is accessible through the web browser. Also, I tried it without embedding usr+pass into the URL. HTTPS is correctly configured, I tried both Basic and Digest auth -- without a luck. Pulling (through HTTP) works fine. I'm using hgwebdir to serve my repo. What else should I check? I found this: http://code.google.com/p/support/issues/detail?id=2580 In my case it's not random, it happens every single time. Relevant part of my vhost conf: WSGIScriptAlias / /home/(...)/hgwebdir.wsgi AuthType Basic AuthUserFile /(...)/basic-password AuthName (...) Require valid-user Order deny,allow Allow from all $ hg -v Mercurial Distributed SCM (version 1.0.2) Strangely enough hg outgoing works ok: $ hg outgoing comparing with https://hg.domain.com/X_repo http authorization required realm: ... user: ... password: searching for changes changeset: 64:... tag: tip user: ... date: ... summary: ...
