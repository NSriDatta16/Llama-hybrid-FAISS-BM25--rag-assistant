Sampling with python statsmodels ARIMA package

Assume I have a model following ARIMA(p,q,d) with statsmodels package of python. Given a time series given by a numpy array "serie", the code looks like: from statsmodels.tsa.arima_model import ARIMA model = ARIMA(serie, order=(p,q,d)) fitted = model.fit(trend='c') fc, se, conf_99 = fitted.forecast(horizon, alpha=0.01) The variable fc is the expected stochastic process, given the stochastic process "serie", of the forecasting horizon and conf_99 will give me lower and upper bound for prediction, in terms of the confidence interval. Now, I would like to generate a sample path, i.e. a sampled stochastic process. Obviously I do not want to do this by hand and I would like to know if there is any simple way using in-package function to achieve this. Or if anyone can let me know a code to do so, it would be extremely amazing.
