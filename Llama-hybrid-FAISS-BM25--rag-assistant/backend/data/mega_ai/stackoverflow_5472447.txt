You should be able to create your own layout for the PreferenceActivity that contains your button bar. A PreferenceActivity is just a ListActivity , so follow the rules for creating your own layouts for ListActivity . Bear in mind that Android 3.0's fragments-based preference screens will not really support this button bar pattern well, and that those buttons will be pointless even in current versions of Android since the preference saving is done automatically.
