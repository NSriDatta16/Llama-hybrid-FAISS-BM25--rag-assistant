Incorporate Weights/Offsets with Nonparametric Models

I am modeling pure premium in R. I have read that pure premiums are usually modeled using a Tweedie distribution (glm). There is generally an offset or weight added to the model, such as an exposure. I am investigating three nonparametric models for pure premiums: glmnet, regression trees, and random forest. My question: how can I incorporate a weight/offset with a nonparametric model? The two package I normally use for modeling in R are caret and tidymodels.
