Classic ASP to WCF using the Service Moniker

I am trying to consume a WCF logging service from classic ASP without deploy a Com wrapper. I found a method of doing so here . Here is the vb script, simplified. Dim addr addr = "service:mexAddress=""net.pipe://localhost/Services/Logging/LoggingManager/Mex""," _ & "address=""net.pipe://localhost/Services/Logging/LoggingManager/classic/""," _ & "contract=""ILoggingManagerClassic"", contractNamespace=""http://Services.Logging.Classic/""," _ & "binding=""NetNamedPipeBinding_ILoggingManagerClassic"", bindingNamespace=""http://Services.Logging.Classic/""" set objErrorLogger = GetObject(addr) Dim strError : strError = objErrorLogger.LogError("blahblah") This works on Server 2008 , but fails with this error on Server 2003 . Failed to do mex retrieval:Metadata contains a reference that cannot be resolved: net.pipe://localhost/Services/Logging/LoggingManager/Mex.. Only when running through ASP does it fail , a sample VBS file on the same machine using the same code works fine. I think it may be permission related, but don't know where to begin. Anyone have any ideas? EDIT - let me clarify that the WCF host is a windows service running as NETWORK SERVICE. If this belongs on server fault, a moderator can move it. I have an account there as well.
