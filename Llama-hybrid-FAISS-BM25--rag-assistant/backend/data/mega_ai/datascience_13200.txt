K-means Clustering algorithm problems

I am trying to implement k-means clustering algorithm, but I am confused about calculating the distance and update(move) cluster centroids. For example, let's say that I have 2 features. One of them is weight={2,4,6,8,11,14,21} and the other one is height={4,6,7,8,9,12,14} . So, in the coordinate system my points are x1={2,4},x2={4,6},x3={6,7} and so on. Then, I initialize the cluster centroids randomly, doesn't matter how many there are for now, but they have coordinates too. Let's say μ1={4,2} . At this point, I understand how do I calculate distance with Euclidean distance. My code for calculating distance: def get_distance(x1,x2,s1,s2): return np.sqrt(np.power(s1-x1,2)+np.power(s2-x2,2)) Now I get a distance. My first question is how cluster assignment step(first step in loop) will know which centroid assign to c(i).I mean,am I supposed to look at each centroid for understand which sample(x(i)) is close to it and then I should assign centroid to c(i), right? My second question, let's say I got distances and I have c(1,2..,n) array now. Second step in algorithm which is called move(update) centroid step, we are calculate μ. According to formula, this μ is the average of points assigned to clusters so for example μ1=[x(3) + x(4) + x(6)] / 3. However, here our μ was a point in coordinate system, right? I mean, μ1 was {4,2}. How can this be possible? It's a point not a variable. It has coordinates. Well, if it will become a variable let's say μ1=5, how can I subtract ||x(i)-μ|| then? x is a coordinate. My last question is very simple. For this example, I have two features weight and height. What is the maximum number of features that we can use in k-mean? Is it possible to use k-mean algorithms for many many features? For instance, my first feature is height and the second is weight and the third is width fourth and so on. I hope, I explained my problem clearly. If not, sorry for the bad English. I think these three questions are independent questions, so you can answer one of them. Thanks.
