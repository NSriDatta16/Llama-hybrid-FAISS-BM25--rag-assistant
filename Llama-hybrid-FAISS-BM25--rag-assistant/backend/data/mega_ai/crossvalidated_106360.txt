How to obtain estimates for all levels in a mixed effects model that uses effect (deviation) coding?

I am running a binomial mixed effects logistic regression in R using glmer for a sociolinguistics project. I was asked to used deviation (effect) coding. From what I gather, in deviation coding the last level in a factor is assigned -1, because this is the level that is never compared to the other levels within that variable. Is it possible to obtain the Estimate ( Exp(B) value) for the last level as well by using function relevel ? I need to report the estimates for all the levels. For example, my model has the independent variable called Orthography with four levels ( s , sh , s1 , sh1 ). The dependent variable is produced sibilant . In deviation coding the fourth level ( sh1 ) will not be compared to the other three levels, and estimates will be available for the first three ( s , sh , s1 ). The intercept is the mean of the means of all four levels ( s + sh + s1 + sh1 / 4 ). I am interested in obtaining the estimate for the last level ( sh1 ) as well. Does anyone know how to get that? Do I have to rerun the model by changing levels? If so, does anyone know how to do that? I have been unsuccessful with using function relevel to do this. I have other terms in my model as well: following segment, which has two levels ( vowel , consonant ), position of sibilant in word ( initial , medial , final ), grammatical function ( noun , verb , adjectives ), and language of instruction ( English , Gujarati ). This is the code for my model: model.final_si = glmer(prod_sib ~ orthography + foll_segment + word_position + grammatical_func + language_instruction + (1|participant) + (1|item), family="binomial",data=data)
