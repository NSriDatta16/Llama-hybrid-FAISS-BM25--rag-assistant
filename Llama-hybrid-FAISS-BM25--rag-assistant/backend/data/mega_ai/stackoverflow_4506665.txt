Changing Spark TextArea text color dynamically over a range of characters

Hoping to obtain the help of some Flex 3/4 gurus out there... I am attempting to dynamically change the color of a subset/portion of text in a Spark TextArea control. Using the MX-based TextArea, I could leverage the mx.controls.textClasses.TextRange type and change the color directly as follows: TextRange tr = new TextRange(theTextAreaControl, false, beginIndex, endIndex); tr.color = somePredefindColor; Input Parameters to TextRange constructor: 1st argument: The TextArea control that will provide access to the underlying textField property 2nd argument: Indicates the TextRange will not modify the content of the TextArea 3rd argument: The beginning index position in the TextArea text string 4th argument: The ending index position in the TextArea text string How would I go about doing this for a Spark-based TextArea control? I am looking to dynamically change the font color for a range of text, not just the entire TextArea AND I cannot statically specify the font color. The problem I run into when trying to re-use the TextRange type is that the 1st argument is expected to provide the textField property, which is currently not on the Spark-based TextArea control. I thought about extending the Spark-based TextArea control to provide this accessor property but that seems like overkill and is probably not the best approach. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Michael
