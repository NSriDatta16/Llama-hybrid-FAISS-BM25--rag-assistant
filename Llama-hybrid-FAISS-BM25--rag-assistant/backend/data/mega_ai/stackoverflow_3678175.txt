The question appears to be: why does the local variable 'received' have only a fragment of the text that is printed to the console. It is because the variable is assigned a new string for each batch of bytes that are read from the DataInputStream. This code does not appear to concisely get the job done - why use a DataInputStream for example - so perhaps asking about the larger task at hand will be more useful.
