Preprocessing and Data analysis is important. You should normalize data, of you don't do it, your KMeans will be influenced a far away more from huge data (ex. Number of car for family and tor. kilometers per year done by a family). In addition, as always, remember to not include categorical variable, it doesn't make any sense, because they are not numbers. Furthermore, if you have many attributes, it is reasonable to reduce them by PCA or other methods. Finally, there are so e situations in which KMeans cannot find an optimal solution: outliers, different deviations of clusters (the dispersion is not uniform), not spherical shape of clusters and so on...
