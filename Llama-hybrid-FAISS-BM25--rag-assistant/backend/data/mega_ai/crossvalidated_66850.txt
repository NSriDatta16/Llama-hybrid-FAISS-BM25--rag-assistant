Prediction of a binary variable

I am establishing a model for prediction of a binary variable (Yes/No) depending on three continuous variables ($A$,$B$,$C$). I applied logistic regression analysis for a learning dataset vith the Tanagra software, and the results were good with high prediction accuracy. My question is: is it possible to get the probabilities of the prediction via logistic regression? Something like (0.7 Yes)? If not, what test do I have to use to get such a result?
