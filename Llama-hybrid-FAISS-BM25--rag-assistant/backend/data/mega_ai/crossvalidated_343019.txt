You should use a distance metric designed for mixed data. For example, Gower distance (Gower 1971) is a popular choice. You could then use any distance-based clustering method, e.g. hierarchical clustering, k-medoids, DBSCAN, OPTICS, spectral clustering, etc. You can't use a clustering method that computes centroids, because the mean isn't defined for categorical values. This rules out methods like k-means, fuzzy c-means, Gaussian mixture models, hierarchical clustering with Ward linkage, etc. Beyond that constraint, having mixed data doesn't indicate which clustering method you should use. Rather, it depends on your goals, the structure of your data, and computational considerations. There are multiple threads on this site to help guide you in this choice. Mixed data also means you can't use PCA, which isn't defined for categorical variables. But, you could use multidimensional scaling (MDS) or kernel PCA in conjunction with a distance metric or kernel function that handles mixed data. This could be used simply for visualization, or for preprocessing or dimensionality reduction prior to clustering. Whether to perform dimensionality reduction before clustering is, again, problem dependent. Note that MDS and kPCA embed the data into a real vector space. So, if you take this approach, you'd be clustering transformed, continuous values rather than mixed data, and the above restrictions on the clustering method would no longer apply.
