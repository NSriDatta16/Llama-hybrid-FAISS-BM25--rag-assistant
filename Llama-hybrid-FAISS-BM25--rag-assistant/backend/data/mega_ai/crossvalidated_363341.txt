The use of IPW requires a robust variance estimator, even without the sort of structure you're thinking of. Basically, both those commands above are using a sandwich estimator ( http://thestatsgeek.com/2013/10/12/the-robust-sandwich-variance-estimator-for-linear-regression/ and http://thestatsgeek.com/2014/02/14/the-robust-sandwich-variance-estimator-for-linear-regression-using-r/ are decent coverages of the topic) to allow for some structure in the data and thus a more appropriate estimation of variance. As this is very often used for clustered data, many of the functions to do that in R (and other packages) will use some sort of "cluster"-type nomenclature. When it was introduced to me, there wasn't compelling analytical results for why IPW needed robust variance, but it had been shown using simulation, and one explanation I heard was that the weights aren't independent, because if you know N-1 weights, you know the Nth weight.
