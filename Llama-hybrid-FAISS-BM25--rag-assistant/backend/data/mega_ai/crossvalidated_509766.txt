Is sample skewness statistically significant?

I've been searching for a research that would examine statistical significance of a sample skewness between two financial time series of returns. Unfortunately, I was not able to find any good or relevant references, so please share them if you know some. Given a series of returns $r_t$ , $j$ -th central moment is defined as $\mu_j = E\left[r_t - E(r_t)\right]^j$ and skewness is defined as $$skew = \frac{\mu_3}{\mu_2^{3/2}}.$$ I've done some simulation studies where I assume a certain data generating process and test for $H_0: \text{skewness difference is zero}$ and found that an error rate even at $10\%$ confidence level is very high, meaning that it is hard to find two time series that would provide evidence of statistically significant difference. However, I would be interested in studying a more thorough research. I would be interested in a research that does not focus on financial market data as well.
