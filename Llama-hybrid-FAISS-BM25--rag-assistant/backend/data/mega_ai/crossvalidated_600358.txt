As you have count data then it will be best to use a count model (Poisson, quasi-poisson, negative binomial) rather than treating the values as continuous.* As the highest number of infected leaves is only about 12% of the typical total number of leaves, you won't have to worry about hitting an upper limit of count numbers. One limitation is that you only know the number of infected leaves per plant, while what's probably of more interest is the probability of a leaf getting infected. That would involve a binomial model and require knowing numbers of total leaves per plant. As you did not use the same plants repeatedly, think carefully whether a mixed model is really appropriate or helpful. With data over only 2 years, it doesn't make sense to treat the calendar year as a random effect. Whether a random effect for location makes sense similarly can depend on the number of locations. It's often thought best to have on the order of 6 groups (locations, here) to treat them as a random effect; see this page and this page for some discussion. You don't seem to have that many locations. You propose to use the week as a random effect, but I suspect that (as typical for studies over time) you will have correlations in effects from week to week that a simple random intercept as you propose for week wouldn't adequately handle. It can be better to model week as a continuous variable but flexibly, with a regression spline or with smoothers in a generalized additive model. For your main question about whether to use the numbers for each plant or the sum over the 4 plants for each treatment/week/location, it's generally best to analyze data as close as possible to the original unit of measurement. That argues for using values for each plant separately. An average over 4 plants wouldn't be appropriate for a count model. Treating the plants separately will better document whether there is extra variance among plants that needs to be handled with a quasi-Poisson or negative binomial model. You should recognize that the main sample-size issue in count-based data is the number of counts rather than the number of individuals from which they were obtained. For example, if you did a binomial model with data on one leaf at a time and a probability less than 50% of infection per leaf, then the limiting factor would be the total number of infected leaves. And if the data are truly Poisson with the same distribution for each plant having the same treatment/week/location, the sum over 4 such plants would also be Poisson. *If you nevertheless choose to treat the values as continuous, note that the variance of the count values will change with the number of counts in a way that simple linear regression won't acccount for. Modeling the square root of the number of counts is an alternative that sometimes works well, but provides results that are harder to explain to others.
