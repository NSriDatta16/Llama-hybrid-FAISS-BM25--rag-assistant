There is no fundamental difference between using RNNs for text vs. for numeric values. In fact, text is more difficult because you have to preprocess the text to convert into numeric values first. In any case you might have a look at this tutorial: https://machinelearningmastery.com/time-series-prediction-lstm-recurrent-neural-networks-python-keras/ I find this site to be pretty useful in general for examples of working with Keras.
