slideDown() makes everything in wrapper shift

I am currently creating a simple menu where there are several names of services and a user can click on one and jQuery will show it's corresponding paragraph describing it below it. My jQuery code is fine and does exactly what I want, however, I have one bug I have yet to iron out. Whenever I click one of these headings and it's description displays, everything in the wrapper for the page shifts to the left about 7 pixels in Firefox, it does the same thing is Google Chrome however I have not measured the amout but I am sure it is irrelevant. Anyways, I am using the slideToggle() command to show the hidden parragraph. I assume this is occuring because when the slideDown occurs it is somehow changing the width of everything and the "margin: 0 auto;" setting for the wrapper rule in my css is compensating for this change. Does anyone have any way I can remedy this problem? I have tried several other fixes I've found around the internet but to no avail. Here is what my code looks like, I put it on jsFiddle to make it easier to view: http://jsfiddle.net/vcH7m/ Feel free to edit it there if you like, or post what needs to be fixed here. Whatever is more convenient. Thank you very much for the help!
