IMHO, yes. And not just because of Javascript, or lack thereof. If you site relies on visual tricks and manipulation (a lot of menus, drag-and-drop, soft pop-ups) it is not accessible to blind or nearly-blind people. If it relies too much on color differentiation, it might moss the color-blind. Etc. Rule of thumb: If you want to be totally accessible, see how easy it is to navigate your site through Lynx . Hopefully I understood your question correctly.
