Expected value of $R^2$ for linear regression of two normal vectors

How can we calculate the expected R-squared for a linear regression model without intercept where the predictor variable x and the response variable y are both 100-dimensional standard normal vectors? I tried the following R code and got the output. It looks complicated to compute the expectation of $$1-R^2 = SS_{\mathrm{res}}/SS_{\mathrm{tot}} = \mathbb{E}\left[\frac{\left\|\left(\frac{xx^\top}{\|x\|^2 } - I\right)y\right\|^2}{\|y-11^\top y\|^2}\right]$$ . Edit Feb 27, 2023: I just realized that it appears that $SS_{\mathrm{tot}}$ (in the without-intercept case) should not be $\|y-11^\top y\|_2^2$ , but rather $\|y\|^2$ . Am I correct? Also, as a follow-up question, what is the distribution of $R^2$ ? I suppose it could be a Beta distribution. > set.seed(123) > > # Define number of iterations > n_iter > # Create a vector to store R-squared values > rsq_values > # Loop through iterations > for (i in 1:n_iter) { + # Generate x and y as 100-dimensional standard normal vectors + x > # Calculate average R-squared > mean_rsq mean_rsq [1] 0.01005497
