In some diciplines, this is knwon as a "rare events" scenario, and that term may help you find additional advice on the matter. Logistic regression is biased in rare events (well, always, but particularly for rare events). There have been adjustments to the usual losigtic regression methods that attempt to account for rare events and don't yield the same kinds of problem usual logistic regression does (e.g., failiure to converge, massive coefficients and standard errors). The Firth correction is one such adjustment. This site has some links and references for software that implements this method and others.
