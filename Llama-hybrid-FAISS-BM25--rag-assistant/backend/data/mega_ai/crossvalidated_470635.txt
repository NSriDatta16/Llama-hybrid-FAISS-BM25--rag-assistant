I think the reason is more sociological that statistical. Short version: We do it this way because we always have. Longer version: Historically, we could not do many of the things we now take for granted. Many things are computer intensive and Ronald Fisher was born before Alan Turing. So, people did OLS regression - a lot. And people read those regressions in all sorts of substantive fields and statistics courses in those fields taught ANOVA/regression and not more modern methods. Additionally, editors of journals learned those methods and not others, and many will reject articles with modern methods because e.g. "they won't be understood". Many practitioners reject modern methods too; I used to be a sort of data analysis geek at a hospital. Doctors would come to ask my advice and, if it wasn't "do OLS regression" or "do logistic regression" they would reject my advice. I got my PhD in psychometrics and many of my professors in other branches of psychology did not know any modern methods (one said: "just report the p value, that's what matters").
