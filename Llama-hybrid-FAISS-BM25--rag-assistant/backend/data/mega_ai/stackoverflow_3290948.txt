Have a look at the error logs, in C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\LOG\ There should be files called ERRORLOG and ERRORLOG.X the latest one should give you an indication why the service failed to start. They are plain text files and can be opened in Notepad. Edit Your error is at the bottom 2010-07-20 16:05:59.54 spid7s Cannot create file 'c:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\DATA\temp_MS_AgentSigningCertificate_database.mdf' because it already exists. Change the file path or the file name, and retry the operation. So try renaming the file c:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL.1\MSSQL\DATA\temp_MS_AgentSigningCertificate_database.mdf and start the service again. If it fails, then look in that file (it should be a new one) in Notepad to see if there are any new errors.
