Basically there's no overhead at all. Fixed means "pin the location the pointer points to in memory, don't relocate it." Every other managed pointer can be "bent" by the Garbage Collector at will if it decides to move memory around. Fixed will prevent this, so basically it will "save" this (possible) overhead. I don't know about the implementation of fixed pointers, but in the simplest case it's just blacklisting memory blocks. This is not very costly compared to normal managed pointers. On the other hand, it prevents all sorts of optimazations that the GC might decide to perform in terms of memory management like increasing localization, reducing fragmenation etc.
