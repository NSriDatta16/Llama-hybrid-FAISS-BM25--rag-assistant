Test for significant difference from zero

I have a set of actor's activity coefficients for different subjects for every day in a given time range, which looks like this: date actor1 actor2 actor3 actor4 actor5 15-Mar-2020 -,344 -,250 ,322 -,452 ,950 16-Mar-2020 -,260 ,135 ,094 -,508 ,305 17-Mar-2020 -,034 -,188 ,287 ,055 1,559 ... For every actor, I would like to test whether their coefficients are significantly different from zero over the course of the whole time range. At first instance, I thought of conducting a simple one-sample t-test, but this does not account for the distance between each observation and the 0 test value. Consider this small example: date actor1 actor2 15-Mar-2020 0 -2 16-Mar-2020 0 1 17-Mar-2020 0 0 18-Mar-2020 0 1 While both actors have an average coefficient of 0 (and thus, both don't differ siginficantly from zero), the second actor has a higher standard deviation. Is there any statistical test I could use to see whether this standard deviation is significantly different from zero, preferably using SPSS or R? Or would you suggest taking this on from a completely different angle?
