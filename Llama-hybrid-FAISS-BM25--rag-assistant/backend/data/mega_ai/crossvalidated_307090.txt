How to know which variables influence a Bayesian model

Is there any way to know what variables in a predictive model are influencing the prediction result of a particular row in a dataset? For example, I have a student dataset and my target variable is whether or not the student will evade school. My model predicted that student X has an 85% chance of leaving school. How do I know which of the variables are influencing the outcome for that particular student?
