How do you verify the correct data is in a data mart?

I'm working on a data warehouse and I'm trying to figure out how to best verify that data from our data cleansing (normalized) database makes it into our data marts correctly. I've done some searches, but the results so far talk more about ensuring things like constraints are in place and that you need to do data validation during the ETL process (E.g. dates are valid, etc.). The dimensions were pretty easy as I could easily either leverage the primary key or write a very simple and verifiable query to get the data. The fact tables are more complex. Any thoughts? We're trying to make this very easy for a subject matter export to run a couple queries, see some data from both the data cleansing database and the data marts, and visually compare the two to ensure they are correct.
