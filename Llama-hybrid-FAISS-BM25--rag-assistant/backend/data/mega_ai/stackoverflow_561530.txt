So it turns out that the .NET files were copied to C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\Primary Interop Assemblies\ . However, they were never registered in the GAC . I ended up manually dragging the files in C:\Program Files\Microsoft.NET\Primary Interop Assemblies to C:\windows\assembly and the application worked on that problem machine. You could also do this programmatically with Gacutil . So it seems that something happened to .NET during the install, but this seems to correct the problem. I hope that helps someone else out!
