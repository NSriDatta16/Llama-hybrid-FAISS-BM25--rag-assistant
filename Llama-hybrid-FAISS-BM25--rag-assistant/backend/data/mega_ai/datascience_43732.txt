I would try using a Genetic Algorithm to estimate optimal parameters for training. You would need to figure out the objective function of parameters of training algorithm $A_2$ which minimalised fitting $A_1(D)$ . Those parameters could be regularization coefficients or numer of layers/neurons, or any other parameters describing your training algorithm. There is also algorithm called bayesian regularization. It is very similiar to Levenberg - Marquardt training, but it is computing optimal regularization parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ by computing effective numbers of network's parameters. I hope I understood your question well. Regards, Max
