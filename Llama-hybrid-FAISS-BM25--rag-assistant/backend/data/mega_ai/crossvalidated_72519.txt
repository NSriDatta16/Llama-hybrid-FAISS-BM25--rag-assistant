Exponential family parameter estimation and fitting, references

First of all, I want to express my apologies if the question is too broad or wrong, but I am in need of references and I have no idea whom I can ask. If you are interested, the question comes from a model I built, you can see some details here and here . In this model I have: $$f(\mathbb{x}|T,\mu)=\frac{h(\mathbb{x})e^{-\frac{E(\mathbb{x})}{kT}+\mu N(x)}}{\mathcal{Z}(T,\mu)}$$ There, my parameters are $\mu$ and $T$, and $\mathbb{x}=(x_1,\dots,x_M)$ where $x_i\in\{0,1\}$ and I have the restriction $\forall i\in\{1,\dots,M-D+1\}$ $$\sum_{j=0}^{D-1} x_{i+j} \leq 1$$ This is, $h(\mathbb{x})=0$ if that condition is not held. I have the "small" inconvenience of not knowing $\mathcal{Z}(T,\mu)$, so I used a MCMC (Metropolis-Hastings) method to approximate this function. However I face two problems. The first of them regards the simulation and the model and I am on solving it (it depends too much on the initial condition). The second is that these parameters are not fully known and I have no idea how can I estimate them. I have been reading about Bayesian inference and I know a bit of estimation theory but I am no expert (furthermore I don't know if not knowing the partition function can affect the result). If any of you were able to give me some clue in the form of a book that I can read, I would be eternally grateful. Thank you very much for your help. Thanks to cardinal's comment, I have realized that I didn't explain one thing. It probably makes all more complex but there it goes: The idea is that $E$ is known in each experiment, actually $E(\mathbf{x}) = \mathbf{E}\cdot\mathbf{x}$. However, $\mathbf{E}$ is not always the same, it represents an external potential for some particles. The "good" thing is that $T$, which accounts for the temperature, never changes whatever $\mathbf{E}$ is, so I thought that I could find a way of estimating it, given the fact that I have an empirical distribution of $x_{i}$ (so, a probability that a particle is in the position $i$) given a certain $\mathbf{E}$. So, in a way, what I have is $$f(\mathbf{x}|T,\mu , \mathbf{E})$$, but I always know $\mathbf{E}$ and I know (can I say this?) that $T,\mu$ are independent of $\mathbf{E}$. I am sorry for not being clear enough before. I am starting to think that nothing of this makes sense...
