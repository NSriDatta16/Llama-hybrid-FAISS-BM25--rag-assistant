The implications of using MCMC normalization algorithm output as input in a separate normal linear model (and similar combined approaches in general)

Background I am a statistics intern (not assigned a supervisor yet) in a medical research institute. I’m exploring methods for network analysis in the context of multi-omics data, focused on microbial abundances and metabolite data. Currently, I am experimenting with Gaussian Graphical Model-based methods that would account for characteristics of microbiome abundance data (compositional, zero-inflated, overdispersed) and confounder variables gathered from the environment (different medical statuses and measurements, e.g. disease status, some blood measurement, BMI). My ultimate goal with these methods is to explore associations and structures within given data and suggest hypotheses about taxa-taxa relations for further analysis. Initial Model I am currently investigating a method described in the article “HARMONIES: A Hybrid Approach for Microbiome Networks Inference via Exploiting Sparsity” by S. Jiang et al which can be found here: https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fgene.2020.00445/full Specifically, I am interested in using the Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) model-based normalization technique they described, then using the normalized abundance counts with Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) methods. It is based on a following ZINB model for the taxonomic count matrix and indicator function $\mbox{I}$ : $y_{ij} \sim \pi_i \mbox{I}(y_{ij}=0) + (1-\pi_i)\mbox{NB}(\lambda_{ij}, \phi_j), \ \ for \ y_{ij},\ i = 1, …, n, \ j = 1, …, p.$ Which can be described as a hierarchical Bayesian model: $\begin{cases} y_{ij} = 0, \ \ if \ \ \eta_{ij}=1,\\ y_{ij} \sim \mbox{NB}(s_i \alpha_{ij}, \phi_j), \ \ if \ \ \eta_{ij}=0,\\ \log \alpha_{ij} \sim \mbox{N}(\mu_j, \sigma_j^2) \end{cases}$ Where $\eta_{ij} \sim \mbox{Bernoulli}(\pi_i)$ , with prior $\pi_i \sim \mbox{Beta}(a_\pi, b_\pi)$ , a $\mbox{Gamma}(a_\phi, b_\phi)$ prior for $\phi_j$ , mean parameter $\lambda_{ij}=s_i \alpha_{ij}$ , where $s_i$ is a sample-specific size factor factor and $\alpha_{ij}$ is the "normalized abundance" , with priors $\mu_j \sim \mbox{N}(0, h_0 \sigma_0^2)$ (suggested parameters so prior is flat for $\mu_0^2$ ) and $\sigma_j^2 \sim \mbox{Inverse-Gamma}(a_0, b_0)$ . The authors of the paper implemented a MCMC algorithm that estimates parameters of the above model, including the "normalized abundance" $\alpha_{ij}$ , which they then pass onto Graphical LASSO. My Suggestion: Bayesian Linear Model Assume there is a set of confounding environmental covariates that have a linear relationship with abundance. I am still interested in the ZINB Bayesian normalization technique, but I also want to account for this additional linear dependence. With this in mind, the simplest approach I could think of is Bayesian linear model and modify my "normalized abundance" as following: $\log \alpha_{ij}=z_{ij}+\mu_{0j}+x_i \beta_j^T$ Where we have Q-dimensional (for Q covariates) vectors $x_i$ and $\beta_j \sim \mbox{N}(0, \sigma_{\beta j}^2)$ , error value $z_{ij} \sim \mbox{N}(0, \sigma_{\alpha j}^2)$ and baseline $\mu_{0j} \sim \mbox{N}(0, h_0 \sigma_{0j}^2)$ , with weakly informative Inverse-Gamma priors for sigmas. With the goal of determining the covariance matrix for errors. My Questions There already exists an implemented MCMC algorithm for normalization of abundance data as described above. However, their implementation is non-trivial to quickly modify it to include the linear relationship I suggested. And even then, I am not sure if my own suggestion would be good compared to other approaches. Thus, I am looking for simpler ways to explore things, sacrificing rigour if need be, but I want to do it consciously and for it to make sense. I have the following questions: First of all, I am looking to confirm that my suggestion would work for getting a covariance matrix to then use for exploring associations between taxa (assumedly free of covariate confounding). My current idea to do it in a "lazy" way: First, I normalize the abundance data with already implemented MCMC method and then use its output (being "normalized abundance counts") to further perform a regression or other separate downstream modeling or analysis (for example using my Bayesian suggestion in regression). Does this carry any practical sense, and what practical and theoretical implications would such an approach have for my problem? I’m struggling to wrap my head around any potential problems and their solutions. In general, what practical and theoretical red flags arise from the creation of such downstream schemes, using outputs of one model as input in a different one or mixing Bayesian and Frequentist approaches to inference? I couldn’t find a lot of information that would direct me with these issues, at least not in an elaborated way, either being opinions or experience that are not explained a lot or some papers and answers writing about adjacent issues which didn’t really provide me with enough clarity to be confident and move on. However, maybe, I just didn’t look good enough. So, basically, it would be really convenient to generally use other methods for denoising or normalizing in sequence with other models or analytic methods, but I would like to know justifications/limitations of this. All in all, thank you very much for considering this question.
