why we generalise that the probability of a head occuring on tossing of a coin is 0.5?? I don't think you can make that generalization unless you further assume that the probability of head on each day is itself a random variable with expectation 0.5 (e.g. one day is 0.6, another day is 0.4, etc. on average it is 0.5).
