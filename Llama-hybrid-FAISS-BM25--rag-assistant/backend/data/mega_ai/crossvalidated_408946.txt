Design for regression analysis

I have a dataset of students, the number of times they were tutored in class, the number of times they were tutored after school, and their marks in terms 1 and 2. studid DaysTutoredAfterSchool DaysTutoredInClass Term1 Term2 -- -------- ------------------------ -------------------- ------- ------- 1 2222180 0 1 37 23 2 2227130 3 0 75 82 4 2218584 0 0 30 3 10 2246718 0 4 57 72 11 2219509 0 1 55 50 Here's the full dataset I'm trying to answer two questions: Is there any association between the number of times a student was tutored and the difference in marks between terms 1 and 2? Does being tutored in class vs after school make any difference in this association? I've described my approaches below and bolded specific questions. Any suggestions for how to approach this would be appreciated. Dividing the students into two groups When I did this analysis last time (on a different dataset), I divided the students in two groups, those who were tutored 3 or more times (DaysTutoredAfterSchool + DaysTutoredInClass >=3) and those who were not. The cutoff of 3 was arbitrary. At the suggestion of this answer on stackexchange I then ran a mixed linear regression model to compare the two groups. Using the same method on this year's data yields this result The dataset with the IsTutored column (DaysTutored = DaysTutoredAfterSchool + DaysTutoredInClass): studid DaysTutored Term1 Term2 IsTutored -- -------- ------------- ------- ------- ----------- 1 2222180 1 37 23 0 2 2227130 3 75 82 1 4 2218584 0 30 3 0 10 2246718 4 57 72 1 11 2219509 1 55 50 0 The dataset reshaped for the regression model: studid IsTutored Term Mark IsTerm2 -- -------- ----------- ------ ------ --------- 0 2222180 0 Term1 37 0 1 2227130 1 Term1 75 0 2 2218584 0 Term1 30 0 3 2246718 1 Term1 57 0 4 2219509 0 Term1 55 0 46 2222180 0 Term2 23 1 47 2227130 1 Term2 82 1 48 2218584 0 Term2 3 1 49 2246718 1 Term2 72 1 50 2219509 0 Term2 50 1 The formula sm.MixedLM.from_formula("Mark ~ IsTerm2*IsTutored",data,groups=data["studid"]) The results Mixed Linear Model Regression Results ============================================================== Model: MixedLM Dependent Variable: Mark No. Observations: 92 Method: REML No. Groups: 46 Scale: 51.8002 Min. group size: 2 Likelihood: -361.3434 Max. group size: 2 Converged: Yes Mean group size: 2.0 -------------------------------------------------------------- Coef.

I tried feeding the DaysTutored column into the model. Here's the dataset studid DaysTutored Term Mark IsTerm2 -- -------- ------------- ------ ------ --------- 0 2222180 1 Term1 37 0 1 2227130 3 Term1 75 0 2 2218584 0 Term1 30 0 3 2246718 4 Term1 57 0 4 2219509 1 Term1 55 0 46 2222180 1 Term2 23 1 47 2227130 3 Term2 82 1 48 2218584 0 Term2 3 1 49 2246718 4 Term2 72 1 50 2219509 1 Term2 50 1 The formula: model2 = sm.MixedLM.from_formula("Mark ~ IsTerm2*DaysTutored",data2,groups=data2["studid"]) The results: Mixed Linear Model Regression Results ================================================================ Model: MixedLM Dependent Variable: Mark No. Observations: 92 Method: REML No. Groups: 46 Scale: 58.4521 Min. group size: 2 Likelihood: -370.5287 Max. group size: 2 Converged: Yes Mean group size: 2.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------- Coef.

Is this a correct interpretation? DaysTutoredAfterSchool vs DaysTutoredInClass I want to see if there is a difference between being tutored after school and being tutored in class. I ran the same regression model with these two different tutoring variables: The dataset: studid DaysTutoredInClass DaysTutoredAfterSchool Term Mark IsTerm2 -- -------- -------------------- ------------------------ ------ ------ --------- 0 2222180 1 0 Term1 37 0 1 2227130 0 3 Term1 75 0 2 2218584 0 0 Term1 30 0 3 2246718 4 0 Term1 57 0 4 2219509 1 0 Term1 55 0 46 2222180 1 0 Term2 23 1 47 2227130 0 3 Term2 82 1 48 2218584 0 0 Term2 3 1 49 2246718 4 0 Term2 72 1 50 2219509 1 0 Term2 50 1 The formula: sm.MixedLM.from_formula("Mark ~ IsTerm2*DaysTutored",data2,groups=data2["studid"] The results: Mixed Linear Model Regression Results ============================================================================================== Model: MixedLM Dependent Variable: Mark No. Observations: 92 Method: REML No. Groups: 46 Scale: 58.1336 Min. group size: 2 Likelihood: -365.2296 Max. group size: 2 Converged: Yes Mean group size: 2.0 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Coef.

Marks for students tutored after school rose, on average, 2.491 points for every day they were tutored after school. Is this interpretation correct? The P values for these coefs are not low enough. What does the coef for IsTerm2:DaysTutoredInClass:DaysTutoredAfterSchool mean?
