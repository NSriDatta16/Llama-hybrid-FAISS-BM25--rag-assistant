There is no convention and adding an ex will make the name harder to read and ugly looking for the average java programmer. But at sometimes I could imagine that it would make your code faster understandable to add a try to methods that are likely to throw an exception. Especially if they are unchecked. It doesn't have to be something ugly like it could be found in many c/c++ programs where you use _name or mName for members or iValue for integers. But in java there are some conventions too. If a method will return an integer it is prefixed with is... set, get and test are the most used examples for this. All of this things are documented in the method header, through return type annotations etc... But adding one word to the function name makes it easier and faster to read and understand. Why not use try to give programmers reading your code a subconscious hint that this method is likely to throw an exception. Like tryCopyFile instead of tryWriteFile.
