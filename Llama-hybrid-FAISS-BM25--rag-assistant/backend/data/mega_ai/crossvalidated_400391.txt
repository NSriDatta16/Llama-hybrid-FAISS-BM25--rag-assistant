Feature selection using PCA for linear regression

I am using PCA to the training data set to do feature selection before applying linear regression to build a classifier model. In this scenario, would it be useful to use ridge regression to ensure that the design matrix is invertible? Does it make sense to use Lasso (not at the same time as using ridge regression) to shrink coeï¬ƒcients to zero?
