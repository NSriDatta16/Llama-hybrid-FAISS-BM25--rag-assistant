Definitely create a UNIQUE index, or, better, make this column a PRIMARY KEY . You need an index to make your checks fast anyway. Why don't make this index UNIQUE so that you have another fallback option (if you for some reason forgot to check with SELECT )? If your table is InnoDB , it will have a PRIMARY KEY anyway, since all InnoDB tables are index-organized by design. In case you didn't declare a PRIMARY KEY in your table, InnoDB will create a hidden column to be a primary key, thus making your table twise as large and you will not have an index on your column. Creating a PRIMARY KEY on your column is a win-win. You can issue INSERT IGNORE INTO mytable VALUES (userid) and check how many records were affected. If 0 , there was a key violation, but no exception.
