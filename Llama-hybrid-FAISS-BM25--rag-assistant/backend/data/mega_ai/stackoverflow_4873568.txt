I've faced the same issue. In my case this happens because Core Data is not able to found my compiled data mapping file (a file with 'cdm' extension) in the resulting application bundle. When I manually moved that file from nested bundle to the root of application bundle (MyApp.app\NestedBundle.bundle\MyMapping.cdm -> MyApp.app\MyMapping.cdm) everything worked fine. But such file layout violates current logic of application bundle structure, so I will try to make Core Data to see my cdm file in nested bundle as well. UPD: It seems that the best solution is to use custom initialization for migration process. Very nice example can found here - http://media.pragprog.com/titles/mzcd/code/ProgressiveMigration/AppDelegate.m . I've adopted that code for searching in all bundles and it works fine.
