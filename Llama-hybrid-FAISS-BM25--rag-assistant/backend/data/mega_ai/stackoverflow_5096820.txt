The problem is, it depends on what version of matlab you have. It depends on how much memory you have. It depends on the largest piece of contiguous memory available to you. So any answer will potentially be vague, since we don't know what you have! How many elements are there? This is done by the simple artifice of multiplication. 2e5*200 = 4e7 elements. So 40,000,000 elements. How much storage does this consume? Assuming these are doubles, each elements requires 8 bytes of memory. 4e7*8 = 3.2e8 bytes of memory, or roughly 0.32 gigabytes of RAM. Do you have this much memory available? That I cannot say. If you are running a 32 bit version of MATLAB on Windoze, it might just barely fit. The possession of 8 gigs of RAM is irrelevant if you cannot address it all, or if your OS won't let you see it all. If you are running 64 bit MATLAB on a system with 8 gigs of RAM, you will have no problems in storing this array. You can see the memory available one SOME systems using the memory function in MATLAB.
