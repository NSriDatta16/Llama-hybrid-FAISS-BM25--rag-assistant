Here are some points to start which all involve gathering "supervision" data. One point to start is to gather satisfaction feed-backs from employees, such as "not satisfied" -1, "average" 0, "satisfied" 1, or a 5 level score, etc. Then you can tackle this problem as a classification/regression task. In the process, you will find out about the important metrics/combinations. Another point to start is to use expert knowledge. That is, experts (or any eligible person) will read the employees' reports and assign a satisfaction level to them. Then you should proceed as the first case. An easier data acquisition is in the form of comparison rather than absolute satisfaction levels. For example, you should gather data in the form of "employee 1 is more satisfied than employee 2", then proceed to predict the difference between two employees, i.e. +1 or -1, using the previous steps. This way, for any given employee $e$ , and a small group of representative employees $e_1$ to $e_5$ that are sorted based on their satisfaction level (as a measuring stick), you can feed $(e, e_i)$ to the model to find the satisfaction level of employee $e$ in the spectrum. For example, 5 outputs in the spectrum would be $+1, +1, +1, -1, -1$ , which means satisfaction level of $e$ is between $e_3$ and $e_4$ . This way, you may not even need to extract the important features, just convert the output of prediction model into a score.
