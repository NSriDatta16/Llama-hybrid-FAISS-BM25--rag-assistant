Keep getting gcov error when trying to run lcov in Windows command line

I was wondering what else is actually needed in order to run lcov in windows command line? Every time when I run perl lcov, I always get a reminder or errors similar to the following: geninfo: ERROR: need tool gcov! I looked into my bin directory, and couldn't find a gcov.exe. I normally do perl genhtml filename to get a html test coverage report of my javascript. I was trying to see if I can do perl lcov as I might want to combine several lcov files into one (and get the total test coverage). Thanks.
