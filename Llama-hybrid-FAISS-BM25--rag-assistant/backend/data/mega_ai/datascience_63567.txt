Before training and testing any Machine Learning model, we should perform some prerequisite steps to tune the accuracy of model and to avoid Overfitting or Underfitting . First you should understand the data. Analyse statistics of data like range, min, max, std dev etc. Visualize the data as it will give you better insight of data. If each features in data has different value range, then perform data normalization and scaling. You must select relevant features and avoid unrelated features. Convert categorical data into numeric. Data may contain unknown or missing data. You must handle missing data appropriately. Outliers detection and handling of such data is very important. There might be some situation where you need to derive some more features from available features. After all that preprocessing of data, you have to split data into Train-Test data. For that there are different different strategies. When you are designing ML model, there are some hyperparameters which you need to tune before training model. These parameters control the performance and accuracy of model. Hyperparameters are like number of trees in Random Forest algorithm. Depth and width of each tree etc.
