You can try converting all the layers into one smart object and then drag the smart object layer into the new .psd file. Go to the Layers palette: Window > Layers(F7). LMB SINGLE CLICK the top layer. Scroll down Layer palette until you get to the bottom. SHIFT + LMB SINGLE CLICK. At this point all the layers should be hilighted. RMB SINGLE CLICK any of Layer "Titles". You should see a menu pop up so use the mouse to scroll until you find "Convert to Smart Object". LMB SINGLE CLICK to convert all the layers into one smart object. The smart object can be edited by double clicking it in the Layers palette. You can also drag a smart object from one .PSD into another .PSD. I usually just open both .PSD files and drag the smart object form one Layers palette to the other Layers palette.
