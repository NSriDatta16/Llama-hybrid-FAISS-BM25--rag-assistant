Visualizing StyleCop and Code Analysis rules violations

I'm setting up a project where we've decide to use StyleCop and VS2010 "Code Analysis" rules. I've setup the build so both sets of rules are executed on every build. The problem is that developers on this project will only be able to see StyleCop and Code Analysis rule violations on build. While authoring code the VS2010 code editor doesn't highlight rules violations like it would do for build errors. I'm afraid that means folks would end up authoring code for an extended period of time and than prior to checkin have to fix 100+ rules violations. I'd like to explore a more organic process. After spending the better part of the last two weeks googling, I admit defeat. I've found "StyleCop for Resharper" that would provide inline code editor highlights for StyleCop rules violations. I was wondering if there's something similar for Code Analysis or if there are any other options for StyleCop? Thanks, -- Justin Angel
