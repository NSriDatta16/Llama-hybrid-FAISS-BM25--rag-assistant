Mathematica, PDF Curves and Shading

I need to plot a normal distribution and then shade some specific region of it. Right now I'm doing this by creating a plot of the distribution and overlaying it with a RegionPlot. This is pretty convoluted and I'm certain there must be a more elegant way of doing it. I Googled, looked at the docs, found nothing. Help me SO! I guess Mathematica counts as programming? :D
