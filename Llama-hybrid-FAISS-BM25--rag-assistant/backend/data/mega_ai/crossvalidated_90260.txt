you might need to clarify your experiment design but as I understand it: you have 3 groups of visualisation (PC, NL, Map) and 3 different types of task (group 1,2,3) - resulting in 9 combinations. Therefore you have 9 subgroups (e.g PC,group1, PC,group2...Map,group3). You should do a 2x3 ANOVA - not a oneway ANOVA as you suggest in your title, if your outcome measures are continuous. If your outcome measure is binary, or otherwise categorical, consider a chi square test or logistic regression. It sounds like the same people perform in all subgroups. You can therefore use repeated measures 2 x 3 ANOVA.
