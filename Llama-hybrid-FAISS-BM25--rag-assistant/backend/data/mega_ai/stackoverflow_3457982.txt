Relationship between Sales Organization, Sales Office and Sales Group in SAP ERP

I want to know the relationship between Sales Organization ( VAKPA-VKORG ), Sales Office ( VAKPA-VKBUR ) and Sales Group ( VAKPA-VKGRP ) in SAP ERP. Relationship in the sense, does One-to-One or One-to-Many relation exist between them, or do they form an hierarchy? Thanks
