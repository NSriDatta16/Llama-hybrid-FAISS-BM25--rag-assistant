global.html is unable to load NPAPI plugin from safari-extension builder but its loading from the direct link

I am developing a Safari extension for both Mac and Win. My extension is a trigger point for my plugin which i am storing at ** /Library/Internet Plug-ins/** My extension's global.html is calling for my plugins mime type by an object tag The issue is when on Mac, I load my extz through safari-extz-builder, the plugin is NOT getting called, but when I drag the same global.html to safari window, it is working. Also the same global.html is working fine on Windows. I have repeated the same process with a generic plugin "npsimple" too which gave me same result (i.e. working on direct linking but failing on load from extension builder) Code of my global.html: Plugin FAILED to load function foo() { alert(document.getElementById("pluginobj").foo()); } foo(); Link for npsimple: http://git.webvm.net/?p=npsimple;a=tree I must be missing something very stupid. Any ideas ?? TIA Parimal Das OSX 10.5.8 / Safari 5.0.3
