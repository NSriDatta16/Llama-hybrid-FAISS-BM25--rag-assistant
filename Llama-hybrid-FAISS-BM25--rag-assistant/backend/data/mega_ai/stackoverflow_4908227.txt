I would use onPause() , as onStop() is not guaranteed to be called. See the application fundamentals for details on the lifecycle. To save and restore a boolean, I would use SharedPreferences . There is a code example on the data storage page that shows how to save and restore a boolean. They use onCreate() and onStop() , but I would use onResume() and onPause() , for the reasons I have already mentioned.
