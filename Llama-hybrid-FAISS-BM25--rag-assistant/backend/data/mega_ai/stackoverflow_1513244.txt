You need to study a vast variety of things to become a programmer. These include: Some programming languages Theory of algorithms and complexity Design patterns Application design System design Integration Database theory Software quality Testing strategy Using source control Organizing work in teams Being a pragmatic programmer, learn to focus on the results not on the process User-centered design, how to listen to users Usability User psychology Acessibility (for various devices and also for disabled people) etc. The thing is that you need to take a small step at a time. Now you know a couple of programming languages, good, learn something about databases, read about algorithms. Then go, apply it in practice. This will give you experience to think about. This thinking will take yoy to the next stage, you get deeper into algorithms, you learn more about languages features. After some time you start to think of global issues like application architecture. An so it will go on, one iteration after the other you will be getting better and better. Imaging a field of old dry grass. You need to have it burnt. What will you do? To make it more effective you ignite the field for several sides, then it will burn evenly. You watch it, where it goes out you ignite again. There it goes. Always watch out where in your knowledge you have white spaces and focus efforts on there when you have the time and wish (or need).
