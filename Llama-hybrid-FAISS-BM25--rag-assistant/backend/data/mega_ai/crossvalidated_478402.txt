If I have understand the question correctly, this is a case of Ensemble Forecasting , and I believe the goal is to find Prediction rather than Confidence Intervals. Given a set of $n$ predictions $\hat{y}_{1, t+h}, \hat{y}_{2, t+h}, .., \hat{y}_{n, t+h}$ for $h$ timesteps ahead: Expected forecast: average of the set of predictions 50% Prediction Interval: median of the predictions 95% Prediction Interval: Find the 2.5% and 97.5% quantiles of the inverse empirical cumulative distribution of $\hat{y}_{i, t+h}$ , there is 95% chance that the prediction falls in this interval.
