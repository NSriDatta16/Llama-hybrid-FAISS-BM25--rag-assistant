Why are the support vectors in an SVM classifier on hyperplanes that are 1 or -1 away from the wanted hyperplane

The way it is described here https://www.svm-tutorial.com/2015/06/svm-understanding-math-part-3/ , the wanted hyperplane is found by finding two other hyperplanes which have the equations $\vec{w}\vec{x}+b = 1$ and $\vec{w}\vec{x}+b = -1$ . He puts it like the values are chosen for simplicity. In this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bS1avoD6g8s at 3:07 it kinda sounds like the values have to be 1 and -1. I don't understand why the values are (or have to be) 1 and -1. If I understand correctly, the margin of the wanted hyperplane is given by the other two hyperplanes going through the support vectors and each hyperplane is half a margin away from the wanted hyperplane. Why can't the equations of the two hyperplanes be $\vec{w}\vec{x}+b = +/- 5$ or something else?
