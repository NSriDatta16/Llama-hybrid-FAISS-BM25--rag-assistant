Regression robust to changes in model, post-training

I am trying to estimate a single variable $y$ from a set of predictors $X$, which are highly colinear. I've read about ridge regression and lasso which, in my understanding, place penalties to favor a solution involving the least amount of predictors that have the highest coefficients. However in my application, $X$ is produced by sensors which may suddenly fail. Take, for instance the sensor producing input $X_1$: it had been identified as one of the best predictors, but suddenly becomes disconnected and has a "flat" reading of zero. If $X_1$ had been given the highest coefficient in the regression for $y$,the result would be completely wrong. Instead, I'm looking for a more robust regression, where perhaps the aim is to make every predictor contribute equally, so that when one input becomes erratic, the overall error is minimized thanks to the contribution other predictors. In the past I had experimented with individually regressing $y$ using each $X$ (one at a time), and then calculating the median of all regressions. Is there a standard algorithm that achieves the same? I feel like PCA could help, but don't know how to work it.
