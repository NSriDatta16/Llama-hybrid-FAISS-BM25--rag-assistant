You should have a look at locally stationary processes . They are defined as typical time series models (e.g. ARMA) but where the parameters of model change smoothly over (unit interval) time. In particular for white noise deviations for locally stationary alternatives with non zero auto correlations (locally) see "Testing for white noise against locally stationary alternatives", (Goerg 2012) .
