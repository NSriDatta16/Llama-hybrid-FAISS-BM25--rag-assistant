Some possible generic explanations for this perceived discrepancy, assuming of course there is no issue with code or likelihood definition or MCMC implementation or number of MCMC iterations or convergence of the likelihood maximiser (thanks, Jacob Socolar ): in large dimensions $N$ , the posterior does not concentrate on the maximum but something of a distance of order $\sqrt{N}$ from the mode, meaning that the largest values of the likelihood function encountered by an MCMC sampler are often quite below the value of the likelihood at its maximum. For instance, if the posterior is $\theta|\mathbf x\sim\mathcal N_N(0,I_N)$ , $\theta$ is at least at a distance $N-2\sqrt{2N}$ from the mode, $0$ . While the MAP and the MLE are indeed confounded under a flat prior, the marginal densities of the different parameters of the model may have (marginal) modes that are far away from the corresponding MLEs (i.e., MAPs). The MAP is a position in the parameter space where the posterior density is highest but this does not convey any indication of posterior weight or volume for neighbourhoods of the MAP. A very thin spike carries no posterior weight. This is also the reason why MCMC exploration of a posterior may face difficulties in identifying the posterior mode. The fact that most parameters are bounded may lead to some components of the MAP=MLE occurring at a boundary. See, e.g., Druihlet and Marin (2007) for arguments on the un-Bayesian nature of MAP estimators. One is the dependence on these estimators on the dominating measure, another one being the lack of invariance under reparameterisation (unlike MLE's). As an example of point 1 above, here is a short R code N=100 T=1e4 lik=dis=rep(0,T) mu=rmvnorm(1,mean=rep(0,N)) xobs=rmvnorm(1,mean=rep(0,N)) lik[1]=dmvnorm(xobs,mu,log=TRUE) dis[1]=(xobs-mu)%*%t(xobs-mu) for (t in 2:T){ prop=rmvnorm(1,mean=mu,sigma=diag(1/N,N)) proike=dmvnorm(xobs,prop,log=TRUE) if (log(runif(1)) which mimics a random-walk Metropolis-Hastings sequence in dimension N=100. The value of the log-likelihood at the MAP is -91.89, but the visited likelihoods never come close: > range(lik) [1] -183.9515 -126.6924 which is explained by the fact that the sequence never comes near the observation: > range(dis) [1] 69.59714 184.11525
