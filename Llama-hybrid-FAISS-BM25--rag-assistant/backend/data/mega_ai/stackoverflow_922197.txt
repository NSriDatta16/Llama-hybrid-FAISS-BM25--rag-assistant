Automating paper forms and process flow in the office

I have been tasked with automating some of the paper forms in HR. This might turn into "automate all forms" eventually, so I want to approach this in a way which will be best for the long term and will be a good framework as this project grows. The first things that come to mind were: -InfoPath/SharePoint (We currently don't use SharePoint now, and wouldn't be an option for the next two years.) -Workflow Foundation (I've looked into this and does not seem too attractive or appropriate) Option I'm considering at this point: -Custom ASP.NET (VB.NET) & SQL Server, which is what my team mostly writes their apps with. -Leverage Infopath for creating the forms electronically. Wondering if there is a good approach to integrating this with a custom built ASP.NET app. -Considering creating the app as an MVC web app. My question is this: -Are there other options I might want to consider? -Are there any starter kits or VB.NET based open source projects there which would be a starting point or could be used as a good reference. Here I'm mostly concerned with the workflow processing. -Any comnments from those who have gone down this path?
