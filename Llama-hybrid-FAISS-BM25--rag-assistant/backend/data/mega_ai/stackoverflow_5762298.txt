How did you save those objects? Some sort of serialization?Did you implement java.io.Serializable ? To read a text file from the internal storage is quite easy: FileInputStream fis; try { fis = openFileInput("myfile.txt"); InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(fis); BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(isr); String data = br.readLine(); Log.i("Reading file" , data); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { Log.w("Reading file" , "Unable to open file"); } catch (IOException e) { Log.w("Reading file" , "Error reading file"); } So, basically, the only thing you need to add now is a way to parse the txt file you saved, which should not be so difficult if you know the format...
