Derivation about the clutter problem of Expectation Propagation

Recently I have read the book "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning" by Bishop, and I spent a lot of time deriving the result of the clutter problem for Expectation Propagation. But I don't know how to derive Eq.(10.217) and Eq.(10.218), as you can see in the picture: I don't understand why variable $\rho_{n}$ suddenly apperas in Eq.(10.219). I have read a lot about EP algorithms on the Internet, such as (1),(2) and (3). But almost all of them just give these conclusions without explaining how to derive them. Can anyone help me?
