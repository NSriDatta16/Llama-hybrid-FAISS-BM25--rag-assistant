I started to look at Maven 2 for its ability to manage a dependency hierarchy, but it seems to want full-fledged projects for each module. That's one way to do it. Alternatively, a multi-module Maven project can be organized like this: project module-1 src main .... test .... pom.xml module-2 src main .... test .... pom.xml ... pom.xml where each pom.xml could also refer to modules defined by other trees. BTW, the Eclipse maven plugin supports this approach as well as the more common one-module-per-project approach.
