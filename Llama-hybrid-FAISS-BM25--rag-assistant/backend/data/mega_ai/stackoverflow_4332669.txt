I see some issues: The IsolatedStorageSettings doc explicitly says not to call Save() because it's not thread safe (scroll down to the platform notes for WP) and may raise an exception (and cause your settings not to be saved). It seems not to be the case here, but using the string "myObjList" all around is pretty dangerous as it's easy to mispell. I would put it inside a constant and rule out any typing error In my experience IsolatedStorageSettings is not very robust on the current WP7 version. You better create a class and serialize it into an IsolatedStorage file. Anyways going on with your app you will probably have more things to save and you will have cleaner code that way.
