How to define custom distributions in JAGS?

I am using JAGS for simulating some MCMC distributions. I see the support for a sizeable set of distributions. But, I would like to sample out of a specific distribution that is not defiend in JAGS. Does anyone know how to write our own custom distributions? Thanks!
