I expect creating a system like digg's, you will be prone to problems like: Voting from bots to get items higher (prevent with captcha, time delay between vote ups, karma system) Organised groups of users voting eachothers stuff up (to combat this you can try comparing submissions with votes from other users. If User A always votes User B's content up, and vice versa, you have a fixed result) Plus the more common problems - mass account creations, mass automated submissions, spam being added. These are combatted using the systems you have mentioned, plus a bayesian spam filter.
