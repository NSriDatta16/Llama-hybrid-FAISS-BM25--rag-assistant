The reason that you don't have a simple iterator is that Word documents can be far more complex than the simple structure outlined in your question. For example, a document may have multiple headers and footers for the first page as well as even and odd pages, contains more than one section with different header and footer setup, contain footnotes, comments and revisions, and objects such as tables, text boxes, images and shapes may appear inline with text or floating. In short, there is no fix sequence of elements. You would have to check how complex your input documents are and based on the result of that analysis decide how to iterate over paragraphs and attached images and shapes etc.
