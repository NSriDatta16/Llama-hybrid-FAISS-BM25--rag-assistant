An answer to this question that is posted as a comment says to try a logistic regression of "alone/multiple" on the fare. This might be a good first thought, but it suffers from a few issues. Unless you are careful (more careful than many would be), you allow your analysis to check for the opposite relationship: that larger fairs are associated with less probability of the traveler being alone. It tests a strictly linear (in log-odds) relationship. Standard methods to allow GLMs to model nonlinearity, such as splines, need not require the relationship to be monotonically increasing, so your model could show a decreasing trend in a region. (I might argue that it is worth exploring if there is a region where increasing fare results in a lower probability of traveling alone, but that isn't your question.) I would argue for a one-sided Wilcoxon test to see if people traveling alone tend to have higher fares, which is logically equivalent to your question. A Wilcoxon test removes the issues related to a strictly linear relationship (just a linear shift), and it is easy to do the one-sided test. If you would use Spearman correlation to explore a similar question but with a continuous or ordinal variable instead of your alone/multiple variable, then Wilcoxon is a perfect fit, as both Wilcoxon the Spearman correlation are special cases of the proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model.
