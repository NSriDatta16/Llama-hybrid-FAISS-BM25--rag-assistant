I would write a separate unit test for each case. Basically every time you write an if or a switch inside the method you are testing it implies different unit tests to handle each case. The reason for this is that the arrange part of your unit test will be different based on which route you would like your code to take (different mock expectations, property setups, ...). Also I would recommend you to organize your unit test in the following three parts: // arrange // -> prepare mock objects, properties, setup expectations // act // -> invoke the method your are testing // assert // -> assert on the results returned by the method your are testing
