Can one use PCA to reduce the dimensionality of One-Hot-Encoded data?

I read a couple times that PCA was used as a method to reduce dimensionality for one-hot-encoded data. However, there were also some comments that using PCA is not a good idea since one-hot-encoded features only contain the values 0 or 1 which is why they will be ignored (I am not sure whether I understood the explaining correctly...). I work on an unsupervised anomaly detection project with data containing mostly cagetorical features, a bit over 200 features in total. I would like to also use a clustering method so I am not sure whether the results given by PCA are incorrect. So my question is: Is it possible to use PCA for One-Hot-Encoded data? If not, which other methods can be used ? I try to avoid t-SNE since it depends on its hyperparemeters which makes it a bit difficult in this unsupervised case.
