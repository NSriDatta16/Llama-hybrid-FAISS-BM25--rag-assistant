Gradient penalty in GAN

In WGAN( https://arxiv.org/abs/1701.07875 ), we have both gradient clipping and gradient penalty. How both differ and why does standard GAN doesn't have any kind of gradient penalty or gradient clipping. Can we have gradient penalty for standard GAN? Any Kind of reference is helpful.
