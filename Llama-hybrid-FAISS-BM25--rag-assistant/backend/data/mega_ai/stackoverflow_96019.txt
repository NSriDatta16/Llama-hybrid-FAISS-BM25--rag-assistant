Variable storage classes or type specifiers (like volatile, auto and static) define how/where variables are saved during program execution. For example, variables defined in functions are usually saved on the stack, which means that it will be lost after the function returns. Using the "static" keyword, you can force the compiler to put the variable in the data segment in memory, making the variables content persistent between calls to that function. The "register" keyword will cause the compiler to try as hard as possible to put the variable in a CPU register, useful for counters in loops etc. However, it's not guaranteed that it's actually in a register after all.
