It's Possible To Render HTML Inside a SQL Server Reporting Services 2008's Report?

I've read, that is possible to render HTML inside a SSRS 2008 report making use of the HTML Markup type of the textbox control. I'm trying to render a simple link like: My Link So the value of the placeholder would be: =" "My link " But it seems like the \" is causing problems. there is a runtime error for using such expression: The Value expression for the textrun ‘Numbers1.Paragraphs[0].TextRuns[0]’ contains an error: [BC30205] End of statement expected. (rsCompilerErrorInExpression) How do you escape the " character inside a expression? Is it possible to render HTML?
