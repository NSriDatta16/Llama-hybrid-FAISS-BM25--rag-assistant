How to find feature importance with multiple XGBoost models

My problem statement : Time Series forecasting(Month wise data), training on 96 months of data and predicting next 12 months with a 3 months empty window in between. Example : Batch 1 ***Training Data index*** ***Unused Month Window*** ***Test Month*** [Trained model with Batch 1 training data can ONLY be used for predicting this month, not any other] Batch 2 ***Training Data index*** ***Unused Month Window*** ***Test Month*** [Trained model with Batch 1 training data can ONLY be used for predicting this month, not any other] and so on till Batch 12... I am training 12 XGBoost models to get predictions for each of the 12 months of FY 18, hence getting 12 different feature importances against each model for the predictors used. But i want to report the feature importance of entire FY 18, instead of giving 12 different set of feature importances against each month. How would I approach that?? Evaluating a single model on the entire test dataset is not an option. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.
