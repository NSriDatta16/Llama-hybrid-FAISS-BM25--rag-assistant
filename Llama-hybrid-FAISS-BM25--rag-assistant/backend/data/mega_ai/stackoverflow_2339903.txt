How to show Infragistics's UltraDesktopAlert from thread

i am facing problem from many days. I have a thread listening for notificaitons from other system. whenever i receive a notification over socket i want to display it in Alert window using Infragistics's UltraDesktopAlert control. there is no winform in this class library. please tell me how to display it using a thread. a sample is here void tcpServerListenter_OnCommReceive(object sender, CommEventArgs e) { string xmlString = Encoding.UTF8.GetString((byte[])e.data); try { XDocument xmlDoc = XDocument.Parse(xmlString); var res = (from msg in xmlDoc.Descendants("consoleNotification") select msg.Element("value").Value).FirstOrDefault(); this.notificationMsg = res; } catch (Exception ex) { MessageBox.Show(ex.Message, "Error", MessageBoxButtons.OK, MessageBoxIcon.Error); return; } // here Alert window is not displaying. ultraDesktopAlert1.Show("Notification", this.notificationMsg); } but this code is not displaying alert window. i checked the following link also How to update the GUI from another thread in C#? but problem is that i have no Winform in my class library. what i wants to display alert window whenever i receive notification on socket.
