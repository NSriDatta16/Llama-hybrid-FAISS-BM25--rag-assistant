Rotation to get equal loadings in the first principal component or factor

I have the observations of $n$ variables $x_i(t)$ where $t$ is the time, and $i=1,2,\dots,n$ is the number of the variable. They're very correlated, so I wanted to use PCA. The first component explains a ton of variance, and its loadings are sort of equal $w_i\approx1/n$, but not exactly equal. I wish they were exactly equal! So, I'd like to rotate the factors such that the first component loadings would be exactly equal, i.e. $w_i=1/n$. Obviously, this is going to mess up other components (factors), but it's probably Ok. My question is how to rotate PCA factors or set up factor analysis so that my first factor would have equal loadings, and the other components were similar to PC2 and PC3 from PCA? I'm using MATLAB, but any other language would be Ok with me. UPDATE: I want my factors still be uncorrelated as in PCA. I'm assuming that since PC1 is already quite close to equal weights, then it must be possible to distort PC2 and PC3 as less as possible. PC2 and PC3 capture the slope and the curvature of variables, so it would be good to preserve this quality, but it's not essential.
