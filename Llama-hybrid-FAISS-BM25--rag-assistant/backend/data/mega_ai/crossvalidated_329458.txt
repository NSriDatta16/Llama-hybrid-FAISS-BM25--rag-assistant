ANOVA or Multiple t-tests for comparing multiple organs in two mice groups

I am comparing two mice groups (1 experimental and 1 control) but I obtain data from 4 different organs of these mice. When I order my data (using GraphPad Prism) I use a grouped table and graph to visualize it. After that I hit the Analyze button and use the default analysis Two-way anova to look for significance between my two groups in the different organs. However I also have the option to compare my groups using Multiple t-tests but I don't know if I would get more or less accurate results if I use this analysis. Which statistical analysis (ANOVA or Multiple t-tests) is better for this experimental design? Why?
