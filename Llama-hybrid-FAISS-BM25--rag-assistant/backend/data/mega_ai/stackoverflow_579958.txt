What should you name your controller in MVC? When should you create a new one?

I have a question that really applies to any MVC framework, I'm using the Zend Framework MVC. When exactly should you create a new controller? What exactly should the Controller layer define? I've created several apps with the MVC, progressively becoming more reusable, but I've always struggled with naming Controller classes. For the most part it matches whatever URL requests there are, so business/front end logic. But in some cases it seems totally arbitrary. Does anybody have some heuristics/guidelines to follow? Seems like with all the hype about MVC, especially with PHP, there is little data on actual conventions and heuristics. As it's pretty easy to create a disorganized MVC application...
