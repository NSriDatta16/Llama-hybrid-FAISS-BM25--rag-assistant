Note that XP will only increase swap in smaller increments. If your program suddenly tries to use a lot more memory and there is insufficient swap then you will get the memory error. SQLite will work quite happily with blobs up to 1GB in size and you can usually use 2GB. However you will run out of address space in a 32 bit process. It is generally recommended for larger items that you store the large data in a file and then store the filename in the database, but that is more work for you. You can solve your immediate problem by doing the following: Switch to using 64 bit. Microsoft sell a Windows 7 Family Pack that includes upgrades for 3 instances of XP/Vista for $150 (street price $130) so you can upgrade several machines. You can switch from 32 bit XP to 64 bit Win 7 this way. Just doing this will immediately solve your problem even if you do not change the amount of RAM etc. Add -1 to the pickle call which tells it to use the most recent pickle protocol that uses binary rather than the ascii default encoding. You will get less data as a result. Read the doc for more info about protocol versions and which Python versions support them. Also compress the pickled data - eg bz2.compress(pickle.dumps(obj, -1) The most likely cause of issues you have here is running out of address space. A 32 bit process will generally only be able to address 2GB of data at the same time and the various executables and shared libraries, stacks for each thread, SQLite cache etc are also subtracted from that space. You will need to pay careful attention to all the various data items you have and when they are alive. Calling del and gc.collect() when you are done with them proactively will help reduce the amount of concurrent data in use.
