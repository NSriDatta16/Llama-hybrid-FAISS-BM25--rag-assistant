RAPI (Remote API) is used for accessing the WM device from the desktop, and can be used to access files. See RAPI and CeCreateFile , or this tutorial on RAPI . You can point it to files on the storage card by the "\Storage Card\" path. But, as you notice, this is a C++ API... I'm not aware of any RAPI wrappers for Java, unfortunately.
