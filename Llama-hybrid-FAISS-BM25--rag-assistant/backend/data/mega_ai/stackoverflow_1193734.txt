Yeah, I would think you'd want to subclass the List: public class MeteoDataPointList : List { public MeteoDataPointList() { } // and now I can wrtie my custom methods specific to my data public double AverageTemperature() { double sum=0; foreach (MeteoDataPoint m in this) { sum += m.Temperature; } return sum / this.Count; } } No need to worry about a destructor. For C# you would look into implementing IDisposable, but this is mostly necessary for handling clean up of unmanaged resources (which you don't have in this case). Also, there is already an extension method for an Average function, so you could technically just use: List list and do: double avg = list.Average(point => point.Temperature); read about Extension Methods and Func Lambda Expressions are also good to know about
