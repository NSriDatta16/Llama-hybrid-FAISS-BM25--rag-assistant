Simple XML Question

Alright, using my XML editor to check the validation I'm getting "Validation stopped at line 2, column 8: no declaration found for element 'Staff'. Does anyone know why this is? Also, every three staff members are of a different type and each type include different elements (Adjunct staff members only have email, name, position for instance, while FullTime types have information for all of the elements.) Is it bad form to have element data left blank? If they're StaffMembers of a different type, is it alright to get rid of the extra elements or does every StaffMember need the same elements all the way through? Thanks!
