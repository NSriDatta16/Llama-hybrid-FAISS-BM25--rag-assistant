Confusion Matrixs for Binary classifier

I am new to modeling, and I am practicing building a logistic regression model. I would like to create a confusion matrix, but my code doesn't seem to work. Here is the code for the model (which works): from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression #train, test = train_test_split(hp[age], test_size=0.3) #from sklearn import preprocessing X = hp['age'].values.reshape((32561,1)) #X = hp[['age','hours-per-week']].values y = hp['evalinvest'].values LogReg = LogisticRegression() LogReg.fit(X,y) print(LogReg.score(X,y)) 0.916710174749 Here is where I am having diffculty: # Confusion Matrix import numpy as np from sklearn.metrics import * CM = confusion_matrix(X,y) print ("\n\nConfusion matrix:\n", CM) It runs and outputs results, but I don't feel like it is correct. Confusion matrix: [[ 0 0 0 ..., 0 0 0] [ 0 0 0 ..., 0 0 0] [385 10 0 ..., 0 0 0] ..., [ 1 0 0 ..., 0 0 0] [ 3 0 0 ..., 0 0 0] [ 33 10 0 ..., 0 0 0]] Then, when I run the following code, it doesn't work: tn, fp, fn, tp = CM.ravel() print ("\nTP, TN, FP, FN:", tp, ",", tn, ",", fp, ",", fn) error: --------------------------------------------------------------------------- ValueError Traceback (most recent call last) in () ----> 1 tn, fp, fn, tp = CM.ravel() 2 print ("\nTP, TN, FP, FN:", tp, ",", tn, ",", fp, ",", fn) ValueError: too many values to unpack (expected 4)
