From the point of intention to treat it is not necessary to take this into account because everybody should be included in the analysis in the arm to which they are randomised. The failure rate is an inherent part of the treatment. If you want to compare the effect of actually receiving the treatment in the two arms that is a different mater but from your description I assume that is unknowable. As a side issue I do not see how you can maintain masking if you are catheterising in one group but not the other. You can, and should, mask the outcome assessors but surely everybody else: patients, investigators, clinical team, ... will know. Edited in response to comments My last paragraph is not relevant now as the OP has kindly elaborated on their ingenious scheme for employing a sham catheter. Just for reference for people coming upon this who may not know about it intention to treat is described in this Wikipedia article and the alternative complier average causal effect is outlined in many articles including this open access one . There does not seem to be a Wikipedia entry for it.
