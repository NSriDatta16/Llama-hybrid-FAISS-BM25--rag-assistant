Visual Studio (with TFS) history other than solution explorer?

Has anyone ever found other ways to get a file's commit history outside of solution explorer? It's really annoying that history is so stagnant because it is a really helpful view. I just wish it would show the current file. Here is the use case. I build my gigantic solution, find random errors in files I have never heard of and want to know who's at fault. I can get to the file by double clicking from the Error List view, but right clicking doesn't work, nor does navigating View->Other Windows->History. If I can even get the history view, I just get the last history that I right-clicked from the Solution Explorer. +1 Also for anyone that has a way to find a file in the solution.
