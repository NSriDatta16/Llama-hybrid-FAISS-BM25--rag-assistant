RNN: Multiple inputs per time step with categorical variables

I am trying to a build RNN model to forecast daily sales for several different cities and different product segments (categorical features and multiple inputs for each day) along with numerical features such as traffic , temperature etc (single input for each day). How do I go about building a model using these features. I tried to label encode (Labelencoder) the categorical features and tried to successively train/update a RNN model feeding it with the time series of each city's product segment data but I ended up with huge prediction errors. Is there a way to one hot encode the categorical features and if I do use one hot encoding how do I go about it (what will be my output dimensions)
