On average there is no different in runtime. Take for example if you are searching for an item out of 10. The original algorithm will process in the following search order: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 The worse case is the last item (taking 10 steps). While the second algorithm will process in the following search order: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2 The worse case in this scenario is item 6 (taking 10 steps). There are some cases where algorithm 1 is faster. There are some cases where algorithm 2 is faster. Both take the same time on average - O(n). On a side note, it is interesting to compare this to a binary search order (on a sorted array). 4, 3, 2, 3, 1, 4, 3, 2, 4, 3 Taking at most 4 steps to complete.
