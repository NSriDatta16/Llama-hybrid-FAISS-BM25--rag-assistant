displaying categories in the left column in magento

I have recently started working in magento, and my boss has given me the task of displaying categories in the left column. I have the static html file which I pasted inside the .phtml file and called it from the xml block and it displays just the static stuff in the left column. I want them to be dynamic so that the categories can be added or removed from the backend. The html that I have is in table format and I want to insert the php code into that same html so that the design is not disturbed and it becomes dynamic.
