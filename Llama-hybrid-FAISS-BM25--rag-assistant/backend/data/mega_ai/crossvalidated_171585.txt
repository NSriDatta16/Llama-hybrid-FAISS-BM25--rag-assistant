There are both statistical and biological issues in your problem. If we could ignore the fact that your pos values are genomic loci, then the problem could be set up as a set of Chi-squared tests, as suggested by @Ryan Simmons in a comment. The Chi-squared test for each locus would determine whether the distributions of (0,1,2) "ancestry" allele counts differ between your two groups. If all you care about is the total number of "ancestry" alleles at each locus, you could just compare the average number of ancestry alleles per individual between the two groups in t -tests or in a linear model or ANOVA that includes loci as a factor. You have no pre-specified hypothesis about the loci that will differ, however, so you would have to correct any p -values for the multiple comparisons you are making: if you accept p multiple-comparisons tag on this site for extensive discussion. The origin of your data as genomic loci, however, adds additional considerations. You probably do not have 7500 independent loci, as linkage disequilibrium (co-inheritance of loci that are close on the genome) means that the "ancestry" allele counts are likely to co-vary among sites. If you ignore this issue you will get into trouble when you try to publish your results. This might actually help you identify genomic locations that differ among your 2 groups, as you should be able to use information about actual genomic locations to pool results among closely linked loci. This is an issue addressed by the Bioconductor project , which provides methods for large-scale analysis of genomic and similar data. Genetic analysis is not my expertise, but I did quickly find a snpStats package that might work for your application, or at least serve as an introduction to other related packages that might better meet your needs. In the long run you will be better off learning about methods that have been honed through experience to deal with the types of data that you have, rather than just trying to start from scratch yourself.
