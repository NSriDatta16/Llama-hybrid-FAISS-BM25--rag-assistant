Weka: ArffSaver writeIncremental() not writing to file

i am trying to create an ARFF file using ArffSaver. (i am actually converting an non-arff file that is very large.) i am trying to write the file incrementally using the writeIncremental(Instance insntance) method. unfortunately, each call to writeIncremental() results in data being written to System.out -- not to the designated file. here is a clip of my code: FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(outFilename); ArffSaver saver = new ArffSaver(); saver.setDestination(out); saver.setRetrieval(Saver.INCREMENTAL); saver.setStructure(instances); String s = null; while ((s = in.readLine()) != null) { Instance instance = toInstance(s, instances); saver.writeIncremental(instance); } saver.writeIncremental(null); any ideas on how i can get the ArffSaver to write incrementally to the file?
