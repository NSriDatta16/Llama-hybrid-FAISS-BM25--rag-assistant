You tell them. Period. Will they shoot the messenger? Maybe. But if they do then do you really want to be in business with them? More pragmatically, if they ever had a problem with their website that cost them a lot of money due to such an attack and if it ever came out that you knew about it and did nothing you'd potentially have some liability issues. Not only is it the right thing to do (to tell them) but you have a professional responsibility to do so.
