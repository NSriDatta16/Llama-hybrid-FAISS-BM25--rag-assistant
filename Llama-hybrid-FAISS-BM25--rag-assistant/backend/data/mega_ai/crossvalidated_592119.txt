Does maximum likelihood need to account for the probability of input covariates?

I am reading "Probabilistic Machine Learning" by K. Murphy. In it, he defines the likelihood of a dataset as However, this dataset $D$ is defined as: So if all $x_n, y_n$ are random variables, it would seem that one needs to account for $p(x_n|\theta)$ via conditional probability? I assume this would factor out if assumed to be a constant, but I didn't see this explicitly stated. Please excuse this potentially naive question.
