Because sales of the set did not meet expectations, no further seasons were released. In 2010, Canada's Alliance Home Entertainment released all seven seasons on DVD. Season 1 mirrored the content of the earlier MGM set, while season 2 was also uncensored, with the exception of one episode, "Paradise". Seasons 3–6 all contain numerous censored episodes, and Season 7 contains the original unedited episodes; unlike the previous seasons, it was produced with no nudity or swearing. In 2013, TGG Direct released the seventh season in the US, again unedited but of marginally inferior visual quality than the Alliance season 7 DVDs. The 5-disc set is titled The Outer Limits: The Complete Final Season, and, in 2014, it was split and re-released as a 3-disc Volume One and 2-disc Volume Two sets. Until June 2020, all seven seasons of the series were available uncut on Hulu, until January 2021 and selectively edited on Amazon Video, and seasons 1–7 are uncut on "The Roku Channel" on Roku devices. All seven seasons are on MGM+, although season 2 is missing episodes 5 ("Mind Over Matter"), 19 ("Falling Star"), and 21 ("Vanishing Act"). These three episodes are included on "The Roku Channel".
