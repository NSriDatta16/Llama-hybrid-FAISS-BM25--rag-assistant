What HTTP headers are required to refresh a page on back button

I'm trying to get a page to refresh when navigated to from the back button. From what I understand after reading around a bit I should just need to mark the page as uncacheable but I can't get any browsers to refresh the page. These are the headers I've currently got: Cache-Control:no-cache Connection:keep-alive Content-Encoding:gzip Content-Length:1832 Content-Type:text/html; charset=utf-8 Date:Mon, 07 Jun 2010 14:05:39 GMT Expires:-1 Pragma:no-cache Server:Microsoft-IIS/7.5 Vary:Accept-Encoding Via:1.1 smoothwall:800 (squid/2.7.STABLE6) X-AspNet-Version:2.0.50727 X-AspNetMvc-Version:2.0 X-Cache:MISS from smoothwall X-Powered-By:ASP.NET Why would the browser pull this page from it's browser history and not refresh it?
