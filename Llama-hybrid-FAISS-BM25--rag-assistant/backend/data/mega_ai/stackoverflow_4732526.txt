how to make an iPhone app tolerant of a CoreData schema change

I have an app that uses the CoreData APIs extensively. I'm developing an updated version that adds a few fields to an entity. My app crashes upon load (unless if I blow away the private storage and start again) because of the schema changes. The problem is when customers upgrade to the new version, I wouldn't mind running an upgrade procedure on their data the first time the app loads, but I can't even get it to load because CoreData doesn't like that the schema changes. Is there any way to sort of tell CoreData "Its ok.. don't worry about the schema change"? Because I have only added fields and haven't renamed or deleted anything.
