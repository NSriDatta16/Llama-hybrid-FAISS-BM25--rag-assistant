cover doesn't actually generate coverage statistics, only reports on it IIRC. Also, the +inc seems to need to be a part of PERL5OPT (comma separated to have -M pass them to import() , e.g. -MDevel::Cover=+inc,"/sometething" ) I could be wrong - I only ever use Devel::Cover when actually running .t files, so never tried to do "all modules in directory" approach.
