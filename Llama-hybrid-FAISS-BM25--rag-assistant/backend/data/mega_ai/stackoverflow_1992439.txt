The CSS standard says: "When a user agent cannot parse the selector (i.e., it is not valid CSS 2.1), it must ignore the selector and the following declaration block (if any) as well.", see http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/syndata.html This means you may use the rgba() and older browsers should ignore that. However, you may provide a fallback value for them (see http://css-tricks.com/rgba-browser-support/ ): background:#cfdfaf; /*works on old browsers*/ background:rgba(200, 54, 54, 0.5); /*overrides the previous declaration for new browsers*/
