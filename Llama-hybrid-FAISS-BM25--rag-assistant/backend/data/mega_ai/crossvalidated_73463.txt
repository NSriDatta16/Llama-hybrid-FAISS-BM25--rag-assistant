What does the inverse of covariance matrix say about data? (Intuitively)

I'm curious about the nature of $\Sigma^{-1}$. Can anybody tell something intuitive about "What does $\Sigma^{-1}$ say about data?" Edit: Thanks for replies After taking some great courses, I'd like to add some points: It is measure of information, i.e., $x^T\Sigma^{-1}x$ is amount of info along the direction $x$. Duality: Since $\Sigma$ is positive definite, so is $\Sigma^{-1}$, so they are dot-product norms, more precisely they are dual norms of each other, so we can derive Fenchel dual for the regularized least squares problem, and do maximization w.r.t dual problem. We can choose either of them, depending on their conditioning. Hilbert space: Columns (and rows) of $\Sigma^{-1}$ and $\Sigma$ span the same space. So there is not any advantage (other that when one of these matrices is ill-conditioned) between representation with $\Sigma^{-1}$ or $\Sigma$ Bayesian Statistics: norm of $\Sigma^{-1}$ plays an important role in the Bayesian statistics. I.e. it determined how much information we have in prior, e.g., when covariance of the prior density is like $\|\Sigma^{-1}\|\rightarrow 0 $ we have non-informative (or probably Jeffreys prior) Frequentist Statistics: It is closely related to Fisher information, using the Cramér–Rao bound. In fact, fisher information matrix (outer product of gradient of log-likelihood with itself) is Cramér–Rao bound it, i.e. $\Sigma^{-1}\preceq \mathcal{F}$ (w.r.t positive semi-definite cone, i.e. w.r.t. concentration ellipsoids). So when $\Sigma^{-1}=\mathcal{F}$ the maximum likelihood estimator is efficient, i.e. maximum information exist in the data, so frequentist regime is optimal. In simpler words, for some likelihood functions (note that functional form of the likelihood purely depend on the probablistic model which supposedly generated data, aka generative model), maximum likelihood is efficient and consistent estimator, rules like a boss. (sorry for overkilling it)
