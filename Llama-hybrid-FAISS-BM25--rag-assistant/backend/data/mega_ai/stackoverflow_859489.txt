How do I GROUP BY on every given increment of a field value?

I have a Python application. It has an SQLite database, full of data about things that happen, retrieved by a Web scraper from the Web. This data includes time-date groups, as Unix timestamps, in a column reserved for them. I want to retrieve the names of organisations that did things and count how often they did them, but to do this for each week (i.e. 604,800 seconds) I have data for. Pseudocode: for each 604800-second increment in time: select count(time), org from table group by org Essentially what I'm trying to do is iterate through the database like a list sorted on the time column, with a step value of 604800. The aim is to analyse how the distribution of different organisations in the total changed over time. If at all possible, I'd like to avoid pulling all the rows from the db and processing them in Python as this seems a) inefficient and b) probably pointless given that the data is in a database.
