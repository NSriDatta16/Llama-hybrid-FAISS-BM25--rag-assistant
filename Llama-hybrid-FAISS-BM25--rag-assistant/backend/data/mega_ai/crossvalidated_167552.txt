It depends on how near to a schedule your buses are coming at. If they were actually keeping to a regular schedule, every minute you wait is a minute closer to a bus arrival, and on average you wait half the inter-bus interval. If the buses were to arrive at varying inter-bus times, at a certain average rate per hour, you're more likely to arrive at the bus stop in a long gap than a short one. Indeed, if they arrive "effectively at random" (according to a Poisson process) it doesn't matter how long you wait, your expected remaining wait is the same. If things get worse than that (gappier/burstier than "random" arrivals, perhaps because of traffic issues) then you could be better off not waiting.
