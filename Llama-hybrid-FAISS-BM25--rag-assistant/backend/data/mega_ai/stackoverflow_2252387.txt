You can layout your view in Interface Builder. Simply drag a bunch of UIButton s in your view controller's view. To respond to events, you define an IBAction in your view controller and connect the buttons to it. This is all very basic. I really suggest that you at least walk through the iPhone programming introduction that Apple has online. It will teach you iPhone and Interface Builder basics.
