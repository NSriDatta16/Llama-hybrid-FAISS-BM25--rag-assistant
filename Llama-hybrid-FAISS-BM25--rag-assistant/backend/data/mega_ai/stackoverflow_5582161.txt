If you look at Apache Tika, there's a good example of reading some style information from a HWPF document. The code in Tika generates HTML based on the HWPF contents, but you should find that something very similar works for your case. The Tika class is https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/tika/trunk/tika-parsers/src/main/java/org/apache/tika/parser/microsoft/WordExtractor.java One thing to note about word documents is that everything in any one Character Run has the same formatting applied to it. A Paragraph is therefore made up of one or more Character Runs. Some styling is applied to a Paragraph, and other parts are done on the runs. Depending on what formatting interests you, it may therefore be on the paragraph or the run.
