Invalid content was found starting with element 'display-name' in web.xml

I am using Eclipse Helios Release. Eclipse xml validator doesn't like the display-name element under in my web.xml. Here's the relevant part: PropTax PropTax PropTax org.slco.treasurer.propertytax.servlet.PropTax (...) If I remove display-name element then there is no error anymore. If I understand correctly 2.5 is the right schema to support display-name, and even context help under the editor will list display-name as part of choice. Could anyone help me here? Error message from Eclipse validator: cvc-complex-type.2.4.a: Invalid content was found starting with element 'display-name'. One of '{"http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee":servlet-class, "http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee":jsp-file}' is expected. web.xml /PropTax/WebContent/WEB-INF line 6 XML Problem
