Please make your question more specific, in these two main areas: Project definition: What is the goal of your project? Is the input unit a single document? A list of documents? Do you intend your program to use machine learning? What is the output? How will you measure success? Your background knowledge: You intend to use linguistic rather than statistical methods. Do you have background in parsing natural language? In semantic representation? I think some of these questions are tough. I am asking them because I spent too much time trying to answer similar questions in the course of my studies. Once you get these sorted out, I may be able to give you some pointers. Mani's "Automatic Summarization" looks like a good start, at least the introductory chapters.
