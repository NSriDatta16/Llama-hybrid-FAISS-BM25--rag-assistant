Jquery setting $(this) to another element while dragging it

I am trying to set the $(this) -while dragging the- element to a new one, but I cant seem to get it to work without getting an error in my Firebug: invalid assignment left-hand side $(this) = $("#external-events.temp-class-for-detection:last"); //Gives the same result. $(this) = $("#external-events.temp-class-for-detection:last")[0]; The above examples acctualy do work in my case, but I still get the error so I assume its not the right way to do it. I have also tried other ways to do it (that dont work at all): //Does not work at all. $(this)[0] = $("#external-events.temp-class-for-detection:last")[0]; //Does not work at all. $(this)[0] = $("#external-events.temp-class-for-detection:last"); //Does not work at all. $(this).html("#external-events.temp-class-for-detection:last"); Here is a bigger picture of what I am doing: $(this).html(" "); $(this).data('eventObject', { title: event.title, id :event.id }); $(this).text(event.title); $(this).addClass("temp-class-for-detection"); $(this).addClass("external-event"); $(this).appendTo( "#external-events" ); $(this) = $("#external-events.temp-class-for-detection:last"); This may look like a terrible way to do it, but I need to move the $(this) element out of its parent div, add it to whatever div and then set $(this) back to itself. Just that now it is refrenced to another parent div. EDIT: I want to specify that this all is trying to be done while the element itself is being dragged. Also, I get the result I want in Firefox but with an error in my Firebug. In IE the element wont stick at all.
