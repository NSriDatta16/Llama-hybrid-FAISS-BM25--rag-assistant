Accumulation has a great answer on how you can come up with more examples explaining the importance of precision over recall and vice versa. Most of the other answers make a compelling case for the importance of recall so I thought I would give an example on the importance of precision. This is a completely hypothetical example, but it makes the case. Let us say that a machine learning model is created to predict whether a certain day is a good day to launch satellites or not based on the weather. If the model accidentally predicts that a good day to launch satellites is bad ( false negative ), we miss the chance to launch. This is not such a big deal. However, if the model predicts that it is a good day, but it is actually a bad day to launch the satellites( false positive ) then the satellites may be destroyed and the cost of damages will be in the billions. This is a case where precision is more important than recall.
