I'm currently experimenting with an embedded pig application which loads results into mysql via PigServer.OpenIterator and a JDBC connection. It's worked very well in testing, but I haven't tried it at scale yet. This is similar to the custom storage method already suggested, but runs from a single point, so no accidental DDOS attack. You effectively end up paying the network transfer cost twice (cluster -> staging machine, staging machine -> DB server) if you don't run the load off the DB server (I personally prefer to run nothing except the DB itself off the DB server), but that's no different than the "write the file out and bulk load it" option.
