calculate average function of several functions

I have several ordered List of X/Y Pairs and I want to calculate a ordered List of X/Y Pairs representing the average of these Lists. All these Lists (including the "average list") will then be drawn onto a chart (see example picture below). I have several problems: The different lists don't have the same amount of values The X and Y values can increase and decrease and increase (and so on) (see example picture below) I need to implement this in C#, altought I guess that's not really important for the algorithm itself. Sorry, that I can't explain my problem in a more formal or mathematical way. EDIT: I replaced the term "function" with "List of X/Y Pairs" which is less confusing.
