Uses for static generic classes?

What are the key uses of a Static Generic Class in C#? When should they be used? What examples best illustrate their usage? e.g. public static class Example { public static ... } Since you can't define extension methods in them they appear to be somewhat limited in their utility. Web references on the topic are scarce so clearly there aren't a lot of people using them. Here's a couple:- http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2005/10/05/StaticGenericClass.aspx Static Generic Class as Dictionary Summary of Answers Given The key issues appear to be "What's the difference between a static generic class with static methods and a non-generic static class with static generic members ?" The decision as to which to use appears to revolve around "Does the class need to store type-specific state internally?" If there is no need for type-specific internal storage then a static non-generic class with generic static methods appears to be preferable because the calling syntax is nicer and you can define extension methods within it.
