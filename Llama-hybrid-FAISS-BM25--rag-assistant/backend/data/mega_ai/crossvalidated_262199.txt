Given two unbiased estimators, show that a third value is also an unbiased estimator

Consider $\hat\theta_a$ and $\hat\theta_b$ are uncorrelated, unbiased estimators of $\theta$. In addition, the variance of $\hat\theta_a$ is twice that of $\hat\theta_b$. Show that for any constant $k$, the weighted average $\hat\theta_a(k)+\hat\theta_b(1-k)=\hat\theta_c$ is also an unbiased estimator of $\theta$. How should I approach this question? Should I start by figuring the variances into the equation somehow, or can it be shown just by manipulating the given equation? Thank you.
