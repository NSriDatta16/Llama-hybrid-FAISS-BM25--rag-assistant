Magento backend customer creation not syncing with api_user table

Currently, if we create a customer in the admin panel / backend of our site, that customer is unable to login using the email address we used in creating the customer profile. Even after resetting the password using a custom and self -generated one. I looked at the database and noticed that customersâ€™ emails that sign-in through the front are placed in the api_user table and customers created in the backend are placed in the customer_entity table. Anyone know why this is? Is it a latency from 1.3.2 and is hiccuping from our upgrade to 1.4.0.? Thanks again for any and all help.
