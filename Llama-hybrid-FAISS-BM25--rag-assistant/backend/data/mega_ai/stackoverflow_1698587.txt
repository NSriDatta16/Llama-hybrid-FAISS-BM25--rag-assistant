It's not a bug in Opera. It's the correct behavior : In a namespace-aware client, the name part of element type selectors (the part after the namespace separator, if it is present) will only match against the local part of the element's qualified name. In your case local name is x , and atom:x isn't even a legal local name in XML . Moreover, namespace-prefixed type selector in CSS has different syntax that doesn't use colon at all: @namespace atom url(http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom); atom|x { color: blue } Your syntax seems to rely on a quirk introduced by HTML parsers in namespace-unaware user-agents. HTML parser "eats" the colon as part of tag name and you get atom:x element in default namespace, which would match atom\:x selector, but in XML that you get x element in http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom namespace.
