I believe Evans' first couple of paragraphs on the subject is pretty clear. A service is used to place logic that doesn't naturally fit in any specific Domain object . It doesn't matter whether your service uses repositories or not - it's the behavioural logic that defines the service. Unfortunately Service is an overloaded term - it can be easy to get ' Web Services ' and ' Domain Services ' mixed up.
