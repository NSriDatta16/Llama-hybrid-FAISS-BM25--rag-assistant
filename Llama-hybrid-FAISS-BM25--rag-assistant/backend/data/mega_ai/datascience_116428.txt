why it would be improper to compute and use test set means?

I have 2 questions regarding the whole subject of the data set in machine learning and I would be happy to receive an answer :) 1.Why it would be improper to compute and use test set means and standard deviations? 2.Why we should limit how many times we use the test set, and that we should use the validation ? Tanks a lot
