NUnit 2.5.7 Breakpoint still not hit (VS2010) even after attaching to the Agent

I am having a problem hitting the break point in debugging under VS2010 under NUnit recent recommended release 2.5.7 I have tried various ways as recommended by responses on Stack Overflow: Attach to NUnit-agent.exe Run time is correctly selected to 4.0 Attaching to Nunit.exe which does not even debug symbols When attaching to the nunit-agent.exe, the symbols seem to load; however the test completes w/o hitting the breakpoint.. Anyone seen this problem??
