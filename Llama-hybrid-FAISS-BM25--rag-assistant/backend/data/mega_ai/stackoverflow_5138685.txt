$row = intval( $cat_id )( "select cat_path,cat_name from sdb_goods_cat where cat_id=".intval( $cat_id ) ); What are you trying to do? It looks like you're taking a variable, converting it to an integer, and then trying to call it like a function with a SQL query. Integers aren't functions, so this won't work. Dreamweaver is probably giving you a syntax error because what you're writing doesn't make sense. You probably want to use mysql_query like RageZ suggests. Rethink what you're trying to do.
