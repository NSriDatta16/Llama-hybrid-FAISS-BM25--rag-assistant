You can use code like list.Values[index] for a sorted list. The easiest way with a SortedDictonary would be to use the ElementAt() method: dict.ElementAt(index).Value However, this is slower than in the list case. In either case, you need to check your count. If it is odd, take index = (list.length-1) / 2 ). If it is even, take index1 = list.length/2 AND index2 = list.length/2 - 1 and average the values.
