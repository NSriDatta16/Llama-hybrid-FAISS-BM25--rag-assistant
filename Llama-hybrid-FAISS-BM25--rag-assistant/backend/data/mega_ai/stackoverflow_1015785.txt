Barry Brown's answer is correct; I would add how this is handled by NetBeans. If you look under the NetBeans installation directory, then under bin, you will see a shell script named "netbeans," which locates your JDK installation when NetBeans is started. There are third party "Uninstaller" utilities for Mac, but dragging an application from "Applictions" to the trash bin is typically how application removal is done.
