note1: you also have the probability table for $A$ . You can think of it as the CPT for $P(A|\phi)$ . note2: at least when beginning with bayesian networks, I think it helps a lot to use the full notation $P(B=b|A=a)$ , to understand what you're doing. Think of $A$ as a binary random variable that can take $a \in [0,1]$ If the network was only A->B , to derive $P(B=b|A=a)$ , you would do: $P(A=a, B=b) = P(A=a)P(B=b|A=a)$ $P(B=b) = \sum_{a\in A}P(A=a)P(B=b|A=a)$ so: $P(A=a|B=b) = \frac{P(A=a,B=b)}{P(B=b)}$ for 3 variables, just apply these Bayesian equations more.
