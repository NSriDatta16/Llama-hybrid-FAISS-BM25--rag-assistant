Time series analysis with 'missing values' in dependent variable

I am seeking to predict the price of a financial time series based on a number of features. The price data of the dependent variable is obviously only available for trading days. However, I have some variables that generate data every day. Over the weekend, these variables could then have 'jumps' if I were to only include the values that are on a trading day. What are the best practices to deal with this issue?
