You specify no padding in your C# declaration of the struct, but not in the C++ version. Since you are mixing char arrays that are not all multiples of four and an odd number of 2 byte shorts, the compiler is probably inserting padding within the struct and add the end. Try wrapping the struct in a #pragma pack to ensure no padding. #pragma pack(push) #pragma pack(1) // The struct #pragma pack(pop)
