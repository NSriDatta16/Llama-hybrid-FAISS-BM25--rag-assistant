Do I need to rescale dummy variables for PCA?

I am wondering if for a PCA for which I rescale my numeric variables, I need to rescale my dummy variables as well ? I have read on the internet that I should not but I do not see why. I guess the question is very similar to this one : whether to rescale indicator / binary / dummy predictors for LASSO but I was not sure about the answer. If it is no, please explain why. Thanks
