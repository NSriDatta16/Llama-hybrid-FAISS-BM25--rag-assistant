First of all... that was an ugly paragraph to read :P Regarding your question, if you are using .NET, why not go with SQL Server Compact (mdf file)? It is like working with SQL Server, but the data is stored in a file. I personally think that's the best way to go, but if you want choices then I guess you could consider Excel file Comma separated text file MS Access Database ?
