I'd consider embedding lua . Its fast, lightweight and ansi C. And its been specifically designed for embedding. Used by many games as their scripting language. (IMO much easier to embed than python or perl) Here's a complete example to show how trivial it is extern "C" { #include "lua.h" #include "lauxlib.h" #include "lualib.h" } #include #include int main() { std::string expression = "12+(3.0*(4)-1)/math.sqrt(121)"; lua_State * L = lua_open(); luaopen_math(L); if( luaL_dostring(L, ("return "+expression).c_str()) != 0 ) { std::cout
