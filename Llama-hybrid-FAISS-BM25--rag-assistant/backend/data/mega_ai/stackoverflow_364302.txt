There is no single criterion that distinguishes a good routine from a bad one. Among the criteria are: conceptual integrity: it does something that can be described in a simple short form, one sentence or paragraph; loose coupling: its behavior is not sensitive to what goes on in code around it; reasonable size: long routines are harder to read and understand, and are less likely to have good conceptual integrity; Parnas's criterion: they "hide" one thing that can change, so that requirements changes have limited effect on the rest of the system.
