I've been working in Silverlight full time now for about 6 months. It's a great technology. It's really a refreshingly wonderful take on creating applications. Microsoft is wisely leveraging it for other outlets too, like Windows Phone 7 and I wouldn't be surprised at all if Silverlight was the platform of choice if/when MS comes out with the tablet they've been talking about. Microsoft really went back to square one and got a lot of things right with Silverlight. it really promotes high quality code if you take the time to really learn the best patterns and practices. The separation of logic and UI is second to none in Silverlight/WPF. Blend is also shaping up to be an incredibly powerful tool for designing very compelling UIs. Will Silverlight really take off? I have my doubts. When MS first came out with Silverlight a few years ago, I don't think they were expecting the wrench to be thrown at them that is HTML5. Google and Apple are majorly behind HTML5, not to mention it being more open makes it a very worthy threat to Silverlight. Silverlight also has some serious problems that need to be addressed ASAP before it can really take off as a fantastic platform. RIA Services (the new, primary means of working with a data layer in Silverlight apps) is very young, raw, buggy and in many ways just plain not good. Other things like the Navigation framework have also left me a bit underwhelmed. Not to mention Silverlight having its own CLR means you lose a lot of the nice .NET tools out there. In a lot of ways, Silverlight is starting over from scratch. But all in all, Silverlight really is fantastically well thought out and very, very powerful. If it takes off, in a lot of ways it will be nice. But I'm also not counting on it. Stay open to other ideas, keep your skillset sharp.
