About Tentative definition

I read from a book about tentative defination that, A tentative definition is any external data declaration that has no storage class specifier and no initializer. A tentative definition becomes a full definition if the end of the translation unit is reached and no definition has appeared with an initializer for the identifier Please explain what the above statement means. Also, the difference between Declaration and Definition? I got mixed up due to this. :( And why doesn't this program give an error: #include int a; //Tentative definition int a; //similarly this declaration too. int main() //not getting any error with this code why its so? { printf("hi"); } Also, what is wrong with this code: #include printf("Hi"); int main(void){ return 0; }
