Magento: adding catalog price rules to options of a bundle

I've looking around and couldn't find how to do this. I'd like to be able to set a catalog price rule for a specific option of a bundled product. Basically I want to set the price of any selection from option1 to be $0 in that bundle (but keep the price the same for that product if someone just adds the product to their cart from outside of the bundle). is there a way to do this that i'm missing? The second approach I was thinking was to set the price to $0 of all those selections for that option (i saw a post on here on how to do something like that programatically) although without testing that that works, it seems like it wouldn't. any ideas would be welcome.
