A perceptron is simply a single-layer neural network. When we refer to neural networks more broadly, we are referring to multi-layer perceptrons because these typically have more than one hidden layer. It is an algorithm that is used specifically for training of binary classifiers. You might find the following of use: "Support Vector Machines and Perceptrons: Learning, Optimization, Classification, and Application to Social Networks", by Murty and Raghava. The book focuses on application of SVMs and perceptrons to social networks, but given this area relies significantly on data mining to conduct analysis, there might be some good examples here. "Neural Networks and Genome Informatics, Volume 1 (Methods in Computational Biology and Biochemistry)" by Wu and McLarty describes how to apply neural networks to the field of genome informatics, and may be quite informative in this regard.

I have not read the titles personally, but anticipate that they might be useful for the information you are seeking.
