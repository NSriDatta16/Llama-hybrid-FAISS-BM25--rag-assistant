"Inside the XIB file I have set the file owner to myViewController ..." I'm not sure what you are doing here. I think this is where the problem is. How many items do you have on the top level of your XIB? It should just be File's Owner, First Responser and a View. If there is another controller object in here, that's your problem. Get rid of it. "...and set the UIViewController identity class to myViewController as well" This part is correct. To connect your custom UIViewController to the XIB, clock on your "File's Owner", go to the "Identity Inspector" then look under "Class Identity" at the "Class" field. Set this to 'myViewController' (or whatever you named it). At this point you should do 1 ctrl-drag from your File's Owner for each outlet you have setup.
