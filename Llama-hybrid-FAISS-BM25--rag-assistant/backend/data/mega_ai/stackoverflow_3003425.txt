If you're on 3.1.3 firmware you can use the touchesBegan , touchesChanged , and touchesEnded methods. If you were to do an iPad app on 3.2, you'd have access to gesture recognizers such as UIPanGestureRecognizer - which provides the same basic functionality but also gives you some extra information. The problem here is that they will not give you a smooth line without some extra work on your part, but these are the basic ways to handle finger tracking. Unfortunately I don't have any examples to give you, but check out the stuff I mentioned in the developer documentation. You should be able to at least get started from that. I'm uncertain if gesture recognizers are available in 4.0. Might be worth checking out.
