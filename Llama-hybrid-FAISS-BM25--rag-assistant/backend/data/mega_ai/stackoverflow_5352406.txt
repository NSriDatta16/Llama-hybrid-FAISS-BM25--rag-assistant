Adding Windows Workflow to Custom Build Process (TFS 2010)

I have a minor problem regarding my Custom Build Process Workflow in Team Foundation Server 2010. At the moment, I have 2 custom workflows, one for Server Builds (.WSP Sharepoint packages) and one for client builds (.MSI Packages). These workflows have some separate steps but also a few steps which should apply for both. For reasons of simplicity, I want "customize" as much as possible, directly in XAML Workflows, instead of creating Custom Activities. One of these Custom Workflows, is a workflow which Signs .MSI and .WSP packages, which is relevant for both my Server- and my Client Build Process. The problem is that, unlike my Custom Code Activities, I can't add the "Activities" the Workflows creates to my Custom Build Process and neither do I want to copy all the whole Workflow Sequence into my Custom Workflow (this would neither be best practice, as I would have to make changes to places evert time I modified it). I think has something to do with the fact that Custom Code Activities are sealed and the fact that you have to write "[BuildActivity(HostEnvironmentOption.Agent)]" before the class definition, which really isn't possible when creating a simple workflow :-) Does anybody know a solution to this problem? Best Regards, Christian
