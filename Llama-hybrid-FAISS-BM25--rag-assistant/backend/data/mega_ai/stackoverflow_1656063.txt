If there aren't too many other listeners on some_form + submit -event or you control all others you could get at it with var boundSubmitEvents = some_form.getStorage().get('prototype_event_registry').get('submit'); boundSubmitEvents.each(function(wrapper){ //do with wrapper.handler whatever }) btw. what do you mean with grab that anonymous event handler back out
