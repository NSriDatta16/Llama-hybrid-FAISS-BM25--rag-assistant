These should provide the information you're looking for: http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q22 http://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_enable In short, versions before 3.6.19 don't enforce foreign keys at all, but they can be simulated using triggers; starting with 3.6.19, foreign keys can be enforced, but this needs to be enabled per connection using the PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON statement, and sqlite must be compiled with trigger and foreign key support enabled (which I'd expect to be the case for any binary distribution).
