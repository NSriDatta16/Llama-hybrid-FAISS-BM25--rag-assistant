Understanding a Definitional PCA Equation

I am trying to understand the following about Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Together, the first $M$ principal component score vectors, $z_{im}$ , and the first $M$ principal component loading vectors, $\phi_{jm}$ , provide the best $M$ -dimensional approximation (in terms of Euclidean distance) to the $i$ th observation $x_{ij}$ . This representation can be written as $$x_{ij}\approx\sum_{m=1}^M z_{im} \phi_{jm},$$ assuming the original data matrix $\vec{X}$ is column-centered. This equation makes conceptual sense to me, but it does not make sense mathematically. By definition, the $m$ th principal component scores are given by $$z_{im} = \phi_{1m}x_{i1}+\dots+\phi_{pm}x_{ip}=\sum_{j=1}^p \phi_{jm}x_{ij}$$ Do these two equations not contradict each other? Is there some other relationship between these two equations?
