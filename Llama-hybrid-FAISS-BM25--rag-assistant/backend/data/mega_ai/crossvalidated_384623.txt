The JB-test (Jarque-Bera test) is a test of normality, not of heteroskedasticity. The JB-test tests whether your sample of data has the same skewness and kurtosis as the normal distribution. You'll recall that the normal distribution has skewness = 0 and kurtosis = 3 (or excess kurtosis = 0). In the first test, you tested for both simultaneously, whereas in the second and third tests you tested for these separately. However, all three tests are test of normality, not heteroskedasticity. See the Breusch-Pagan test for a test of heteroskedasticity.
