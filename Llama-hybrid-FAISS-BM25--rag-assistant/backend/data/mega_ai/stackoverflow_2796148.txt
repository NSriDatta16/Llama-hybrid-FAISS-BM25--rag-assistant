An obvious solution is to send the software to the end user on a bootable CD. The user simply restarts their computer and they're now on a non compromised computer. However, this is not terribly simple to develop (trying to make the OS on the CD compatible with all the variations of hardware we're going to encounter on machines). Also, I can't imagine that the average home user has their BIOS set to "Boot from CD" and telling voters to modify their BIOS settings is just going to far.
