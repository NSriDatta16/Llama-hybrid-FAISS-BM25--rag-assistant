Normal distribution vs Lognormal distribution for residuals in Bayesian linear models

When should I use normal distributions for residuals, and when should I use lognormal distribution in Bayesian linear regression? For example, if I want to create a regression model for chemical exposure (exposures are positive values and distributed lognormal) across time I have four options on disposal: log-log model (power model): y=a*t^b -> ln(y) = ln(a) + b*ln(t) , log-lin model (exponential model): y=a*exp(b*t) -> ln(y) = ln(a) + t*b , and lin-log model: exp(y)=exp(a)*t^b -> y = a + b*ln(t) lin-regression: y = a + b*t The first two models convert lognormally distributed y to normally distributed ln(y) , and I can use, in Bayesian linear regression, a normal distribution for residuals, but the last two models don't. Should I change a line in the code that specifies the normal distribution for residuals to use lognormal distribution in the last two cases? BTW, are there any other decay models that I can transform and use with the linear model? Any help is welcome!
