Ignore #pragma comment(lib, ...)?

I'm attempting to perform a link of previously generated .obj files (using the latest version of MSVC). When those .obj's were created, the source code specified: #pragma comment(lib, ...) As such, the linker is attempting to link against static libraries specified in the source. Is there a way to instruct the linker to ignore these libraries, so I can specify my own? e.g., if a piece of source did the following: #pragma comment(lib, foo.lib) At link time, I'd like the linker to ignore 'foo.lib', and instead link against 'bar.lib'.
