Java logging best practices about logger name

I just ask about the logger name... It it possible to give a custom name for a logger, or to use class name. But what to use in which case? -> Using a custom name for each application module: some classes are used by 2 modules -> to which logger name should it belong to? -> Using classname: it seems to require a good package organisation -> best practices for logging known about that?
