I had almost the same problem: 'restoring' age, gender, location for social network users. But I used users' ego-networks, not visited sites statistics. And I faced with two almost independent tasks: 'Restoring' or 'predicting' data. You can use a bunch of different technics to complete this task, but my vote is for simplest ones (KISS, yes). E.g., in my case, for age prediction, mean of ego-network users' ages gave satisfactory results (for about 70% of users error was less than +/-3 years, in my case it was enough). It's just an idea, but you can try to use for age prediction weighted average, defining weight as similarity measure between visited sites sets of current user and others. Evaluating prediction quality. Algorithm from task-1 will produce prediction almost in all cases. And second task is to determine, if prediction is reliable. E.g., in case of ego network and age prediction: can we trust in prediction, if a user has only one 'friend' in his ego network? This task is more about machine-learning: it's a binary classification problem. You need to compose features set, form training and test samples from your data with both right and wrong predictions. Creating appropriate classifier will help you to filter out unpredictable users. But you need to determine, what are your features set. I used a number of network metrics, and summary statistics on feature of interest distribution among ego-network. This approach wouldn't populate all the gaps, but only predictable ones.
