I think the best method, in your case, is to factor analyze the polychoric correlation matrix. In R, the 'psych' package allows you to perform the polychoric factor analysis (by the fa.poly command) and also to compute the factor scores. Here the documentation and this web page may be useful. Moreover, the 'psych' package contains the fa.parallel.poly function, that is very useful to choose the optimal number of factors to retain by Monte Carlo simulation. With the missing values, you can either exlude them from analysis or replace them with the mean or the median values. Here is a recent paper that confirms the superiority of the polychoric factor analysis: Holgado–Tello, F. C., Chacón–Moscoso, S., Barbero–García, I., & Vila–Abad E. (2010). Polychoric versus Pearson correlations in exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of ordinal variables. Quality and quantity, 44 (1) , 153-166. In response to your second questions, principal component analysis and factor analysis are not the same thing . If your aim is to simply reduce your data, so principal component is the election technique. Otherwise, if you want to explore the underlying dimensions of your questionnaire, you have to use factor analysis. In PCA, the components derive from the variables (by maximizing the variance), while in FA are the factors that explain the variables, so the pattern is opposite. To my knowledge, this is the only important aspect to keep in consideration when you have to choose between the two methods. fa.poly conducts a FA, and you can specify the factoring method (GLS, WLS, PF...). If you want to conduct a PCA, I think you can use principal , but submitting to the analysis not the raw data but the polychoric correlations matrix. Check the 'psych' documentation for these aspects, I never done a categorical principal component analysis.
