Mitigating cell count <5 or almost zero

Mitigating problem when cell count $ or almost zero a. 2x2 table with cell count zero b. When event rate is small in logistic regression: such that when seen further by an independent categorical variable it leads cell counts less than 5 or almost zero. Are these options? One is to take this variable out of the regression model. It might not be a good option, but it could help in verifying the problem. The other option is to collapse across some of the categories to increase the cell size.
