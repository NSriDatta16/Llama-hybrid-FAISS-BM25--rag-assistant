I think it depends on the level of JavaScript expertise we're talking about. If we're talking from the beginner through intermediate perspective, the drawback is that it can be a crutch preventing developers from honing their native JS skills (on the other hand, it can also be a bridge INTO JS development - it certainly has been for me). Once you become interested in working more in pure JS, the main drawback is that it is DOM-centric. As your programming becomes more data-focused, the bias towards the DOM can sometimes get in the way. It can also get a bit tricky to keep all your code organized as your code gets larger. I think what I would most like to see going forward is some sort of dependency management - eg, let my scripts auto-load, or not, any needed plugins and components. Having said all that, I am definitely a fan of jQuery and it is my JS library of choice. I find the strengths far outweigh the weaknesses, and that it is improving all the time.
