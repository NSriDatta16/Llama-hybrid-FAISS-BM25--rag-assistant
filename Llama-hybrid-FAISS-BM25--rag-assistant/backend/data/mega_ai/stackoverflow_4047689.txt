Lookup telephone area code by latitude and longitude

Looking for a way to get a list of telephone area codes for a given latitude and longitude (and if necessary a given intl. code.) Note, I'm not talking about international dialing prefixes but the area codes within them. For example, Denver Colorado is covered by the area codes 303 and 720. It's at 39.739 -104.985 and is in NANP 1. So given 39.739,-104.985,1 I'd like to get back [303,720]. Libraries, web services, DB's, or raw data that needs to be parsed into a DB, e.g., a web page of shape points, are all fine and the more global coverage the better, but just NANP 1 would be a great help. Note I already use MaxMind and could turn the lat-lng into a fake IP and use that as the lookup key, but MaxMind claims only U.S. area codes (whether they truly mean U.S. or actually NANP I haven't tested) and seemingly only 1 per location (e.g. just 303 for Denver.) So it's a possibility, just not a great one. UPDATE : I found some more relevant information, but no definitive solutions so I'm listing it here rather than in an answer: I was able to find two U.S. databases http://www.area-codes.com/area-code-database.asp and http://www.nationalnanpa.com/area_codes/index.html (50% down the page, MS Access file.) The former includes lat/lng for $450 and the latter would require nearest-neighbor matching as KeithS talks about (it's probably the same DB underlying the NANPA City Query he found.) Additionally I found information that implies Teleatlas has area code boundary maps and that ESRI includes area code shape files with copies of ArcGIS. Maponics seems to have data available: there's a Google Maps implementation of Maponics' data at http://www.usnaviguide.com/areacode.htm .
