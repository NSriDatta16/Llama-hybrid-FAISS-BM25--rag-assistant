Usefulness of univariate time series methods

When are time series techniques (such as ARIMA and GARCH for exams) more useful in forecasting than simple eyeballing in the univariate case? I find that often eyeballing can give better point estimates than ARIMA sometimes. So what is the point of the models? Is it to be able to incorporate the forecast intervals? Can their point estimates be better simply looking at the trend and extrapolating?
