Does correlation assume stationarity of data?

Inter-market analysis is a method of modeling market behavior by means of finding relationships between different markets. Often times, a correlation is computed between two markets, say S&P 500 and 30-Year US treasuries. These computations are more often than not based on price data, which is obvious to everyone that it does not fit the definition of stationary time series. Possible solutions aside (using returns instead), is the computation of correlation whose data is non-stationary even a valid statistical calculation? Would you say that such a correlation calculation is somewhat unreliable, or just plain nonsense?
