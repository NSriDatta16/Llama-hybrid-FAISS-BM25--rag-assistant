Whether looking at 3-gram/4-gram is enough to tell if a document is biased towards John or Joann can be quantified by looking at the classification performance. Such n-grams may not capture very well the quality of writing (though they could still produce a decent approximation {1}) but it should capture the domain well. FYI: Different ways to produce a confidence interval for odds ratio from logistic regression one can also extract the most predictive n-grams in convolutional neural networks e.g. see https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.08705 Tables 4 and 5.

RECITAL. 2012. http://francky.me/doc/TALN-JEP-RECITAL-2012-article-reviewed_en.pdf : Early research on the automatic evaluation systems appeared fifty years ago. One of the notable projects was the Project Essay Grade, led by Ellis Batten Page at Duke University (Page, 1968). His work was based on the use of stylistic features of the response of the learner, such as word size and number of prepositions, to predict the human note of correction.
