I made a major miscalculation in the early 90s when I said that the Internet would never take off because the browsers at the time were not consumer-friendly. Microsoft came out with IE and pretty much changed the game overnight. I'm not going to be wrong about a major shift again. It's just a matter of time before individuals leverage a MobileMe-type computing infrastructure and businesses shift costly IT infrastructure to third parties. My only realistic cavaet about cloud computing all along has been that users and corporations don't like the idea of personal or valuable information being off premises. Slowly but surely whether it be trusting social networks or relying on SaaS, everything is trending towards trusting the cloud: the core benefit being cost. Once that trust is fully established it'll be hard for anything to stop the momentum.
