jqtouch mobile app ajax loading issue

I simplified this question at SIMPLIFIED: jqtouch mobile app ajax loading issue But am leaving this post for details. Thanks. I have an RSS Reader app I use as a playground to learn. It's current incarnation is for learning about jqtouch/mobile app stuff. I'm having a problem dynamically loading the posts because jqtouch takes over the 'a' and does stuff with it. Here's the general process: - Page loads general html (this is very basic, a couple of empty divs between the body tags) and a link to the reader - when the document is ready, the first thing that fires is an ajax call that gets a list of the blogs I'm following that have unread posts and appends it to the proper divs - when I click the link to the reader, all the blog titles are there - I click a blog title and it is to load all of the unread posts The problem is, jqtouch & iui both seemingly force you to use an "a" tag to go between pages/cards and I want to dynamically load the blog posts as they are needed, for speed (and eventually I will be implementing a manifest and localStorage). For what I want to do, it's important that I load it with JSON. I want to make this as fast and efficient as possible. I'd prefer to bind/live a click to a div not an "a" which would give me the ability to do a lot more with the click besides just jumping to the new page/card. Here's the HTML portion: TERSE teRSSe Loading, please wait ... Here's what is fired when the page loads: $(document).ready(function() { // onload $.ajax({ type: 'GET', url: '/ajax/feeds', dataType: 'json', success: function(data) { append_feeds(data); }, async: true }); // ... This is the function that adds in the feed titles: function append_feeds(data) { var feeds = ''; // loop 1, add the links that will be shown in the main feeds block for ( i=0; i \n'; feeds = feeds+ ' '+this_data.title+' &nbsp; ('+this_data.unread+' unread) \n'; feeds = feeds+' \n'; } $('#feeds').html(' \n RSS \n Back \n \n \n'+feeds+' \n'); // loop 2; 2nd time around to create pages/cards for each blog // this is where the individual posts will load when the blog // title is clicked for ( i=0; i \n'; A = A + ' '+this_data.title+' \n'; A = A + ' \n'; A = A + ' loading '+this_data.title+' ... \n'; A = A + ' \n'; A = A + ' \n'; $('body').append(A); } } By now, we have the basic html, and append_feeds() has stuffed a bunch of divs/uls with the titles + num_unread of the blogs I am following. In addition, I've set up other divs to be the target of the links, one for each blog. These are "pages" or "cards". But, when I click on the title of the blog, I want to 1st grab all of the posts for the single blog using ajax/json, then update the proper feed's div, and load the page/card (basically jqtouch and iui pull out the div matching the ID of the hash in the href=""). I've tried bind/live to the click/tap events but jqt/iui seemlingly take over the call. I would skip the "a" tag altogether and just bind a click to "li.post" or something, but jqtouch doesn't recognize it as a click. It seems to only want to allow me to use actual links as click events.
