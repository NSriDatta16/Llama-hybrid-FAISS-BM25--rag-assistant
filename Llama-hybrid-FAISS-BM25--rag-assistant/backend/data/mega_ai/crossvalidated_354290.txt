The sample mean is never truly zero, it's close though. If you could measure the mean of an infinite sample from a Standard Normal Distribution, that would be zero, by definition. This is what you get if you simulate 10 values from a standard distribution: [1] 1.2240818 0.3598138 0.4007715 0.1106827 -0.5558411 1.7869131 0.4978505 -1.9666172 0.7013559 -0.4727914 and the mean is: -0.4245589 If n = 100 , then the mean is: 0.02161711 For n = 10000 , then: -0.002404524 As n gets bigger, you get closer to the truth (ie: mean = 0). there must be a value that will be an average of all the values throughout the distribution Zero is a value, the same principle will hold if you simulate from a distribustion with mean = 3, for example. [1] 4.208902 3.431187 2.652505 1.998890 3.677987 3.498629 2.734247 4.564173 1.229492 2.982534 And the mean is infact close to the expected (3): 2.93444 (with a relative small sample)
