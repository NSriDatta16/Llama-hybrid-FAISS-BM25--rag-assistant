If you are using the standard "Wald" confidence interval it is common to get values outside of the possible range (0,100) because it is a symmetric interval. I highly recommend some more sophisticated confidence intervals which are able to avoid this and have better coverage probability: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval
