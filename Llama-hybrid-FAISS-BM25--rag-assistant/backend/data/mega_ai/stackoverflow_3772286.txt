Using HTML markup instead of classes in a JavaScript drop-down menu

I got a piece of JavaScript from a training video, but I do not like how the HTML that associated with it is built. It's an accordion-style drop down menu, and it uses classes on each of the menu items that initiate the drop-down effect. I'll post my code and explain after... window.onload = initAll; function initAll() { var allLinks = document.getElementsByTagName('a'); for (var i=0;i -1) { allLinks[i].onclick = toggleMenu; } } } function toggleMenu() { var startMenu = this.href.lastIndexOf('/')+1; var stopMenu = this.href.lastIndexOf('.'); var thisMenuName = this.href.substring(startMenu,stopMenu); var thisMenu = document.getElementById(thisMenuName).style; if (thisMenu.display == 'block') { thisMenu.display = 'none'; } else { thisMenu.display = 'block'; } return false; } body { background-color: white; color: black; } div { padding-bottom: 10px; background-color: #6FF; width: 220px; } ul.menu { display: none; list-style-type: none; margin-top: 5px; } a.menuLink { font-size: 16px; font-weight: bold; } a { text-decoration: none; } Comedies All's Well That Ends Well As You Like It Love's Labour's Lost The Comedy of Errors Tragedies Anthony &amp; Cleopatra Hamlet Romeo &amp; Juliet Histories Henry IV, Part 1 Henry IV, Part 2 I would like the HTML to not use classes or IDs, and instead use pure HTML markup and work the same exact way. I'm no good enough at JavaScript to figure out how to do this, so I was hoping someone could modify this code to make it work the way I'd like it to. I would also like to keep , so it would be awesome if the script could run based on that ID so I can put other ul's on the page without them interfering with each other. Thank you!
