Significance level on real life

Recently I was reading a problem for one-tailed test, a fragment in the resolution demanded my attention: "As noted in the preceding section, the level of significance, denoted by Î± , is the probability of making a Type I error by rejecting Ho when the null hypothesis is true as an equality. The decision maker must specify the level of significance. If the cost of making a Type I error is high, a small value should be chosen for the level of significance. If the cost is not high, a larger value is more appropriate". ("Statistics for Business and Economics", Anderson, 11ed, page 357) We know the concept for level of significance, but the question is... based on what we assign a value for significance level? when a high value? when a small value? how do we determine the cost of making a certain type of error into business or research? In few words, how does the level of significance is worked on real life?
