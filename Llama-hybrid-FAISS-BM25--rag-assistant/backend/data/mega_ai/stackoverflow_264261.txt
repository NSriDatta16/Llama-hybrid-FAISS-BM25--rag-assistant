What are you trying to achieve? I suspect that the biggest objection to using MFS_DEFAULT for a purpose other than the one for which it was intended is that you're violating a visual convention Microsoft is trying to promulgate about what bolded menu items mean, and how a user (or an assistive program such as a screen reader) should react upon encountering one. If all you're trying to do is call the user's attention to a few menu items that are of particular interest -- well, that seems a bit strange, but it also seems fairly innocent, and I'd be surprised if it caused you enormous problems down the road. Anything's possible, of course! Still, I'd wonder about what exactly you were up to. If you're trying to expose part of your program's state by bolding and unbolding menu items -- that seems a little bit unexpected to me, but I'd hate to pass judgement before hearing the specifics. If you have some other goal in mind -- like maybe you think the default font for menus is ugly and you like it better when everything is bolded -- then the method you've discovered might be expedient, but there might also be a better way to get exactly what you want, which we could discuss in more detail (perhaps in a separate question) if you were willing. I doubt this is the case, but who knows?
