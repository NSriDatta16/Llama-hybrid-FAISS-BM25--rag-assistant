The multiprocessing module works fine on Windows. See the documentation here (end of first paragraph): http://docs.python.org/library/multiprocessing.html On the wxPython IRC channel, we had a couple fellows trying multiprocessing out and they said it worked. Unfortunately, I have yet to see anyone who has written up a good example of multiprocessing and wxPython. If you (or anyone else on here) come up with something, please add it to the wxPython wiki page on threading here: http://wiki.wxpython.org/LongRunningTasks You might want to check that page out regardless as it has several interesting examples using threads and queues.
