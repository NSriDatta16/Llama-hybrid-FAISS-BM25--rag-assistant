If the elements of the mixture are either Betas or Beta-Binomial, I would suggest using a mixture of both, $$\sum_{k=1}^{K_1} \omega\pi_k\, f(\cdot|\theta_k) + \sum_{k=1}^{K_2} (1-\omega)\varpi_k\, g(\cdot|\eta_k)$$ and solving the estimation in a Bayesian manner, using as a prior on $\omega$ a distribution peaked at zero and one. And estimate $K_1$ and $K_2$ by either a reversible jump algorithm à la Richardson and Green (1997) or by a saturated scheme à la Rousseau and Mengersen (2012).
