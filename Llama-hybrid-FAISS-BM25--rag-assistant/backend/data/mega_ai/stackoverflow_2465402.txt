How to show validation messages in MVC?

When a user tries to click: Save and they have entered in some invalid data, i want to notify them. This can be with methods such as: directing their attention to the thing that needs their attention with a balloon hint automatically dropping down a combo-box triggering an animation showing a modal dialog box etc What is the mechanism where a controller tells the view to show a validation message for some controls, given that different views have different notification methods? p.s. the controller doesn't know the order that controls are physically arranged in the view (e.g. LTR locale wants to notify the user in a top-down-left-to-right visual order, while RTL locale wants to notify the user in a bottom-up-right-to-left order)
