You can find people talking about deploying the JDBC driver to talk to PostgreSQL on the pgandroid mailing list. Some examples there and if you run into problems that's the right place to ask for help. I believe the regular .jar files work fine with recent Android versions, but you may have to patch things to add compatibility with older Android versions. The other option if you don't want to use Java/JDBC is to use the psqldroid library.
