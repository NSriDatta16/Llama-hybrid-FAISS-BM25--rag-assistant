Is Hyperparameter Optimization A Discrete Or Continuous Problem?

I'm currently learning AI/machine-learning with Python and Scikit-learn. Not having a strong background in math, I'm confused on a certain point. Say I want to tune the parameters of a machine learning model in order to reduce its error rate. For an example, let's use a support vector machine . Some of the several parameters it accepts are floats, others are integers or booleans, yet others are strings. Would searching over the space of parameter values in order to reduce the error rate be considered a discrete, or continuous optimization problem?
