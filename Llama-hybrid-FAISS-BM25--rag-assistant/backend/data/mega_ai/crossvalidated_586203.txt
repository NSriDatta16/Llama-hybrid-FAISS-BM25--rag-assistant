I do not see anything here unique to logistic regression. Plenty of people misinterpret p-values, whether for linear regression coefficients, logistic regression coefficient, coefficients for other generalized linear models, or from other tests. Itâ€™s basically all the same combination of misinterpreting the p-value to be the effect size and the posterior probability of the null hypothesis. (Note that the p-value neither (exclusively) measures effect size nor is the (posterior) probability of the null hypothesis being true.)
