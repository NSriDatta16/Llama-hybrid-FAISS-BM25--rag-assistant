Standardization before applying ANOVA?

I have a matrix where the rows are the data points (samples) and the columns are the features. It is a multiclass (4 classes) problem. On this data I want to apply machine learning classifiers. But first I want to do feature selection by using ANOVA. For this I use Matlab's anova1 method. Should I standardize (zero mean and unit variance) the feature or samples before applying ANOVA? And if so should I standardize the features (i.e. each column) or the data points (each row)? Second, should I pick the features which give the highest values after ANOVA or the one which give the lowest (or near zero)?
