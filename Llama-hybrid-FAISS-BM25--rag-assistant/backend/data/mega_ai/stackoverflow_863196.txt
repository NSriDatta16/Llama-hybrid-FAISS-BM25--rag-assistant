XSL Traversing Question (with Server Error:)

I have, what I believe to be, an interesting situation at hand. I have a car garage XML and am transforming it (using XSL) into HTML. CAR XML: Car001 Blue Unleaded I only want to print out & but want to set the as href in a HTML link. CAR XSL: This enables me to achieve my goal of setting the tag as the href value. BUT a problem occurs...all of the values of licensePlate are printed to screen. Can someone recommend how to prevent it from printing to screen? I have tried commenting out but I think this affects the preceeding-sibling:: statement as I receive an error I have also received this error when trying to apply a CSS display:none . Thankyou for your time and patience, Lucas
