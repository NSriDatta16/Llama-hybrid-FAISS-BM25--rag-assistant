Magento performance question

I have an installation of 1.3.2.4 running two Store Views and 2,734 products. The site sees around 15,000 visits a month. Apache and MySQL (mostly Apache) hovers at around 1.5 GB RAM usage most of the time and peaks over 3 GB. My questions is, considering the stats, is this normal? Seems like a lot. If that memory usage is in fact abnormal, would an upgrade to 1.4.1.1 help?
