Understanding variance and standard deviation

I get that the variance of a random variable X is the expected value of the squared deviation from its mean, and the standard deviation is just the square root of that. Can you interpret the standard deviation as the absolute average deviation from the mean? Is the variance defined as such because if we defined the standard deviation as the expected value of X - E(X), we would get 0?
