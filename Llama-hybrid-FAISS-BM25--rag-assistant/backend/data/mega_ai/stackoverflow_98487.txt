Even a qualified or certified compiler can produce undesirable results. Keep your code simple and test, test, test. That or walk through the machine code by hand while not allowing any human error. PLus the operating system or whatever environment you are running on (preferably no operating system, just your program). This problem has been solved in mission critical environments since software and compilers began. As many of the others who have responded also know. Each industry has its own rules from certified compilers to programming style (you must always program this way, never use this or that or the other), lots of testing and peer review. Verifying every execution path, etc. If you are not in one of those industries, then you get what you get. A commercial program on a COTS operating system on COTS hardware. It will fail, that is a guarantee.
