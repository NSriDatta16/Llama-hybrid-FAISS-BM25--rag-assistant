I think the usefulness of design patterns lies more in the added vocabulary that accompanies them, more-so than using a single (or a couple) of patterns. Having a working knowledge of the common patterns in the Gang of Four book is extremely useful when trying to communicate with other developers. I would suggest reading the Table of Contents, then reading the summary of the patterns catalog. If you are limited for time, knowing in general what the patterns symbolize would be beneficial so that when you NEED to know the details of a pattern you would know where to look. This is as opposed to knowing the State or Singleton patterns on their own little islands.
