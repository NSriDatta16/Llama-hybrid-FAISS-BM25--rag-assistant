You could look into Multiple Factor Analysis . This can be implemented in R with FactoMineR. UPDATE: To elaborate, Leann was proposing – however long ago – to conduct a PCA on a dataset with repeated measures. If I understand the structure of her dataset correctly, for a given 'context' she had an animal x 'specific measure' (time to enter, number of times returning to shelter, etc) matrix. Each of the 64 animals (those without missing obs.) were followed three times. Let's say she had 10 'specific measures', so she would then have three 64×10 matrices on the animals' behavior (we can call the matrices X1 , X2 , X3 ). To run a PCA on the three matrices simultaneously, she would have to 'row bind' the three matrices (e.g. PCA(rbind(X1, X2, X3)) ). But this ignores the fact that the first and 64th observation are on the same animal. To circumvent this problem, she can 'column bind' the three matrices and run them through a Multiple Factor Analysis. MFA is a useful way of analyzing multiple sets of variables measured on the same individuals or objects at different points in time. She'll be able to extract the principle components from the MFA in the same way as in a PCA but will have a single coordinate for each animal. The animal objects will now have been placed in a multivariate space of compromise delimited by her three observations. She would be able to execute the analysis using the FactoMineR package in R. Example code would look something like: df=data.frame(X1, X2, X3) mfa1=MFA(df, group=c(10, 10, 10), type=c("s", "s", "s"), name.group=c("Observation 1", "Observation 2", "Observation 3")) # presuming the data is quantitative and needs to be # scaled to unit variance Also, instead of extracting the first three components from the MFA and putting them through multiple regression, she might think about projecting her explanatory variables directly onto the MFA as 'supplemental tables' (see ?FactoMineR ). Another approach would be to calculate a Euclidean distance matrix of the object coordinates from the MFA (e.g. dist1=vegdist(mfa1$ind$coord, "euc") ) and put it through an RDA with dist1 as a function of the animal specific variables (e.g. rda(dist1 ~ age + sex + pedigree) using the vegan package).
