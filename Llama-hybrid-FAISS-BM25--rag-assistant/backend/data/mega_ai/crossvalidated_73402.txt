What's the likelihood function in this case?

I have a data set with a binary response variable as non-zero survival cells (y=0) or zero survival cells (y=1), and I would like to build a model with explanatory variable X. I know that the most straightforward method is to use logistic regression. However, in my case, it is more biologically sound to use a Poisson model. Thus, the number of survived cells follows a Poisson distribution $f(k,\lambda)$, and the response (probability of having zero survival cell) is the Poisson distribution at $k=0$. Therefore, my model can be written as $y=f(0,\lambda)=e^{-\lambda}$, where $\lambda=g(\beta,x)$. $\lambda$ is a function of $x$ with parameter $\beta$. I am trying to estimate $\beta$ using MLE. Now I am bit confused about which likelihood function I should use. Shall I assume that $y$ follows a binomial distribution: $y\sim B(1,e^{-\lambda})$, so that I could conduct MLE on the likelihood function from this binomial distribution? What about the Poisson distribution? It is not used in the estimation? Suppose $\beta^{*}$ is the estimated parameter, which gives $\lambda^{*}$. This means that the probability of having zero survival cells follows a $B(1,e^{-\lambda^{*}})$ distribution and the survival cells follows a Poisson $f(k,\lambda^{*})$ distribution?
