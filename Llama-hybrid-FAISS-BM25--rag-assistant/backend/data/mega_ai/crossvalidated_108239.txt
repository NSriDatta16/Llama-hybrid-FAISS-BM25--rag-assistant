Interaction in time series analysis

I have three different physiological variables--heart rate, respiratory rate and blood oxygen saturation, each as a time series. I am trying to study the interaction between the variables as they progress towards a particular defined point in time. I tried the use of a Vector Autoregressive (VAR) model but unfortunately was not successful in trying to study the variables since I could never come up with a stable VAR model after many different iterations and crossing all the checks required for VAR modeling. I am wondering if I could get an idea or two on how I could study interactions between the variables in time as they progress to a defined point?
