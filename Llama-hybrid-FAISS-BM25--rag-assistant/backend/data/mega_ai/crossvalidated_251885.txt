Using Non-numeric Features

I'm just starting out with machine learning. The example I was shown during a mini course I took was the predicting of the sale price of a house given features like: size of house number of floors age of house number of rooms Given those features, it's trivial to train an algorithm to minimize some cost function, which in the course I took, was the sum of the differences between the value in the training set and the function used to fit it. My question: how would I work with a feature that is not represented as a number? For example, what if one of the features was, say, the name of the closest high school?
