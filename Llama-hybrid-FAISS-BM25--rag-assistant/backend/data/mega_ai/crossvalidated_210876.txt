Error while decomposing a time series in R

I'm coding to forecast using ARIMA model. The data is one single column in .csv file and it is an annual data. Therefore, the frequency = 1. When I'm trying to decompose my data it gives me an error: time series has not or less than 2 periods I am new to R and want to know if my data has any trend. If it does, than I would like to remove the trend and use the data without the trend in it. Below is the code I'm using: dataEmployee = read.csv(file.choose(), header = TRUE, sep=";") attach(dataEmployee) EmployeeTimeSeries = ts(Turnover, frequency = 1, start = 2009, end = 2015) plot(EmployeeTimeSeries) Employee.decom = decompose(EmployeeTimeSeries)
