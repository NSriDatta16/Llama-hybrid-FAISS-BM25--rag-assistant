I recommend these three lines log_slow_queries set-variable = long_query_time=1 log-queries-not-using-indexes The first and second will log any query over a second. As others have pointed out a one second query is pretty far gone if you are a shooting for a high transaction rate on your website, but I find that it turns up some real WTFs; queries that should be fast, but for whatever combination of data it was run against was not. The last will log any query that does not use an index. Unless your doing data warehousing any common query should have the best index you can find so pay attention to its output. Although its certainly not for production, this last option log = /var/log/mysql/mysql.log will log all queries, which can be useful if you are trying to tune a specific page or action.
