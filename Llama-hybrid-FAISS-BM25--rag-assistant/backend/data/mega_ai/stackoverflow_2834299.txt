MySQL has a feature to support multiple storage backends (storage engine). The most prominent ones are MyISAM and InnoDB. MyISAM is the default, in many situations quite fast but provides no data integrity. InnoDB supports full data integrity. When creating a table you can set the type. CREATE TABLE foo (...) ENGINE=innodb; See also http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/storage-engines.html for more details.
