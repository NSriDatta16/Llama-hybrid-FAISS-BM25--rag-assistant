In both Poisson and negative binomial regression, if you exponentiate the raw coefficients, you get an incidence rate ratio. That is not being emotionally charged (if I read your post correctly, even though it seems to contradict the output) is associated with an IRR of $e^{-0.5825642} = 0.558$ . You need to note that this is the IRR conditional on not being a structural zero. That is, a zero-inflated model estimates the probability of always responding a zero, and the coefficients of a count model conditional on not being a zero. You didn't show the zero-inflated part of the model, but those coefficients are for the log-odds of being a structural zero. You interpret those just like a logistic regression. A zero-inflated model output is not that complicated to interpret. However, you should ask yourself a) is a zero-inflated model plausible , and b) even if a is true, is a zero-inflated model a better model for the data than a normal count model? That is, are there some people in the sample who will never retweet? This seems like a justifiable assumption, but it isn't always. Even if so, say the marginal distribution of the outcome has a lot of zeros. That could be adequately explained by a very low rate.
