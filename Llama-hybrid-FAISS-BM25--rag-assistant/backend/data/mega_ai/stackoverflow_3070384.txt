How to store a list in a column of a database table

So, per Mehrdad's answer to a related question , I get it that a "proper" database table column doesn't store a list. Rather, you should create another table that effectively holds the elements of said list and then link to it directly or through a junction table. However, the type of list I want to create will be composed of unique items (unlike the linked question's fruit example). Furthermore, the items in my list are explicitly sorted - which means that if I stored the elements in another table, I'd have to sort them every time I accessed them. Finally, the list is basically atomic in that any time I wish to access the list, I will want to access the entire list rather than just a piece of it - so it seems silly to have to issue a database query to gather together pieces of the list. AKX's solution (linked above) is to serialize the list and store it in a binary column. But this also seems inconvenient because it means that I have to worry about serialization and deserialization. Is there any better solution? If there is no better solution, then why? It seems that this problem should come up from time to time. ... just a little more info to let you know where I'm coming from. As soon as I had just begun understanding SQL and databases in general, I was turned on to LINQ to SQL, and so now I'm a little spoiled because I expect to deal with my programming object model without having to think about how the objects are queried or stored in the database. Thanks All! John UPDATE: So in the first flurry of answers I'm getting, I see "you can go the CSV/XML route... but DON'T!". So now I'm looking for explanations of why. Point me to some good references. Also, to give you a better idea of what I'm up to: In my database I have a Function table that will have a list of (x,y) pairs. (The table will also have other information that is of no consequence for our discussion.) I will never need to see part of the list of (x,y) pairs. Rather, I will take all of them and plot them on the screen. I will allow the user to drag the nodes around to change the values occasionally or add more values to the plot.
