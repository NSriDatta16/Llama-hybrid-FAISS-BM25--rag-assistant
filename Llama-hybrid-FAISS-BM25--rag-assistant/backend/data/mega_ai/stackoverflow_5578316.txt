I stumbled across a solution using the good 'ol C++ standard (I'm not sure what version it's considered, but let's just say this solution works in Visual Studio). Here's the link: link . Also, here's a short version of a JSHash function using the above technique. The shown one here supports up to 4 characters, though you can add as many as you want. template struct cHash { template struct HashCalc { enum { value = (C == 0) ? hash : hash ^ ((hash > 2)) }; }; enum { value = HashCalc ::value>::value>::value>::value }; }; As noted, because this is a compile time hash, you can do something like this: namespace Section { enum Enum { Player = cHash ::value }; } It's not the most elegant solution, so I plan on doing more research in this area, however as this is the only thing I've gotten to work in VisualStudio2010 I'm a little limited as far as my current project is concerned.
