Designing a simple Reinforcement Learning themed game?

So I'm trying to write a (super) simple RL based game, where the agent is on the ground and has to evade obstacles falling from the sky. Based on what I've read about RL, I thought it would be a good idea to encode a pattern in the way the obstacles fall, so the agent can truly "learn" that pattern and make optimal moves. My question really boils down to a couple things: (1) Does this approach make sense in the context of RL (hardcoding a pattern in the falling objects)? (2) If it does, what are some algorithms I should be looking into to power the agent? Thank you!
