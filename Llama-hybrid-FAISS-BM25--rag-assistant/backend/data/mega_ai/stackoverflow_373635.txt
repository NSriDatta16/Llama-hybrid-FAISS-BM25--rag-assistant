Two tables. The first, say children, should have an id column and information about each child like name, age, etc. The second should be called something like childrenweights. Each row contains three things. The id of the child from the children table, the weight, and the time the measurement was taken. Then you can use sql to query the children_weights table to select a range of weights for a child, say starting at January 1st and ending at January 8th and do whatever with them. Or you can even have the sql query return just the average or sum of that.
