I didn't write Mercurial, so I can't say why they did it that way, but here are some of the positive results of that decision: you can look over the results of the merge before you commit it you can edit the results of the merge before you commit it you're encouraged to commit frequently If you really want to do a merge and have stuff in your working dir that you can't bear to commit don't bother with shelve just do: cd .. hg clone myrepo myrepo-mergeclone hg -R myrepo-mergeclone merge hg -R myrepo-mergeclone push myrepo On the same file system clone is near instantaneous and uses hardlinks under the covers so it takes up almost no space past that of the temporary working copy.
