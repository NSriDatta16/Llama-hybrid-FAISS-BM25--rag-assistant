Database table for grades

I'm trying to define a table to store student grades for a online report card. I can't decide how to do it, though. The grades are given by subject, in a trimestral period. Every trimester has a average grade, the total missed classes and a "recovering grade" (I don't know the right term in English, but it's an extra test you take to try to raise your grade if you're below the average), I also gotta store the year average and final "recovering grade". Basically, it's like this: |1st Trimester |2nd Trimester |3rd Trimester Subj. |Avg. |Mis. |Rec |Avg. |Mis. |Rec |Avg. |Mis. |Rec |Year Avg. |Final Rec. Math |5.33 |1 |4 |8.0 |0 |7.0 |2 |6.5 |7.0 Sci. |5.33 |1 |4 |8.0 |0 |7.0 |2 |6.5 |7.0 I could store this information in a single DB row, with each row like this: 1tAverage | 1tMissedClasses | 1tRecoveringGrade | 2tAverage | 2tMissedClasses | 2tRecoveringGrade And so on, but I figured this would be a pain to mantain, if the scholl ever decides to grade by bimester or some other period (like it used to be up until 3 years ago). I could also generalize the table fields, and use a tinyint for flagging for which trimester those grades are, or if they're the year finals. But this one would ask for a lot of subqueries to write the report card, also a pain to mantain. Which of the two is better, or is there some other way? Thanks
