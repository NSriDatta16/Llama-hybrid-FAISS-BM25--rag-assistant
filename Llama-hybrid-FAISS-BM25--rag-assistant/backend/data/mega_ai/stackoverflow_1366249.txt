This is definitely not a normal collision scenario: 32 characters with 62 options per character is equivalent to 190 bits (log2(62) * 32) According to the birthday paradox, you should be receiving a collision naturally once every 2**95 cookies, which means never Could this be a concurrency issue? If so, use different random.Random instances for each thread Can save these instances in thread-local storage ( threading.local() ) On linux, Python should seed them using os.urandom() - not system time - so you should get different streams for each thread.
