The fastest way is to construct HTML as text and set the innerHTML property once. Another approach is to create a document fragment and once done put it into the DOM. There might be a difference in the speed of insertion of one tag or another, but it will be marginal and different between browsers. The thing is that touching the DOM is a very expensive operation - if speed is what you are after - minimize that. Have a look at Stoyan Stefanov's performance tips .
