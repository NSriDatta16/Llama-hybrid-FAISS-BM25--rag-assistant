Every event exposes different objects inside of the $observer object that is passed around. In Magento you can often get a lot of stuff by referring to any number of objects that are in the request or session. In this case there is a customer/session object (Mage_Customer_Model_Session) which has the customer attached. if(Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->isLoggedIn()){ Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->getCustomer(); }
