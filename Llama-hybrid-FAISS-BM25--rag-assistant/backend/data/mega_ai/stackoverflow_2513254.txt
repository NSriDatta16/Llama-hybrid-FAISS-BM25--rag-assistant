The problem I had with our custom packaging, is that Maven did not recognize the project as being Java-based, hence the Maven Eclipse Plugin did not generate the right entries in the .project file, and did not generate a .classpath . The first thing can be corrected by adding the right build commands and natures in the POM, but that still does not give you a .classpath . The solution is to add the following fragment to your components.xml : org.apache.maven.artifact.handler.ArtifactHandler (fill in your own packaging) org.apache.maven.artifact.handler.DefaultArtifactHandler (fill in your own packaging) (choose war or jar if required) java true With this addition, the MEP will treat your project as a normal JAR or WAR project and generate the expected Eclipse configuration for it.
