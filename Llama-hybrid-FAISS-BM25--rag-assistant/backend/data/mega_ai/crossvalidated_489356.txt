Jacobian of transformation

In Bayesian Data Analysis , PDF freely available , section 4.1 (page 84, bottom) there is a comment saying: If we had instead constructed the normal approximation in terms of $p(\mu, \sigma^2)$ , the second derivative matrix would be multiplied by the Jacobian of the transformation from $\log\sigma$ to $\sigma^2$ and the mode would change slightly, to $\tilde{\sigma}^2 = \frac{n}{n+2}\hat{\sigma}^2$ . My question is how do we compute the Jacobian from $\log\sigma$ to $\sigma^2$ ? I can differentiate one function with respect to the other but I can't reconcile the stated change in mode (which makes me think I'm mistaken). Thanks in advance
