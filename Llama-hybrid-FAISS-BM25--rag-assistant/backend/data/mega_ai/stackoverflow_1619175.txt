Returning 700 requests would be an order of magnitude larger than returning 3 results. If you generally know your average user would only be interested in 5 or fewer results, it would be safe to assume you could return those results up front and save yourself the trouble of wasting bandwidth from those extra 695 results nobody really cares about. It is, after all, about providing users exactly what they want. If 700 is overkill, simply cut it back and save yourself the trouble. If each row of data is 1kb, which may be an overestimation, that is a difference of 5kb per request (plus headers) vs. 700kb. That would add up very quickly given a number of users.
