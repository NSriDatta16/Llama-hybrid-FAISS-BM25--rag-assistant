The description of the function prewhiten The bivariate time series are prewhitened according to an AR model fitted to the x-component of the bivariate series. Alternatively, if an ARIMA model is provided, it will be used to prewhiten both series. The CCF of the prewhitened bivariate series is then computed and plotted. gives an impression that first the originally supplied series x and y are prewhitened and then the CCF is computed and plotted. It could be that the function na.omit.ts that actually gives you the error message kicks in after prewhitening but before computing the CCF. Then you cannot see the problem just by looking at the original series x and y ; you should instead look at the output of the model that is used for prewhitening (before computing the CCF) -- you might find NA values there.
