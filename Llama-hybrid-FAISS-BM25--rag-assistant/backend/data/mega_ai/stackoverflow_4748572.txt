Is overloading the "is" and "as" operators allowed? No. If not, can this be accomplished inherently by overloading the implicit/explicit conversion operators? No. The "as" and "is" operators tell you what a thing really is . They pay no attention to user-defined conversions. See http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/10/08/what-s-the-difference-between-as-and-cast-operators.aspx http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2010/09/16/is-is-as-or-is-as-is.aspx for some more thoughts on the "as" and "is" operators.
