$facebook->getSession() returns null in the example code. is that ok?

Running the example code for the Facebook API I get a null session object, and I should get a non-null object giving the comment in the code. What am I doing wrong? In other words, in my index.php this fragment from the example code shows "no session" when I go to http://apps.facebook.com/my_app in my browser: '...', // actual value replaced by '...' for this post 'secret' => '...', // actual value replaced by '...' for the post 'cookie' => true, )); // We may or may not have this data based on a $_GET or $_COOKIE based session. // // If we get a session here, it means we found a correctly signed session using // the Application Secret only Facebook and the Application know. We dont know // if it is still valid until we make an API call using the session. A session // can become invalid if it has already expired (should not be getting the // session back in this case) or if the user logged out of Facebook. $session = $facebook->getSession(); if ($session) { echo "session ok"; } else { echo "no session"; } ?> Note: in my server index.php and facebook.php are in the same folder.
