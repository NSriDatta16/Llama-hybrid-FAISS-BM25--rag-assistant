Why is the use of high order polynomials for regression discouraged?

I've read many times on this site that high order polynomials (generally more than third) shouldn't be used in linear regression, unless there is a substantial justification to do so. I understand the issues about extrapolation (and prediction at the boundaries). Since extrapolation isn't important to me... Are high order polynomials also a bad way of approximating the underlying function within the range of the data points ? (i.e. interpolation) If so, what problems are arising? I don't mind being redirected to a good book or paper about this. Thanks.
