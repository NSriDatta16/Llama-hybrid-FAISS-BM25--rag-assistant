Whats the maximum memory that a Flash movie can use in a browser?

I need to store a lot of data coming in from a server into memory, so I have to write my memory-storage algorithms based on how much I can safely use without hanging up or crashing the browser. Is there any safe size limit like 1MB or 100MB, that contents of global variables should not exceed?
