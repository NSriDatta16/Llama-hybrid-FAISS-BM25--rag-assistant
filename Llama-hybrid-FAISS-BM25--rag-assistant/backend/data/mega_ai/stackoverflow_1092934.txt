Process.Start specify culture

In one webapplication i have a IHttpHandler that when invoked starts an regular application that connects to a firebird database and amongst other things parses some dates from the database. When run from the desktop the application does what is should without any problem. But when it is started from the httpHandler is ends up with the wrong culture and fails to parse the dates. Ive set the culture i both web.config and CurrentThread.CurrentCulture but it still ends up with the wrong one. All of this is run from an English Windows Server 2003 with the culture set to sv-SE. So is there a way to start an application with System.Diganotics.Process.Start with a specific culture? If there aren't which culture does the newly started process use?
