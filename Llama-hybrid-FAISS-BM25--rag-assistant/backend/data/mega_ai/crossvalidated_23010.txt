Analysing over 300,000 rows in Excel to make pretty graphs

I'm doing a research module for my Computer Science degree, and for my topic, I have collected over 500,000 tweets using the Twitter Streaming API, using a ruby script to store them in a Mongo database (BSON/JSON). I started recording the tweets on Tuesday 7th Feb, and stopped the following Tuesday, so there is a week's worth of tweets. Here is what the spreadsheet looks like. I have successfully exported around 300,000 tweets to an excel spreadsheet (I can hear groans already). I would like to make some time series charts, for example volume of tweets over time and eventually include followers_count as a weighting. But I'm unsure as to how I would calculate this. I think I need to make the created_at column more meaningful to excel but converting it to a date/time it can understand. I've also had a go with Rapid miner and managed to import a spreadsheet and convert the created_at field into something the program can understand, but I didn't really have any idea what I was doing after that! I'd really appreciate some hints as I'm a bit stuck right now.
