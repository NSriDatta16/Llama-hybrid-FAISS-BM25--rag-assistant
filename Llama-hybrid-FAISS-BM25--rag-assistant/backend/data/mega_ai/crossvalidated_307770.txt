Using a linear fit to create p-values from the response values of a generalized boosted regression model

I am creating a boosted regression model in R using a binary target, several string variables including missing values (as.factor) and several continuous numerical variables with missing values imputed as a large negative number. My problem is that the response values of the resulting model cannot be interpreted as p-values: > vFormulaStr > modelGBM > resp = predict(modelGBM,type="response",single.tree=FALSE,n.trees=100) > range(resp) [1] 1.132390 1.199362 because the response values fall in the range [1.132390,1.199362] and not in the range [0,1]. In order to interpret these response values as p-values, I have fitted linearly the response values into the target values: > y = modelGBM$data$y; y p range(p) [1] 0.03179395 0.86170170 As a result, the resulting fit seems to be as expected: average target value corresponds to the respective p value. However, I am wondering two questions: Whether such a linear conversion is the most suitable conversion to produce p-values from the response values of a GBM model? Whether there is a more suitable method to convert the GBM response values into p-values?
