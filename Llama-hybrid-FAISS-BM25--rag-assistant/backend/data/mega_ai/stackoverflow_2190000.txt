You should namespace your code anyway, and jQuery gives you a good opportunity to re-claim the $ in the same step: jQuery.noConflict(); jQuery(function ($) { // $ is the jQuery object in here // and doesn't conflict with Prototype }); As described here . I don't know if you can make Prototype "step down", but this is a perfectly elegant and working solution.
