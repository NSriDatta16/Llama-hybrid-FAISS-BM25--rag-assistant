Error while trying glmnet() in R: "Error in storage.mode(xd) <- "double" : 'list' object cannot be coerced to type 'double'"

I'm trying to create a logistic regression model using Ridge, this is the code: glmnet(X_Train, Y_Train, family='binomial', alpha=0, type.measure='auc') And this is the error message I'm getting: Error in storage.mode(xd) I tried converting all the variables into "numeric" but still doesn't work. I'm going to post the code for those two datasets so you can reproduce it: libraries: library(dplyr) library(fastDummies) library(missForest) library(glmnet) Data: url Getting rid of null-values: crx[crx == "?"] Data transformations: crx % rename(Gender = V1, Age = V2, Debt = V3, Married = V4, BankCustomer = V5, EducationLevel = V6, Ethnicity = V7, YearsEmployed = V8, PriorDefault = V9, Employed = V10, CreditScore = V11, DriversLicense = V12, Citizen = V13, ZipCode = V14, Income = V15, ApprovalStatus = V16) crx = subset(crx, select = -ZipCode) crx % mutate(ApprovalStatus = recode(ApprovalStatus, "+" = "1", "-" = "0")) # Normalizing numeric variables: crx $Age Age) crx $Debt Debt) crx $YearsEmployed YearsEmployed) crx $CreditScore CreditScore) crx $Income Income) crx $Gender DriversLicense Creation of dummy variables: df $ApprovalStatus_0 ApprovalStatus_1 $Married_l BankCustomer_gg $ApprovalStatus ApprovalStatus Creation of Training datasets and Test datasets: X % dplyr::select(-ApprovalStatus) Y And trying to use the glmnet: glmnet(X_Train, Y_Train, family='binomial', alpha=0, type.measure='auc') I did some research and I found an article saying that you have to convert everything into numeric class, so I tried converting everything into numeric variables like this: Y_Train And still doesn't work. What am I doing wrong exactly?
