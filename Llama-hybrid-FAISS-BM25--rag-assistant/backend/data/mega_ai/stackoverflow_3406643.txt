I'm new to objc so apologies if this is a stupid suggestion. What happens if you use stringByAppendingString instead of description that you're invoking: NSString *thumbName = [@"Thumbnail" stringByAppendingString:fileName]; I don't see why the two aren't equivalent for this usage, but still. Also, how/where are you generating the hash? EDIT @ar06 I think you're saying that your (I'm assuming it's your) writeToTempFile method does a replace on the XXXXX' in the fileName parameter to a random value. If so then there's your problem - it generates a new random every time it's called, and you're calling it twice. The code fragment you posted does work, because fileName is immutable; it will save with a 'XXXXX' extension. Do you need to refer to these random suffixes later? Whatever mechanism you use for tracking them could be also used by writeToTempFile to attach the same value to the thumb and the fullsize. FWIW I agree that Kenny's approach is better since you can't guarantee uniqueness.
