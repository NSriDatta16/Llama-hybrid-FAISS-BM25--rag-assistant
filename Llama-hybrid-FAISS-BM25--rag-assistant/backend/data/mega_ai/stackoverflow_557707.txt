If you run on java 1.5 you can probably do it using java.lang.instrument and the -javaagent option to the jvm. Redefine the run method on the thread object which should call your code. You already seem to use instrumentation so it should be available. as it modifies runtime bytecode you should be fine That said, it is hard to provide a more specific and detailed answer your question lacks at least the jvm version and the main frameworks in use (think spring-aop, jboss-aop, jvm version etc)
