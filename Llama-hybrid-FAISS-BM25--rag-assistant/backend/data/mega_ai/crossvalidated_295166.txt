does subtracting means affect a least squares solution?

Suppose I have the usual overdetermined $A x = b$ system. The least squares solution is then $x = (A'A)^{-1}A'b$. Suppose I want to subtract the mean of each row of $A$ from $A$ and the corresponding row of $b$. Let $k$ be this column vector of row means and $K$ be $k$ replicated horizontally to match the number of columns in $A$. Then the new system is $(A-K)x' = (b-k)$. Is the least squares solution $x' = x$ ? Well, expanding the new system out we get $Ax' - Kx' = b - k.$ Assuming $x' = x$ indeed, then we're saying that $Kx = k$, which is true only if $sum(x) = 1$. That seems like an unlikely result of the least squares solution, so I'm guessing the answer to the titled question is "yes." However, just because $x' \neq x$ doesn't say anything about the residual. I'm having trouble reasoning about this. The actual application involved is machine learning, where I would without thinking go and subtract the mean of an image patch before processing, and add that mean back in at the end. I am attempting to justify doing that.
