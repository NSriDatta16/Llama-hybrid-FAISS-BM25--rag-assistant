Of course you must remember that replication is something completely different from backup, because one system's programmatic failure in handling the data can quickly replicate to other nodes resulting in total mayhem. Maybe using a Hadoop File System or OpenAFS would be a good solution here? I haven't used any of those systems in real-life scenarios, only had interest in them during my research on peer-to-peer and distributed storage solutions, but I think they're worth a try.
