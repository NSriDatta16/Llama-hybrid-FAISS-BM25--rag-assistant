You have daily data . A cardinal rule when trying to form an ARIMA model is that you need equally spaced observations and no missing values . If the # of missing values are few then one can always fill in a zero and a replacement value can often be suggested (pulse anomaly). You have a number of missing days so all bets are off . Please fill in the missing days as best as you can as you might have day-to-day auto-correlation and potentially deterministic structure due to particular days-of-the-week etc . Please re-post your complete time series and your corrected acf and pacf.
