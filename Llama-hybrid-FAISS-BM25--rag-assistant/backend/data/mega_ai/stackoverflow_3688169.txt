What kind of problems upgrading Silverlight from v3 to v4

We are contemplating building an upcoming project in Silverlight. We would be developing this in SL 4, not 3, but another developer in our organization had the experience of upgrading from v2 to v3 in the middle of a project, and losing features and functionality that MS didn't include in v3. This was some headache for him, working around this, and my team are wondering if others have had similar headaches (i.e. lack of backwards compatibility) in upgrades from v3 to v4 -- as a way to possibly predict if we're going to run into serious problems when SL goes from v4 to v5. The application we will be building doesn't "need" advanced SL features, and could easily be built as a plain vanilla ASP.NET web application. We would like to learn to use SL, however, and this is an opportunity to do so -- but not at the expense of SL munging our future maintenance efforts by making it problematic to upgrade framework versions. Any experiences out there?
