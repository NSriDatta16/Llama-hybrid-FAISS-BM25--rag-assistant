Elegant syntax for assigning value from possibly null db value

For some context, the record class SaleAmount property is public decimal? SaleAmount { get; set; } Ideally I would go with this record.SaleAmount.Value = sql.Reader.IsDBNull(IDX_SALEAMOUNT) ? null : sql.Reader.GetDecimal(IDX_SALEAMOUNT); Alas the compiler and this are not friends because... Type of conditional expression cannot be determined because there is no implicit conversion between '' and 'decimal' So how would you express this elegantly, and dont play the obvious card like below... if (!sql.Reader.IsDBNull(IDX_SALEAMOUNT)) record.SaleAmount = sql.Reader.GetDecimal(IDX_SALEAMOUNT); Or is above the best solution?
