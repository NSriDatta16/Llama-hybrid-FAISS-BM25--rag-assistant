Fast introduction to deep learning in Python, with advanced math and some machine learning backgrounds, but not much Python experience

I've the following somewhat unusual background and I've managed (probably by luck) to get an industry job of a computer vision researcher using deep learning. My background: I've a PhD in pure math, and have the following machine learning experience: linear and logistic regressions, support vector machines (SVM), linear and quadratic discriminant analyses (LDA/QDA), decision trees, PCA. I'm familiar with the mathematical theory of all the above, and implemented the LDA/QDA, SVM, PCA in matlab, where I'm proficient in. However, my experience with Python and deep learning are very limited to zero. I don't know scikit learn, only somewhat familiar with NumPy arrays, but still have problems with the basics like concatenation with empty arrays. I don't know for examples the data structures like classes or lists in Python-just to give you an idea. I know what a neural network is, but don't know anything else, e.g. backpropagation or autoencoder. Hence I don't know the theory of deep learning as well. Time constraint: So I'm in a situation where I'll have to gain some hands on experience in both Python as well as deep learning, possibly in 2 months (the company has a 4 months trial period and use only Python, but they'll get a sense of my learning in 2 months, hence I've to learn fast). Question: Given my expertise and time constraints, could you mention a road map (if possible) so that I can get a fast introduction to deep learning and its Python libraries (e.g. Tensor Flow or Keras etc.)? I know there're tons of resources out there, but not all of them can be learnt within a short time span. Thanks so much in advance!!!
