How to set up "The Grinder" agent to recognize the console?

I really want to start working with "The Grinder" but unfortunately my agent doesn't find the console what ever I try. The message issued by the agent is "(agent): Failed to connect to 'localhost/127.0.0.1:6372', proceeding without the console; set grinder.useConsole=false to disable this warning." Both console and agent are located on local-host. It happens both when I start the agent without a grinder.properties file at all and when I do use grinder.properties file with a default grinder.consoleHost property. It happens even when I set grinder.consoleHost to be my IP. Any ideas?
