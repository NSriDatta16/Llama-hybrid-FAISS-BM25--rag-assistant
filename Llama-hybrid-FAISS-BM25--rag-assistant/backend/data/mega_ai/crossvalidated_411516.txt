Estimation of trend unavailable for final observations using Classical Decomposition

I'm having a hard time understanding why the trend cannot be estimated for the last several observations in a time series using the Classical Decomposition. I have also read that it can't be used to estimate the first several observations, but this makes more sense to me because one couldn't know if the first observations are trend-related, season-related, or simply have big errors. Can someone explain the intuition for this?
