Martin York has a good explanation of what is happening and James McNellis gives you a decent answer on what to do if you are using literals. If you are using int / float / short /etc variables instead, then you can get around this by just casting them inline. e.g. double Average(int *values, int count) { int sum = 0; for(int i = 0; i (sum)/count;" // or "return sum/static_cast (count);" // both of which are very explicit in what you are casting }
