LSTMs are often referred to as fancy RNNs. Vanilla RNNs do not have a cell state. They only have hidden states and those hidden states serve as the memory for RNNs. Meanwhile, LSTM has both cell states and a hidden states. The cell state has the ability to remove or add information to the cell, regulated by "gates". And because of this "cell", in theory, LSTM should be able to handle the long-term dependency (in practice, it's difficult to do so.)
