I used Dragon Dictate in 1996 for the same reason as you. It was slow going, but better than not working. I found it easier to write code by filling 4x8 white board with code and then getting someone else to type it in. Then I used DD to debug. And while you're at it, you might look at Deborah Quilter's books about RSI. They're very informative.
