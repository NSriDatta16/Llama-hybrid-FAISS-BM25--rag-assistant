using checkbox as radio button

I am looking for a way for users to select one of the two options (strength or weakness) for a list of qualities. for eg: strength weakness not applicable 1. Communication 2. Punctuality ... Radio button lets me select either a strength or weakness. However, I want the user to check only those qualities that apply and if a user accidentally selects a quality there is no way to undo the selection for a radio button unless there is a third radio button called not applicable or have the user re-enter the page. I was wondering if there is a way to be able to get the flexibility of a checkbox (check / uncheck) in addition to disabling or enabling the other checkbox when one of them is checked or unchecked instead of using three radio buttons. I don't think I have seen this behavior before so wondering if there is a more elegant way of doing this. I am open to other ideas to get the same functionality. Using a checkbox as radio button was just a thought. thanks much.
