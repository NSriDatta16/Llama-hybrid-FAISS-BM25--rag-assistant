Er. As far as I know there is no classical statistical method to assess the probability that a set of values is the same as in the population. This claim is equivalent to trying to assert a null hypothesis. If you care to update your hypothesis to be about whether the probability of a set of values falls within a certain range around the stated population value... then (I think) things start to get possible again using confidence intervals. However, I'm making this up based on what seams reasonable to me, so perhaps I am getting it wrong. Assess what proportion of the sampling distribution of the means for males falls in the range around the population mean for males Assess what proportion of the sampling distribution of means for females falls in the range of the population mean for females. Multiply these proportions to satisfy the AND part of your statement. Interpret the multiplied proportions to say (something like): Frequentist: if you ran the experiment N times this proportion of times the means observed would satisfy these conditions Bayesian: there is an probability chance that both really do fall in the ranges provided There is also an element of your question that looks like it is about distributions. Distributions of means are reflected above, but if you are interested in individual distributions, then you might want a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to compare the distributions. But again, your assertion that they are the same will be based on endorsing the null which is still not great.
