Under the assumption that you sampled your subjects from the same population (e.g. you repeated your experiments in the same subject pool), you could treat your data as one experiment. You could even include in your model a replication factor that tests whether there were differences between your replications. The results of the test on your independent variable would be saying that on average across all your studies was the effect of the IV significant. That's the easy way, but probably not best since it is hard to say you randomly sampled from the same population (and that there was no one in more than one of your studies). The hard but better way is to conduct a meta-analysis of your experiments. In short, you'll get the effect size of your IV and its standard error from each experiment and analyze that as new data (e.g. with an n of 5 is the average effect size different from 0). There are a lot of other considerations that make it different from regular ANOVA/General Linear Models. This provides a good tutorial. There are plenty more on Google
