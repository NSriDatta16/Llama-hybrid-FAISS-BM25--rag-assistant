wouldn't it be cross-browser if to just use the picture as a background to a div box? Yes, but you'd still be starting a drag; if you moved the pointer over into part of the page with text in, you'd be selecting the text, which you probably wouldn't want. I'd stick with the x.ondragstart=x.onmousedown= function() { return false; }; .
