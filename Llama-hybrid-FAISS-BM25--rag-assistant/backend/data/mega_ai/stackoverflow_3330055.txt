I took Trey's code and changed a few things and now it seems to work: (defvar G-address-script "goobook_dmenu_with_cache") (defun G-set-to () "execute script in G-address-script and populate the To: line with the results" (interactive) (save-excursion (goto-line 2) (re-search-forward "$") (unless (= (current-column) 4) (insert "; ")) (insert (shell-command-to-string G-address-script)))) Some remaining questions: The bit where Trey's code checks if the string returned from G-address-script is empty doesn't work at the moment, what do I have to change? Is there really no function to get the content of a specified line as a string? Is there a better/more elegant way to do this? The vim script solution looks so much simpler, surely I am missing something. Anyway, I'll mark this as solved in a day or so if there are no more answers as Trey solution basically does what I wanted. Thank you Trey!
