Bringing tab to front in JTabbedPane

When I use setSelectedComponent or setSelectedIndex on a JTabbedPane object, the panel always comes up in my UI. However, sometimes the tab associated with the panel remains hidden. In other words, the tab does not scroll to a visible portion of the tabbed pane. How can I fix this? I have tried the cheesy select one index, then select desired index, as well as several other more elegant things, but arrrrgh!! Help me if you can. Thanks, Todd
