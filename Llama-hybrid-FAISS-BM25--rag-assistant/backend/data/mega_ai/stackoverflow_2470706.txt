Render an asp.net control from a text string

I'm not sure if it is possible to render an asp.net control from a string. The string contains fragments of html code and I've tried rendering that string to a div tag setting the following attributes: runat="server" , asp panel contain , asp label control and asp literal control . These attributes do not render the control in that text to an actual control. The result remains as a string. I've also tried adding around the attributes but this is not accepted. Thanks in advance.
