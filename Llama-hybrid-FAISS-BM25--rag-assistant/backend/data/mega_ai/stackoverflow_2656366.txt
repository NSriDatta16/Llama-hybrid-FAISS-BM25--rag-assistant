What's the best way to mix Ruby and other languages? (Especially C++)

I'm learning Ruby, and I'm starting to play with building extensions in C. I have Programming Ruby The Pragmatic Programmers' Guide and so I can follow that for the basic nuts and bolts. What I was wondering is if there already existed some nifty frameworks/whatever to help interoperability between Ruby and other languages, with C++ being the most important for me. I've tried googling, but the results focus on language comparisons, rather than language interoperability. TIA, Andy
