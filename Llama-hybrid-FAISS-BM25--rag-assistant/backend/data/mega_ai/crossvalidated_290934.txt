The answer depend of what you mean with "properly". In an idealized (properly?) experiment we are sure that problems as omitted variables, simultaneity or measurement error or also any others source of endogeneity don't play any role. If the experiment is idealized any of these problems way out by definition. Also in terms of measurement errors, in idealized experiment, we don't have any problem to measure the effect of the tratements on the subjects. Probably you are referred to econometric problems and in that field, tipically observational, if we want to capture the average causal effects we would to achive a scheme that is as good as an experiment. However in the real world no experiment is perfect (idealized), at the best is close, and some problems can occour.
