Travis is completely right. You need to leverage the programming language to prevent SQL injections. For example, in Java use PreparedStatements to execute SQL queries. Parameters can be specified into Prepared Statements and these parameters can not be any other sql queries i.e. preventing user to type other sql query into input parameters. In this way SQL injection can be avoided. This is a very basic example and the answer depends upon the programming language you are using.
