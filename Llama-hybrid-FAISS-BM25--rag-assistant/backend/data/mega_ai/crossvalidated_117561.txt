Random Forest - Huge Disparity between OOB Error and test data error

I am building my model in R and am using the randomForest package. My current model has 7 features and I see OOB error rate of about 14%. I also ran the rfcv in the random forest package to see how the error varies with the number of features. Here also I see an error rate of about 15% for 7 features. However now when I apply this model to the test data my error rate blows up to 30%. Is this possible or is there an error in my code? Train Set - 15,121 records Test Set - 565,893 records Both the data set were handed to me - I did not create them Additional clarification and/or code available on request.
