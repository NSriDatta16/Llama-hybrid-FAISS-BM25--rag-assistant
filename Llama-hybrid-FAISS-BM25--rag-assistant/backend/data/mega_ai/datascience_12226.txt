How do I assess which sentiment classifier is best for my project?

I wanted to perform Twitter sentiment analysis on Twitter tweets. When I googled it, I found a stanfordNLP code of sentiment class. I used it for finding Twitter sentiment later I came to know TwitterGate model is made for Twitter tweets only. Then I replaced the stanfordNLP model with TwitterGate model. I did not find any difference in the sentiment results. Both models give the same result. However, when I tested the same tweets with Monkeylearn API and Datumbox API sentiment, I got confused with results. In NLP and twitterGate most tweets sentiment is given as negative, where the same tweets sentiment is given as neutral in Monkeylearn & Datumbox APIs code. How can I know which model is giving the correct sentiment?
