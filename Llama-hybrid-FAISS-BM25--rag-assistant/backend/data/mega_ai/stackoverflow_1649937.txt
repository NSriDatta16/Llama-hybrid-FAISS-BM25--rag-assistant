There's an extra step you will have to do: you will have to load the XML into a XDocument (or a XNode if I recall correctly) before being able to query you data. After that it's simply a matter of selecting nodes in a tree with LINQ to XML syntax. Unfortunately, there is no LINQ syntax that will let you query both and let you plug the XML or the DB transparently. PS. Pay attention to the XML namespace when you will select nodes, it could be a headache! PS2. Sorry I don't have code handy PS3. I would suggest your database layer to derive from an interface, that way you will be able to switch from XML to DB and vice-versa easily Hope this helps
