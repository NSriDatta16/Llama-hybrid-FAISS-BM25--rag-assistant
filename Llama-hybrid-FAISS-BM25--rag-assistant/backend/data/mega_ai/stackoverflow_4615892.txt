Silverlight: MVVM and re-initializing form

We use Prism and from the grid we pop up a edit form that has two options, "Save" and "Save and New". My question is about re-initializing form. I am wondering if there is a better or simpler way? What I do is expose a InteractionRequest on the view model, and than use InteractionRequestTrigger in xaml to change the properties of the form, like this: private void SubmitAndNewCommandCallback(IEnumerable errors) { if (errors != null && errors.Any()) { Errors = errors.Select(x => x.ErrorMessage).ToList(); } else { if (IsNew) { _events.GetEvent ().Publish(this.BidAgent); } _intializeFormRequest.Raise(this); } }
