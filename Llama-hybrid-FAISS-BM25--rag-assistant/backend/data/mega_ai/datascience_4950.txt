semi-structured text parsing using machine learning

I am looking for a method to parse semi-structured textual data, i.e. data poorly formatted but usually having a visual structure of a matrix which may vary a lot in content and number of items in it, which may have headers or not, which may be interpreted sometimes column-wise or row-wise, and so on. I have read about the WHISK information extraction paper : https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~soderlan/soderland_ml99.pdf but unfortunately, it is not very detailed and I have not been able to find a real-system implementing it, or even snippets of code. Has anybody have an idea where I can find such help? Or suggest an alternative approach which may be suited to my problem? Thank you in advance for your reply!
