Is there a self-hosted google-sites like solution?

I am looking for a wiki type software to keep something like a wiki/knowledge base at my university. I tried MediaWiki (with FCKeditor), DokuWiki and MoinMoin, but they seem too hard to use for an average user - at least not without some trouble. I found Google Sites to be almost ideal for my purpose, but as I mentioned the wiki is to be used at my university, there will be a strong demand to host it on our servers. Do you know any software similar to what Google Sites offers? What I really want is a WYSIWYG editor and a hierarchical menu structure - without cryptic "categories" or lots of colons or brackets.
