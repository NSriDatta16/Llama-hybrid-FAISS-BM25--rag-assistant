Adjusting PCA based on prior information

When performing a PCA analysis on a set of questions (participants have been asked to fill out a questionnaire), what measures can be taken to adjust for clearly gender biased questions? That is, how can one adjust for the fact that males and females tend to express this same trait in different ways? For example, if one wants to find components that describe physical activity, how should one adjust for the fact that males and females tend to express this same trait through different means. Yes, I know that one clear solution would be to redesign the questionnaire, but what other mathematical methods are there (for those cases where redesigning is not possible, due to the nature of the questions)?
