The new features of VS2010 are so much more powerful than you might expect, that I strongly recommend evaluating the Ultimate version. It may very well be the case that an organization which would never have spent the money for VS2008 Team Architecture edition might be so impressed by the new Architecture-level features of VS2010, that they may decide to buy a single Ultimate license for 2010.
