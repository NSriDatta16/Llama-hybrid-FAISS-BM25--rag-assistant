Is there any different between feature selection and pca? If there is could anyone please kindly explain for me please?

First of sorry for asking a possibly beginner question, but i don't understand pca seems to be the same as feature selection, but when i search online they seems to be talked differently. What people usually say is PCA for reducing dimensionality and feature selection for selecting feature. Didn't those two do the same thing? Reducing number of attributes/features/dimension? Please kindly help me understand. Thank you
