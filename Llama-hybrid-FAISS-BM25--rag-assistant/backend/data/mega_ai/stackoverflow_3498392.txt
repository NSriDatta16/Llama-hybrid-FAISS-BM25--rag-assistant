Silverlight: How to implement CodeBehind code in XAML

There is an int property of the 'CustomControl' (in Silverlight 4 application), TextBlock is displayed inside of the 'Canvas' control: As text can be changed It should be centered. Here is a "CodeBehind-solution": public partial class FieldItem : UserControl { public FieldItem() { InitializeComponent(); } public int TeamNumber { private get { return _iTeamNumber; } set { _iTeamNumber = value; TeamNumberTextBlock.Text = _iTeamNumber.ToString(); TeamNumberTextBlock.SetValue(Canvas.LeftProperty, (TeamNumberTextBlock.Width - TeamNumberTextBlock.Width) / 2); } } private int _iTeamNumber; } When somebody will set a new value to the control, its 'Canvas.Left' property will be recalculated. Is it possible to implement similar functionality using binding (or any other mechanism that is workable in design mode)? Thank you!
