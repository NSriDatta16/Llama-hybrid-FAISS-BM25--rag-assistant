Yes, you can write their usernames to cookies. So they’ll connect with the same username until their cookie files expire, or they reinstall their browser (or OS), or clear the browser data, or simply use another computer. Or, if it’s okay to keep the usernames in a database, you can also differ users by IP plus some headers from browsers (for example, the user agent). Of course, in this case the username remains the same until the user updates or reconfigures the browser, or uses another browser or another computer. Or if his or her IP changes (a lot of ISPs use dynamic IPs, and also the user can connect from a café via Wi-Fi, for example) You can also combine these ways. For example, save the username to cookies, and at the same time, save the same username to the server with IP and user agent. If a cookie is available, use the username from the cookie. If it’s not, try to recover the person’s username from the database using his IP and user agent. Even if that wasn’t accurate and you assigned a wrong username, the user still can change it to the proper one.
