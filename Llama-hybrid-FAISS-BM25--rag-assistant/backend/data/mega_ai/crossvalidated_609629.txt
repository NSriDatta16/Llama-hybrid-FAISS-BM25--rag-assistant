Identifying root cause of very poor Random Forest model

I've been working on building a random forest model using h2o.ai in R for climate data. I know that there is some issue, either with my understanding of randomforest, code or dataset. However, I'm not sure exactly what is causing my model to have a very high MSE and low percent variance explained. My apologies in advance if I've overlooked something very simple. I have spent much time reading and testing but haven't improved. So far I've tried: adjusting the parameters, reducing number of correlated predictors, checking formulas and input data for outliers, normality. Based on what I've researched random forest has been used for similar data in the past. I am using 70 rows in total with a 0.7 split. The entire dataset I've created is 12M rows and to create this subset I have taken the mean for 70 regions. I have tested on the entire dataset with no significant change. Here is my code, header and current results: ##Code## #Check data head(dNBR_model) #summary(dNBR_model) #correlation matrix corNBR % sqrt() PRMSE = (RMSE/(mean(dNBR_test$dNBR)))*100 print(PRMSE) h2o.varimp_plot(testDRF) varimp ##Results## ** Reported on validation data. ** MSE: 4034.157 RMSE: 63.51502 MAE: 47.38234 RMSLE: 0.1174528 Mean Residual Deviance : 4034.157 % variance explained: -167.545 ##Header##
