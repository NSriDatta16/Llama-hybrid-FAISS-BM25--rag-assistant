Yes The Certificate Authority is responsible for enforcing the organisations PKI security policy via its policy files and templates. This may include EKU (extended key usage) attributes. In reality you are requesting a certificate of a certain type from the CA on behalf of your subject. It is up to the CA to enforce the type of certificates (and the associated uses) that it will issue. The CA is not actually modifying the request so much as issuing a cert of a permitted type.
