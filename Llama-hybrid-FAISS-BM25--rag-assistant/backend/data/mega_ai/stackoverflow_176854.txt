How to give a name to an Eclipse Update Site?

I'm generating an Eclipse update site and I'm trying to give it a label so that when it appears in a user's sites list, it would appear as a name (e.g., "Ganymede project") rather than as a URL. I haven't been able to find any parameter for it in the PDE or site.xml The only thing that I've seen is to let it generate and then manually edit artifact.xml, but that gets messed up everytime you build and is ugly as hell.
