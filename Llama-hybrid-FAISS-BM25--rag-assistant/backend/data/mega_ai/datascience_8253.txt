How to binary encode multi-valued categorical variable from Pandas dataframe?

Suppose we have the following dataframe with multiple values for a certain column: categories 0 - ["A", "B"] 1 - ["B", "C", "D"] 2 - ["B", "D"] How can we get a table like this? "A" "B" "C" "D" 0 - 1 1 0 0 1 - 0 1 1 1 2 - 0 1 0 1 Note: I don't necessarily need a new dataframe, I'm wondering how to transform such DataFrames to a format more suitable for machine learning.
