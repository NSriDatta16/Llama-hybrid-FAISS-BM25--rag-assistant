jQuery draggable removing without changing position of other elements

I am building a page layout configuration system on jQuery. So everyone, who is using my website can make it personal by moving elements on webpage. But, I have a problem. Every element on my page is a draggable div with option to be removed from page if necessary. When user wants to remove an element, he clicks on inner div and the following function is called: $(function() { $('.close').click(function(){ $(this).parent().hide(); }); }); When user wants to add an element on page, he clicks on link and followinf function is called: function addNewWidget(page_name, size){ var page = $('#'+page_name); var closeDiv = $(document.createElement("div")).attr("class", "close").html('X'); closeDiv.click(function(){ $(this).parent().hide(); }); var div = $(document.createElement("div")) div.attr("class", "drag"); div.appendTo(page); closeDiv.appendTo(div); div.draggable({ containment: "#page", scroll: false, grid: [200, 200] }); div.css("top:0; left:0"); div.addClass(size); div.addClass('widget'); } Everything works fine, but when element is removed, other elements, which were on page are moving up. It is because of element positioning in the code. These divs in the code are before div, which was removed, and their absolute top is changed by -heghtOfRemovedElement Is there any way to prevent other elements from moving up?
