Graph Classification via Random Forest

This is my first post here, just a brief presentation: my name is Gianmarco, Iâ€™m Medicinal Chemistry undergraduate student who is preparing his dissertation, my idea would be to create a classifier that can distinguish anticancer drugs as active or inactive and distinguish those active in three classes, describing the molecules as a graph. My supervisor suggested me to use the Random Forest classifier, to do this I need to convert my graph into a vector trying to keep as many characteristics as possible. I start from a molecular graph dataset like this: Data(x=[9, 9], edge_index=[2, 18], edge_attr=[18, 2], y=[0], smiles='COC(=O)C=CN1CC1') where x, edge_index and edge_attr are a torch tensor, and y is the label (0=inactive, 1=activity of class one, 2=activity of class two...). To run a random forest classifier I think I must to convert them into a vector like a np.array, but I have no idea how to do it, has anyone had experience on this task? Thanks!
