I think there are several parts of this problem. 1. Are you trying to submit multiple forms in JSF? There is a way you can seggregate components in different forms and then submit a chosen group of them if req. The outer tag may be and inside these you may have as many as you may like. (Please know t:subform is a tomahawk library; but it works well with JSF). Also Subforms can be submitted in a chosed group using t:commandButton . Notice the last paragraph on subform deocumentation that all forms with comma seperated id's may be submitted. so for example some input controls here more controls here whole lotta controls here something like this will allow you to submit selective forms and validating components only for forms you wish to validate. If that is what you are really trying to do here. But if your intent is really to submit these forms by a single piece of java script I have a small advise, javascript supports lookup of form tags dynamically in a dom tree as shown in above example by aquatic. you could traverse those ui elements also by implementing a PhaseListener which gets invoked before "RENDER_RESPONSE" phase and there traverse the ComponentUITree to get the names or list of all the UI components and then provide them to javascript by scriplet variables or $ variables that JSP 2 supports. I could give more detailed answers or examples if you could exactly lay out your problem, as to WHY you want a common java script and do you intend to submit multiple forms parallely or you intend to submit them one at a time ( as and when requiered) but by a common piece of java script. Parallel submission of HTML form component is really not possible until and unless u use javascript to accumulate component values from all forms and then do whole lot of manual maipulating. Give more details on your actual intent.
