You should first decide on a survival time distribution that best fits the data you have already, this can be done by fitting several parametric distributions (e.g exponential, Weibull, log-normal e.t.c the R package 'flexsurv' will be useful as it provides the AIC as part of its return values) to the data from the 40 patients and comparing the AIC of the models. Below is a mock of how to choose between say a log-normal and an exponential model for the lung cancer data. library(flexsurv) surv Lets have a visual of the fit plot(model, ylab="Survival probability", xlab="Time") legend("topright",legend=c("KM Plot","Fitted"), lty=c(1,1),col=c("black","red"), cex=0.5) Now lets try the Weibull model model2 See how it fits below plot(model2, ylab="Survival probability", xlab="Time") legend("topright",legend=c("KM Plot","Fitted"), lty=c(1,1),col=c("black","red"), cex=0.5) Model 2 (the Weibull distribution) fits better, it has a lower AIC. This is also supported by the graph which shows smaller deviations between the fitted and observed failure probabilities over time for the Weibull distribution. You can then generate your random samples from your choice of the best fitting distribution. I have used Weibull but it might not be the case with your data. n C)/n)*100 # censoring rate (%), adjust the scale parameter for 'C' to make this as close as possible to the observed censoring rate in the sample data T_new Now you have the time and the censoring indicator, you actually don't need the later from your description; your interest is in the total of T_new. You will actually have to repeat picking samples of 100 several times, say 1000, then pick the average of the total of T_new across the replications. I hope this was helpful.
