Yes, there is this. Always check the distribution of the target . If classification,% of each class. This is important for many type of metrics and losses. If regression, check for eventual high concentration in some fixed value. For example, it happens often that because of some mistakes in processing the target ends up being imputed and there are a lot of zeros. Always check for drift. Typically these are id's. They have no meaning, but often they drive models to absurdly high performance because of some hidden bias. Understand the distribution of features. often what you expect in production will not match what is in test. Think of some distribution of populations, that were sampled in particular way in training but will be more evenly matched in production. This happens often in churn/targetting models If you are working with structured data, take time to understand what your features mean. If there is a data catalog available, read it. Example: Users tend to register on the website before purchase. Then if you are fitting a targeting model, probably due to use registration as a feature (BTW: This is a real life example that I have seen happen not only once, nor twice, but over three times at three different companies.) If you are working with text. Take some time to read a couple of examples. Just don't throw it in the model. NLP is one of the few use-cases where you have the most intuition on what the model needs to understand.
