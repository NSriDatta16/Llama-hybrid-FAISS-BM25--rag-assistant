I'd be tempted to make sure that lastSelection was never null, and have it point to an "empty" object in cases where it would be null in the current design. Then, there's no need for a null check. Engineering possible errors out of the system is always good practice. IOW, I'd ask if the inelegance in the code is how you do the null check, or whether it's the fact that a null check is required at all .
