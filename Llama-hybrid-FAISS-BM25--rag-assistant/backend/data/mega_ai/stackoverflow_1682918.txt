Another thing, to comment on the program: don't use void main() . It isn't standard, and it offers you no benefits. It will make people not take you as seriously when asking C or C++ questions, and could cause programs to not compile, or not work properly. The C++ Standard, in 3.6.1 paragraph 2, says that main() always returns int , although the implementation may offer variations with different arguments. This would be a good time to break the habit. If you're learning from a book that uses void main() , the book is unreliable. See about getting another book, if only for reference.
