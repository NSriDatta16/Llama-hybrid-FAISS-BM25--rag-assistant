For me, the key aspect is to be pragmatic sometimes. Modeling should not be a boolean activity (we do not either model or not model). We should be able to adapt the modeling level/precision to the characteristics of the project (see for instance what people working on agile modeling do) and the company. Too little or too much modeling may be problematic (with too little you may not see the benefits, too much may be overkilling fo your company, specially if you are beginning the transition or you don't have the required tools) In my portal/blog ( http://modeling-languages.com ) we often discuss about the benefits of modeling or how modeling should be used.
