Neat way of doing stuff with a List (and such) in Java

In C# you can do some operations on a list, like this: return myList.Average(p => p.getValue()); This returns the average of all values. Is there something similar in Java? (That would save me the calculation of a sum and then division by the number of elements?) Thanks!
