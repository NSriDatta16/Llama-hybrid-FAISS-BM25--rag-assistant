Large value of $X\beta$ in logistic regression?

In logistic regression, the probability is obtained from $$ Pr = \frac{\exp(X\beta)}{1 + \exp(X\beta)} ~~~~ (1) $$ From the plot below, it is obvious that if $X\beta$ > 10, the probability approaches 1 In my case (a penalized logistic regression, details are omitted), my estimate for $\beta$ (and therefore $X\beta$ ) is very large, > 2000, when plugging the equation (1), R gives out Inf . (Updated details based on @whuber comments: I actually also have some negative values, say, $$ Pr = \frac{1}{1+\exp(-X\beta)} ~~~~~~~(2) $$ I am looking for some suggestions on how to deal with this situation, where the output is $Pr$ . Possible two approaches I can think of are: Use the if -condition: If $X\beta$ > 10, then Pr = 1; to compute the probability and skip the equation (1). Check my code on the estimation of $\beta$ . (though I do not think my code has bugs) (based on @whuber's comments) If $X\beta$ is positive, use Equation (2); if $X\beta$ is negative, use Equation (1). (based on @BenBolker's comments) Use the R function plogis() to compute the $Pr$ , which is the logistic of $X\beta$ . The code is plogis(c(-2000,2000), lower.tail=TRUE) .
