Reading on "Economic nowcasting" for a probabilist

I am about to attend an interview for a postdoc in "economic nowcasting". I am work mostly in probability, particularly complex networks and random graphs. I am looking for some good reading, so that I can have some understanding of this field, and how it relates to statistics and potentially complex networks and data science. Any recommendations?
