Any good articles related to deploying GWT applications to production?

Does anyone know any good articles on how to deploy Google Web Toolkit (GWT) applications to a production environment? What are the requirements? Should I use Tomcat or Jetty with or without Apache? My GWT app leverages GWT-RPC requiring it to be hosted on a JVM stack. My current experience with deployment to production is primarily based on a Microsoft stack (IIS, ASP.NET etc). Hope anyone can point me in the right direction, Thanks.
