How do I know what proportion of data to take for testing in deep learning?

I am trying to learn about how deep learning works. I have a data set in hand. I'm taking some parts of it for training, and a column for label. Then I just randomly take random selections for testing. My question is how do I know what proportion to take for testing to be sure about its accuracy? Can I do something like 10-fold cross validation? How can I see the accuracy of the model when the predicted scores are out? I'm having the below code. I appreciate your answers. library(mxnet) train_data I also like to know how to compare the two sets in prediction, since it comes up with 2 sets(I guess it is defined in out_node = 2. so what if it is = 3 or 1).
