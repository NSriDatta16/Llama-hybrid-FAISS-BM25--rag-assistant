Bayesian parameter estimation using priors from MLE-parameters

10 Points of maximum water levels available ONLY. I am trying to fit the data to a gumbel/GEV distribution using the following method. -MLE -Bayesian Problem When i try to fit the data and get the distribution parameters using bayesian with no prior, the whole scheme goes unstable and no reasonable results are achieved. Question Is it reasonable to fit the data and estimate distribution parameters using MLE and then put these parameters as prior for Bayesian analysis. Or it is kind of over fitting ? what could be a better prior than uniform priors? Regards
