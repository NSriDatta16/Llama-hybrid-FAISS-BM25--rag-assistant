Does non-relational OLAP Engine exist?

Like a NoSQL Database, but for OLAP. Open Source of course :) Edit: OLAP engines use Relational DB behind the scenes. For example SAPBW can use Oracle, etc. What I meant was an OLAP engine WITHOUT this underlying Relation DB. Sort of like a Google BigTable with OLAP functionality. The OLAP DB can be gigantic since BigTable is about the same amount of Data, and I want to know if anybody has made a model for fusing both.
