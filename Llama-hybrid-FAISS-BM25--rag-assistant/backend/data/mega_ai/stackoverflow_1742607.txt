What does the spec say it should do? There should be a description of under what conditions the overflow flag should be set. Conventionally, the overflow bit is set when the output is too big for the storage. You could think of it as a 33rd bit in the answer of summing two 32 bit numbers. In signed arithmetic, this can happen if the magnitude of the result of the operation is too big, irrespective of sign. With 2-s complement arithmetic, you have to be a bit careful as the biggest negative number is slightly more -negative than the biggest positive number that you can represent in a given number of bits. In terms of actually doing it, just create a numeric_std vector that is 1 bit wider than the inputs, do a and let the synthesizer create the logic. You then don't have to worry about the details. The MSB of "a" can be taken off (using a(a'high) and use it as the overflow.
