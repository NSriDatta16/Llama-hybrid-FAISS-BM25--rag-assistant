Not quite sure about the specific task of Airline passengers, but in my experience, while Transformers have overshadowed RNNs recently, this statement is mostly true within the academic research community, and not so much in the industry (Setting aside NLP). Regardless, None of the Vanilla-RNNs are now considered SOTA, but variants that somehow utilize attention, or some other tricks are indeed SOTA comparable. Some notable examples are Temporal Pattern Attention for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting ( paper ) DeepAR: Probabilistic Forecasting with Autoregressive Recurrent Network ( paper ) Multivariate time series forecasting via attention-based encoder-decoder framework ( paper ) one of the newer variants of ConvLSTM I believe that one of these will perform nice out-of-the-box. As per your other question, head over to the paper on Informer , they provide a comparison using many types of time series data - which might help.
