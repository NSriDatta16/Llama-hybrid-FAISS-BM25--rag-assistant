I think it's a bad idea having the 'x-amz-date' header in your settings.py as this file only gets run once each time the server is started. I guess you were using the development server, which gets restarted every time you change some .py code. Anyway, django-storages already has code to set the relevant header so you don't need that line at all. I did additionally have a problem with the header as set by django-storages, see this issue on BitBucket for a fix: http://code.welldev.org/django-storages/issue/56/aws-authentication-requires-a-valid-date-or-x-amz-date
