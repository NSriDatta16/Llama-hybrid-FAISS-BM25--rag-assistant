Positive and negative impact of predictors on responses in data mining models

My question is an extension to the question asked here . How does one identify the parity of predictor/feature/variable impact on response/outcome in a data mining model. Is there a standard procedure to find the 'direction' of impact after one does feature selection and derives variable importance using methods such as regularized random forest or lasso/elasticnet? I know this question may sound quite naive, but I really wanted to know and I have searched SO and other materials but couldn't find a convincing answer.
