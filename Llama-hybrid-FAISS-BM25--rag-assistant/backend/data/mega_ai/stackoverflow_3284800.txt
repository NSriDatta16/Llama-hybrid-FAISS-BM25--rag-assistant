How to display/sort specific divs based on user choice

Sorry if the title doesn't accurately describe what I'm trying to do. I'm a novice at all this to say the least! To help you understand what I'm trying to accomplish please read the example below. I have a list of divs, each of which may have a series of "tags" as I'll call them. For this example I'll use Red, Blue, and Green as the possible tags. Each tag also has a button linked to it, which the user can click to filter what divs are displayed. When the button is "on" it will display divs with that specific tag, but when it's "off" it will hide content with that tag. That is unless content has another tag that's currently turned on. Red: ON Blue: OFF Green: ON DIV 1: Red DIV 2: Blue DIV 3: Green DIV 4: Red, Blue DIV 5: Blue, Green DIV 6: Green, Red Because the tag Blue is turned off every DIV will be displayed except DIV 2. The reason it still displays DIV 4 and DIV 5 is because the tags Red and Green are still turned on. If you were to turn off the tag Red as well only DIVs 3, 5 and 6 would be displayed, since only Green is turned on. I'm sure there's a much more elegant way of explaining the above but hopefully it got the point across. I've been searching for a solution that would achieve this, but have yet to find it. There are a lot of list filters that use search boxes but that wouldn't work for my needs. If someone could point me in the right direction as to what I could use to accomplish this I'd appreciate it!
