It depends. In some simple cases with normally distributed data, when you have frequentist confidence interval based on the $t$-distribution, the corresponding marginal posterior from a Bayesian analysis would be a shifted, rescaled student $t$-distribution with quantiles matching the frequentist confidence limits, see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution#Bayesian_inference . Similarly, if you have frequentist confidence interval for some variance parameter $\sigma^2$ derived via the chi-square distribution of some pivotal quantity like $S^2(n-p)/\sigma^2$, the corresponding Bayesian marginal posterior would be an "inverse rescaled chi-square" (an inverse Gamma distribution), again with quantiles matching the frequentist confidence limits (provided that the a non-informative scale prior $\propto 1/\sigma^2$ is used).
