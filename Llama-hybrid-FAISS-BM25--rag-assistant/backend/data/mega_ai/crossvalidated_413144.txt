Putting it in more simple terms. In the black box of the neural network, we don't know the optimum value of the number of epochs. So we have to experiment on the number of epochs. And while doing that when is no convergence of loss( Loss is not decreasing much or stabilizing), that means we are getting to the correct number of the epoch.
