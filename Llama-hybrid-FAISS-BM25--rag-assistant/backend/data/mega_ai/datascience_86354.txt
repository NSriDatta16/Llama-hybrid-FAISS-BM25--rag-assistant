Similarity between two time series with different sampling frequency, different amplitude, and different lengths but taken from the same source?

I have two files with accelerator readings and I want to get some metric/ measurement to get the similarity between these two files. I have tried Pearson’s R coefficient, dtw distance, dtw score. Pearson’s r gives returns a value 1 if the files are identical, the dtw score and path are 0 if the files are identical. But I need a solution if the files are as the ones in the figures, similar, with a little time lag. They are readings from two different accelerators who were attached to the same source. The sampling frequency and amplitude is not same. Even the number of readings are not same. Time stamps could be different. How do I measure the similarity between such files? Is there some metric or measurement I can get using Python? Because dtw score and dtw distance do give some output, but there is no way I can say the files are similar using those values.
