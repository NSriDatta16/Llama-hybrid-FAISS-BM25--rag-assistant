This sentence is wrong: By limiting the varchar length seems to me like you're shooting yourself in the foot cause you never know how long of a field you will need. If you are saving, for example, MD5 hashes you do know how large the field is your storing and your storage becomes more efficient. Other examples are: Usernames (64 max) Passwords (128 max) Zip codes Addresses Tags Many more!
