Aside from the fact that Enumerators and Iterators are better at expressing what you are trying to do when you are trying to walk the values in a collection, and abstract away the details of the particular collection type as duffymo mentioned, the Iterator interface allows you to use the much more elegant for syntax such as: List list = new ArrayList (); for(String entry : list) { System.out.println(list); }
