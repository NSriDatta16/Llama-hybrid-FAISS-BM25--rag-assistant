What is considered short and long text in NLP (document similarity)

What is considered short and long text in NLP? I'm working on a dataset that contains documents from 10 to 600 words and I'm asking myself if I should treat them differently. Also, I haven't found a source which explicitly defines short and long text in NLP yet. The goal for my task is to find similar documents.
