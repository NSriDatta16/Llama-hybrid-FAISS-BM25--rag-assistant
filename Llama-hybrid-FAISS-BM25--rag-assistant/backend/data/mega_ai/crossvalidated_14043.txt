I don't know if this is going to help much, but economists sometimes think about data like these as discrete time event history data, and fit (strings of) logistic regression models to them. See e.g. http://www.ats.ucla.edu/stat/stata/library/survival2.htm . And apparently you can add random effects to that to control for correlation within the same subject: http://www.jstor.org/stable/3068299 .
