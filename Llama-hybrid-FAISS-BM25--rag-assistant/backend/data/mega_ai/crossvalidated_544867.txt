Airplane problem question

I'm practicing some exercises for probability and counting and I came across this problem: A small 100 seat theatre is conducting a play, and assigns a random seat number (from 1â€“100) to the ticketed guests right before they walk in. There are 36 guests in total, who usually sit in their assigned seats. If their seats are occupied for some reason, they choose another seat at random. An actor who is part of the play messes this up by picking a seat out of the 100 seats randomly (prior to any audience member arriving), possibly taking a ticketed audience's numbered seat. The questions asked were: What is the probability that the last person is in the wrong seat? and On average, approximately how many people will sit in the wrong seat? I understand that this is very similar to the airplane probability problem but I was wondering if the same intuition should be used here as well?
