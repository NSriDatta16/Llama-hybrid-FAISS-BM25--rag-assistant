Instead of storing uploaded pdfs and so in the database, these are now stored in a regular file system folder. So they're stored as regular files on the regular filesystem. Plone's database itself handles those files transparently, so the application code doesn't need to know whether the files are on the filesystem or inside the database. (The technical term is "BLOB storage": binary large objects). And, yes, it helps a lot with performance :-) For another explanation, see point 4 on http://jstahl.org/archives/2010/09/01/5-things-that-rock-about-plone-4/ .
