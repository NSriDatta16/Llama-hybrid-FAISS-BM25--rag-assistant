Variable importance for random forests using caret

Consider the following toy example dataset (in R), including 5 factors: set.seed(2022) dat Let's build a random forest using the caret R package, to predict the variable Y against all other variables: library(caret) rfcaret We get the following importance scores: Overall V31 100.00 V11 83.69 V41 70.49 V2c 54.81 V2d 54.27 V2b 0.00 Here we get an importance score for all factor levels , instead of importance scores for all factors , as it is the case using the randomForest R package: library(randomForest) forest MeanDecreaseGini V1 1.271775 V2 3.100692 V3 1.221858 V4 1.212846 Here we have (as expected) an importance score per variable . The help pages from caret do not document very clearly this behavior, and furthermore, they say that caret::varImp() is only a wrapper for randomForest::importance() , which is clearly not true (as noted in another post ). So, what are the importance scores from caret? And theoretically, what is an importance score for a factor level ? (It basically seems that caret transforms each factor into a series of dummy/binary factors... which I could not find in the docs, and which is not really what I want here.) Have you any clue about this behavior, and the rationale of this behavior? Thanks!
