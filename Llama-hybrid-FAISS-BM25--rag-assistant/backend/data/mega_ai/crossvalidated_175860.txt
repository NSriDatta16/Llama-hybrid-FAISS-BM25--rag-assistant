Bayesian approach for parameter estimation

In the book, "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning, Bishop" for parameter estimation of a model if Bayesian approach is used then it automatically adapts the number of parameters which best estimates the data. This statement is unclear to me. I read Bayesian Regression, which includes regularization parameter in its estimation, value of which decides the number of parameters. Is this the way it adapts a number of parameters for a model?
