scikit-learn: High / low value for C in SVM

I'm playing with scikit-learn. Looking into the user guide and documentation they say: A low C makes the decision surface smooth, while a high C aims at classifying all training examples correctly. The default value is 1.0, which is used by most of the examples. I also found the value C=100 . What is meant by "low" and high for C ?
