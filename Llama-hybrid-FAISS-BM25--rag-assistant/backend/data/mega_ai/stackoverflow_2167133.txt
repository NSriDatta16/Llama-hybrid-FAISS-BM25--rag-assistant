One suggestion for you, to figure out how to do this, and in case you are using NetBeans or have access to NetBeans, is to look at the default Java Desktop Application template . It creates a pre-wired desktop app with progress bar built into a status bar, that will automatically get updated when any "Action" code gets executed. It leverages the Action API which is also pre-wired to run in a background thread. By looking at that auto-generated code you'll be able to properly and easily implement it in your own.
