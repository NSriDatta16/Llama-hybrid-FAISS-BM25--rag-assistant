Might want to look into the code coverage tool in VS 2005 Team Edition. There's an FAQ on it here There's another tool out there called ncover that looks like it does something similar as well. Seem's pretty expensive, but they do have a 30 day trial. I'm sure others will chime in with other tools that might fit the bill as well.
