Magento multi-currency w/multiple stores

We've got a Magento store setup with prices in USD. We need to set it up so that people can also buy in CAD. Problem is CAD prices need to be specific prices, they can't just use the exchange rate and USD. So I believe we would have to setup multiple stores to do this, correct? Any help docs or advice on how to do this? thanks
