Data Science Association?

Have you heard of the "Data Science Association"? URL: http://www.datascienceassn.org/ Do you expect it to become a professional body like the Actuaries Institute? If yes, then why? If no, then why not and do you see anyone else becoming the professional body? Lastly, is this question "on-topic" ?
