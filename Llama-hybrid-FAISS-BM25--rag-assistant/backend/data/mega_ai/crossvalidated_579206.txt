What is 'factored models'?

What is 'factored models'? I've seen the term 'factored models' in paper 'The Bayesian Structural EM Algorithm'. But I see it for the first time and it is hard to understand... I tried searching it but cannot found. What is 'factored models'? Sorry for not writing in detail. It is hard to write in detail because I don't know about it too much... https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.7373 https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1301/1301.7373.pdf
