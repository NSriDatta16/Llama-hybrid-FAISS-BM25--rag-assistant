Not sure if I understand your question correctly. But in general how filters are used in CNN is that they start a specific point on the image. For example the top left corner. At this location, we apply the filter n the 9 Pixels in that corner. After that we move the filter to the right by one row of pixels (often in practice its moved more than one row). Here again apply the filter (with the same weights) and move it another row to the right. I hope the gif can make that clear. https://gfycat.com/impartialdecimalbarnswallow So we can use the same filter for the whole image.
