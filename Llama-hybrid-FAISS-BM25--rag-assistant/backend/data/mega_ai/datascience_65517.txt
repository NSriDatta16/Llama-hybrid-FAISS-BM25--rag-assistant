How to know which binning mode to apply to target column

I am trying to prepare for DP-100 certification and I got some sample questions online. Here is one of the questions: You are a data scientist using Azure Machine Learning Studio. You need to normalize values to produce an output column into bins to predict a target column. Solution: Apply a Quantiles binning mode with a PQuantile normalization. Does the solution meet the goal? A.Yes B.No Correct Answer: B Section: [none] Explanation Explanation/Reference: Explanation: Use the Entropy MDL binning mode which has a target column. References: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio-module-reference/group-data-into-bins I am not really sure why this solution is incorrect. Can someone please tell in what cases we choose which mode?
