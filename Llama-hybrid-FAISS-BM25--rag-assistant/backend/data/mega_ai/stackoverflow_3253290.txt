Strings are designed to handle text and not binary data. As such, certain string implementations might take certain liberties and not store the data as you entered it (unicode conversions, for example). EDIT: To clarify, the above comment, I wasn't talking about any specific language, but the fact that certain string implementations (in languages where strings are not simply char arrays) internally store the data differently, so even if you create the string from a byte array, internally it could be saved as double-byte array. Also, in a lot of languages strings are immutable, which is generally not what you want when dealing with raw data. In any case, I can't think of any language that has decent string implementations but not a vector implementation. Why not use that instead as your container? EDIT: True, most languages won't let you override operators for arrays/vectors, and for good reason (but that's a whole other discussion). But other than that, you should have everything you need, even if it is with a little less syntactic sugar.
