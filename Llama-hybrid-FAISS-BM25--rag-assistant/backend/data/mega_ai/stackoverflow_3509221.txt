What framework are you using to get that value from the form? A sensible one would definitely provide a way to return always a list -- specifically, if the value has been entered just once, a one-item list (and possibly, if the value has not been entered at all, an empty list). For example, with good old cgi , you'd use the getlist method of the FieldStorage instance -- form.getlist('numberofrow') instead of form.getvalue('numberofrow') which behaves as you describe, returning either a string or a list -- and that would solve all your problems much more simply and elegantly!
