You can get some information from the HTTP request headers in a servlet, such as the user-agent (so that you knows which browser the client is using (or want to let us think it is using)) and the remote-addr (the client's IP address (or the proxy's one if the client is using it)). String userAgent = request.getHeader("user-agent"); // Browser identifier. String remoteAddr = request.getRemoteAddr(); // IP address. You can't access system environment variables using Javascript. That would be a security hole. There are ways using ActiveX, but that works only on a certain webbrowser developed by a team in Redmond and still then, the client would need to lower its security settings to allow it to run. That's a big no-no. The only way to get the computer name is to run a client application which is served by a webpage and let this client application sniff it and send it to the server side. For example a Java Applet using respectively System.getProperty("COMPUTERNAME") and java.net.URL . You however need to sign it, else it will prompt a security warning as well.
