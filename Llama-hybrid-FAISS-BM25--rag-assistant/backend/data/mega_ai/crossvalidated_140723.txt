Clustering depends on scale , among other things. For discussions of this issue see ( inter alia ) When should you center and standardize data? and PCA on covariance or correlation? . Here are your data drawn with a 1:1 aspect ratio, revealing how much the scales of the two variables differ: To its right, the plot of the gap stats shows the statistics by number of clusters ($k$) with standard errors drawn with vertical segments and the optimal value of $k$ marked with a vertical dashed blue line. According to the clusGap help, The default method "firstSEmax" looks for the smallest $k$ such that its value $f(k)$ is not more than 1 standard error away from the first local maximum. Other methods behave similarly. This criterion does not cause any of the gap statistics to stand out, resulting in an estimate of $k=1$. Choice of scale depends on the application, but a reasonable default starting point is a measure of dispersion of the data, such as the MAD or standard deviation. This plot repeats the analysis after recentering to zero and rescaling to make a unit standard deviation for each component $a$ and $b$: The $k=2$ K-means solution is indicated by varying symbol type and color in the scatterplot of the data at left. Among the set $k\in\{1,2,3,4,5\}$, $k=2$ is clearly favored in the gap statistics plot at right: it is the first local maximum and the stats for smaller $k$ (that is, $k=1$) are significantly lower. Larger values of $k$ are likely overfit for such a small dataset, and none are significantly better than $k=2$. They are shown here only to illustrate the general method. Here is R code to produce these figures. The data approximately match those shown in the question. library(cluster) xy
