You're going to have to do some experimenting to figure out what is 'best', but I would recommend starting with a convolutional neural network. Since you're only detecting a very small difference, though, the pixel values themselves should give you a good indication of where the colour is, and whether there is colour at all. I'm a bit surprised that a simpler architecture hasn't given you any luck.
