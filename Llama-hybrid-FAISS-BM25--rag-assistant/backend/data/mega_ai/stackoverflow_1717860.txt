If you're segmenting a piece of text into sentences, then what you want to do is begin by determining which punction marks can separate sentences. In general, this is ! , ? and . (but if all you care about is a . for the texts your processing, then just go with that). Now since these can appear inside quotations, or as parts of abbreviations, what you want to do is find each occurrence of these punctuation marks and run some sort of machine learning classifier to determine whether that occurance starts a new sentence, or whether it does something else. This involves training data and a properly-constructed classifier. And it won't be 100% accurate, because there's probably no way to be 100% accurate. I suggest looking in the literature for sentence segmentation techniques, and have a look at the various natural language processing toolkits that are out there. I haven't really found one for Ruby yet, but I happen to like OpenNLP (which is in Java).
