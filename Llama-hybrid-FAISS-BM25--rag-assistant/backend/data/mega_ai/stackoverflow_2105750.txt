How can I write to the current directory in the iPhone SDK when running xcodebuild from the command line?

Does anyone know how to obtain the path to the current directory when running xcodebuild (mainly, the project directory) and write files to it? I'm trying to save the results of some unit tests to disk from my obj-c code, but I'd rather not dump them deep in the app's document path if possible. I might be able to append '../../..' etc. to the document path, but I was hoping there might be a more elegant method. *This is relevant only to the simulator, of course... but perhaps even the simulator attempts to maintain the iPhone file system sandbox? I've had no luck writing to other random locations on my Mac, so I suspect that might be the case. Thanks for your input!
