Conditional probability is a measure of a set (N==1) occupies upon the (N>=1) partition (rather than the whole unity, as it is for unconditional probability). Understanding this fact makes conditional probability much more intuitive. In a physical sense, among all the cases one or more events of interest happened within a given time interval, 40% of the cases only contained one event. Now, the question is, what was the average event rate per time interval (lambda)? Next, Poisson is a discrete distribution, so we can calculate the probability of N being 1 using Poisson PMF ( lambda ^ 1 * exp(-lambda) / 1! ) Probability of N>=1 is also easy to be calculated as 1 - PMF(0). Calculating via 'trial and error' is of course not the best exercise they could think of but at least it's doable.
