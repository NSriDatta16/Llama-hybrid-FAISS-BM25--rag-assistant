Some points: the spss output shows you are doing a stepwise regression (could be that is spss's default?) You shouldn't do that, tell spss to keep in all variables. Second, the wald statistics reported by spss are based on large-sample approximations which often are way off with logistic regression. I believe that spss logistic regression offers bootstrapping, try that. Or get some better software, such as R, and try likelihood profiling. And third, ask a local statistician, logistic regression isn't for amateurs! And, search this site, a lot of useful information about logistic regression here.
