If you can, would recommend rethinking this design Any form of hashing cannot guarantee uniqueness If you do need uniquely random userIds, then you will need to use something larger, like a GUID, or retain a persistent list of all UserIds which have already been issued. But as you are suggesting in your post, an ideal way IMHO would be to use singleton or storage (e.g. SQL identity) which tracked the last issued UserId.
