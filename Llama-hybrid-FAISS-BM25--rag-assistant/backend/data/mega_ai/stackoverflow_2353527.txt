How do I receive and store data input in C#?

Basically I'm still in the starting phase, and I know how to use Console.WriteLine , but I have no idea on how to have it read input from the user. For example, I'd want a user to be able to type in a pair of numbers, then return the result. My goal is a program that receives input , then combines them and returns the average. This is all in Visual C# Express 2008
