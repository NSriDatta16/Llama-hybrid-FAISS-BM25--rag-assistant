Take a look at Magento ( http://www.magentocommerce.com/ ): it is an open-source CMS create specifically to easily create e-commerce sites. It ships with a multi-store functionality... and it has many additional interesting features, like SEO optimization procedures, etc. You could start installing that, testing it on your local system and eventually adapting it according to your needs. I think it is a great tool and it can save you a great deal of work. Magento is written in PHP. Cheers, Gianluca.
