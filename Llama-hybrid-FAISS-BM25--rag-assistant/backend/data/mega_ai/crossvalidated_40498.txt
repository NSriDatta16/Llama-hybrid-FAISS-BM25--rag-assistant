How can I classify images as "normal" or "lesions" using SVM?

I want to classify images as "normal" or "lesions", and then rate the images in the lesions category from mild and severe. This classification would be based on edge, color and texture features. For this concept I want to use a binary SVM classifier using threefold cross validation, in Matlab. Where do I start?
