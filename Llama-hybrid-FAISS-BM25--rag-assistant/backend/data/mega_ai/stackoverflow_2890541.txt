There are a couple of developers in Europe (Uwe Habermann and Venelina Jordanova) who are working on a Visual FoxPro to Silverlight product right now. They are presenting it in Europe during the summer of 2010 and at the Southwest Fox Conference held in Mesa, AZ, USA this October. It is a free pre-conference session if you subscribe to their framework, subscribe to FoxRockX, or attend the conference. (full disclosure, I am one of the organizers of Southwest Fox Conference, but hopefully it does not make the information any less valuable). Rick Schummer, VFP MVP
