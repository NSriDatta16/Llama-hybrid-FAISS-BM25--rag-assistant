Is there something like a Filestorage class to store files in?

Is there something like a class that might be used to store Files and directories in, just like the way Zip files might be used? Since I haven't found any "real" class to write Zip files (real class as in real class), It would be nice to be able to store Files and Directories in a container-like file. A perfect API would probably look like this: int main() { ContainerFile cntf("myContainer.cnt", ContainerFile::CREATE); cntf.addFile("data/some-interesting-stuff.txt"); cntf.addDirectory("data/foo/"); cntf.addDirectory("data/bar/", ContainerFile::RECURSIVE); cntf.close(); } ... I hope you get the Idea. Important Requirements are: The Library must be crossplatform anything *GPL is not acceptable in this case (MIT and BSD License are) I already played with the thought of creating an Implentation based on SQLite (and its ability to store binary blobs). Unfortunately, it seems impossible to store Directory structures in a SQLite Database, which makes it pretty much useless in this case. Is it useless to hope for such a class library?
