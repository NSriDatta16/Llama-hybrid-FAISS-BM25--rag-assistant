Can I get the relationship between my independent variables using linear regression?

Say I have some data which are sets of variables: (y, x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4), and y = a x_1 + b x_3 + error, and x_2 = c x_1 + error, x_4 = d x_1 + e*x_3 + error. Then I do a linear regression and find the best values for y = w1*x_1 + w2*x_2 + w3*x_3 + w4*x_4 and the correlations between them. Can I recover a,b,c,d,e from the w_i (EDIT: all of them, not just a and b)? Or do I need to do PCA or some other technique?
