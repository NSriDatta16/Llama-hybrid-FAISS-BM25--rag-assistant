Weighting is a procedure that weights the data to compensate for differences in sample and population (King 2001). For example, in rare events (such as fraud in credit risk, deaths in medical literature) we tend to sample all the 1’s (rare events) and a fraction of 0’s (non events). In such cases we have to weight the observations accordingly. Example: Let us say, In a population of 500,000 transactions there are 50 fraud transactions. In this case you would Sample all 50 frauds transaction (100% of the fraud) 10% of the good transactions (10% of 500,000 is 50,000 good transactions) In this case you would assign a weight of 1 for fraud transactions and a weight of 10 for good transactions. This is called the Weighted Maximum Likelihood method. The important takeaway is that the weighting is related to sampling proportions Refer: Logistic Regression in Rare Events Data (King 2001)
