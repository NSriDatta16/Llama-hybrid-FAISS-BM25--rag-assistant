How to override the stylesheets embedded in the Telerik assembly?

Embedding RadEditor in my page but Master page's CSS is screwing it up ..like Editor's content area is inheriting background-image property of the body tag when I want it to be white..drop down lists inside of Editor too are not displaying correctly..I don't wanna create whole new custom skin
