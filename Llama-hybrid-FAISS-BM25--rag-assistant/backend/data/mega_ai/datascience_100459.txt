Pre-trained models for semantic segmentation of satellite images

I'd like to use semantic segmentation of satellite images but I don't have the processing power to train existing models or producing one my own. Ideally, I'm looking for a U-Net CNN model that can be used together with Smoothly-Blend-Image-Patches Is anyone aware of any pre-trained model of this kind?
