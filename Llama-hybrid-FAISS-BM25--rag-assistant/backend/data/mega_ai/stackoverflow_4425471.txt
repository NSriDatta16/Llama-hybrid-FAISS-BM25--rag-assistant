If you're building multiple houses, you need to keep track of the bricks as an appropriate member of the house. If you're only building one house, a static member in the brick class will work. There are more 'elegant' ways to achieve this, depending on your actual aim. You could modify the Singleton pattern (on the brick class) to accomplish this (even if you're building many houses!).
