I pretty much have the same answer as aku for the first question, you might want to take a look at the Enterprise Library in general since there are several useful blocks such as the Logging and Validation blocks. Can't help with the second since I haven't worked on any projects that needed to support localization of any kind. Without a better idea of what kind of data/application you are developing it is kind of difficult to recommend local data storage. A couple of thoughts that I have (no particular order) are: An Xml file is portable and can be manipulated with LINQ->XML. Are your objects stable? You could always serialize them.... (Although I don't recommend this) Although local now, would the data (some or all) be better shared on a server with other users in the future. You mentioned SQLite, have you considered SQL Server CE? What kind of query performance does you data layer need to support?
