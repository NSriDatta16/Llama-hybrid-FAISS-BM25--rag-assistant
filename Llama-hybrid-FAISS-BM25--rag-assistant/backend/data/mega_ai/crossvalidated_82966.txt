Gibbs and MCMC methods are sampling methods. EM methods are optimisation methods. Two very different things. The first ones sample from the posterior distribution, the other one finds a maximum/minimum. EM algorithms are used whenever you can conduct the E and M steps relatively easy. Otherwise, you usually go for some other sort of optimisation method such as the one you mention.
