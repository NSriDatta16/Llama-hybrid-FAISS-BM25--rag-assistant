Without some context it is difficult to know what kind of answer you need. Your impression might come just from the dominance of means and proportions in elementary applications (and courses ...) There are many other quantities being estimated routinely, such as variances. Some other examples you can use as search terms on this site: correlation, autocorrelation, cross correlation regression coefficients (linear regression) odds or log odds (used for example with logistic regression) rates, rate ratios (RR) (used for example with Poisson regression) median, quantile, ... which are all in heavy use, in many disciplines. It would be easy to make the list longer. But introductory posts have to start someplace. Another point: Many (not all) of this statistics can be seen as means of some constructed random variable, so what you learn about inference means will help you later with many other statistics.
