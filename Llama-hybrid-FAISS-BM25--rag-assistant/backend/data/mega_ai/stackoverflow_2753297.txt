Updating multiple Sprites - AS3 performance best practices

Within the container "BubbleContainer" I have multiple "Bubble sprites". Each bubble's graphics object (a circle) is updated on a timer event. Let's say I have 50 Bubble sprites and each circle's radius should be updated with a mathematical formula. How do I organize this logic? How do I update all Bubble sprites within the BubbleContainer? (should I call a bubble.update() function or make a temporary reference to the graphics object?) Where do I put the Math logic? (as static functions?)
