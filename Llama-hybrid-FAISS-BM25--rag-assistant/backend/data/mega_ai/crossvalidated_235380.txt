? cor.test() says: For Spearman's test, p-values are computed using algorithm AS 89 for n (and default value is exact = TRUE ). And its Warning message: In cor.test.default(x2, y2, method = "spearman") : Cannot compute exact p-value with ties They mean that if you don't give an argument exact , cor.test() uses algorithm AS 89 when n and no tie. rcorr() always calculates p-values via the asymptotic t approximation, so cor.test() and rcorr() return the same p-value when any ties are present. getS3method("cor.test", "default") gives you the code. D. J. Best and D. E. Roberts, Algorithm AS 89: The Upper Tail Probabilities of Spearman's Rho, Applied Statistics, Vol.24, No.3 1975, pp.377-379 gives the details about AS 89. [Edited] Algorithm AS 89 has two methods, the "exact" method and the "semi-exact" method. cor.test() uses the former when n and the latter when 9 . In your case, p.value was calculated by the "exact" method. If you do it manually; library(e1071) # to get permutations x2 rho) / factorial(7) * 2 # [1] 0.06626984 cor.test(x2, y2, method="spearman")$p.value # [1] 0.06626984 # the same
