Liferay 6 / jBoss is there an 'easy' way to have clean urls?

I am working with Coldfusion 9, running under jBoss/Liferay 6. All is well, I have developed quite a few portlets that I have made work around for (when I run into some issues that I could usually handle in a straight forward fashion). Overall Coldfusion 9 portlets work very well inside of Liferay. One thing I really dislike is that the URLs are so unreadable, and I was really hoping for clean urls for my application, so when a user searches, and the result comes back, I can have them click a link like http://liferaysite.com/web/viewitem/ABC123 . Currently I get a raggedy URL that includes portlet status, properties, the portlet ID associated with the variable that I am passing (usually a combination of portlet id + variable) and other garbage that is un-needed. Is there any 'easy' way to get clean URLs? My issue is that I am not a JAVA person, so I am not too confidant in digging into jBoss/Liferay code to get something done. However I feel that Liferay is sufficiently 'hands-free' so that I can build my portlets and deploy them without modifying JAVA code and getting dirty. Any ideas? I am not able to find many articles on this, especially since Liferay 6 is so new, and there are so few people posting things about it. Maybe this would be some sort of URL rewriting in Jboss? Thank you, appreciate any and all suggestions :)
