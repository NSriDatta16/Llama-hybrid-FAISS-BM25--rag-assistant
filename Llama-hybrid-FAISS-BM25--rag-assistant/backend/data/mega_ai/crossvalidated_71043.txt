There's several ways. An option is to convert dates into days after the very first day. Also, you could have have additional variables of days of the week (trends across the week) and the month (to see trends in certain times of the year). By doing so, you can use multiple regression. To get the variable "# of days after the first day", I believe (both excel and R) you can simply subtract the earlier data from the latter date and get the day difference. So maybe try subtracting 1/1/2010 from all your dates. You should also tell R that the new value is numeric using as.numeric() EDIT: R seems to read in the year first, so you may have to mess around the dates a bit. see this: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2254986/how-to-subtract-days-in-r Time series analysis is another approach, but I'm not too familiar with it.
