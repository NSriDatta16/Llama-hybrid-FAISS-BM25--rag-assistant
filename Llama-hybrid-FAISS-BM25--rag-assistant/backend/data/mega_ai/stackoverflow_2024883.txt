It could be because the id is still present in each of the models which often happens when saving in a loop because the data gets merged. Try the following to reset the models so they don't load in the previous data. $this->Sale->create(false); $this->Bidagent->create(false); $this->Licitation->create(false); From your code snippet though i'm not sure what T1, T2 and T3 are... if they are models then they need the same $this->Model->create(false) ; Reference: http://api.cakephp.org/2.3/class-Model.html#_create
