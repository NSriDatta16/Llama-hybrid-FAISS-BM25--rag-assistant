Unfortunately lots of example code takes short cuts which should not be followed. The danger here is that the learner is not in a good position what to imitate and what not to. Applet life-cycle method and the main method are example of upcalls. Like listeners they should be short, extract necessary information, encapsulate handling of the upcall and call a method on an object that is meaningful to that object (in particular not encumbered by dependency on the upcall).
