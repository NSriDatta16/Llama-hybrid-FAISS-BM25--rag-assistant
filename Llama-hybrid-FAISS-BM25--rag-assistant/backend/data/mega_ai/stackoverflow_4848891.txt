In GCC at least, the -O flags just turn on a whole load of other flags, see e.g. http://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Optimize-Options.html . You could just enable the ones you're interested in, although that's generally discouraged. Note that I'm not sure that the behaviour of e.g. GCC at -O2 and -O3 is necessarily any indicator of what a completely different compiler will do.
