Information Retrieval is an area of study concerned with retrieving documents, information or metadata from a collection of unstructured or semi-structured data. It usually has 3 parts: Crawling : Identifying the documents that we want to search when our document collection is not clearly defined, especially important to web search engines. Indexing : Parsing and inverting the documents into an index, either a static offline process or a set of incremental updates for frequently changing document collections. Searching: retrieving the most relevant documents to the given query. This step requires that we rank documents with scoring functions which measure how relevant the documents are to each query.
