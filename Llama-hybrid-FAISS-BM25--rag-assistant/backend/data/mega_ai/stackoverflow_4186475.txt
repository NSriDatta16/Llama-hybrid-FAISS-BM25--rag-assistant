Error when trying to parse XML from SVN log command

I'm trying to build a simple drop down that will display the revisions of a specific file. From the option chosen, I use jQuery to fetch the current text contained in that revision and populate a textarea (using svn cat). The header in my HTML file: My shell command: svn log --xml "file:///C:/Documents and Settings/username_here/Desktop/svnrepo/Web/trunk/my_file.php" XML parsing call: $xmlData = simplexml_load_string(utf8_decode(trim(shell_exec($cmd)))); At this point, I get this error: Input is not proper UTF-8, indicate encoding ! Bytes: 0xE9 0x20 0xE7 0x61 -I'm using the utf8_decode function to help display characters properly. For instance, "é" gets displayed as "Ã©" -If I change the meta tag to utf-8, it displays properly. However, I need to have ISO-8859-1 per organizational set rules -I'm calling my SVN repo using the file:/// protocol as a temporary measure for the moment Funny enough, my jQuery call only necessitated a header call for it to display the characters properly (shell_exec(svn cat...)): header('Content-type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1') ;
