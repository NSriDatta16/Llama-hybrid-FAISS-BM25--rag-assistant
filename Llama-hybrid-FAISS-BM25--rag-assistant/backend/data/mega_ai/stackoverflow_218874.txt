All of these options are feasible, and there is not one correct answer. You should weigh your various options and choose the best solution for your situation. Option 1: Feasible but could really get out of hand as your user count increases. May also have an impact on storage costs. Option 2: Probably the fastest solution to implement but the least robust solution and a higher maintenance cost. If you need to go to 6 columns, you will have to add another column, etc.. Option 3: Probably the most robust solution is to have a metadata table that captures this information and then build your tables\columns dynamically based on this metadata. This solution will also probably take the longest and cost the most $$.
