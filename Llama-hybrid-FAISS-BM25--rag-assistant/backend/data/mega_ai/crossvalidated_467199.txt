How to compare two sets of categorical observations?

I have two strains of organisms, strain A and strain B. Each organism is allowed to move along a closed line segment and is initially positioned at the midpoint of the line segment. After a given amount of time, each organism's position is registered as "right" (movement to the test sector, a nutrient droplet), "left" (movement to the control sector, a water droplet) or "middle" (no movement). I'm trying to show that strain A has a higher probability of moving to the right, compared to strain B. What statistical technique should I use to analyze this dataset? Currently, I scored "left", "middle" and "right" as "-1", "0" and "+1", respectively and I applied the Wilcoxon rank sum test in R ( wilcox.test(score ~ strain, data=data) ). However, I'm not sure if this is a valid approach. This is my data: strain, sector, score --------------------- A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A right 1 A middle 0 A middle 0 A left -1 B right 1 B right 1 B right 1 B right 1 B right 1 B middle 0 B middle 0 B left -1 B left -1 B left -1 B left -1 B left -1
