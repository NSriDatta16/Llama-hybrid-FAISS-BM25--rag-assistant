I think you are looking for a heap . Or at least, you use a tree when an array structure is not enough for your needs so you can try to implement a tree inside an array but it wouldn't make much sense since every node contains references to its children without any need of indices. But an heap is an array that can also be seen as a binary tree, look it out here . It's a tree in the sense that it organizes data as a tree but without having direct references to the children, they can be inferred from the position.
