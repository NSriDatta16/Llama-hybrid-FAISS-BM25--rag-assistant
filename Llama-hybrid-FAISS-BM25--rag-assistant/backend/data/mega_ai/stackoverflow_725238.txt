You can't have an owner of a project that's a team, as you're finding it just doens't work. You have a couple of options, my favourite would be to declare independence - they don't want the responsibility of being the owner - you take the responsibility yourself. You clearly understand the problem, try grabbing control, send a few pithy emails outlining the new structure - do NOT ask for permission, just do it that will shake them up a little. Other answers - you won't get an owner available 24x7, you have to work around the owners schedule, but you can demand to know that schedule in advance. QA - for 3.5 developers I'd like between .5 to 1 QA people dedicated, I'd expect between 0 and 1, with it being much more likly to be 0, if you can't get a dedicated tester go straight to the users - you are the new owner remember, build a brains trust of early QA users and subvert the organisation. BTW - answers based on 50+ projects in 20 organisations.
