Which deep learning framework have support for gtx580 GPU?

I would like to train convolutional neural networks using a gtx580 gpu. I tried setting up TensorFlow but it did not work (wrong cuda compute compability). Which deep learning framework can best support a gtx580 gpu in terms of functionality and speed?
