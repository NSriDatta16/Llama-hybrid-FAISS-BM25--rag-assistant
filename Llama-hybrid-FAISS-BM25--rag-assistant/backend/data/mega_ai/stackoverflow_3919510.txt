FWIW, I wrote a jQuery Markdown Plugin that uses the Showdown converter. It is intended for use as a client-side utility when your server is serving Markdown documents - presumably organized in some meaningful directory structure. Links to other Markdown documents and images are resolved with respect to your document base directory and document directory structure. Transclusion is also supported using {{include-this}} style tags allowing you to create meta-documents composed of smaller chunks of Markdown or raw text. Sample usage: $(#mydiv).markdown('mybase/', 'mydir/mydoc.markdown'); Please feel free to download and use without restriction at http://plugins.jquery.com/project/markdown .
