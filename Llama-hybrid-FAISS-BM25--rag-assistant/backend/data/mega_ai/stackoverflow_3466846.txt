Once an object is deleted, the memory it occupied is handed back to the runtime (or to the OS, in some cases) for reuse. If you go and allocate memory for another object of exactly the same size, or sometimes even a little bit smaller, that chunk of memory is probably the best fit -- so it's quite reasonable to use that chunk of memory instead of carving another chunk out from somewhere else and raising the chance of memory fragmentation issues later on.
