Check out AnticiPy which is an open-source tool for forecasting using Python and developed by Sky. The goal of AnticiPy is to provide reliable forecasts for a variety of time series data, while requiring minimal user effort. AnticiPy can handle trend as well as multiple seasonality components, such as weekly or yearly seasonality. There is built-in support for holiday calendars, and a framework for users to define their own event calendars. The tool is tolerant to data with gaps and null values, and there is an option to detect outliers and exclude them from the analysis. Ease of use has been one of our design priorities. A user with no statistical background can generate a working forecast with a single line of code, using the default settings. The tool automatically selects the best fit from a list of candidate models, and detects seasonality components from the data. Advanced users can tune this list of models or even add custom model components, for scenarios that require it. There are also tools to automatically generate interactive plots of the forecasts (again, with a single line of code), which can be run on a Jupyter notebook, or exported as .html or .png files.
