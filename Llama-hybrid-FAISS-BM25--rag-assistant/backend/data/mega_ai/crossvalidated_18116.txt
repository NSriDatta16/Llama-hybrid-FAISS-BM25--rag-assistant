Is machine learning less useful for understanding causality, thus less interesting for social science?

My understanding of the difference between machine learning/other statistical predictive techniques vs. the kind of statistics that social scientists (e.g., economists) use is that economists seem very interested in understanding the effect of a single or several variables -- both in terms of magnitude and detecting whether the relationship is causal. For this, you end up concerning yourself with experimental and quasi-experimental methods, etc. Machine learning or statistical modeling that is predictive often entirely neglects this aspect and in many cases doesn't give you a specific degree to which one variable affects the outcome (logit and probit do seem to do both). A related question is to what extent do theoretically inspired economic or behavioral models have an advantage over atheoretical models when predicting to new domains? What would a machine learning or prediction-oriented statistician say to the criticism that without an economic model, you wouldn't be able to correctly predict new samples where covariates were very different. I'd be really happy to hear people's take on this from all perspectives.
