You can compute the sum of squared errors (or the likelihood in, say, a logistic regression case) and then conduct an $F$ -test. You'll probably have to do it manually. $$ F = \frac{ \frac{SS_{resid,restricted}-SS_{resid,full}}{df_{resid,restricted}-df_{resid,full}}} {\frac{SS_{resid,full}}{df_{resid,full}}} $$
