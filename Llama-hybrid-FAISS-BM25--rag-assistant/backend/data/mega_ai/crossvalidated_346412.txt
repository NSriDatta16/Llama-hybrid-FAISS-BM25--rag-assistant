Q-Learning: state independent of agent's action

Could state be independent of the action chosen by agent? We would have a situation in which agent learns only which actions are the best in specific states without having any impact on those states (States change with every next iteration). If I create such algorithm will it create anything sensible or agent should always have an impact on the next state when he perform action?
