Predictive distribution in the Frequentist setting

Let $\{X_t\}_{t \in T}$ be a time series, such that $X \sim F(\theta)$ , for some arbitrary distribution $F$ . Based on the observed values $\{x_1, x_2, \cdots, x_{t-1}\}$ , suppose that I want to predict $x_t$ . What should I do? My suggestion would be: estimate $\theta$ , say, by $\hat{\theta}$ (e.g., MLE), $2)$ simulate sufficiently many points from $F(\hat{\theta})$ , and $3)$ average values from step " $2)$ " in order to obtain $\hat{x}_{t}$ . However, the above procedure has two problems (maybe more): $A)$ I am not accounting for the uncertainty in estimating $\theta$ , and $B)$ I am obtaining a "deterministic point prediction", as opposed to a "probabilistic forecast" (in the form of a predictive distribution, which is what I want). Assuming $X$ is absolutely continuous and, therefore, has a pdf $f_X$ , I think I could address item $B)$ by arguing that $f_X(x|\hat{\theta})$ describes the predictive distribution. Is it correct? Even if it is true, I still have the problem described on item $A)$ . Also, under this same framework, how could I predict $\{x_{t+1}, x_{t+2}, \cdots, x_{t + p}\}$ based on the same original data set? In this case, the uncertainty must increase with $t$ , right? I think my question can be summarized by: "under the frequentist framework, how to make 'probabilistic forecasting' appropriately?".
