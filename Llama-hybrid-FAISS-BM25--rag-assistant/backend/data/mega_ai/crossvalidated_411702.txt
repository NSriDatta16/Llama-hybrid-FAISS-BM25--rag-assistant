Note your use of the $\sigma$ notation which means the (known) population standard deviation. The T-distribution arose as an answer to the question: what happens when you don't know $\sigma$ ? He noted that, when you cheat by estimating $\sigma$ from the sample as a plug-in estimator, your CIs are on average too narrow. This necessitated the T-distribution. Conversely, if you use the T distribution when you actually do know $\sigma$ , your confidence intervals will on average be too wide. Also, it should be noted that this question mirrors the answer solicited by this question .
