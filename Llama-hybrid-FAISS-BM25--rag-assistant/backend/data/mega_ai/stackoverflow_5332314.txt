I got the same problem but it was in a table cell. I had one string with carriage return (multiple line) into a Text object that was append to a paragraph that was append to a table cell. => The carriage return was ignored by word. Well the solution was simple : Create one paragraph by line and add all of these paragraph's to the table cell.
