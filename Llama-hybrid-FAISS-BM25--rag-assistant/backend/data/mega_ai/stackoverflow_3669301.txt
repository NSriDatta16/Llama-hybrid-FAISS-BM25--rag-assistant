jQuery UI Sortable: How to disable a connectSortable, but still be able to drag an item away from it

I have a situation whereby I have a series of connected sortable lists, and a list can have no more than 2 items at any one time. Therefore I need to somehow disable the "full" list, but still allow an item to be dragged away from it. // If this list has two items, disable it, otherwise enable it if ($('li', this).size()==2) { $(this).addClass('ui-state-disabled'); } else { $(this).removeClass('ui-state-disabled'); } I need to somehow disable the full ul as a drop target. Any ideas would be hugely appreciated.
