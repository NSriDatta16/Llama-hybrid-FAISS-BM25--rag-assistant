The best way is to hire a technically-experienced agile coach. Get somebody to work on your team that has done whatever agile method you want to adopt (scrum, xp, crystal, kanban, ... whatever) before. They're going to have to see your working circumstances - and preferably work in the environment to help. Check their references and make sure they really have used it in practice. Lots of wannabees and fakes around. Having somebody experienced on the team makes all the difference. It's extremely difficult to adopt from just from reading a book. You're trying to change a culture and you can't do that using a checklist or an algorithm. It's a social complexity thing. You're trying to encourage emergent behaviour in a complex system. If you can't hire an agile coach, find other people on the team or in your department or company that have experience and invite them 'round to see the team. Show them your circumstances and get their opinion. Different teams will need different pieces of advice - it depends on lots of things including the team members, the kind of technologies you use, the type of business you work in... Above all else, make contacts with local agilists and learn face-to-face.
