It would appear I should have utilized the google a bit more thoroughly. Rails has a built in class called ActiveRecord::Calculations (go figure) to do pragmatic database counting. I wound up using code like this: results = find(:all, :conditions => conditions, :limit => limit, :offset => offset) total_count = count(:conditions => conditions) return {:results => results, :total_count => total_count}
