Character U+3053 "HIRAGANA LETTER KO". The \xff\xfe bit at the start of the UTF-16 binary format is the encoded byte order mark (U+FEFF), then "S0" is \x5e\x30 , then there's the \n from the original string. (Each of the characters has its bytes "reversed" as it's using little endian UTF-16 encoding.) The UTF-8 form represents the same Hiragana character in three bytes, with the bit pattern as documented here . Now, as for whether you should really have it in your data set... where is this data coming from? Is it reasonable for it to have Hiragana characters in it?
