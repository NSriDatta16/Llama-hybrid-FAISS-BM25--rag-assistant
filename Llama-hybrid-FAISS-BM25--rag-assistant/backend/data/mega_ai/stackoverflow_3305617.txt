Unfortunately, jQuery UI Draggable doesn't expose any methods to manually change the element's position. You will have to track the #person's position manually when moving it with the keyboard, and stop moving it when it is about to exceed the bounds of the #map. You can use jQuery methods such as .offset() and .position() methods to find reliable positions for elements. For instance: $(document).bind( 'keydown', function(event) { switch(event.which) { case 37: { var character = $(characterName); var map = $('#map'); if((character.offset().left - 40) > map.offset().left) { character.animate( { left: '-=40' }, 250, function(){} ); } break; } } } );
