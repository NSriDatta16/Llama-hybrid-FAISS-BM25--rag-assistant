Rank regression is an informal procedure not based on a fully specified statistical model. So you can expect to have interpretation problems and especially have problems generalizing it in various ways such as adjusting for multiple covariates and incorporating repeated measures. It is better to conceptualize the problem as a semiparametric ordinal model. The proportional odds ordinal logistic regression model is one such model, and it has the Wilcoxon and Kruskal-Wallis tests as special cases. Ordinal semiparametric models allow one to obtain all sorts of predicted values included means, medians and other quantiles, exceedance probabilities, and individual cell probabilities. For details see the nonparametric statistics chapter in BBR and the long case study on ordinal models for continuous Y in RMS . Ordinal models do not lead directly to the Hodges-Lehmann estimator but do lead directly to traditional measures such as differences in means. With some trouble you could go back to the definition of Hodges-Lehmann and derive that too, probably.
