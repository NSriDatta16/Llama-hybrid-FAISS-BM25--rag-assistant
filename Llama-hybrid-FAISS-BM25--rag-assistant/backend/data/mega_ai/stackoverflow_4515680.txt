What is the difference between Microsoft.Samples.ServiceHosting.StorageClient and Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient

I am new to Azure and wondering what is the difference between Microsoft.Samples.ServiceHosting.StorageClient and Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient? Are both being used or should I just used the latter? Thank you.
