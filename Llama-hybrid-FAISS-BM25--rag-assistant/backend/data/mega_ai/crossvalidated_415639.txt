Understanding ratio between precision and recall

I have a naive question regarding the ratio of precision and recall. When I build the model, I am able to get precision and recall. Later, I could use this model to make perditions, which is val_pred . Assuming everything stays the same, that means ground_truth value is val_truth = val_pred * Precision/Recall . In that case, will that encourage me of building a higher precision and low recall model in order to inflate val_truth ? Thanks in advance.
