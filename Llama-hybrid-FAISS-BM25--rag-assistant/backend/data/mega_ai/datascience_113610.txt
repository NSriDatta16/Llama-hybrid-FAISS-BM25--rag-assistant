There are 2 popular options when forecasting a time series: Auto-regressive (AR in ARIMA). This approach use all available history to predict next time point. In order to predict further into the future one uses the model's predictions as features: $$ \hat{x}_1 = f(x_{-5},\ldots,x_{0}) $$ $$ \hat{x}_2 = f(x_{-4}, \ldots, \hat{x}_1) $$ $$ \hat{x}_3 = f(x_{-3}, \ldots, \hat{x}_2) $$ and so on. This approach has a downside of accumulating prediction errors over time. Another approach is to make a prediction to exact prediction horizon you are interested in. E.g., if you want to predict what will be the temperature in 24 hours, you train the model to predict exactly that (ommiting predictions 1 hours into the future, 2 hours into the future and so on). The downside of this approach is that you do not use the closest available temporal information from the training data, because during inference that information will not be available (it will still be "the future"). Both approaches are used on practice, sometimes in combination, predicting a short time interval using AR models and predicting further into the future (which is corrected later, as information became available, since future become present ^_^) using non-AR models.
