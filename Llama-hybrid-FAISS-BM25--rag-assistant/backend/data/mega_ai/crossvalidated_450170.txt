For a proportion of individuals with some characteristic, there are two terms we can consider: prevalence and incidence . The distinction relies in how prevalent cases are counted. Prevalence includes both new and prevalent cases. Incidence only includes new (incident) cases. Therefore, you should consider the characteristic in the context of your work. Whether the characteristic is prevalence or incidence depends on the provided context. Often incidence requires multiple measures (since you need to identify who does not have the characteristic at baseline). Example : let's consider the proportion of right-handedness. If we were collect handedness at birth (or as soon as it can be measured) that would correspond to incident handedness since all are new instances of right-handedness. However, if we collect handedness among adults then that would correspond to prevalence since both people who were right-handed at birth and became right-handed would be part of the proportion. However, you could also define right-handedness to be incident among adults (i.e. you would only look at people who had previously been left-handed and see if they began using their right-hand instead). Returning to your ice cream example, I would consider it prevalence. The 60% constitutes both people who recently began to prefer 'cups' and people who have always preferred 'cups'. To find the incidence, you would take the 40% who responded as preferring 'cone' and conduct a follow-up survey.
