There's also an interesting point raised by King & Roberts (2014) : if your classical and robust standard errors diverge, your model suffers from misspecification that need to be fixed. "Settling" for the misspecified model and just correcting the standard errors will lead to "biased estimators of all but a few quantities of interest."
