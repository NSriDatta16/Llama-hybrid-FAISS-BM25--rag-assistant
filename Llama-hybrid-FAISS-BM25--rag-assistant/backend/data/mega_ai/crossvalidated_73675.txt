Interpretation of the final cluster centers (cluster analysis)

I have a question concerning the interpretation of the final cluster centers. I performed a cluster analysis based on a pca (the variables are based on a five point Likert-scale). I got the following result for one factor: cluster_1 cluster_2 cluster_3 cluster_4 cluster_5 0,31 0,39 -0,82 0,63 0,35 Is this factor also interesting for the description of cluster 1, 2 and 5? Or should I only mention its influence for the clusters 3 and 4? Thanks a lot!
