You can normalize the values so that you use, for example, $$\frac{AP - AP_0}{AP_1-AP_0}$$ where $AP$ is the current air pressure, $AP_0$ is the air pressure value you want sent to $0$, and $AP_1$ is the air pressure value you want sent to $1$. It is ok if your inputs occasionally go a bit outside $[-1,1]$. It is dangerous if an input is usually small, but has some occasional extreme values. Then it might be better to split the input into more than one input value, or to remove the outliers and accept that the neural network has a restricted context of applicability. Rescaling so that the outliers are between $-1$ and $1$ won't fix the problem.
