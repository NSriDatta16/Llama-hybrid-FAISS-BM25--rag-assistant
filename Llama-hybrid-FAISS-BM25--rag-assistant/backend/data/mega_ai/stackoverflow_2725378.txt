Order a MySQL result by Date and Time in PHP

$datos = mysql_query("SELECT * FROM usuarios LIMIT 0, 30 "); Who is a simple MySQL query in php, but i need the result organized by date and time. There is a field in my table who has this value (automatic inserted when the user sing up in my page). So the table is something like this: Id Name DT 1 Domingo 2010-04-26 23:00:00 2 Cesar 2010-04-25 12:00:00 3 Nataly 2010-04-26 08:00:00 DT is a "datetime" field. How can i get the result order by new to old? Thanks!
