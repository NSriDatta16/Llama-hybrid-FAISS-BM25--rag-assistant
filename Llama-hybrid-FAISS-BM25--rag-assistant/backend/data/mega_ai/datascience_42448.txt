Variance is the variability of model prediction for a given data point or a value which tells us spread of our data. Model with high variance pays a lot of attention to training data and does not generalize on the data which it hasn’t seen before. As a result, such models perform very well on training data but has high error rates on test data. Error due to variance Error due to variance is the amount by which the prediction, over one training set, differs from the expected value over all the training sets. In machine learning, diﬀerent training data sets will result in a diﬀerent estimation. But ideally it should not vary too much between training sets. However, if a method has high variance then small changes in the training data can result in large changes in results. https://www.coursera.org/lecture/machine-learning/diagnosing-bias-vs-variance-yCAup https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-the-bias-variance-tradeoff-165e6942b229
