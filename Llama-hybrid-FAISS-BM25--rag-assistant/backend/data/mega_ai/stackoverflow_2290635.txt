Objective-C for IPhone for Java Developers: Books, Sites, Videos?

[Yes I have seen this question but I do not know C nor C++, otherwise the O'Reilly book would be great. Though some of the answers to the question are helpful] I do not know C nor C++. I know C#, but only the "managed" stuff. I know Java, but have never dealt with JNI. (I also speak Ruby, PHP, and Basic variants, but that seems to be besides the point). I would like to learn Objective-C for iPhone development particularly, but I'm coming from "higher-level" languages like Java and C#. Are there any resources that would be a good fit? I would really like something that leverages my existing knowledge and talks in terms of differences between Java (or C#) and Objective-C.
