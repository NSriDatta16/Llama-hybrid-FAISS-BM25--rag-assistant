Is addition of a random control variable a good idea, to ensure that results are correct?

I'm dealing with a complex dataset with many patients who have a condition, and various qualities about these patients. I'm trying to determine patient outcome based on patient qualities. I'm using xgboost Classifier to try to determine one of the patient outcomes. In order to ensure that my results are making sense, I've added a random variable, rand which is a random number within (0,10) that will have no impact on patient outcome. The rand variable should show last in variable importance. rand is meant as a control variable. Is adding a control variable like rand a valid method to ascertain that my model makes sense?
