Whitespaces in CLASSPATH

I am working on a Windows PC and have cygwin on it! I have organized all my jars under a directory within a few directories! I am writing a bash script to set the CLASSPATH by iterating through the directory that is passed as a parameter as follows: for JAR_FILE in `ls *.jar` do CLASSPATH="$DIRECTORY_TO_LOOK_FOR_JARS"/$JAR_FILE:$CLASSPATH done Whenever there are spaces in the directory that is passed like /cygdrive/c/Documents and Settings/user/My Jars and I run java -cp $CLASSPATH somepackage.someclass , it throws an error stating that the class and is not found, because the CLASSPATH variable is getting split after /cygdrive/c/Documents . Can someone help me to solve this issue?
