The trick to making a self-unsubscribing event-handler is to capture the handler itself so you can use it in a -= . There is a problem of declaration and definite assignment , though; so we can't do something like: EventHandler handler = (s, e) => { callback(e.Result); _client.AddMemberToTeamCompleted -= handler; // So instead we initialize to null first, so the declaration is before the usage, and it has a known value ( null ) before first used: EventHandler handler = null; handler = (s, e) => { callback(e.Result); _client.AddMemberToTeamCompleted -= handler; }; _client.AddMemberToTeamCompleted += handler;
