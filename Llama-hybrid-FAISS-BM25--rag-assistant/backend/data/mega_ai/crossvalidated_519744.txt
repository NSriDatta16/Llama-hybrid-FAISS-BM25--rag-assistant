Probability distribution of new data given old data

Say we observe data $D$ , which comes from a probability distribution $P[D|\theta]$ , where $\theta$ are the unknown model parameters. Given this information, what is the probability distribution of the future data $D'$ ? Further questions: Does this aim have a specific name in the literature? Can this question be addressed using Frequentist statistics? For Bayesian statistics I came up with the following procedure Find posterior $P[\theta|D]$ Find $P[D'|D] = \int_\theta P[D'|\theta]P[\theta|D]d\theta$ Does this approach make sense? Is this what people typically do?
