If you could post an entire code sample (with html & relevant script tags with nonworking versions), I could help probably point out what's wrong and/or verify the problem .... However, I'm not sure that you want to pass an array of 1 object [ev] as the second parameter to your trigger call. The documentation says "Finally, you can pass a literal object with data. It will be copied to a real jQuery.Event object. Note that you must specify a type attribute in this case." Can you verify that it (should be|worked before) as you've written and/or possibly paste some more code or URL to the relevant page? I'd be happy to take another look at it. Hope that helps. :) Edit: Taking another look at it. It's doing exactly what you ask it to. On the mousedown event, you do some things, and then end by triggering another mousedown event which will do some things and then cause another mouse down event and so on ... and so ... You've created an infinite loop. Why not just make the relevant divs all draggable when the page loads rather than when they are first clicked? Wouldn't that avoid this problem? Also have a look at this post , and I'd be very interested to see some code that used to work. As written, I'm not sure that I understand the sequence of how the code would emulate a complete "drag" event - composed of mousedown, mousemove, and mouse up events. Let me know. Thanks!
