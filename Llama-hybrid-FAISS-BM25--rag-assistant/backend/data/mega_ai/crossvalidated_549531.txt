Development of a sequencing-score (SeqScore)

I'm working with next generation sequencing on a daily basis and hence interpreting a lot of coverage analysis reports to decode the quality of sequencing runs. I'm using the Ion Torrent technology and targeted sequencing. A coverage analysis report consists of: mapped reads (in millions) - How many reads that have been mapped to the reference genome. mean depth - a summary statistic for reads that are assigned to specific amplicons. On target (%) - the percentage of reads that were mapped in the target regions file to any targeted region of the reference. Uniformity (%) - Percentage of bases in targeted regions that is covered by at least 20% of the mean depth. The aim is to create a single number that gives a quick interpretation in form of a score. This is to efficiently determine if the sequencing is of a quality that can be used in downstream analysis. The standard parameters for an accepted sequencing in our lab are: Mapped reads: 5000000 Mean depth: 1000 On target: 80% Uniformity: 80% However, coverage reports can vary a lot, hence a score would be ideal for the assessment. The equation so far: Given the above mentioned parameters, would give a SeqScore of 0.090. Meaning that a sequencing with a SeqScore > 0.090 would be of bad quality and a sequencing with a SeqScore â‰¤ 0.090 would be accepted. Examples: Sequencing 1. Mapped reads: 6902500 Mean depth: 850 On target: 70% Uniformity: 81% SeqScore = 0.098 (Bad) Sequencing 2. Mapped reads: 4000000 Mean depth: 1100 On target: 75% Uniformity: 87% SeqScore = 0.082 (Good) I'm not sure if this a valid way of creating a score? Constructive criticism and inputs to improve this score are very welcome. Thank you for your time.
