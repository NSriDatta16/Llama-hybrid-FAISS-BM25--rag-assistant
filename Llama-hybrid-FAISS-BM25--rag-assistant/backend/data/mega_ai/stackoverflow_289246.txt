dragging and dropping the stored procedures onto a dataset design surface (in .net 2.0 and higher) generates a wrapping function but if you have a lot of them to do, you might be better off using or writing a simple code generator two options for this: generate the wrapping code yourself as C# classes/methods generate a dataset.xsd file then open it in visual studio and let the designer generate the classes/methods for you the latter can be maintained via the dataset design surface, but may be tricky to get generated right (the first time)
