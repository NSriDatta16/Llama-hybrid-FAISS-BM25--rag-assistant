Design of experiment in multiple regression

Suppose we have the following model of our environment: $\hat{y}_t = e^{dayofweekeffect} * x_{1, t}^{\beta_0} * x_{2, t}^{\beta_1}$ which we can linearize into: $log(\hat{y}_t)= dayofweekeffect + \beta_0 * log(x_{1, t}) + \beta_1 * log(x_{2, t})$ To imagine this, lets assume that $y$ consists of daily sales and $x_{1, t}, x_{2, t}$ different daily investments, lets assume promotional activitiy expenditure. Our investments are not the sole driver behind sales, the baseline sales is modelled by $dayofweekeffect$ . We can imagine that the $dayofweekeffect$ is modelled by fourier terms or dummies. Notice that we dont "control" for the dayofweekeffect in the sense that we have an proxy for dayofweekeffect but instead we use dummies or fourier terms and models it "simultaneously". We could also imagine some structural time series model trying to decompose the effects. The dataset is problematic since the previous analyst, did not consider the baseline sales but instead used an model $log(\hat{y}_t) = \beta_{dayofweekeffect_0} * log(x_{1, t}) + \beta_{dayofweekeffect_1} * log(x_{2, t})$ and used this model to optimize expenditure. This means that he essentially created datapoints for $x_{1, t}$ in which he spent less when the $dayofweekeffect$ was lower and more when the $dayofweekeffect$ was higher. My goal is to design an experiment(DOE) such that we can efficiently disentangle the $dayofweekeffect$ from the effect of $x_{1, t}$ but i need some guidance on which literature/design criterions i should further investigate. Question What would be an appropiate design criteria for this scenario? Also notice, that we are not sure how well he optimized the previous expenditure, there might not be an perfect collinearity between the unknown $dayofweek$ -demand and $x_{1, t}$ thus it could be useful to also factor in the previous dataset in some way.
