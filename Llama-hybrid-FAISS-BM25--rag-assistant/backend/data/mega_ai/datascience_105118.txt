Not exactly sure which hidden layer you are looking for, but the TransformerEncoderLayer class simply has the different layers as attributes which can easily access (e.g. self.linear1 or self.self_attn ). The TransformerEncoder is simply a stack of TransformerEncoderLayer layers, which are stored in the layer attribute as a list. For each layer in the list you can then access the hidden layers as mentioned.
