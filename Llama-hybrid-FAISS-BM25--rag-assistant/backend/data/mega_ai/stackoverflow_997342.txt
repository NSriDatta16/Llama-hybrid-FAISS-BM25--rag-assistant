Why does ASP.Net RadioButton and CheckBox render inside a Span?

I would expect this: ...to render like this (with some attributes removed for simplicity) : ...when in fact, the RadioButton and CheckBox get wrapped with a span tag and the CSS class gets applied there. Is there a reason for this and is there a way to avoid it? It makes jQuery selectors ugly since you can't catch all of them with: $("input.myClass") Granted it is just going to: $("input.myClass, span.myClass input") ...but that is ugly. I could write my own selector, but again not as elegant as it should be.
