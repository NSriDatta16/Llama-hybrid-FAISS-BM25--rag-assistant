Markov chain transience of a state

I am trying to understand how this Markov chain would arise. denote $p_{ij}^{(n)}$ the probability of going from position $i$ to $j$ in $n$ steps. Assume $p_{ij}^{(n)}>0$ and $p_{ji}^{(n)} > 0$ is it possible for state $i$ to be transient? I do not quite know how to think of this, here is my current take: Maybe given the properties of $p_{ij}^{(n)}>1/5$ and $p_{ji}^{(n)} > 1/5\space \forall n\geq 0$, this implies that $i$ will always rotate between positions $i$ and $j$ given the proba is not 0. However I am also thinking that there is some proba that we might go from state $i$ to $k$ from which $k$ is an element of a closed subset when $i$ is not, however would that mean that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} p_{ij}^{(n)}=0$ and $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty}p_{ji}^{(n)} = 0$
