The point of PCA is to correlate the data to convert it from a multi-dimensional vector into a lower dimension. This is done by only selecting the eigenvectors with the largest eigenvalue. IE only selecting the dimensions which have most variance. Therefore, for your case where you only have a single dimensional vector this is not possible. From reading the comments i see that you need it for an RNN. What i suggest is that you reduce the size of the vector, either by max-pooling, or average-pooling prior to feeding it to the RNN. Other options include using maxpooling with a convolutional net before to try and extract information for the RNN but this increases the complexity of your network. Without additional information about the application, i cannot really give more insight to this. Hope this helps!
