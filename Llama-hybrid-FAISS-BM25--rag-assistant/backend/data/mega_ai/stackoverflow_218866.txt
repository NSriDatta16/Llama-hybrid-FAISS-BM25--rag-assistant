How do I display mysql data in row span using PHP?

I have data from MySQL showing all organisations a customer got, with all details of employess in each organisation. I want to list each organisation name only once i.e. in a single cell ( row span) and all employees in that organisation against this name like: Org1 Emp1 Name, Emp1 Phone, Emp1 Address Emp2 Name, Emp2 Phone, Emp2 Address Org2 Emp1 Name, Emp1 Phone, Emp1 Address Emp2 Name, Emp2 Phone, Emp2 Address How do I display this data because the number of employess for each organisation is not known in advanced, so I do'nt about setting value of rowspan. Similarly how do I start a row for other organisation? Do I have to write two queries? Many Thanks.
