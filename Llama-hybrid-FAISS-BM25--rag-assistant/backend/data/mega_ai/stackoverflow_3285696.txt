The byte size impacts data retrieval, not calculation based on it. Indexes can improve this if necessary, but will slow down UPDATE/INSERT/DELETE statements. I suggest choosing the data type that reflects the operations you're going to be using. If you don't need the precision at all, there's no reason to consider using DECIMAL or FLOAT.
