Literature on applying XGBoost to Time Series Data

I'm currently working on doing a time-series model with very limited data. However, most of the independent variables I have are not time-dependent, cross-sectional data. As such I want to apply some form of regression or decision tree in such. Is there any literature, white paper, package or methodology where I can apply XGBoost or any of the regression trees or algorithms for such use?
