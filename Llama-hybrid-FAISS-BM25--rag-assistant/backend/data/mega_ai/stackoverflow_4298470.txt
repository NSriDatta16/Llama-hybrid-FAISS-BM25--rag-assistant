A narrow string literal has type "array of n const char ", where n is the size of the string as defined below, and has static storage duration . Static storage is neither automatic ("on the stack") nor dynamic ("on the heap"). It is allocated prior to the actual runtime of your program, so pointers to string literals never become invalid. Note that char* p = "Hello" is deprecated because it is dangerous: the type system cannot prevent you from trying to change the string literal through p (which would result in undefined behavior ). Use const char* p = "Hello" instead.
