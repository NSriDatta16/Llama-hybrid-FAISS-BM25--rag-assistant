I can't find any evidence in the JPA 2.0 spec that the @OrderColumn annotation is supposed to work for Map . Quoting the spec: 11.1.39 OrderColumn Annotation The OrderColumn annotation specifies a column that is used to maintain the persistent order of a list . The persistence provider is responsible for maintaining the order upon retrieval and in the database. The persistence provider is responsible for updating the ordering upon flushing to the database to reflect any insertion, deletion, or reordering affecting the list. The OrderColumn annotation may be specified on a one-to-many or many-to-many relationship or on an element collection. The OrderColumn annotation is specified on the side of the relationship that references the collection that is to be ordered. The order column is not visible as part of the state of the entity or embeddable class. If you want to preserve order, use a List (of Embeddable in your case). With a Map , access to values by keys.
