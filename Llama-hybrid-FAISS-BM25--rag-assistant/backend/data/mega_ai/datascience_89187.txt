NER with LSTM - How to recognize person names that are not part of the vocabulary?

I am learning Named Entity Recognition and going through posts similar to this one: Named-Entity Recognition (NER) using Keras Bidirectional LSTM So the sentences are fed into the model as a sequence of integers - every int corresponding to the index in the vocabulary - from what I understand this is how the embedding layer works. My question is - does that mean the model would not be able to recognize a person's name if it doesn't exist in the vocabulary? For example, from the sentence: "John Doe went for a walk" given John Doe is in the vocabulary, it will be recognized as a person name but the sentence: "Unknown Name went for a walk" will not be properly tagged if Unknown Name is not in the vocab? To me, this would be a little strange as Unknown Name is in the same context as John Doe so I was hoping to be able to somehow tag it properly. I'm obviously lacking knowledge here so I'd be very grateful for any suggestions and reference materials.
