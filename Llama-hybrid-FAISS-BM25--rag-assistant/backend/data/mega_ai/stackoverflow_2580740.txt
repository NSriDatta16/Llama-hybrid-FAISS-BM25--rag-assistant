Ganglia ( http://ganglia.sourceforge.net/ ) is a popular monitoring tool that supports collecting arbitrary statistics using the gmetric tool. You might be able to build something around that. If you do need to roll your own solution then you could have a persistent message queue at A (I'm a fan of RabbitMQ) to which you could log your metrics. You could then have something at B which listens for messages on the queue and saves the state at B. This approach means you don't lose data when the connection drops. The message might be a simple compressed data value, say csv or json so should be fine on low bandwidth connections. All the work (parsing the csv or json, and saving the data to a database for example) is done at B where you don't have limitations.
