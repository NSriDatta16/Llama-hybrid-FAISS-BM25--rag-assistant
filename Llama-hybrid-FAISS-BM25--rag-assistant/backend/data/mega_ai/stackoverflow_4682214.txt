The GCC has a __builtin_expect “function” that you can use to indicate to the compiler which branch will likely be taken. You could use it like this: if(__builtin_expect(FIRST, 1)) … Is this useful? I have no idea. I have never used it, never seen it used (except allegedly in the Linux kernel). The GCC documentation actually discourages its usage in favour of using profiling information to achieve a more reliable metric.
