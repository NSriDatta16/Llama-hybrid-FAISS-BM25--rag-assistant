If you mean LDA I would say the name, linear discriminant analysis, can be explained historically dating back at least to Fisher's paper from 1936 , which, to the best of my knowledge, precedes the current terminology and distinction in machine learning between a discriminative and a generative model. Not that Fisher called it linear discriminant analysis directly, but he did explicitly ask for a linear function for discrimination. As a curious side remark, Fisher considered discrimination for the famous Iris data set in the paper. Fisher did, by the way, not present the linear method for discrimination in terms of a generative model. He sought a linear combination (for two classes) that maximizes the ratio of the between-group variance to the within-group variance , which does not require a normality assumption. Details, and how it relates to LDA as a Bayes rule for a generative model, can be found in Chapter 3 in Brian Ripley's book "Pattern Recognition and Neural Networks".
