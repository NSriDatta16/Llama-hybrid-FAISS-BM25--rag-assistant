Why are neural networks smooth functions?

I am reading Chapter 11 of Elements of Statistical learning and came across this sentence: "Unlike methods like CART and MARS, neural networks are smooth functions of real-valued parameters" What is meant by 'smooth functions' here? I have come across things such as smoothing splines, but am unsure what a 'smooth function' means more generally. Following on from the above, what makes neural networks specifically smooth functions?
