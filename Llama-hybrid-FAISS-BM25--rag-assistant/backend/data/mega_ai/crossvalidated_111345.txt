Weighting words based on position in text

I'm currently working on semantic analysis and had a question about text organization and structure. Are there any algorithms, or statistical / machine-learning models that weight the importance of a word or n-gram based on it's position in the global text ? I'm asking this question because I'm looking for a way to improve the score of titles, (sub)-chapter names, section names, list elements, table headers, etc.
