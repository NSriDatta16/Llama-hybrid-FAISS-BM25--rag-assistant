Database designers almost always know how many characters a column needs to hold. US delivery addresses need to hold up to 64 characters. (The US Postal Service publishes addressing guidelines that say so.) US ZIP codes are 5 characters long. A database designer will look at representative sample data from her clients when she's specifying columns. She'll ask herself, questions like "What's the longest product name?" And when the answer is "70 characters", she won't make the column 3000 characters wide. VARCHAR has a limit of 8k in SQL Server (I think). Most applications don't require nearly that much storage for a single column.
