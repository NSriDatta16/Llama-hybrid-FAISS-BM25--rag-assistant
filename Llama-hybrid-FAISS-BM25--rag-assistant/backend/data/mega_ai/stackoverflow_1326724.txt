Performance: selector or traversing?

I was wondering which was the fastest way to apply a class on body and, let's say, all paragraphs. We can use simple selectors such as: $("body").addClass("foo"); $("p").addClass("bar"); But also traversing methods like: $("body").addClass("foo").find("p").addClass("bar"); Is there any difference in term of performance?
