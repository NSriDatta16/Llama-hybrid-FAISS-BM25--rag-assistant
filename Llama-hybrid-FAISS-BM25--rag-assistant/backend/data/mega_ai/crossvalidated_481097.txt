A classic linear regression model works under the assumption that the data can be modeled as y = Ax + b + eta where eta ~ N(0,sigma) . if your residuals are uniformly distributed, it means that the above assumptions doesn't hold. However, this linear regression can still work for you, depending on the application- both a uniform and Gaussian model are symmetric, with E(data) = median(data) . So even though the data is not really 'Gaussian', the line that best fit the data (according to the mean/median) will be the same (again, depending on the application). An option that might work for you is Bayesian Linear Regression (BLR): in BLR, you can choose your model assumptions: eta ~ U(-1,1) , eta ~ N(0,sigma) or eta ~ Beta(2,2) are all valid assumptions. anything that best fit your data
