As you code to make the interface as clear as possible, I always prefer using a field as _name internally, having it as name as a method argument, assigning it elegantly as _name = name . I have seen this in Fowler's Refactoring and other similar textbooks, though I see ugly mechanisms such as using the field as name internally then using aName as a method argument, ugh.
