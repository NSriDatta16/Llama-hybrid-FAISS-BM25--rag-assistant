Multiple Comparisons Problem for non-independant subsets

I'm investigating whether a program was effective or not using BACI analysis and noticed that overall it had no effect (The 2-way ANOVA and non-parametric approach gave a p-value of about 0.5). I want to investigate whether there's any short term effects. Unfortunately, the data was very noisy and so to smooth things out, I borrowed a technique used in stock market analysis (plotted the daily moving average of the last week) and calculated the p-values for each giving the plot below; I've heard of the Multiple Comparison Problem and know that I can't just use the same significance level I used for the overall effect ( What significance level should I use to tell whether the peak at day 12 is significant and why?
