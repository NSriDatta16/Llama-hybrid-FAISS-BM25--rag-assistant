A group combination and constraint solving problem. What algorithm can I use?

This problems feels like it should have a name. Hopefully someone can recognize it. There is a 32 member club. Every week the members have dinner together, dividing themselves into 8 tables of 4 members each. Each week they arrange themselves such that they are always sitting with different people. Is it possible to have every person be seated with every other person exactly once? I've tried programming a greedy approach, but it didn't work for these numbers (it did work for a 16 member club with 4 tables of 4 each, but not 36 members with 6 tables of 6 people) Though this sounds like a homework problem, this is actually from my friend's mom, who is trying to organize these dinners.
