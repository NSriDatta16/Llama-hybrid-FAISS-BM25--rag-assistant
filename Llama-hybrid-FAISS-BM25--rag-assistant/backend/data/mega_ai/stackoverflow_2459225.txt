Seems like a reasonable way to do it... I'd just suggest that you make use of jQuery's data storage utilities rather than introducing an extra variable (which could become a headache if you wanted to keep track of a whole bunch of links). So based of your example: $('a').click(function() { var clicks = $(this).data('clicks'); if (clicks) { alert('odd number of clicks'); } else { alert('even number of clicks'); } $(this).data("clicks", !clicks); });
