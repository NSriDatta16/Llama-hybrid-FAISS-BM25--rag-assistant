What tool(s) for fairly complex stress testing a web application

I'm part of a team developing a new web-based product for our company. Whilst we're pretty positive the application will work perfectly with our expected average of 10-50 concurrent users, we have a requirement to ensure it will continue to work correctly for 1000 concurrent users. Our primary concern is around the loading and displaying of various documents from the file system. To get the files, the user would need to log in, navigate to a search page, wait for a search to complete, then click a link and wait for the document to load. We have SilkTest/TestPartner, which can be configured to go through the steps above, but I don't believe these tools can realistically be used to simulate load to the extent we require. Can you suggest some (preferably free / open source) programs? Commercial products aren't a no-go, but the price cannot be enormous :) Thanks in advance!
