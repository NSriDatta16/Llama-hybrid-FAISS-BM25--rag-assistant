SQL Better performance: char(10) and trim or varchar(10)

I have a database that uses codes. Each code can be anywhere from two characters to ten characters long. In MS SQL Server, is it better for performance to use char(10) for these codes and RTRIM them as they come in, or should I use varchar(10) and not have to worry about trimming the extra whitespace? I need to get rid of the whitespace because the codes will then be used in application logic for comparisons and what not. As for the average code length, hard to tell exactly. Assume all codes are a random length between one and ten. Edit: A rough estimation is about 4.7 characters for the average length of a code.
