How to convert PDF binary parts into ASCII/ANSI so I can look at it in a text editor?

Most PDFs contain lots of binary looking parts in between some ASCII. But I remember also having seen PDFs where such binary parts by and large were absent, and one could open them in a text editor to study their structure. Is there a trick, tool, or command that will convert binary PDF parts to ASCII/ANSI? (Preferably "free as in beer" or even "free as in liberty")
