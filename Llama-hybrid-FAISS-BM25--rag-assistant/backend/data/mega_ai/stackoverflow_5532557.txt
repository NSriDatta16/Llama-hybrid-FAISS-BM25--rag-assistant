How to find the text in an NSTextView?

I need to find the text in an NSTextView , and save it to a file. I can do the saving fine. I have used -stringValue , and -textStorage so far, but neither have worked. When I put -stringValue in, it just gave me (null), and when I put -textStorage in, it gave me a very large chunk of nothing (like a long paragraph of invisible text). How can I put the text from an NSTextView into an NSString ?
