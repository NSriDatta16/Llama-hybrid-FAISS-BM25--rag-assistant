Depends on how sparse/dense your matrix is. If it is sparse, you better store a list of points, if it is dense, go with the 2D array. If in between, you can have a hybrid solution storing a list of sub-matrices. This implementation detail should be hidden within a class anyway, so your code can also anytime convert between any of these representations. I would discourage you from settling on any of these solutions without profiling with your real application.
