In Common Lisp, it looks like you can do: (defun average (&rest args) (when args (/ (apply #'+ args) (length args)))) although I have no idea if &rest is available on all implementations of Lisp. Reference here . Putting that code into GNU CLISP results in: [1]> (defun average (&rest args) (when args (/ (apply #'+ args) (length args)))) AVERAGE [2]> (average 1 2 3 4 5 6) 7/2 which is 3.5 (correct).
