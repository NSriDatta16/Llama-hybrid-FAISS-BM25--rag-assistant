As explained in this answer , multiple imputation is used to generate multiple datasets, perform statistical analysis on them, and average the results. Basically, multiple imputation takes a simple imputation and adds to it a random value to try to restore randomness lost in the imputation process. Therefore, averaging multiple imputations before doing any statistical analysis on them just removes most of that restored randomness (by averaging) and gives a result close to simple imputation plus an small random error. Therefore, there is no advantage in using multiple imputations to report average of imputations over just using and reporting simple imputation.
