Try searching for "Continuous Integration ". It's a Good Thing(TM), in my opinion. "Continuous Implementation " would only be a good development methodology in the Dilbert universe. ;) Edit: The original question was simply asking what "continuous implementation" is. Since this site is StackOverflow, not EconomicsOverflow or PolymerEngineeringOverflow, the correct answer is "nothing." The question was edited afterward to expand the scope, but that doesn't really change my answer. All references of this term I can find in the realm of software development appear to be a mistake where the author is really meant continuous integration , a common agile technique. The OP now referenced a a paper using the term in the context of use of the term in an "agile" supply-chain management implementation. Even so, despite the publication, the term has not entered common parlance in SCM, much less software development, and thus has no generally-accepted definition.
