I think Li-Mak (Li & Mak, 1994) (univariate) and Ling-Li (Ling & Li, 1997) (multivariate) tests are suitable candidates for error diagnostics in univariate and multivariate GARCH models, respectively. Unlike some other (popular) tests*, they account for the fact that standardized residuals from GARCH models are not equal to true standardized innovations but are mere estimates thereof and contain estimation errors**. However, I have not investigated their performance empirically nor do I remember studying any references doing that. Nevertheless, there is a paper (Wong & Ling, 2005) investigating some practical aspects of and containing tips on the use of these and other tests; I hope it can be useful. *The deficiencies of some popular (univariate) tests are analyzed in Chen (2002) , among other. The deficiencies extend from the univariate to the multivariate case as well, since taking residuals for actual innovations is a problem regardless of the dimension of the time series. **This problem is characteristic not only to testing residuals of GARCH models, but also those of ARMA models; see the thread "Testing for autocorrelation: Ljung-Box versus Breusch-Godfrey" for why popular tests fail there.
