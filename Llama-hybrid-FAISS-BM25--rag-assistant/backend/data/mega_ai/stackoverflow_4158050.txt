does the lambda function somehow store a 'reference' to the variable or something? Close. The lambda function captures the variable itself. There is no need to store a reference to a variable, and in fact, in .NET it is impossible to permanently store a reference to a variable. You just capture the entire variable . You never capture the value of the variable. Remember, a variable is a storage location. The name "i" refers to a particular storage location, and in your case, it always refers to the same storage location. Is there anyway around this problem? Yes. Create a new variable every time through the loop. The closure then captures a different variable every time. This is one of the most frequently reported problems with C#. We're considering changing the semantics of the loop variable declaration so that a new variable is created every time through the loop.
