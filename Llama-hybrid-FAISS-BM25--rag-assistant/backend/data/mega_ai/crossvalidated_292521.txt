Logistic regression or two sample t-test on clinical data

I have a database with healthy subjects and people with memory losses. For both groups, I have obtained from a MRI scan the volume of lesions they have on the brain. So I have one categorical variable indicating the group and a continuous variable indicating volume of lesions. I would like to test if theres a relation between the volume of lesions and the memory losses. Firstly I considered making a two-sample t-test to see if the mean of the lesion volume differed between both groups. Now I have received a suggestion about making logistic regression, using the group as an independent variable. After reading the following post: Logistic regression or T test? , it is not clear to me which test is more suitable for my data. Does each test confirm different hypothesis? Do you have any suggestion of what should I have into account to choose a test?
