Four years after asking this question, I've learnt a few things, so perhaps I should add a few ideas. I think Bayesian hierarchical modelling provides a flexible approach to this problem. Software : Tools like jags, stan, WinBugs, and so on potentially combined with their respective R interface packages (e.g., rjags, rstan) make it easier to specify such models. Varying within person error: Bayesian models make it easy to specify the within person error variance as a random factor that varies between people. For example, you could model scores $y$ on participants $i=1,..., n$ at time points $j=1,...J$ as $$y_{ij}\sim N(\mu_i, \sigma^2_i)$$ $$\mu_i = \gamma$$ $$\gamma \sim N(\mu_\gamma, \sigma^2_\gamma)$$ $$\sigma_i \sim \rm{Gamma}(\alpha, \beta)$$ Thus the standard deviation of each person might be modelled as a gamma distribution. I have found this to be an important parameter in many psychological domains where people vary in how much they vary over time. Latent classes of curves: I have not explored this idea as much yet, but it is relatively straight forward to specify two or more possible data generating functions for each individual and then let the Bayesian model choose the most likely model for a given individual. Thus, you would typically get posterior probabilities for each individual regarding which functional form describes the individuals data. As a sketch of an idea for a model, you could have something like the following: $$y_{ij} \sim N(\mu_{ij}, \sigma^2)$$ $$\mu_{ij} = \gamma_i \lambda_{ij}^{(1)} + (1 - \gamma_i) \lambda_{ij}^{(2)}$$ $$\lambda_{ij}^{(1)} = \theta^{(1)}_{1i} + \theta^{(1)}_{2i} \exp(-\theta^{(1)}_{3i}) $$ $$\lambda_{ij}^{(2)} =\theta^{(2)}_{1i} + \theta^{(2)}_{2i} x_{ij} + \theta^{(2)}_{3i} x^2_{ij}$$ $$\gamma_i = \rm{Bernoulli}(\pi_i)$$ Where $x_{ij}$ is time and $\lambda_{ij}^{(1)}$ represents expected values for a three parameter exponential model and $\lambda_{ij}^{(2)}$ represents expected values for a quadratic model. $\pi_i$ represents the probability that model will choose $\lambda_{ij}^{(1)}$.
