If we assume that the scores are drawn iid (and I don't see why we wouldn't, since it's different players of different teams), then the 378 observations of average points per player (score/2 for each row) allow you to characterize the distribution of the statistic you're trying to estimate (in your case the "mean of means"). The standard deviation of this sampling distribution is the standard error you are trying to calculate!
