How to Have a Bundled Configurable Product in Magento?

I've been searching about this topic on Magento forum and Google but can't find a definite answer for the question. Hope I find it here. Is it possible to have a bundled configurable products in Magento? Take for example I want to sell a set of t-shirt and short on a product page where the customer can choose the number of quantity, the color and the size for the t-shirt and short respectively. Maybe like this : T-Shirt [A configurable Product] Color : [combobox to select color] Size : [combobox to select Size] Qty : [input to enter the qty] Short [Another configurable Product] Color : [combobox to select color] Size : [combobox to select Size] Qty : [input to enter the qty] [Add to Cart Button] Any help and answer will be much appreciated. Thanks!
