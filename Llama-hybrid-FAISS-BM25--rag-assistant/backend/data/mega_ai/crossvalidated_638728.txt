How to obtain the (weighted or unweighted) L1 imbalance measure for "raw" data

I have two questions regarding the JASA paper, Multivariate Matching Methods That Are Monotonic Imbalance Bounding , by Iacus et al. (2011), the authors produce Figure 2 (left panel) where they compare the L1 measure for propensity score, mahalanobis and cem matching methods and benchmark against the L1 measure for the "raw" data. In their supplementary materials they state "file acompleteone.R: produces Figures 2 and 3 and Table 3" but no such file exists in their directory. Having read the paper and the preceding paragraphs before Figure 2 carefully, I'm still not understanding how they calculate L1(H) for the "raw" data. I believe that for each of the 250 iterations, they randomly select an upper and lower limit for the coarsening range of each variable and then select H randomly as opposed to their rule-of-thumb median method but it appears this is the case only for the raw, propensity score and mahalanobis methods as for cem they state, "we use CEM with fixed coarsening (10 intervals for each continuous variable and no coarsening for the categorical variables)". Additionally, it is not 100% clear to me whether they calculate the weighted or unweighted L1 imbalance measure, although here it appears it is weighted but no mention of this in the actual paper. If weights are used for the paper's Figure 2 results, any idea why weights are not explicitly in the formula for their L1 multivariate imbalance measure? (Formula (6))
