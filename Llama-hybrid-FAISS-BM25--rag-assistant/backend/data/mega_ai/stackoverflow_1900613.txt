Well, we recently made a timestamp format where time is stored in a unsigned 64-bit integer as microseconds from 1970. It will last until the year 586912, which should be enough. Coding for "forever" is unnecessary - of course you could use BigIntegers and such everywhere, but why? Just be prepared for more than 5 or 10 years. Twenty year old production code is not quite unusual nowadays, and I suspect that the average life cycle will get even longer in the near future.
