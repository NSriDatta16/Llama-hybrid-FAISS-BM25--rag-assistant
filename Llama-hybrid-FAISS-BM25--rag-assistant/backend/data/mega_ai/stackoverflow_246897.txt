One of the first differences that I can recall from top of my head are multiple domains running in the same server, partial resource retrieval, this allows you to retrieve and speed up the download of a resource (it's what almost every download accelerator does). If you want to develop an application like a website or similar, you don't need to worry too much about the differences but you should know the difference between GET and POST verbs at least. Now if you want to develop a browser then yes, you will have to know the complete protocol as well as if you are trying to develop a HTTP server. If you are only interested in knowing the HTTP protocol I would recommend you starting with HTTP/1.1 instead of 1.0.
