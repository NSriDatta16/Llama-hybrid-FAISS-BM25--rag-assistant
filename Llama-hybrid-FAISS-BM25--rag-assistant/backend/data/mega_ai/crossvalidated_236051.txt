You can use pretty much any numerical optimization algorithm to optimize weights of a neural network. You can also use mixed continous-discrete optimization algorithms to optimize not only weights, but layout itself (number of layers, number of neurons in each layer, even type of the neuron). However there's no optimization algorithm that do not suffer from "curse of dimensionality" and local optimas in some manner
