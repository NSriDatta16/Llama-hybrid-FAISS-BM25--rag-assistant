There are three real options here to get better invoices: Write a better invoice system that still uses PDFs. I've done this for a client, it takes a long time. Unfortunately, there is no really good way to change the PDFs that Magento generates by default. Replace the controller/action that generate the PDFs with ones that will simply output HTML. Same as above, but override the mass-action dropdown to contain your new entries. This is probably the easiest, and you can add more reports while you're at it. Take a look at Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Sales_Order_Grid , specifically _prepareMassaction Hope that helps. Thanks, Joe
