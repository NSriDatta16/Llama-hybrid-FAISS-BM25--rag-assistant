You will not find a theoretical/scientific justification for this statement as there is none! The difficulty of optimisation is related to a lot of things, dimension being just one of them and most likely not even a very important one. For example, if you just assume continuity and not differentiability of your objective function the question of the dimension of the domain becomes completely moot anyway. Using space filling curves you can always reparametrise an $n$ -dimensional function to one of a single variable. So it is really easy to find one-dimensional functions which are impossible to optimise using BO. And it is also easy to find functions in hundreds or even thousands dimension which are simple to optimise, be it Bayesian or otherwise. Then why do some people make such statements and why do others believe them? I think there are two reasons for this: They are (in those cases the researcher is interested in or knows about) a good heuristic. The full qualification of those statements is just too long and would contain too many complicated "purely theoretical" qualifications. And many of those qualifications are probably "obvious" to people working in the field, they "go without saying".
