There are good answers here, but I am surprised that one thing has not been emphasized. CART does not make any distributional assumptions about the data, particularly the response variable. In contrast, OLS regression (for continuous response variables) and logistic regression (for certain categorical response variables), for example, do make strong assumptions; specifically, OLS regression assumes the response is conditionally normally distributed, and logistic assumes the response is binomial or multinomial. CART's lack of such assumptions is a double-edged sword. When those assumptions are not warranted, this gives the approach a relative advantage. On the other hand, when those assumptions hold, more information can be extracted from the data by taking those facts into account. That is, standard regression methods can be more informative than CART when the assumptions are true.
