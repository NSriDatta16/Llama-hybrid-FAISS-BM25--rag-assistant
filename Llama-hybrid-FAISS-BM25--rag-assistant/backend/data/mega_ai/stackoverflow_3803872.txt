Yes you can add controls dynamically to pages, without a round-trip to the server. Drag-drop is also executed client-side. Think of Silverlight as more like a desktop app, that talks to the server only to get/save data. Adding controls dynamically in Silverlight is as simple as newing the appropriate control class and inserting it in the render tree (e.g. by adding it to a parent control).
