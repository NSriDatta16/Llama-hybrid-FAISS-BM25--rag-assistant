What exactly are you trying to accomplish? I'm not 100%, but I am pretty sure each row is going to be with same width as the parent table. However, if you have a custom UITableViewCell, you can make it transparent, and organize your objects on the cell's view to mimic a different sized cell. For example if you wanted a cell to be 50px less wide than the other cells and indented, you could place a white UIView on the transparent cell, make it 50px less wide than it should be, and position it to the right. Make sense?
