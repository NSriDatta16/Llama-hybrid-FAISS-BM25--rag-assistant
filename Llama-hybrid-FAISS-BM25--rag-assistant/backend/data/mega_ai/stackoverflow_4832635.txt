Can I make this easier? Bubbling vs Tunneling in WPF?

I am working with drag and drop functionality in a WPF application. I have a tree structure such as the following. StackPanel - Border 1 - Grid A - Grid 1 - Grid 2 - Border 2 - Grid B - Grid 1 - Grid 2 This is my attempt to show the tree representation of the UIElements in my WPF application. so the stack panel contains Grids with nested grids within it. These are being defined dynamically in code, and not in XAML. I have the inner Grids(1 & 2) handling Drag and Drop events. The problem I am having is that when a drop operation is being performed, and it is dropped on the border of one of the grids, it falls through and hits the StackPanel Drop. What I would like to do is when an item is dropped on the border, I would like it to fall through to the same drop event handler. I am fairly new to the idea of Routed Events and Bubbling and Tunneling events. I am aware that I need this event to travel down the element hierarchy which makes me believe that I am in need for "Tunneling" Event. Does this mean that I am supposed to attach the border to an event handler. Right now I have the following code for the Grids to be subscribed to the event. fieldItemGrid.PreviewDrop += Grid_Drop; private void Grid_Drop(object sender,DragEventArgs e) { //React to Drop Event Here } Am I able to do something simpler then rewriting the code that goes here in a Border_Drop Event? Thanks ahead of time.
