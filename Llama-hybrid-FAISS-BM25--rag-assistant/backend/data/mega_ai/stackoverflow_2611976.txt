I am afraid I have no answer as far as XAMPP configuration but I can suggest including PHP headers. header('Content-type: text/html; charset=utf-8'); header('Expires: Mon, 20 Dec 1998 01:00:00 GMT'); header('Last-Modified: '.gmdate('D, d M Y H:i:s').'GMT'); header('Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate'); header('Pragma: no-cache'); Not sure how a system to check the file last editted timestamp would help as PHP files are generally generate dynamic content and this timestamp has no correlation to database updates.
