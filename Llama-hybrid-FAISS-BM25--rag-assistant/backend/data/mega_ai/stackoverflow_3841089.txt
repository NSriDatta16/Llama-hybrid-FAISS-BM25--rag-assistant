From http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/REC-xml-20081126/#sec-line-ends XML parsed entities are often stored in computer files which, for editing convenience, are organized into lines. These lines are typically separated by some combination of the characters CARRIAGE RETURN (#xD) and LINE FEED (#xA). To simplify the tasks of applications, the XML processor MUST behave as if it normalized all line breaks in external parsed entities (including the document entity) on input, before parsing, by translating both the two-character sequence #xD #xA and any #xD that is not followed by #xA to a single #xA character. So, it's ok to look for &#xA; (or &#10; ). But do note that white space only text nodes from the input may or may not be preserve depending on XML tree provider (MSXSL XML parser doesn't preserve this text nodes). Not white space only text nodes are preserved, of course. Then, this text named template replace new lines with empty br elements in XSLT 1.0: With this input: whatever and more Output: whatever and more
