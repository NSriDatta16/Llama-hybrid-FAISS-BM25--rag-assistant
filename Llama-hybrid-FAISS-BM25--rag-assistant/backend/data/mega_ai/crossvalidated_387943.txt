Confidence Interval for accuracy - Binomial?

Imagine we fit the same data mining model on 100 different validation datasets and accuracy is always exactly 95%. If we now use the Binomial proportion confidence interval we would have a standard error of around 2%. The 95% confidence interval is therefore around (0.91,0.99) which seems quite wide for a model that always got us always 95%. Also, if we average accuracy over the 100 trials, the outcome would be the same if we would have attained 100 various accuracy measures that averaged to 0.95 (e.g. 50 times 90% and 50 times 100%). This does not seem right to me. I am also not sure if the binomial model would be right for this. Can somebody clear this up to me? (A solution to get more narrow CI would of course be to do more repetitions, which is however not possible for me because of computing time.)
