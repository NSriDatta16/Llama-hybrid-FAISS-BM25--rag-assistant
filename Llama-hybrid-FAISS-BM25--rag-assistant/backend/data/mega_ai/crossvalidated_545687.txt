Discern between- and within person correlation in longitudinal data

There's a known between-person association of X and Y, and I'm trying to find out whether this association also holds on the within-person level by conducting a longitudinal study with 4 measurement occasions. My question is: How can I analyse both between- and within-person correlations at the same time? I'm hypothesizing two possible scenarios: A) there is a within-person association of X and Y, or B), as X changes, Y doesn't change (with Y beeing pretty constant in general), but within-person mean levels of X are associated with Y. If I were only interested in the within-person correlation, I could specify a multilevel model as follows, with $\gamma_1$ giving the average within-person association (correct?): $$Y_{it} = \beta_{oi} + \beta_{1i}X_{it}$$ $$ \beta_{ot}=\gamma_{0} + u_{0i} $$ $$ \beta_{1t}=\gamma_{1} + u_{1i} $$ But I'm not sure how to analyse between-person associations within this framework. Basically, I'm looking for something like a random-intercept cross-lagged panel model, but without the cross-effects.
