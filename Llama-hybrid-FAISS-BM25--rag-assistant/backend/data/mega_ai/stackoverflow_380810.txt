You want django to check it for you because it ensures file is put inside MEDIA_ROOT dir so it's accessible for download. In any case you want to put files outside MEDIA_ROOT (in this case '/tmp') you should do something like this: from django.core.files.storage import FileSystemStorage fs = FileSystemStorage(location='/tmp') class YourModel(models.Model): ... file_field = models.FileField(..., storage=fs) see Django documentation
