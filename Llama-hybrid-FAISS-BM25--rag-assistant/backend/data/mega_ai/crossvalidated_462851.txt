Many statistical methods assume independence of observations, because the probability of independent events happening simultaneously can be easily calculated as a product of their individual probabilities: $P(A \cap B) = P(A) \cdot P(B)$ . This is extensively applied e.g. in maximum likelihood estimation of parameters. However, if your events are not independent, the above formula is not valid anymore. It's a question of definition what constitutes a time series, but I think everyone agrees that time series include some memory effect. One can say that in time series, current observed value of a variable depends on the observed values (as opposed to modelled values!) at some previous time(s). To take the above example of daily temperature: The temperature today depends in part on the season, which depends on the relative position of the Earth towards the Sun. Thus, you can model daily temperature through the Earth-Sun relationship. This relationship is physically a function of time, but that's not the reason why temperature is a time series. If we had the power to adjust the Earths position as we wish (as we do with independent variables in a controlled experiment) we could control the season and, consequently, the temperature---to a certain degree. There is, however, another component to daily temperature: The heat capacity of the ground, the atmosphere, the oceans, etc. The heat that was absorbed yesterday is being emitted today, so yesterday's temperature by itself influences todays temperature. That's what makes daily temperature a time series. For a counterexample, consider Moon's brightness. It oscillates monthly with Moon phases, but it is not a time series. Even if, due to some extraordinary event, tonight's brightness drastically changes (e.g. due to a Moon eclipse), this will have no effect whatsoever on the brightness tomorrow night! The Moon will be exactly as bright as if it would be without the tonight's eclipse. You may argue that---barring extraordinary events---knowing yesternight's Moon brightness still allows you to quite precisely predict its brightness tonight. But, time is here just a correlate. It is conceptually the same as saying that knowing the force a spiral spring exerts at an elongation $x$ allows you to quite precisely predict the force exerted at the elongation $x + \Delta x$ . If the spring oscillates, the force will vary with time, but it will not vary because of time. Deciding whether a data set constitutes a time series can be tricky and require substantial domain knowledge. Asking yourself whether some magical manipulation of the outcome at one time point would affect it at some later time is, in my opinion, a useful approach.
