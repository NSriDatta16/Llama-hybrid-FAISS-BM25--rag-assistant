You wrote my response variable, 'disease_severity,' is non-linear. A variable cannot be linear or non-linear. That is a characteristic of relationships between variables. The Spearman method seems right, but the disease severity was the average of 10 plants, so I am not certain it's actually ranked data. Spearman does not require ranked data. It ranks whatever data you give it. The internet suggests that Pearson is only suitable for normally distributed data. The internet is wrong a lot. Pearson does not require normally distributed variables. What I would do is make scatter plots and then base my choice on those, combined with what my exact goals were and which correlation better met those goals. E.g. If there are outliers, do you want them to be de-emphasized? Then Spearman. But if they are very important, Pearson might be better.
