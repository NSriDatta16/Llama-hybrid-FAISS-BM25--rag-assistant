If you're really going to take a whack at language design and implementation, you might want to add the following to your bookshelf: Programming Language Pragmatics, Scott et al. Design Concepts in Programming Languages, Turbak et al. Modern Compiler Design, Grune et al. (I sacrilegiously prefer this to "The Dragon Book" by Aho et al.) Gentler introductions such as: Crenshaw's tutorial (as suggested by @'Jonas Gorauskas' here) The Definitive ANTLR Reference by Parr Martin Fowler's recent work on DSLs You should also consider your implementation language. This is one of those areas where different languages vastly differ in what they facilitate. You should consider languages such as LISP, F# / OCaml, and Gilad Bracha's new language Newspeak.
