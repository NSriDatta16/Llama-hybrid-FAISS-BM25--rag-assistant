Yes, this is fine. This is called the $G$ -test. It compares if $311/2000000$ and $420/2200000$ are statistically different. It is an alternative to tests like the proportion $z$ -test, Fisher's exact test, and the chi-squared test. ANOVA asks if multiple normal distributions have different means by doing a linear regression; the $G$ -test asks if multiple Binomial distributions have different means by doing a logistic regression. Both compare the fit of the model considering the categorical predictor to a model that only considers the overall mean. In both tests, if the fit of the model with the categorical predictor is much better, we consider the means to be significantly different. There are R packages that do the $G$ -test for you. I find it instructive to do it yourself (at least constructing the logistic regression models yourself). library(lmtest) x
