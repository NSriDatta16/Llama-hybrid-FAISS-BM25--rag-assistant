Bayes theory always made sense to me, but Bayesian analysis was always very confusing. Things really started to click when I read this blog post about the 8 Schools example: http://andrewgelman.com/2014/01/21/everything-need-know-bayesian-statistics-learned-eight-schools/ I actually think the example could be more meaningful with a better example, the metric described in the 8 Schools is some abstract "coaching" result.
