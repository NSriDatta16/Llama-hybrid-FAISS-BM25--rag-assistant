Can Tobit model handle a clustered data with many zeros in a continues outcome?

I have a longitudinal data, with different follow-up number for individuals. I have considered measurements for each individual as a curve which I already smoothed them, then calculated the area under curve and divided by the interval length to find the average of my outcome which is functional ability over a year. My aim is to see if the area is different among individuals with and without disease (my exposure). I do not want to remove the zeros. I tried the model below, but it is not approprite. f = lmer(Area ~ statusDisease+age+gender+education+(1 | sibling id), data = dat, REML = FALSE) Then I am advised to do Tobit model? but is it appropriate in my case? and how to death with the dependency? like the random factor in lmer(). Which model in appropriate in this case? Any help is appreciated.
