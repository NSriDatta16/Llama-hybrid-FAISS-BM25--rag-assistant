drag/drop a *part* of a row?

I'm looking for suggestions on how to implement a UI feature. I'm working on a scheduling app for a small music competition in my town. There are time slots, and students performing. We assign a kid a time, but something always comes up and kids have to be rearranged. So let's say the schedule is set up as a table something along the lines of 11:00 joe smith 11:20 sally jones 11:40 john doe All good until joe smith learns he has a soccer practice and can't make it at 11:00. I'd love to be able to drag joe's name into a different position without moving the time itself ("joe smith" moves, 11:00 does not move). Does that make sense? Has anyone faced this issue before? I will need to write the updated data (including the time) back to a database, so the time somehow has to be bound to the student, not just some visual thing. I'm more comfortable with jQuery than some of the other javascript/ajax frameworks, so that's the environment I hope to work in. Thanks for any pointers. Steve
