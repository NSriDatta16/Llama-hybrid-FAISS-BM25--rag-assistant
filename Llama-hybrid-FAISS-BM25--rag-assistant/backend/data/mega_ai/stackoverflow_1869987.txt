ASP.NET Response.BinaryWrite file download being block with SSL

I have a page that generates a dynamic file for download, and sends it to the client using Response.BinaryWrite. Everything seems to work fine, except when we moved it to a test server with SSL. The download happens in a new window, and what I'm seeing (in IE7/8 but not chrome or FF) is the tab opens, and closes, but no File Dialogue is shown. Here's the complete header write: Response.Clear() Response.Buffer = True Response.ContentType = "application/octet-stream" Response.AddHeader("Content-Length", abytFileData.Length.ToString) Response.AddHeader("cache-control", "private") Response.AddHeader("Expires", "0") Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "cache") Response.AddHeader("content-disposition", "attachment; filename=""" & pMsg!pstrFileName & """") Response.AddHeader("Accept-Ranges", "none") Response.BinaryWrite(abytFileData) Response.Flush() Response.End() I thought for sure that my problem was what was mentioned here , But my cache-control heade is correct. Any ideas?
