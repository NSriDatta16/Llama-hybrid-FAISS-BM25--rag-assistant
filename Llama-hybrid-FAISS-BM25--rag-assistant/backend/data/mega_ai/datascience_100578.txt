Do you actually need math for your data science job?

I am a physicist working in a data scientist role. I was told everywhere that my degree is a very good starting point because I know a lot of math and it is crucial for this job. But other than understanding the math behind the models' calculations I don't use any math. Okay sometimes I need to create principal components or carry out SVD but these are Just algorithms that anyone can look up on the internet. So honestly I am a bit worried because I might be doing something wrong. Can you please share your experiences? Important note: May be that I don't use deep learning for my job.
