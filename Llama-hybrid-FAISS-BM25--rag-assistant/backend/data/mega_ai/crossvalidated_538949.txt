The above proposal is statistical overkill. I finally discovered that unconditional score statistic methods can be applied to the difference in two independent binomial proportions AND relative risk AND the odds ratio. Unconditional score statistic methods have been demonstrated to perform well for all of these estimates, e.g. Agresti & Min 2002, Biostatistics 3 , Newcombe 1998 Stat. Med. 17 . Unconditional score statistic methods (and others) can be computed using the PropCIs R package . I found that my logistic regression riskratio intervals were more conservative (wider than) those from the riskscoreci function in PropCIs.
