In general, when Sun (Oracle, whatever) declares a Java method deprecated, it means that they changed their minds about including it, they discourage you from using it, and they may remove it in some future version. Of course it's likely to be a long time before it gets removed as who knows how much existing code there is out there using it, and what's the point of breaking existing programs just because the inventors of Java think they now have a better idea about how to do something? Presumably they had a good reason for deprecating something, so you should investigate WHY they say that some newer function is better. In the case of deprecated Date methods, usually this means that they suggest you now use the Calendar or SimpleDateFormat classes. In your case, probably the latter.
