Accuracy in neural network for regression

I want to measure the accuracy in neural network that performs regression. I have two outputs. Is the root-mean-square deviation ( RMS wiki ) the right way to go? From wikipedia RMSD is a good measure of accuracy[...] How do I use it? I want to show how the accuracy is changing over epochs. In classification measuring accuracy is simple. $$ accuracy = \frac{TP+FN}{TP+FP+TN+FN} $$
