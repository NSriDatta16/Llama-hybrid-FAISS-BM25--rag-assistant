Are reset password links a bad idea?

We have a password reset web application. The application sends out an confirmation code to an alternative e-mail. My manager believes it is not a good idea to include a link to the page were you have to enter the code. I see his argument. However, the helpdesk has been overwhelmed with users who are confused about the process. I'm assuming this is because many our users browse using only one tab/window and navigate out of our web application to check their e-mail for the confirmation code. My question : How should we approach this issue? I would like to alleviate helpdesk and, in turn, make the process pain free for our users. Any suggestions? Clarification He believes that we are doing the user a disservice by training them to click links from a sender that cannot be verified (in this case, it's an automatic message with a "no-reply" address). This, would in turn, make users more susceptible to phishing attempts which we've had a lot of issues with in our organization.
