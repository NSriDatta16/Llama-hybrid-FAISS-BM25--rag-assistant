Below is a very simple Bayesian process. I think that in order to get to an answer that is closer to what you want, you will need to specify the function that translates the guess into the measure of closeness. The measure I used here is the simple 1 if the guess within a tolerance distance of the true answer and 0 otherwise. Nmin guess - tol, 1, 0) } guess = x - tol & z x + tol) return(abs(response - 1)) else stop("error") }) } N ```
