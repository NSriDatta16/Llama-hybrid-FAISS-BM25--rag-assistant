Finding the Sufficient Statistic from a PMF

Let X be a random variable with the following PMF $ f(x;\theta)=\frac{1}{4}, x=1,2 $ $ f(x;\theta)=\frac{1+\theta}{4}, x=3 $ $ f(x;\theta)=\frac{1-\theta}{4}, x=4 $ and $0\leq\theta\leq1$ Find a sufficient statistic for $\theta$ ATTEMPTED SOLUTION I am familiar with finding the sufficient statistic when given a PDF with X already present. However, X is not here. So, I began by finding the likelihood function with the following method $L(\theta)=\frac{1}{4}*\frac{1}{4}*\frac{1+\theta}{4}*\frac{1-\theta}{4}$ \ $L(\theta)=\frac{1}{256}*(1-\theta^{2})$ From here I am not sure what to do. There is no X present and I and unsure how to introduce one. Any help would be appreciated.
