From past experience, I've never used PHP's internal functions like fsocketopen() for external data posting. The best way to do these actions are using CURL, which gives much more ease and is massively more powerful for developers to leverage. for example, look at these functions http://php.net/curl_setopt and look at the one with URL, POST, POSTDATA, and COOKIESFILES which is for .JAR, which you get then retrieve and that you can use file_get_contents() to send the data using GET.
