As msw pointed out, crawling a site could be either illegal, unethical, irritating to the author, or perfectly fine. Please use your scripting powers responsibly and for Good (tm). Asking permission would certainly be a nice thing to do. Note that the ctrlaltdel-online.com web server seems to return HTTP 403 forbidden to wget with the normal wget User-Agent string. Emulating something Firefox-ish seems to bypass that (although I bet they are just explicitly denying wget, which indicates they most likely forbid this type of access). USERAGENT='Mozilla/5.0 Firefox/3.6.3' for DAYS in $(seq 365) do NEXT=`date -d "${DAYS} days ago" +%Y%m%d` wget -U "${USERAGENT}" "http://www.cad-comic.com/comics/cad/${NEXT}.jpg" done Replace 365 with a larger number to go back more than a year. The wget output might be annoying, so you can pass it -q to make it quiet.
