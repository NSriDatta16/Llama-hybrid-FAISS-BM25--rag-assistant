Functions are evaluated when called. For example function test() { window.foo = 'bar'; } console.log(window.foo); // => undefined test(); console.log(window.foo); // => bar Even though test was created before the first console.log , window.foo is not populated until test is actually called. If your requires* functions are hanging/blocking, then you need to show the code for those (why would you not provide the source for the problematic ones?) Edit : Currently, your site is blanking out on me when you attach the loaded to the . Anyway, a quick fix would be to place the scripts you wants near the bottom of the page, before , because only scripts in will fully block the page while loading. There are some elegant ways to late-load resources, but, to keep it simple .. requiresJQuery(); // jQuery is available at this point The point is that, since the is placed AFTER your main elements, the DOM elements will be available (and potentially loaded) before the browser starts to download your other libraries.
