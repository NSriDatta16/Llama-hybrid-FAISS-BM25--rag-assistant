any alternative to kaggle for data mining & analysis competitions and training?

Are there any alternative to www.kaggle.com to test abilities for data mining? Or how can I find my own projects to test myself on data mining projects? Kaggle is a data mining community that constitute some competitions and I am looking for some alternative web site or community to better my data mining and machine learning abilities. If there aren't any alternative, what are the common ways for the data mining experts to advance their skills and practice more. I want to be a member f such a community you advice or use the ways of practising to advance my ML and data mining skills.
