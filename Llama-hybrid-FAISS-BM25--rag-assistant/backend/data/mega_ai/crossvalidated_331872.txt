There are several related domains: Outlier detection: find unusual points, rather than typical representatives as in clustering. Stratified sampling. Choose a random sample such that the samples correspond to different classes. For larger sets, so that the class distribution matches. Archetypal analysis. Summarize data not by 'average' cluster representatives, but rather by extreme observations that "bound" the clusters. But you'll certainly need to become more explicit about the formal requirements that you have, some vague intuition is not enough. Maybe you still want clustering - kmeans tries to minimize the within-cluster variance, which implies that it maximizes the between cluster sum of squares. So in a good kmeans clustering, the typical squared deviation of two objects not in the same cluster is maximized; the clustering does divide the data into partitions that are "as dissimilar as possible".
