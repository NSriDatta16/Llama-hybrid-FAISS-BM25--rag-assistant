Fluent nHibernate Startup still slow even with persistent configuration optimization

We're trying to reduce the Fluent nHibernate startup overhead. All the articles we've seen on this subject (including this one ) make the following two suggestions: Persist the configuration on the first run and restore that subsequently, instead of re-creating it. Make sure the ISessionFactory is created only once per session of the app. We've done both of these, and the Fluent nHibernate startup time to create the session factory is now around 550ms on a dual-proc 2.8Ghz 64 bit Windows 7 system, with a SQLite backend. There are only four entities at present, with about six properties each on average. This is still way too high. We'd like to reduce this time to 20ms or less (so that even on slow systems it will be less than 100ms). Is there any likelihood of us being able to do this? Any insight into what Fluent nHibernate is doing during startup that takes so long will also help.
