Asynchronous Stream Processing in Python

Let's start with a simple example. A HTTP data stream comes in the following format: MESSAGE_LENGTH, 2 bytes MESSAGE_BODY, REPEAT... Currently, I use urllib2 to retrieve and process streaming data as below: length = response.read(2) while True: data = response.read(length) DO DATA PROCESSING It works, but since all messages are in size of 50-100 bytes, the above method limits buffer size each time it reads so it may hurt performance. Is it possible to use seperate threads for data retrieval and processing?
