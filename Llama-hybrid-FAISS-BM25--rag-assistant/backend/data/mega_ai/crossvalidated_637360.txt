Setosa is being used as your reference level. In a multinomial regression model, one of the outcome levels is used as a reference to compare the other possible outcomes. Think of binary logistic regression where, for example with a mortality variable, you might be trying to find what predicts the odds of dying compared to staying alive, which is the default reference level. In your model, the coefficient for petal width for the versicolor outcome could be interpreted as: "For every unit increase in petal width, the odds of being versicolor compared to setosa are 0.407 (exp[-0.899263]) times lower."
