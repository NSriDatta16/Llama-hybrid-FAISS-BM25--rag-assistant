Core Data and iTunes File Sharing - Move/hide the .sqlite file on app update?

I have an iPad app that uses Core Data for data storage. I would like to enable file sharing in iTunes and I don't really want the users to be able to delete or modify the .sqlite file. Can I move the file to a different, hidden directory? Alternatively, could the file be made read-only? I wouldn't mind users having access to the file as long as it couldn't be changed. I suspect there is a trivial solution that is escaping me at the moment.
