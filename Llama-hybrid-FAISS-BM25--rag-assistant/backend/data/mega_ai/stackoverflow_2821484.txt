Usually the can check the User Agent header of the request, it will include things like YahooSlurp or GoogleBot or SomeOtherTypeOfBot. If you're using .NET, there is a property in Page.Request.Browser.Crawler that should indicate if it's a bot. I'm not sure if/how this is represented in other platforms Be aware though that some crawlers had a tendancy to hide the fact that they are a crawler (I've seen MSN do this recently), and just send a User Agent field that looks like a regular browser, so you'd have to filter those by IP range, but that just becomes a game of whackamole, so you may end up just living with those cases.
