XGBoost tutorial - problem with understanding transformation

I'm following tutorial in xgboost docs: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/latest/model.html I'm stuck on this step: I don't understand how the first term (loss) was transformed, they seem to not be equal (sympy says so too). I'm thinking there may be some magic with constant term involved?
