If you work in natural language processing, you can view the filter size in a CNN as the n-gram size. If you work in computer vision, you can view the filter size in a CNN as the receptive field. See How to work multiple filter region sizes: 2, 3 and 4 in CNN? to get a better intuition. how to fix the size of the filter. The choice of the size of the filter depends on the dataset. I am not aware of any rule of thumb, typically one would start with a size of the filter that has been used in similar works. Some ideas: What are the state-of-the-art methods to determine parameters in CNN, NN, RNN, or any deep learning models . E.g. in {1} we used Gaussian Processes to automatically choose the filter height. References: {1} Franck Dernoncourt, Ji Young Lee.
