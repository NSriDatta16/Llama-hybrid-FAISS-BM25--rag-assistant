In my experience with mac development, the only times I've needed to use C was when I fell back to the older Carbon apis. Cocoa is all Objective C and quite different from old school c. As far as I know, all of the iPhone APIs use objective c and you would only ever need to use gangster style c if you're using a library already written with in it.
