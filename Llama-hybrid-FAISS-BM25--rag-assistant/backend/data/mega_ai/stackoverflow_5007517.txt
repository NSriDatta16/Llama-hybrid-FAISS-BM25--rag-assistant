It looks to me like you only have one element named Module -- so .Value is simply returning you the InnerText of that entire element. Were you intending this instead? coveragePriv.Element("Module").Elements(); This would return all the child elements of the Module element, which seems to be what your'e after. Update: is a child of but you appear to want to handle it similarly to in that you want to write out each child element. Thus, one brute-force approach would be to add another loop for : foreach (var con in cons) { if (con.Name == "NamespaceTable") { foreach (var nsElement in con.Elements()) { var nsId = nsElement.Value; Console.WriteLine(nsId); } } else { var id = con.Value; Console.WriteLine(id); } } Alternatively, perhaps you'd rather just denormalize them altogether via .Descendents() : var cons = coveragePriv.Element("Module").Descendents(); foreach (var con in cons) { var id = con.Value; Console.WriteLine(id); }
