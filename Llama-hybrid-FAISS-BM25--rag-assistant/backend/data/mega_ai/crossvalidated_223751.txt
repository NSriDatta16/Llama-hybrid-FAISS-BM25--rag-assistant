You can quantify the difference between probability distributions using the Earth Mover's distance (EMD) . As for testing... assuming that you want to do classical null hypothesis significance testing, you could of course use the EMD as your test statistic. To get its distribution under the null hypothesis, you could simulate your experiments actually measuring the same thing, run your two separate MCMCs, and record the resulting EMD. Do this many times, and you have your EMD null distribution. Finally, compare your "true" EMD to this one.
