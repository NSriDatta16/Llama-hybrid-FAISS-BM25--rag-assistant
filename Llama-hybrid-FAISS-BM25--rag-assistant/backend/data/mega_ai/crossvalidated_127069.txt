20-fold cross validation of a dataset composed of1000 observations?

I have a dataset made up of 1000 observations and I want to split that data and use it for estimation of parameters in a way that maximum of 50 observations form one fold and my estimation process covers the whole data to estimate parameters, but only 50 observations at a time. Should I use 20-fold or I can adopt any other better method? Please note that I am new to machine learning and data mining. Please guide, thank you.
