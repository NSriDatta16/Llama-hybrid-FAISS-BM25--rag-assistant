This question has been addressed in the comments. I reply here to give an old questions an answer. The two sentences within each pair are more alike than two randomly chosen sentences with different genders of the subject; this makes their scores paired. - Glen_b Then if the choice is between a paired or unpaired t-test, you should choose the paired t-test . As Phil also notes in the comments, you should check the assumptions of the test are fulfilled by your data . A nice reference on the paired t-test is here which lists the assumptions, and some worked examples on the same site here . I note the machine-learning tag on this question, and the application for detecting bias in an ML model. I would like to leave the following references here for anyone who has stumbled across this question. Kiritchenko, Svetlana & Mohammad, Saif. (2018). Examining Gender and Race Bias in Two Hundred Sentiment Analysis Systems . 43-53. 10.18653/v1/S18-2005. ( pdf ) Abstract below: Automatic machine learning systems can inadvertently accentuate and perpetuate inappropriate human biases. Past work on examining inappropriate biases has largely focused on just individual systems. Further, there is no benchmark dataset for examining inappropriate biases in systems. Here for the first time, we present the Equity Evaluation Corpus (EEC), which consists of 8,640 English sentences carefully chosen to tease out biases towards certain races and genders. We use the dataset to examine 219 automatic sentiment analysis systems that took part in a recent shared task, SemEval-2018 Task 1 ‘Affect in Tweets’. We find that several of the systems show statistically significant bias; that is, they consistently provide slightly higher sentiment intensity predictions for one race or one gender. We make the EEC freely available In this paper they do very similar to what is described in the question above (and they use the paired t-test). If you don't want to read the original paper, there is a write-up of it on Medium here .
