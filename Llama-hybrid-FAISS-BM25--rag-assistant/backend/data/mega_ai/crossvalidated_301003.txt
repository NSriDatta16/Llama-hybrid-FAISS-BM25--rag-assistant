Answered in comments, copied below: I don't think much mathematical knowledge is needed to appreciate the issues. After all, if you walk three miles to one location and one mile to another location, it likely makes sense to you that the average distance you walked is two miles. Why would such a statement be invalid? If you agree that makes sense, then what we ought to investigate next is why averaging non-Euclidean distances might be any less valid. Conceivably, for some purposes and some distances, it might not be valid--but it's hard to think of any such situation. â€“ whuber
