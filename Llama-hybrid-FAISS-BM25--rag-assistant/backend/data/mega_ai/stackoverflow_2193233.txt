A file system is essetially a database for files. The main thing you'll need is a lookup table for storing byte offsets and file lengths. The file names could also be stored in the table or they could be stored in the first few bytes at each offset. It will be far easier on you if you make your file system a fixed size. This would be similar to how the FAT file system works. You can also have a look at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_storage_structures since at the lowest levels file systems and databases are very similar.
