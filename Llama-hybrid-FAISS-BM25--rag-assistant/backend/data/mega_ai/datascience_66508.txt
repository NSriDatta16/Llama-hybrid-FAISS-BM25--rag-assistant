Have a look at this competition organized by the European Spatial Agency (ESA). https://kelvins.esa.int/collision-avoidance-challenge/scoring/ Here they use a composed loss function. A binary classification whether two spatial are at risk of colliding or not. And in case that they collide a regression saying what is estimated risk between them. This is done by constructing a loss function combining the Mean Squared Error (MSE) and the F_β score with β=2. You could consider your problem similar. You will want to classify whether your offer gets accepted or not, and in case of acceptance the money in return that you will receive. In the part of the discussion of the challenge, you will find some notes on how to do it. Also, I believe that they will publish a paper in the next weeks.
