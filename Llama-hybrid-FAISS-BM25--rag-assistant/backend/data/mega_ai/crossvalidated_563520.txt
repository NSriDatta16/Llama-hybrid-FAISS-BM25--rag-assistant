prepare data for autoencoder

I have for example 500 engines and for each engine I have 100 features and each feature is measured 1000 times. It means the data table is: 500,000 rows and 100 columns. (for each engine I have only a number, no more metadata) I want to use autoencoder to detect anomaly. I do not know how to prepare my data for the autoencoder. Should I rearrange the table and get a table with this dimension (500 * 100,000) or should I behave it as a table like (500,000 *100). Or just get a three dimension array which is (500,1000,100). Can someone help me and give me some hint how to behave my data. Many thanks in advance!
