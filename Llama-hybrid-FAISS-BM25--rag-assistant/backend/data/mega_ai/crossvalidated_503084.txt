When you have a 2 factor category independent variable and a continuous dependent variable then look at performing a t-test. In this case you have a categorical independent variable and count data for the dependent variable, i.e. number of wins and the number of losses; thus the $\chi^2$ test is the better test. If you have a continuous independent variable such as "X_mod_var" and a binary dependent output (Yes/No) as in your example, then a logistic regression can model the probability function. Here is a good introduction text for statistical tests and R: http://rcompanion.org/handbook/
