I think the word 'introductory' should be banned in statistics. Not many without a strong background in statistics will find topics such as vector autoregressive models or ARDL to be introductory nor the Hamilton work and many others mentioned. There is a a huge gap between academic and practitioner audiences in this topic I feel. Having looked hard as a practitioner for time series books over the last 7 year, I have found few that are introductory and either fewer aimed at practitioners as compared to academics. The Chadwick book already mentioned was useful (practical). I found Anders Milhoj to be useful for exponential smoothing, but he uses SAS. Many issues that practitioners worry about, such as cleaning and finding data are simply not addressed in many works on time series nor the use of expert judgement to correct mistakes. Concepts such as using multiple models to triangulate results (found to correct error) never show up in the academic time series books I have encountered. I have found on line links better than books for this, although I plan to read many of the works suggested.
