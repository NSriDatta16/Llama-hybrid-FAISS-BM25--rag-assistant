Rails response.format fallback?

A rails app has some files end with .mobile.erb, which is for iPhone. There is before_filter which set request.format = :mobile by check the request.user_agent. My question is below: If some_action.mobile.erb doesn't exist. How to fallback to some_action.html.erb rather than an error page.
