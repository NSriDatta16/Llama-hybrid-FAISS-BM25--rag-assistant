Interesting investigation about details that I never paid attention to. It's not a bug, because it is documented this way in the Stata documentation. I never looked at the details and references for boundary problems in kernel regression, but it looks like Stata uses a different trade-off between bias and variance at the boundary than R or statsmodels. My guess is that R and statsmodels oversmooth compared to Stata if there are fluctuations or trends close to the boundaries. With constant bandwidth the effective window size would always shrink when going to the boundary, i.e. the Stata behavior results. So maybe it's a partial misnomer in Stata if there is a strict definition of LOWESS, but Stata's behavior still looks common for windowed convolution filter or similar local polynomial kernel regression with fixed bandwidth. In this case fixed bandwidth is in terms of neighbors and not in terms of metric distance, where Stata does not trade off neighbors from one side to the other side by extending the one-sided window. For references I would look at Fan and Gijbels and related literature on boundary problems of kernel or local polynomial regression.
