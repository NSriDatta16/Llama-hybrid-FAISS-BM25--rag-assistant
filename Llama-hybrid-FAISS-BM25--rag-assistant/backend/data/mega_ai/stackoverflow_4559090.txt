Magento Custom Product Options

If you take a look at the following product page on a site that I want to "take inspiration from". http://www.pauls-hair-world.co.uk/best-sellers/beauty-works-celebrity-choice-100-remy-hair-extensions As you can see, one of the product options is to choose the colour of the product, there is an option for you to click 'Click here for colour chart' and you are presented with lots of pictures showing the colours of the prduct that are available. I know how to add the custom option of a drop-down menu with options that I choose, but how do I get it to show those images also. (Also, when you click the imagesit changes the option in the drop-down menu. Any help is very much appreciated, even a link to a great resource will do. If I figure it out in the mean time I will post the answer here. (Not hopeful though). Thanks in advance!
