No. Deciding if data is separable is a feasibility problem of the SVM without slackness. And it only finds a feasible plane but not an optimal one. And logistic regression is an unconstrained optimisation problem. If there is no regularization, its solution will not converge ($|\beta|\rightarrow\infty$) (Source: http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/cs769/lr.pdf )
