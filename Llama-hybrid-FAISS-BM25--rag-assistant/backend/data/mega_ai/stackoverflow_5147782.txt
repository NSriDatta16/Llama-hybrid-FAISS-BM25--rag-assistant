How do I know if the user made changes so I can save state when needed?

My app is kind of an editor where the user can drag and drop objects over a canvas, and change N properties on the objects. How can I know if the user has made changes on the app in order to prompt him whether he wants to save these changes or not? One way is to create a IsDirty property but this means I would have to add a line of code in many places, maybe another way could be create a virtual save, and then compare the real saved file with the virtual saved file; is there another way?
