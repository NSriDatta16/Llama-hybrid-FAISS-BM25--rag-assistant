Back in the dark ages of console programs, people used to output text by writing directly to the screen buffer. The console screen buffer is organized as a continuous array of pairs of bytes, describing the displayed character and its attributes (color, background color, and eventually blinking). In your case, the screen buffer seems to be at 0xb800000 ( Ad ). Pos translates a screen position (y,x) to a memory offset in the screen buffer, assuming a screen width of 80. Write changes the displayed character at the specified position, while WriteA changes the character's color.
