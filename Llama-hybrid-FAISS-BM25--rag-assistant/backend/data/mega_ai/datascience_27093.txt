You need to use linear regressor instead of logistic regressor. The difference between the two is, the latter is used to "classify" things whereas the former provides a continuous output as you require. In order to get ..."one continuous variable"... you need to use for example KerasRegressor if you are using Keras. Similar functions exist in other systems like scikit-learn, caffe etc. Here is a great example (written in Keras), that describes how to predict house prices (a continuous value) using Keras machine learning library. Here is it for scikit-learn , and here is a tutorial on linear regression using caffe . Check this StackOverflow post for in-depth analysis of the difference between linear and logistic regression.
