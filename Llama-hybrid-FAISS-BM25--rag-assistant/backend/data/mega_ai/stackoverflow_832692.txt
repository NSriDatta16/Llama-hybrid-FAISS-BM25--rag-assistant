How can I check whether Google Maps is fully loaded?

Iâ€™m embedding Google Maps into my web site. Once Google Maps is loaded, I need to kick off a few JavaScript processes. Is there a way to auto-detect when Google Maps has fully loaded, including tile downloads and all? A tilesloaded() method exists that is supposed to accomplish exactly this task but it does not work .
