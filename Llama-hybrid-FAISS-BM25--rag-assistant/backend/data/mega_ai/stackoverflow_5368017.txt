The main practical utility of just creating a generic object would be to leverage its locking capabilities (e.g., wait() and notify() ). But this may be what you are referring to by "denial of service", since use of these methods can help manage threads and potentially help in a defense of DoS. (but that is really app specific, and not inherent to the purpose of these methods within Object) The reason(s) why Object is not abstract is already discussed at length here: Why java.lang.Object is not abstract?
