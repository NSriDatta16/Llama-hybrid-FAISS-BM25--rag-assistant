If there is some way for you to visualize your data, that is the best possible scenario however not all data can be visualized in the same way, so you may need to find your own way to project the data that can help you understand your data better. However, in general, I usually take a small sample of the data, convert it into ARFF and try different clustering algorithms from WEKA. Then, I just see which algorithm gives me better confusion matrix. It gives me a hint as to how well the classes are separated and allows me to investigate why that particular algorithm does better for this data. I also change the number of clusters (i.e i don't just use k = 2, I use k = 3, 4 etc.). It gives me an idea whether there is fragmentation in the data or whether one class is more fragmented than the other. If you mix training and testing points together for clustering, you can also measure which clusters are represented by your training points. Some clusters may be over-represented and some may be under-represented, both can cause issues which learning a classifier. Always check your training accuracy. If your training accuracy is not looking good, then mis-classified training points are also a big hint.
