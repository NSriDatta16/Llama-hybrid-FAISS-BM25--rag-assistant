IOS: fill a NSArray with UIImageView

In my project I created 30 small UIImageView where inside I put a different background. This is my group of UIImageView without background and this is the group of UIImageView with different background: I put these group of UImageView inside a UITableViewCell and I use them to define a timeline, but it's not important. I declared in .h these UIImageView but now I must insert theme in an NSArray, or NSMutableArray? Because in my code (depending on the case) I must set different background for each UIImageView. How can I organize them in my code?
