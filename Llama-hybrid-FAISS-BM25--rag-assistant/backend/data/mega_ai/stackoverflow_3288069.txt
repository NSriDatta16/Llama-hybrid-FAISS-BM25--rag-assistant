A few questions regarding $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] and using RegEx to extract information from the results

Okay, take this user agent for example: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US; rv:1.9.2.6) Gecko/20100625 Curious as to what all of it means. I can figure out a few things, obviously, such as Mozilla == Firefox, and Windows NT 5.1 == Windows XP. But what is the rv:1.9.2.6, and What is Gecko? and U? And also, I'm working on setting up a script that puts various pieces of it into separate variables, such as the Mozilla, and the Windows NT 5.1, but how would I go about using RegEx to extract that, if most (if not all) of the other sections in the User Agent would by dynamic based on each user?
