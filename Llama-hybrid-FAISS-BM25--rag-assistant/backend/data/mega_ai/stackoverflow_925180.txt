how to reference XSD Schema location while parsing XML Doc via SAX Xerces?

how to reference XSD Schema location while parsing XML via SAX Xerces? > Must I reference this element really within the XML Doc??? I hope, not... -- > I also set it as follows in Java code, which is not elegant, while schema location is fixed(not appropriate for production) SaxParser.setProperty( " http://java.sun.com/xml/jaxp/properties/schemaSource ", "F:...\myschema_v2.5.xsd" );
