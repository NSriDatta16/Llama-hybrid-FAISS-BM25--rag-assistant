One thing wrong is that in the line l[i] / l[j] you dont assign the result of this to anything or display it in any way. Your program DOES the operation but doesn't save it anywhere. So when you return l at the end of your function you will just get the exact same thing you sent in. On a side note Heres something you might want to look at. It doesn't do exactly what you want but you should be able to change it to what you need. From the tutorial http://docs.python.org/tutorial/stdlib.html#quality-control def average(values): """Computes the arithmetic mean of a list of numbers. >>> print average([20, 30, 70]) 40.0 """ return sum(values, 0.0) / len(values)
