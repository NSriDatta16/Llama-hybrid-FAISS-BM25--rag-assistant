Magento: Loading attributes per store

I have a custom module that exports data to our fulfillment system when the user checks out. Before export I need to run the address through a verification service. Since we are charged for this service, I need to configure the user name and password for the service per store. I have added the attributes I need, however I cannot figure out how to load them per store. How can I tell my resource model to load based off the store?
