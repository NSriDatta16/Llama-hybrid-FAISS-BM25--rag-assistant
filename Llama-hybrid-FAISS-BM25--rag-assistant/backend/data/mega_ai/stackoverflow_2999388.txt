There are varying opinions on how pure you should be, but to me you shouldn't give anyone access to any fields. Use getters and setters. If you need to segregate who can read and who can write, you can throw interfaces into the mix. Define an interface with just the getters and you can restrict your viewer to read only. Robert Harvey added a comment that points to other options, like using a different access modifier for class or package level access.
