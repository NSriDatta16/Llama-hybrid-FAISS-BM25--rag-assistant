Django - Allow duplicate usernames

I'm working on a project in django which calls for having separate groups of users in their own username namespace. So for example, I might have multiple "organizations", and username should only have to be unique within that organization. I know I can do this by using another model that contains a username/organization id, but that still leaves this useless (and required) field on the defualt django auth User that I would have to populate with something. I've already written by own auth backend that authenticates a user against LDAP. However, as I mentioned before, I am still stuck with the problem of how to populate / ignore the username field on the default django user. Is there a way to drop the uniqueness constraint for the username for Django auth users?
