Under a application server it's likely that the server will provide a JNDI context for you. In a standalone application you must provide a JNDI Context your self. For that you can use a javax.naming.InitialContext . There is a nice example using Apache's DBCP here: http://commons.apache.org/dbcp/guide/jndi-howto.html . Of course, will you have to fix the Datasource objects to the implementation you are using. This will be enough (not very elegant, though) for simple JNDI usage.
