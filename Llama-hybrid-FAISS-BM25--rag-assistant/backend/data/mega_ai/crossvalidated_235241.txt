It is possible to apply correspondence analysis to a 2x2 contigency table?

I was wondering if it is possible to apply correspondence analysis to a 2x2 contingency table. Since that correspondence analysis is a method for dimensionality reduction, I think it is necessary to have a contingency table with many rows and columns. Is there a minimum value of the number of rows and columns needed to apply correspondence analysis? Thanks in advance.
