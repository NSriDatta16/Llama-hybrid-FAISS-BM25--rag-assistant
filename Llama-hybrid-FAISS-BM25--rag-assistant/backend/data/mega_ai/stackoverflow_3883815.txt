There's nothing special about ₹ (U+20B9 New Rupee symbol), except that, being so new, there is almost zero font support for it. If you've got a database connection that supports Unicode, you can store it just as easily as any other character: INSERT INTO Currency (name, symbol) VALUES ('INR', '₹'); (You would want to use NVARCHAR for storage and N'₹' in SQL Server.) If you haven't got a Unicode-safe connection (for example you're using some crap tool like the Windows console) you would have to work around that using eg. VALUES ('INR', CHAR(226, 130, 185)) for a UTF-8-collated column in MySQL, or NCHAR(8377) for a Unicode column in SQL Server.
