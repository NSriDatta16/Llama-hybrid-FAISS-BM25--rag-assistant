This is a very popular approach to forecasting. Actually, most deep neural network approaches to forecasting work like this. But this method is also successfully used with other models like random forest or gradient boosting machines . Those data-driven methods are often quite successful, provided there is sufficient data available. The great disadvantage relative to model-driven methods like ARIMA is that they are rather black boxes, which can do forecasting but don't really give you more information about the time series itself, i.e. there is no real model with interpretable parameters.
