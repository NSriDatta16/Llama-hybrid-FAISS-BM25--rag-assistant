Using the EstimatedSize value inside a program uninstall key to correctly display the program size in the Add/Remove Programs list

I've attempted to use the EstimatedSize value during creation of an uninstaller registry key for an app I've developed, unfortunately the value I specify does not appear in the Add/Remove Program list next to my program's entry. I've tried to find the proper procedure for using this value but to no avail. Anyone have any experience on this issue? Your help would be appreciated. Divo got me on the right track so I figured I'd post step-by-step instructions on how to correctly display the EstimatedSize value. Create the registry key with all relevant properties, including EstimatedSize. This value will be replicated in the ARPCache key in the registry Find the registry key inside the ARPCache folder, delete the SlowInfoCache binary value, and set the Changed value to 1. Next time the Add/Remove Programs list is opened you will see the value you specified in the EstimatedSize entry, not the arbitrary Windows generated one.
