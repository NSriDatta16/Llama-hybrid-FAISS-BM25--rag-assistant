There are a couple options. Certainly you could rank them; given your research question, I would combine the two "No" responses but not the others. Combining categories throws away information. You could then do ordinal logistic regression with "amount of drinking" as the DV and "entrepreneur" as an IV (with other IVs possibly added). Another alternative is to take advantage of the precision of your categories and turn it into a "days drinking per month": No, I have never drunk alcohol = 0 No, I no longer drink = 0 Yes, but only rarely = 1 Yes, I drink alcohol 2 or 3 days per month = 2.5 Yes, I drink alcohol 1 or 2 days per week = 6 Yes, I drink alcohol 3 or 4 days per week = 15 Yes, I drink alcohol 5 or 6 days per week = 25 Yes, I drink alcohol everyday = 30 or something similar. Then you could do a t-test, or perhaps a count regression. Is this valid? Well, I think it's at least reasonable. You could do sensitivity analysis with different conversion factors. Lots of variables are not exactly ordinal and not exactly interval either.
