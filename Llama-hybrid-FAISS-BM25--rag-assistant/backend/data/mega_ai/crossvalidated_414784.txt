How can I normalize Bayesian Network query result?

While taking a Bayesian network tutorial on YouTube, I was watching a video explaining the Bayesian Network probability inference. Somehow, at the end of the tutorial, the lecturer did not explain how to get the number, 0.284 in the circle in Black. I'd appreciate if somebody can explain it. The mentioned YouTube video can be found HERE .
