You can also filter by thresholding at some multiple of the standard deviation. This would filter out results that were much farther than expected from the mean (average). Standard deviation is simply sqrt(sum(your_values - average_value) / number_of_values). edit: You can also look at weighting the value by it's deviation from the mean. So values that are very large can be weighted as 1 / exp(deviation) and therefore contribute much less the farther from the mean they are.
