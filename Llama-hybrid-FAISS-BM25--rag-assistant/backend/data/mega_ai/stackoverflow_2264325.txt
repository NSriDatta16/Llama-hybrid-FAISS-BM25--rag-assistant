I'm a fan of Component One, mainly based on personal taste. ActiProSoftware have some good controls, but I find that they don't expose enough properties to make it easy to style and customize, though you can get around this with implicit styles. Xceed have my favourite Grid control, lots of cool features and easy to work with. I don't particularly like Telerik and I've never tried SyncFusion. I would love to try Infragistics as that is one that I haven't tried, but have been really impressed with the demos. Does anyone have any comments on the architecture of Infragistics? Like Reed said, they all have their advantages and disadvantages, but from my experiences I would recommend Component One. HTH
