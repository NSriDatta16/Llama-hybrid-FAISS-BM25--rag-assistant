Kernel methods - How do the infinite dimensions arise?

I'm going through the Kernel chapter from Kevin Murphy's Machine Learning book and he talks about the importance of positive definite or Mercer kernels: My question comes from the last sentence: What makes φ depend on the eigen functions of κ, and how does that make $D$ be a potentially infinite dimensional space? I think I'm missing something critical for the understanding of kernels and SVMs.
