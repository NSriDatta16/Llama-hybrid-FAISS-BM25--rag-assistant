Although I have not read the paper, permuting the features is not a weird idea. In the case of classifying sets of objects where the order does not matter, this is actually desirable. For example, we want to classify a sports team like a tennis duo, there is no clear order between the two although you would want exactly the same output regardless of which player you put in first. Shuffling the inputs is a bit of a hacky way of solving this however, but you can still learn non-linear relations between the objects, depending on the model. However, building a model that knows that the features are permutation equivariant or invariant is a better way of solving this issue. Here are two papers that are about this topic using neural networks: https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.04530 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1703.06114.pdf
