Best factor extraction methods in factor analysis

SPSS offers several methods of factor extraction: Principal components (which isn't factor analysis at all) Unweighted least squares Generalized least squares Maximum Likelihood Principal Axis Alpha factoring Image factoring Ignoring the first method, which isn't factor analysis (but principal component analysis, PCA), which of these methods is "the best"? What are the relative advantages of the different methods? And basically, how would I choose which one to use? Additional question: should one obtain similar results from all 6 methods?
