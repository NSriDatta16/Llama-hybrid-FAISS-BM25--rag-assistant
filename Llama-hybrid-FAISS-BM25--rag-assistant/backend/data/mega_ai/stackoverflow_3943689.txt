The only thing I can think of would be to subscribe to a service which offers an IP to net speed lookup. These services work by building a database of IP addresses and cataloging their registered intended use. They're not always accurate, but they do provide a starting point. Look up the user's IP address against one of these and see what it returns. Ip2Location.com provides such a database, beginning with their DB13 product. Of course, if your goal is a mobile version of the site, user agent sniffing is a better solution.
