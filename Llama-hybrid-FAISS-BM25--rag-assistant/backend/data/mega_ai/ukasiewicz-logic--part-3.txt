 This is expressed by the general, linear, and standard completeness theorems: The following conditions are equivalent: A {\displaystyle A} is provable in propositional infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic A {\displaystyle A} is valid in all MV-algebras (general completeness) A {\displaystyle A} is valid in all linearly ordered MV-algebras (linear completeness) A {\displaystyle A} is valid in the standard MV-algebra (standard completeness). Here valid means necessarily evaluates to 1. Font, Rodriguez and Torrens introduced in 1984 the Wajsberg algebra as an alternative model for the infinite-valued Łukasiewicz logic. A 1940s attempt by Grigore Moisil to provide algebraic semantics for the n-valued Łukasiewicz logic by means of his Łukasiewicz–Moisil (LM) algebra (which Moisil called Łukasiewicz algebras) turned out to be an incorrect model for n ≥ 5. This issue was made public by Alan Rose in 1956. C. C. Chang's MV-algebra, which is a model for the ℵ0-valued (infinitely-many-valued) Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic, was published in 1958. For the axiomatically more complicated (finite) n-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were published in 1977 by Revaz Grigolia and called MVn-algebras. MVn-algebras are a subclass of LMn-algebras, and the inclusion is strict for n ≥ 5. In 1982 Roberto Cignoli published some additional constraints that added to LMn-algebras produce proper models for n-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery proper Łukasiewicz algebras. Complexity Łukasiewicz logics are co-NP complete. Modal Logic Łukasiewicz logics can be seen as modal logics, a type of logic that addresses possibility, using the defined operators, ◊ A = d e f ¬ A → A ◻ A = d e f ¬ ◊ ¬ A {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Diamond A&=_{def}\neg A\rightarrow A\\\Box A&=_{def}\neg \Diamond \neg A\\\end{aligned}}} A third doubtful operator has been proposed, ⊙ A = d e f A ↔ ¬ A {\displaystyle \odot A=_{def}A\leftrightarrow \neg A} . From these we can prove the following theorems, which are common axioms in many modal logics: A → ◊ A ◻ A → A A → ( A → ◻ A ) ◻ ( A → B ) → ( ◻ A → ◻ B ) ◻ ( A → B ) → ( ◊ A → ◊ B ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}A&\rightarrow \Diamond A\\\Box A&\rightarrow A\\A&\rightarrow (A\rightarrow \Box A)\\\Box (A\rightarrow B)&\rightarrow (\Box A\rightarrow \Box B)\\\Box (A\rightarrow B)&\rightarrow (\Diamond A\rightarrow \Diamond B)\\\end{aligned}}} We can also prove distribution theorems on the strong connectives: ◻ ( A ⊗ B ) ↔ ◻ A ⊗ ◻ B ◊ ( A ⊕ B ) ↔ ◊ A ⊕ ◊ B ◊ ( A ⊗ B ) → ◊ A ⊗ ◊ B ◻ A ⊕ ◻ B → ◻ ( A ⊕ B ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Box (A\otimes B)&\leftrightarrow \Box A\otimes \Box B\\\Diamond (A\oplus B)&\leftrightarrow \Diamond A\oplus \Diamond B\\\Diamond (A\otimes B)&\rightarrow \Diamond A\otimes \Diamond B\\\Box A\oplus \Box B&\rightarrow \Box (A\oplus B)\end{aligned}}} However, the following distribution theorems also hold: ◻ A ∨ ◻ B ↔ ◻ ( A ∨ B ) ◻ A ∧ ◻ B ↔ ◻ ( A ∧ B ) ◊ A ∨ ◊ B ↔ ◊ ( A ∨ B ) ◊ A ∧ ◊ B ↔ ◊ ( A ∧ B ) {\displaystyle {\begin{aligned}\Box A\vee \Box B&\leftrightarrow \Box (A\vee B)\\\Box A\wedge \Box B&\leftrightarrow \Box (A\wedge B)\\\Diamond A\vee \Diamond B&\leftrightarrow \Diamond (A\vee B)\\\Diamond A\wedge \Diamond B&\leftrightarrow \Diamond (A\wedge B)\end{aligned}}} In other words, if ◊ A ∧ ◊ ¬ A {\displaystyle \Diamond A\wedge \Diamond \neg A} , then ◊ ( A ∧ ¬ A ) {\displaystyle \Diamond (A\wedge \neg A)} , which is counter-intuitive. However, these controversial theorems have been defended as a modal logic about future contingents by A. N. Prior. Notably, ◊ A ∧ ◊ ¬ A ↔ ⊙ A {\displaystyle \Diamond A\wedge \Diamond \neg A\leftrightarrow \odot A} .
