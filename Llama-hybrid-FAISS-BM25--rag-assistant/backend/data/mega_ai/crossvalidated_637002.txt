Demand forecasting : example 1 Suppose you a retailer. You have to forecast demand for the goods you are selling. Based on the forecast, you order $\hat n$ goods, and the demand turns out to be $n$ . Let $e:=\hat n-n$ . From each good you sell, you make a profit of $r$ . From each good you fail to sell, you incur a cost of $c$ (due to storage costs, partial depreciation or complete depreciation due to perishability). In the ideal case, you would order $n$ goods, so that $e=0$ , and then you would earn $nr$ . In reality, you will likely end up with $e\neq 0$ . If $e>0$ , your loss (relative to the ideal scenario) is $ce$ . If $e , your loss is $r(-e)$ . This is quantile loss. Demand forecasting : example 2 You are a producer. You have some funds available, but you need to borrow some more to finance your production. The demand for your product, $n$ , is uncertain, so you have to predict it. Your prediction is $\hat n$ . Let the prediction error be $e:=\hat n-n$ . If you borrow too much, you will have paid unnecessary interest on the extra amount. With an interest rate $r$ , you end up paying $re$ , and that is your loss. If you borrow too little, you cannot produce as much as demanded, and you forgo a profit of $\pi$ per unit. Thus your loss is $\pi(-e)$ . This is quantile loss.
