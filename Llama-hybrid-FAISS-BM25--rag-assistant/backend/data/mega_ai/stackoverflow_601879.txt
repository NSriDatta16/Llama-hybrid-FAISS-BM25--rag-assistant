I have a little trouble understanding the code/output fragments you have posted. Is the actual error message included? Problems with SSL/TLS are often because of the X.509 certificate infrastructure. There are "Certificate Authorities" (CA) like Verisign, RapidSSL etc. which digitally "sign" the certificates of servers. To check these signatures, you need the so called "root certificate" of the CA who signed the certificate of the server ("issuer") you are connecting to. Usually operating systems come with a fair amount of certificates pre-installed. And often Browsers, the OS and certain libraries all have their own list of certificates. On a Mac you can see them, if you start the program "Keychain Access" and open the "System Roots" keychain. So I suggest you check if the cert is missing from Ubuntu and if so to add it there. (Maybe that is all saved in /etc/ssl/certs/)
