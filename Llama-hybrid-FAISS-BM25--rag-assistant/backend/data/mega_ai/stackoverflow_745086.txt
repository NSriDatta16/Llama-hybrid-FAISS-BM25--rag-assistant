Create page based on xml schema and add data from xml record

Let's say I have a system that stores data for some complex objects in xml. These objects have a weak inheritance relationship: maybe 4 fields common to all of them and then another 20 that are unique to each type of object, say 6 to 8 different types of object. The data that is unique to each object may itself be complex: things like enums, other complex types, and items that are only used conditionally. Each type of object has an xml schema to describe it. This system builds up a record for each object over a series of steps, and so it will be very common to have only a partial record. What goes into each step is not defined: a user may fill in as much as they know and then pass it up the chain for someone more knowledgeable to complete. What I want to do is create an ASP.Net page to show these records. Given a record number (and type) load the schema for that type into a form, and then populate the form from the record itself. I don't think the record by itself will be enough to create the page, because the record may not yet list each field I want to include on the form and won't implicitly include data for types like enums. What would be an elegant way to accomplish this? I'm sure I'm missing something obvious about a simple way to do this, but Xslt probably won't cut it. This is a follow up to this question , and at the moment is purely hypothetical. Based on responses here I may go a different way completely.
