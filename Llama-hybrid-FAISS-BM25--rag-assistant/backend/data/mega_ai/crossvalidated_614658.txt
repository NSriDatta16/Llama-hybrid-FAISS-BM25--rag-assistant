What you describe is very similar to a MMRM , which would additionally account for the correlation of measurements over time (and do some implicit imputation of missing timepoints, which you would otherwise ignore). You may also want to consider whether there's an interaction between timepoint and covariates (e.g. the importance of a pre-experiment measurement will often decline over time). You may indeed believe that the times are not too different, or perhaps that the size of a visit to visit change cannot be too large (forward-difference-parameterization). Additionally, it may indeed often be plausible that covariates have similar effects at different times, which you could reflect by having main effects and being skeptical on time point by covariate interactions being tool large. One way of encoding such things would be in a Bayesian fashion, which you could e.g. do with the brms R package (see here ).
