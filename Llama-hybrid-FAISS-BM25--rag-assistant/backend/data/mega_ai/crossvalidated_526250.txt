how to classify a part of sentence using transformer

The problem is like this: I have many sentences and for each sentence I have a continuous sequence of words that I want to mask out. Then I want to train a model to classify the masked part to 1/0. The purpose is to train a model that can classify the masked part without using any information in the masked part but purely using the context information. An example: “i borrow a book from Jason and it is interesting”. Without looking at Jason, the model should read “I borrow a book from MASK and it is interesting” and classify MASK as 1 (is a person name). I know this looks like NER problem in the first place but because the limitations of the training data, treating it as NER problem leads to an overfitting solution. So I want the model to not looking at Jason itself but look at the context to make a binary classification decision. My question is how can I turn this idea into a nlp problem and use Bert to model. Any idea is appreciated.
