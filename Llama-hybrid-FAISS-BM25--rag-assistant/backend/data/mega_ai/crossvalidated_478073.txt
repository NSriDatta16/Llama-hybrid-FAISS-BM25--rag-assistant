Interpreting classification report scores

I have been working with multi-class classification where the labels have four classes in total. I have used Random forest classifier and also performed cross validation and was able to obtain accuracies around 97% along with the below classification report. I want to know whether my model is fine to go with this classification report. The whole classification report has scores more than 93% (image is in the link). I've read many articles so far and as far as I understood my model seems to be okay. But could you please help in interpreting these scores? I'm very grateful if I can be guided to know whether my model is over fitting or not.
