It depends on a lot of factors, not least of which is what kind of file system you're using. MySQL uses files for storage anyway, so read speed isn't the issue -- the biggest factor will be how fast MySQL can find your data, compared to how fast it can be looked up in your filesystem. Generally, though, MySQL is quite good about finding data quickly -- after all, that's its purpose in life. So unless you have a really good reason why the FS should be much faster, stick with the DB and check your indexes and such.
