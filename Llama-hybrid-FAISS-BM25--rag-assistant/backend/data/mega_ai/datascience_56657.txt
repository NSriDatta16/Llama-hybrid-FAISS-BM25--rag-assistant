The good performance of Random Forest and even Decision Tree clearly indicates that there are some variables that help solving this problem, whereas the majority of variables is useless and "swamping" this for the other methods. Study the variables used by the decision tree. There is a good chance that these are bad (e.g., identifiers). For the variables that don't play a major role there, extract better features . While people like to pretend that AI is a universal magic weapon that can solve any problem if you just throw the magic AI sauce on it, that doesn't just work. Features and getting the right data is important, and that is why so many AI projects fail to deliver any ROI.
