I posted a response , similar to this about PhoneGap and Appcelerator Titanium ... but to be more specific, the approach I have taken with these frameworks is to use the framework first and then leverage plugin or extensions the framework provides when I need to get down in the weeds. I believe knowing the "classic" style can only benefit you now that these frameworks are relatively new and probably not complete. It allows you to code your way through the last mile when necessary. So to sum it up, I would start with PhoneGap or Appcelerator Titanium and get the thing going, and fall back on the classic way when you get stuck
