If you happen to be on Ruby 1.9x, I just got CoverMe (an rcov-ish lib that works under 1.9) working. Snappy and works out of the box w/ RSpec -- pretty much a plug-n-play setup. It just silently does your /coverage stuff every time you run rake:spec. Thought I'd mention it since I'm running 1.9.2preview3 on my bleeding edge stuff and it's possible you'll run into some 1.9 issues if you're using it.
