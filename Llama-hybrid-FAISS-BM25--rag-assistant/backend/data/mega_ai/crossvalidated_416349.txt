You have data in a spatial order along a line, not a time order. So while time series methods could be useful, be aware of methods that actually depends on the time order. Autocorrelation itself does not depend on the time order, you can check that by itself by calculating it the two possible ways (switching order), the results should be equal. ARIMA models, will depend on the order, so use with care. In reality, a better fit is spatial models, which also works in 1D (some implementations might not, but that is not because of the mathematics.) For example, if you want interpolation or extrapolation, look into kriging. One interesting-looking paper . Depending on your goals, (you didn't tell us,) regression with correlated errors could be a possibility.
