Including an embedded web server - possible issues with deployment

While analyzing some approaches to making our web app easier to deploy on our customers' sites, one of the suggestions was to include an embeddable web server to save the customer from needing to configure/install Apache/IIS. What are some drawbacks to this approach? Specifically, what are the possible issues that we could come across with an embeddable web server if the customer's server already has Apache/IIS running on the default port? Have you seen this approach taken by any commercial products? If the goal is easier deployment with the least amount of "server surgery" needed during installation, is embedding a web server a viable approach? Or are there more beneficial ways to minimize deployment support?
