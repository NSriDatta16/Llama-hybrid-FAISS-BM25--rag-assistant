Can this clinical data be modeled with survival analysis or recurrent neural network

I am not from statistics background but I am faced with data that seems to be survival data. First of all, I read about survival analysis and I know about recurrent survival data and different models (AG, PWP, Frailty, WLW) for it. Data description The data that I have is from clinical trials: Each patient was supposed to have a specific test (T) each year and from this test we can "guess" the percentage of infection (POI). The data also has more covariates about patients; Age, Sex, DOB, Race, and more. All in all, some patients did all T tests in 10 years (Folow-up time) while the others did some of these tests. The goal To predict the POI for next visit from previous or current test. I already restructured the data such that I can use it with one of previous recurrent models. Suggestion I read about Recurrent Neural Network and I am thinking to use it as a predicting mechanism, is this possible?
