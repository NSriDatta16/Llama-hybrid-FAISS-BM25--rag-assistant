Xi'an pointed out the original answer was wrong and I have corrected it (hopefully): runif() generates samples from the uniform distribution while rnorm() generates samples from the normal distribution. So in the first plot you are essentially drawing from a multivariate uniform distribution while in the latter example you are not drawing from a multivariate uniform distribution. This is because the random number generators work as expected. What you are doing in the first case is plotting a multivariate uniform distribution which has uniform coverage on a square and in the second case because both $U_i$ and $U_{i+1}$ are normally distributed you are making a multivariate normal distribution and plotting that. This is expected to look like a circle centered at (0,0) since rnorm() draws from a normal distribution with mean 0. You have effectively plotted the level sets of a 2D normal distribution: https://mathinsight.org/level_sets
