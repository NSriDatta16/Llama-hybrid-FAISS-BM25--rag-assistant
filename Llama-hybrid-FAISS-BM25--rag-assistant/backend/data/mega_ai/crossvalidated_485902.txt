I figured out the reason of my confusion. We can interpret the Diff-in-Diff technique in two ways: Only consider the members of the first group to be units in the experiment. This was my initial interpretation. In this case, we don't split the units in control and treatment sub-groups because we don't need to. We have both average possible outcomes under the Parallel Trends assumption, so we can directly estimate the ATE through the sample ATE (which is unbiased), as I described in the question. Note that here we didn't do any selection. Consider the members of the first group and the second group to be units in the experiment. In this case, the first group is the treatment group and the second group is the control group. And we know that the difference between their observed average outcomes is also an unbiased estimator of the ATE, but only if the selection bias is 0. Which it is. (The selection bias is defined as the difference in the expected outcome without treatment of the treatment group and the control group. The Parallel Trends assumption essentially tells us that this difference is 0.) Note that here we did a selection, but its bias is 0. Both interpretations reach the same ATE estimate, but for different reasons.
