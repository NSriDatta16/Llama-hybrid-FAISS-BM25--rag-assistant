Train a final model with the full data

I have trained a few NLP models, measured their performances and now I want to create a final model for production trained with all the data I have available. I'm working in text classification and I'm using transformers with the library PyTorch Lightning . The issue here is that I can't find an example of how to turn off the validation step (with pytorch lightning) and after several google searches I was not able to find discussions about that. So, now I'm having second thoughts and questioning if I'm thinking correctly. Is it common practice to train the production model with the full dataset without the validation? Or should I just use the best model I have already trained? If so, why?
