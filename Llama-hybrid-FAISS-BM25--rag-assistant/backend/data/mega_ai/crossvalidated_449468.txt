Why does the supporting vector satisfy $y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x_i}+b) = 1$ instead of $> 1$ or $= 2$

The SVM is about solving the constrained optimization such that $$\min_{\mathbf{w}} \dfrac{1}{2} \mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{w}$$ subject to $$y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x_i}+b)\geq{1}, i=1, 2, ...,n$$ Suppose that $(\mathbf{w}, b)$ is the optimal hyperplane that we get by solving the SVM problem, then it must be true that the supporting vectors satisfy the following relationship: $$y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x_i}+b) = 1$$ My question is why this must be the case? Our constraint says that our hyperplane is the optimal one as long as $$y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x_i}+b)\geq{1}, i=1, 2, ...,n$$ is satisfied. So why couldn't the supporting vectors satisfy $$y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x_i}+b) > 1?$$ or $$y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x_i}+b) = 2?$$ or $$y_i(\mathbf{w}^T\mathbf{x_i}+b) = 100?$$
