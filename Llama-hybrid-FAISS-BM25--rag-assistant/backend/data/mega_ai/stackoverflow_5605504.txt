jQuery UI Draggable animation whilst snapping to a grid

jQuery UI Draggable offers a grid option which, when set, will snap your draggable element to a grid. The only problem I'm having with this is I still want it to animate before snapping. If my grid is [500,500] then there will be no user feedback until the mouse covers a distance of 500px. Is it possible to do a similar "snap to grid" thing but also animate at the same time?
