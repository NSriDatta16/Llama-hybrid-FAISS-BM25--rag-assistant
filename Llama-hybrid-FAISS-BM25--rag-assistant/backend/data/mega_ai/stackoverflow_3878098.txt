It sounds like what you already have are foreign key constraints. You want to load the Orders table before you load the OrderLines table. I'm assuming that you have a single SSIS package that contains one Data Flow task for each target table. You need to create a connection between the Data Flow that loads Orders and the Data Flow that loads OrderLines. This connection is called a precedence constraint. Select the Orders Data Flow and you should see a green arrow. Click and drag the arrow to the OrderLines task. This creates the precedence constraint that indicates the Orders Data Flow must successfully complete before the OrderLines DataFlow can start.
