Does it make sense to interact 2 dummy variables?

I am running a logistic regression, where the dependent variable is marital status. And I assume that educated women are different from women with e.g. high school degree and are less likely to marry. Does it make sense to interact 2 binary variables? I remember that we usually interacted a continuous and a binary variable, that is why I am hesitating to include this interaction and how to interpret it. Please help.
