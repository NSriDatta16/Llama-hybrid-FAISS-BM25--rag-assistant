Looking for XML parser

I have been tasked with finding an open source DOM XML parser. The parser must minimally support XPath 1.0. Schema support is desired, but not a deal breaker The files we are parsing will be small so speed and memory consumption are not a large concern. Any OO language (C++, C#, Java, etc.). To clarify, the plan is to integrate an XML parser into an application much tighter than can be done with an external parser. We are creating an adaptive object model based on XML (change the XML, change the object model.) To do this we need to integrate the parser at a pretty low level. This results in a level of elegance that needs to be experienced to be understood (thank you Mr. Yoder). Part of that elegance disappears if we don't have the ability to navigate this object model via XPath. We have created a prototype that uses an operating system provided parser. It worked pretty well, but suffers from complexity and performance problems. But hey, it was a prototype. Now I want to do the real thing and I can write the parser from scratch. (I've done that part and it was kinda easy.) Now, the XPath engine is a different story. I'm pretty sure I won't get that done in a weekend.
