The relevant quote from page 23 of Elements of Statistics: "Hence most data points are closer to the boundary of the sample space than to any other data point. The reason that this presents a problem is that prediction is much more difficult near the edges of the training sample. One must extrapolate from neighboring sample points rather than interpolate between them." If $x_0$ is > 3 standard deviations from the origin, that means that on average well under 1% of sample points will be further from the origin in the direction of $x_0$ . So the sample size would have to be very large to avoid the problem of $x_0$ being at the edge of the sample.
