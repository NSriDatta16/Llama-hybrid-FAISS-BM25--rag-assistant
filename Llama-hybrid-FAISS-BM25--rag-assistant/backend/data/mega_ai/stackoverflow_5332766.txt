If I understood your question correctly, there's IoXML that can do it: IoXML is a Camlp5 syntax extension for OCaml mli and ml files which generates XML parsers and printers for all types you define. There's a similar one for JSON: https://github.com/mirage/shelf If you're fine with using JSON, I'd suggest also looking at ATD/yojson . This system relies on external data definition language, but it still produces idiomatic OCaml type definitions. UPDATE (08/15/2011): Now my own Piqi project can do this as well. It can serialize OCaml data using 4 different formats: Google Protocol Buffers, JSON, XML and Piq.
