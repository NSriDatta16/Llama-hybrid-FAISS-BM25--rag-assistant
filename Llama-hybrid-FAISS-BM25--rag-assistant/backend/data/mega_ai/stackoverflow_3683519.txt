Nothing is impossible in IT. But some things might get extremely complicated. Using key-value storage for things like full-text search might be extremely painfull. Also, as far as I see, it lack support for large, clustered databases: so on MySQL you have no problems if you grow over 100s of Gb in Database, and on Redis... Well, it will require more effort :-) So use it for what it was developed for, storing simple things which just need to be retreived by id.
