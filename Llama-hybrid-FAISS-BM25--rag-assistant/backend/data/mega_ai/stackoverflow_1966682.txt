Do you have a database or do you want to create a new one? If you have one just create a connection in server exploer, add new Model in Visual studio, select LinqToSql Classes, select tables from your connection and drag and drop the tables you need to the design surface. Then you can access your model from your controller where the user data is posted to. Check this thread for example of saving. If you don't have a database you obviously have to design and create it first
