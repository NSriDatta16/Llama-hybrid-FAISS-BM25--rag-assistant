Is there an R package that can infer a causal structure with a mix of discrete and continuous variables?

I have an observational dataset with a mixture of discrete and continuous variables. I'd like to infer a causal structure compatible with the data. The pcalg package for R can handle datasets with continuous, discrete, or binary variables but apparently not a mixture of such, unless one is willing to write a custom function for testing conditional independence between such variables (which I wouldn't know how to do). Is there an R package that can infer a causal structure compatible with a dataset that has a mixture of discrete and continuous variables?
