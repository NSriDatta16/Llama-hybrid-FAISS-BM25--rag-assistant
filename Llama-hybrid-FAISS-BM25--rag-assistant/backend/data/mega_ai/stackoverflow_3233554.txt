What do you mean by "compiling"? There's no such concept as compiling a generic XML file. I don't have a detailed understanding of aiml files, but it's not that you want to view the XML data itself in it, right? Or is that what you want? I suppose you want to make an aiml -based bot which operates based on data given in the aiml file. Then what you need is not an XML viewer; rather, you need an implementation of aiml bot. This is not about XML per se. You might have misunderstood, but XML is not a programming language in itself; it's just a nice way to organize data in a plain text. It's not that you can take an XML file, compile and run it just as you would do with a C/C++/Objective-C source code. You should have a look at the list of the implementations there: http://www.alicebot.org/downloads/programs.html Objective-C is a superset of C, and you can also use C++ together using Objective-C++. So you should be able to use the C++ implementations listed there.
