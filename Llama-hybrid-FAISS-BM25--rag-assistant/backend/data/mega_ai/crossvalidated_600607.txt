Logistic Regression models with two or more response variables in R/SAS

There are a lot of inconsistencies in the literature over what should be the appropriate term(s) for the regression models involving two or more responses, and if they are binary/continuous, for more than one predictor variable. I have three questions/clarifications regarding these: Multivariate Logistic Regression is one where we have more than one response variable and they are all binary. The predictors could be categorial or continuous. I also found that this is aka Mixed Effect Logistic Regression by some. Though I still think it is up for debate. Multinomial Logistic Regression is one where we have only one response variable which has more than two classes. The predictors could be categorial or continuous. Multivariate Linear Regression is when we have more than one response variable and they are all continuous. The predictors could be categorial or continuous. Can somebody please confirm if these definitions are appropriate and point me in the right direction to execute these regression models in R/SAS/Python with right commands...
