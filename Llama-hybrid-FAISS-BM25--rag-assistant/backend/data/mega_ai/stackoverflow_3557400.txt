When you changed the field type, did you also change the database's field in the schema (structure in xBASE/Clipper)? If not, you're trying to assign a non-numeric value to a numeric type field, and that's what's causing the exception. If you're still using DBF style files, you need to change the type of the field in the database from NUMERIC to CHARACTER. You can do it using SQL from the Database Desktop, IIRC, with the BDE's DBASE support. Just changing the TField's type from ftFloat to ftString won't alter the database storage for that field automatically; you have to do it in both places yourself.
