What do you think of Google's new programming language: Noop?

http://code.google.com/p/noop/ Noop (pronounced noh-awp, like the machine instruction) is a new language that attempts to blend the best lessons of languages old and new, while syntactically encouraging industry best-practices and discouraging the worst offenses. Noop is initially targeted to run on the Java Virtual Machine. What's the pros/cons with using this language?
