 neural networks trained simultaneously in a two-player minmax game: the generator produces new data from samples of a random variable, the discriminator attempts to distinguish between generated and real data. During the training, the generator's objective is to fool the discriminator, while the discriminator attempts to learn to better classify real and fake data. In GAN-based inpainting methods the generator acts as a context encoder and produces a plausible completion for the gap only given the available information surrounding it. The discriminator is used to train the generator and tests the consistency of the produced inpainted audio. Recently, also diffusion models have established themselves as the state-of-the-art of generative models in many fields, often beating even GAN-based solutions. For this reason they have also been used to solve the audio inpainting problem, obtaining valid results. These models generate new data instances by inverting the diffusion process, where data samples are progressively transformed into Gaussian noise. One drawback of generative models is that they typically need a huge amount of training data. This is necessary to make the network generalize well and make it able to produce coherent audio information, that also presents some kind of structural complexity. Nonetheless, some works demonstrated that, capturing the essence of an audio signal is also possible using only a few tens of seconds from a single training sample. This is done by overfitting a generative neural network to a single training audio signal. In this way, researchers were able to perform audio inpainting without exploiting large datasets. Applications Audio inpainting finds applications in a wide range of fields, including audio restoration and audio forensics among the others. In these fields, audio inpainting can be used to eliminate noise, glitches, or undesired distortions from an audio recording, thus enhancing its quality and intelligibility. It can also be employed to recover deteriorated old recordings that have been affected by local modifications or have missing audio samples due to scratches on CDs. Audio inpainting is also closely related to packet loss concealment (PLC). In the PLC problem, it is necessary to compensate the loss of audio packets in communication networks. While both problems aim at filling missing gaps in an audio signal, PLC has more computation time restrictions and only the packets preceding a gap are considered to be reliable (the process is said to be causal).
