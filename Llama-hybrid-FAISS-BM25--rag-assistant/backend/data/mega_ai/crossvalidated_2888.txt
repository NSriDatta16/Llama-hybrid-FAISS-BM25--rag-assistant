I haven't seen this used in outside of bioinformatics/machine learning either, but maybe you can be the first one :) As a good representative of small sample method method from bioinformatics, logistic regression with L1 regularization can give a good fit when number of parameters is exponential in the number of observations, non-asymptotic confidence intervals can be crafted using Chernoff-type inequalities (ie, Dudik, (2004) for example). Trevor Hastie has done some work applying these methods to identifying gene interactions. In the paper below, he uses it to identify significant effects from a model with 310,637 adjustable parameters fit to a sample of 2200 observations "Genome-wide association analysis by lasso penalized logistic regression."
