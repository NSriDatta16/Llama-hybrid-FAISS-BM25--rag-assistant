Why does log-transformation of the RNA-seq data reduce the amount of explained variance in PCA?

I am running a PCA on a dataset with 2k rows and 36k columns. I noticed that when I log-transform the data I need to ask for more principal components during PCA to achieve the same amount of explained variance (see images attached). What is the underlying reason for this? I have a naive intuition that log-transforming "compresses" the data, therefore the amount of explained variance for the different principal components is being "homogenized". Is there a rigorous explanation for this or did I make a mistake?
