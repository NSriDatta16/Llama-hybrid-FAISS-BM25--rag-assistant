Sensitivity of Weibull survival model to early missing data

I have a few datasets of survival times that appears to be very well-modelled by Weibull distributions; I am mostly interested in whether $k$ is above, below or around 1. However, there is a real chance that the data has a selection effect that leaves out some data points with small durations (the data is the survival time of societies, and clearly the literature may overlook particularly obscure and short-lived ones). As far as I can tell, removing some small duration data pushes $k$ upwards since it makes it look like the early time hazard is lower than it is. Is there (1) a way of quantifying the magnitude of this effect (e.g. "if a fraction $x$ of points below $y$ are missing, $k$ is biased roughly as $f(x,y)$ "), or (2) some principled way of dealing with it? For example, one could just translate the whole distribution so the smallest duration is $x_{min}+1$ ( $+1$ to avoid the MLE fitting problems for Weibull for $x=0$ ); this looks very crude and potentially biased in the other direction to me. A more complex approach might to assume some functional form of the selection effect and try imputing extra data points, maybe even weighing together the resulting parameter estimates in a Bayesian way. My analysis is pretty qualitative, so I am less interested in highly precise estimates than a way of reasoning about how solid conclusions can be in the face of this potential missing data.
