The data you have is sometimes referred to as panel data. Th statistical problem is NOT whether or not they are correlated BUT whether or not a similar model/set of parameters is appropriate for the individual n series . Thus in general we may have and we may wish to find what subset series have a common model. You can refer to Pooled Cross-Sectional Time Series. At the end of the day, you would estimate parameters of a suitable ARIMA model locally and also globally and construct an F Test to challenge the hypothesis of a common set of parameters.
