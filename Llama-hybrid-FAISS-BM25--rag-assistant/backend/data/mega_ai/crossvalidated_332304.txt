Verbal Description Of The RSE

I'm reading An Introduction to Statistical Learning , currently on page 69, the chapter on Simple Linear Regression. The text says: In the case of the advertising data, we see from the linear regression output in Table 3.2 that the RSE is 3.26. In other words, actual sales in each market deviate from the true regression line by approximately 3,260 units, on average. Another way to think about this is that even if the model were correct and the true values of the unknown coefficients $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ were known exactly, any prediction of sales on the basis of TV advertising would still be off by about 3,260 units on average. I was a bit puzzled by the last sentence, isn't what's described here the approximation of the average absolute deviation instead of the RSE, which is an approximation of the standard deviation ?
