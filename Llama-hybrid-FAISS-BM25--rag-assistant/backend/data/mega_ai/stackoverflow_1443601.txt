How can I detect whether the iphone has been rebooted since last time app started

I'd like to detect from within my app whether the iPhone has been rebooted since last time my app was started. I need to do this because my app uses the timer since last system reboot to clock a user's time and I want to detect reboot so I can invalidate the time. Is there anywhere I could extract the information from the system console log like reboot , crashes ? The organizer in xcode can access it , maybe I can too. If not , can you think of other ways to get this information?
