c(x,y) is just the entries in x followed by the entries in y . You want t.test(x, y) , which returns Welch Two Sample t-test data: x and y t = -11.934, df = 2759.7, p-value Enter ?t.test at the R command prompt to view the documentation for this function (including how to do things like change your desired value of $\alpha$ or use a one-sided rather than two-sided test). Note that this is using the t-test for the difference in means between X and Y. Since your other example involves a pair of exponential distributions, you might be asking for an equality of distribution test. A standard one is Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov: > ks.test(x, y) Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test data: x and y D = 0.2185, p-value See paragraph 4 of the Wikipedia page on Kolmogorov-Smirnov for references to some other common tests of equality of distribution.
