I can't help but give a very generic answer. A lot depends on what kind of sophistication is required; Is it a school project or some critical application. And further, a lot of time (weeks at least) can go into understanding the basic nuances of time series/forecasting. If you do not have the background in stats/analytics, you might overshoot your deadlines. I would suggest plugging-in one of these . If you really want to add forecasting to your forte, Rob J Hyndman's generous blogs, book and codes(in R) can be good starting point.
