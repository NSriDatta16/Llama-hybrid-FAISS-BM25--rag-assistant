draggable connect to sortable (change the id)

I have a ui draggable that connects to a sortable list with helper clone. $(".mydrag").draggable({ helper:'clone', handle: '.drag', connectToSortable:'.new', start: function(event, ui) { console.log(ui); var id = ui.helper[0].id; $(ui.helper).attr("id","new-"+id); } }); When start the drag I and a prefix of "new-" at the id expecting that when received by the sortable will sit as new-id. But its not working. I also tried to change the context $(ui.helper.context).attr("id","new-"+id); but in this case change the id of the received element in the sortable BUT it also change the id of the original item I also tried to change the id when sortable receives the new element but change the id of the original item (because when receiving there are 2 elements with the same id) So I am really stuck. Any help appreciated
