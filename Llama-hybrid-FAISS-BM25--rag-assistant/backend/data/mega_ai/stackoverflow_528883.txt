How to display a standard SharePoint "Access Denied" message

How can I re-direct the user to the standard SharePoint "access denied" page, similar to the image below? Currently, I am throwing an UnauthorizedAccessException, but this error message is not as elegant as SP message. throw new UnauthorizedAccessException("User does not have permission to access this list"); Any help will be highly appreciated.
