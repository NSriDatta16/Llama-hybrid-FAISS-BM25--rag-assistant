What exactly is a node in node.js?

In Erlang I was able to immediately understand the notion of a 'node' - a self-contained Erlang VM. I could start a node on one machine with erl -name gandalf -setcookie abc , and another node on another machine (on the same LAN) with erl -name bilbo -setcookie abc . I could then spawn processes on gandalf which would communicate magically with other processes on bilbo. Now, since I also wanted to serve up a jazzy webpage with animated graphical results from my Erlang processes, I picked up some Javascript and learnt jQuery. Still a humble paduwan, but I sort of understand how Javascript fits into the scheme of things. I recently came across node.js and an (evil) voice started whispering: 'This is it! Now you can do everything with Javascript! Forget Erlang and guards and periods, stick to a language that everyone uses'. I've read the docs a bit, but I still don't understand what a node is in node.js. Do I have to run a http server and that becomes my node? What if I don't like http, or I don't care how gandalf talks to bilbo - that's what I like in Erlang. Maybe I nai:vely expect that node.js is erlang with Javascript sugar?
