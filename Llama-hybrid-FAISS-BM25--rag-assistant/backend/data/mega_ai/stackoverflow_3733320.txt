Adobe (Macromedia) Flex applications is handled by Adobe. Adobe has released Flex Builder 3.0; this release includes the QuickTest Professional Flex add-in. The add-in was developed using QuickTest Professional's Test Extensibility Architecture functionality. The Flex add-in is developed and owned by Adobe. Hewlett Packard does not support the Adobe Flex add-in, therefore I suggest contacting Adobe ( http://www.adobe.com ) to see about availability, support details, and pricing. Adobe is providing the add-in via an automation package that is shipped with Flex Builder 3 Professional. Basic information on the automation package with QuickTest Professional integration is here: http://www.adobe.com/support/documentation/en/flex/3/releasenotes_flex3_fb.html http://www.adobe.com/products/flex/upgrade/ Users can download the automation package with QuickTest Professional integration here: http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/tdrc/index.cfm?product=flex A specific Adobe license is required and needs to be requested from Adobe. No specific Flex license is required on the QuickTest Professional side. Note: Support for the Flex add-in is being provided by Adobe. Customers/end-users need to contact the Adobe support organization for help with problems or questions related to the Flex add-in. From the Flex Builder 3 release notes (for an updated version, contact Adobe): Requirements for Using the QTP Plug-in To test applications with Flex Automated Testing and the QTP agent, you must install the following: HP QuickTest Professional 9.1 (no support for Smart Identification), available from HP HP QuickTest Professional 9.2 and patch 1701 or later if you want Smart Identification support.
