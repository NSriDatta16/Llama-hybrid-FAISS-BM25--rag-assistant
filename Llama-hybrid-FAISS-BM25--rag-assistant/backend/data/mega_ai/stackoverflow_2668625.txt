I would like to know to create a youtube like flash player

I basically want to embed a swf object and then feed different videos to it. Right now, I made a xml driven video player, however, I would have to create a new swf and xml list for each video I want to embed on my site. This is a real drag and pain. What is the procedure to make a universal player like youtube. FYI: I can't use flow player because it uses java script and I would like the pages I make on my site to be able to share on facebook.
