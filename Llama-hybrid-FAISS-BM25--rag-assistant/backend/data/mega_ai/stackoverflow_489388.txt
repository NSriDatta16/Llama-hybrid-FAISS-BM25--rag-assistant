Thanks for the idea, strager. It was close, but the actual problem is the set of quotes around P:\bg\Gif Image. Changing them to single quotes fixes the problem. I believe this can be also be solved with FixMake: http://www.grassvalleysoftware.com/ . FixMake takes a makefile and cleans up things such as trailing backslashes and escaped quotations.
