@imoutidi, I also encountered the same deprecation warning. After digging around a bit, it looks like the new/replacement package can be imported with the following: from nltk.tag.stanford import CoreNLPNERTagger However, when trying to run the tag() method I end up getting an unexpected HTTP connection refused error. I haven't figured out if this is an environment configuration issue (missing .jar path) or an issue with the NLTK codebase. I tried temporarily turning off my local firewall and that didn't help, so I'm guessing it is one of the other two possibilities. I hope the python import statement is at least some help.
