binary logistic regression - Model Fit Problem

I have a run a binary logistic regression to identify associations between three categorical variables (gender, work sector, workplace region/location) and violence victimisation at work. Sample size= approx 20,000 participants I have significant terms, but the goodness of fit tests indicates the model may not be appropriate. Hosmer and Lemeshow p Does this mean I should exclude these results from my analysis? If not, how can I justify their inclusion? Results: Omnibus Tests of Model Coefficients Chi-sq df Sig.
