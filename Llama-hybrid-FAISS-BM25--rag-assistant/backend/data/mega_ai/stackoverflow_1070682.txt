Removing the border styling on IE

Why is it the simple things that IE manages to mess up the most? Anyway I want to replace a normal hr line with a single image a bit like the - ยง - symbol (on its side). Trying to make it look elegant :) It appears the only way to actually get rid of the border in IE though is to set the color: css value. Doing this will override whatever is set as background-image unfortunately and make the whole hr the parameter for color. It's not possible to wrap it in a div or even really apply a class to it as the client that will be using the site is using a wysiwyg text editor which I don't really relish hacking to insert a div wrapped hr. I am one step away from adding a div block wrapper with jquery, but that seems fundamentally wrong (shotgun vs walnut) - any suggestions?
