Drag Drop to the Desktop after creation of the file? (C#)

I have a query about drag-drop in C# using .NET. My issue is with remote files. I have a list of remote files which the user can drag into an explorer window (desktop, etc). When such a drag occurs I want to be able to download the file and write it to the drop location. The normal method of dragging files: private void StartDragDrop(string FileToDrag) { MyControl.DoDragDrop(new DataObject(DataFormats.FileDrop, FileToDrag), DragDropEffects.Copy); } ...does not suit my needs as I will not have the file data to populate the drag-drop object until after the DROP. I have seen this functionality in many FTP clients and such. Thanks in advance wizards.
