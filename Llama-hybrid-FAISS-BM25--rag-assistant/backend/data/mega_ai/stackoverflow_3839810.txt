Better D Documentation

Where can I find good solid D documentation? I've been trying to learn D, and am having issues finding good reference docs for the language. For instance, I see op opImplicitCast talked about back in 2007...was that ever implemented? Overall the language information seems to be extremely fragmented between dsource the digitalmars site and the public wiki. Any ideas?
