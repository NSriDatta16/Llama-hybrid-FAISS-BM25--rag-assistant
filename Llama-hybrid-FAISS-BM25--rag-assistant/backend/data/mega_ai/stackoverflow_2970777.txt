How do I route watir through a proxy pragmatically?

I'm trying to route watir through a proxy pragmatically -- this means within the script I'd like to change my proxy dynamically before launching the browser. Here's what I've tried so far (and so far am failing): I'm running chrome and lucid lynx ubuntu. I chose TREX cause I thought watir might be making use of PROXY or something. I rewrote /usr/bin/google-chrome as: #!/bin/bash /opt/google/chrome/chrome --proxy-server="$TREX" $@ The reason I'm passing in the environment variable to proxy-server rather than http_proxy is because I never could get http_proxy to work as is anyways then I did a simple: require 'rubygems' require 'watir-webdriver' ENV['TREX'] = "XX.XX.XX.XX:YY" browser = Watir::Browser.new(:chrome) browser.goto("http://mysite.com") Anyways, what is happening here is that it is forwarding me to the login page of the proxy rather than just forwarding the request. What am I missing here? I feel like I'm pretty close.
