Read the documentation for Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() Note: don't be confused by the word "external" here. This directory can better be thought as media/shared storage. It is a filesystem that can hold a relatively large amount of data and that is shared across all applications (does not enforce permissions). Traditionally this is an SD card, but it may also be implemented as built-in storage in a device that is distinct from the protected internal storage and can be mounted as a filesystem on a computer. In devices with multiple "external" storage directories (such as both secure app storage and mountable shared storage), this directory represents the "primary" external storage that the user will interact with. I have not personally seen a case but there is no requirement that getExternalStorageDirectory returns the memory card. You are doing the correct thing by treating the returned directory as shared storage as it was an intentional decision by the device manufacturer.
