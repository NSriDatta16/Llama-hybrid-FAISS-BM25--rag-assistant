Understanding the causes and implication of heteroskedasticity

I’m trying to heteroskedasticity and how, even if we don’t have MLR 5 assumption (heteroskedasticity), we can still have unbiased estimates. I was thinking: a very intuitive cause of a growing variance would be that we have an omitted variable bias. In this case, wouldn’t MLR 4 be violated as well, as thus the above statement is invalid? (MLR 4 refers to conditional mean independence of X and error terms. I understand that this means that X and errors must be uncorrelated. Therefore an OVB would rule this out) Am I just thinking of but one specific cause of heteroskedasticity, and thus the other causes can still preserve MLR 4? I understand another cause is autocorrelation, which is like inertia of an outcome with respect to an X variable, usually time (in time series).
