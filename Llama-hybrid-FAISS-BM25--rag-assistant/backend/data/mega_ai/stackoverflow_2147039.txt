Debug java plugin

Is it possible to debug the applet loading process of the java plugin? I don't want to debug my applet application, I want to debug the applet loading process of the java plugin2. I mean the jnlp/jar download, cache lookup, certificate check, etc. I know the java plugin is not open source, but it would help anyway. I'm trying to solve JNLP2ClassLoader issues happening only within IE. It works with Google Chrome or Firefox. The error is not very reproducible, but one of the is "JNLP2ClassLoader.findClass: org.apache.log4j.spi.ThrowableInformation: try again...".
