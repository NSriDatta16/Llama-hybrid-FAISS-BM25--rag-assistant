How to start prediction from dataset?

I have event dataset in a factless table. It has list of events timestamp-> event name -> node ( In network) There is always a sequence of event happening. So how do I start predicting future event based on past one and discover list of nodes that will be affected from past experience. I am programmer without knowledge of machine learning. I have installed spark,R and have dataset in oracle database.Is there any tutorial/algorithm that I can use to get started. I taught myself scala/R but have no idea on getting started. My dataset are huge i.e. more than 9billion rows for 3 months. Node Eventtime alarmname 192.168.1.112 6/14/2016 19:41 Main power supply has a fault alarm 192.168.1.113 6/14/2016 19:23 Association path broken 192.168.1.113 6/14/2016 19:23 NA 192.168.1.113 6/14/2016 19:23 Association broken 192.168.1.112 6/14/2016 19:23 Mains Failure 192.168.1.112 6/14/2016 19:23 Mains Failure Additional Information: I have 98 nodes. I would like to predict: i. No of node that has alarm or goes down when a single node goes down e.g. if node A has alarm if in 1 month list of node that has alarm at the same period ii. The sequence of event occurrence i.e. if one node has mains failure then the next event would be node down.
