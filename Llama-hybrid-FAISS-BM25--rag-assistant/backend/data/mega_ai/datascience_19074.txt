What pre-trained models are available?

It's not entirely clear what pre-trained networks are out there in deep learning. Of particular interest to me are the deep convolutional networks. I'm only aware of the VGG series like VGG16/VGG19. I searched the internet for Microsoft's famous ResNet that won ImageNet 2015, but couldn't find it. I suppose the corporate giants don't really share their models, eh? Any pointers to maybe a comprehensive list that I have simply overlooked or there isn't one?
