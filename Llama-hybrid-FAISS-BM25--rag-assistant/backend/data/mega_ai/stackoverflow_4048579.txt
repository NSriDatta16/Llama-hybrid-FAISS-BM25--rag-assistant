You can't do both. Either use Scrum, or support your customers. I would suggest using Scrum if you can build up a Team of at least five developers who won't get interupted during the Sprint. Generally, even though support is required, customers can wait for the Sprint to end. On the other hand, you might have one spare developer whose job is to fulfill customers support. The Team will then be able to fulfill its job by develiring higher value products so that your customer support requirements will decrease. Then your organization will benefit, in my opinion, of your Scrum experience.
