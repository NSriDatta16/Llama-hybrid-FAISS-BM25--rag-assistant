It depends on what you are modeling. If you have panel data, where the different time series you are interested in probably drive each other, possibly with lags (very typical for macroeconomic time series, like GDP, workforce, housing starts etc.), a model like VAR is appropriate. If you have an intervention time series that you can set externally, you just use the future settings. An example would be future promotions in forecasting retail sales. You may also have a time series $X$ that drives your focal time series $Y$ , but not vice versa. An example would be the influence of weather on your retail sales. (Can you tell what I do for a living?) In this case, you can use whatever is appropriate to forecast your driver $X$ , in this case your favorite meteorological forecast.
