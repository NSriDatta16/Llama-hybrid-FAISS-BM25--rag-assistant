I implemented a simple version of what you described, where a toolbar had options that were context sensitive and were simply shown or hidden. The application used the MVVM pattern, so my toolbar had a view model. I leverage the message bus (sometimes called event aggregator) to publish messages which the toolbar's view model could react to.
