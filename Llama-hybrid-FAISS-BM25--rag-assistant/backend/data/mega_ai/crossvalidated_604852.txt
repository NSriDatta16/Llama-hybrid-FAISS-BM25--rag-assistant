Most likely, you have several factors (i.e. categorical covariates) in your model. E.g. you have country (e.g. US, Canada, Germany and Andorra), age group (e.g. =65) and previous disease history (yes/no). You are trying to fit a negative binomial model like events ~ 0 + country + agegroup + diseasehist . If it then so happens that for the 5 people from Andorra 0 events happened and for the 1 person aged $(0, \infty)$ as rates cannot be negative). Even worse, you typically/by default work on the log-scale when you do negative binomial distribution, which means you don't get numerical convergence (i.e. the likelihood will become higher and higher as you estimate on the log-scale becomes a negative number of bigger and bigger magnitude). The package you use seems to remove variables from the model that cause such problems (but in some cases, they might of course be very important variables that predict very well that no events will happen for certain people). This is the same problem as complete separation/quasi-complete separation in logistic regression and Cox regression. So, it would seem obvious to try the same solutions. Out of the known obvious solutions, the Firth's correction and exact negative binomial regression are not things I've seen implemented for negative binomial regression, so the main obvious solution is a Bayesian approach. E.g. the brms R package provides a convenient interface for fitting Bayesian negative binomial regression (the parameterization used is described here ).
