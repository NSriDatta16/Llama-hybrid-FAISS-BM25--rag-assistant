Neural Network Structure

I am currently building a Neural Network library. I have constructed it as an object graph for simplicity. I am wondering if anyone can quantify the performance benefits of going to an array based approach. What I have now works very good for building networks of close to arbitrary complexity. Regular (backpropped) networks as well as recurrent networks are supported. I am considering having trained networks "compile" into some "simpler" form such as arrays. I just wanted to see if anyone out there had any practical advice or experience building neural networks that deployed well into production. Is there any benefit to having the final product be array based instead of object graph based? P.S Memory footprint is less important than speed.
