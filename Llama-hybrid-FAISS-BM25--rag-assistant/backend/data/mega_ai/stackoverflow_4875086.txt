The simple answer here would be to move the image store from SQL to Azure Storage Blobs. The container for those blobs can then be made public and accessed via a URL without the need for you to act as an intermediary with your caching layer. However, if you still want your applications to act as that intermediary via the http handler, you should still be able to accomplish that with the 1.3 SDK. This verson introduced full IIS which allows you to configure virtual directories and http handlers inside web role. But I'd really recommend you take a look at the use of publically readable blob containers. It gives you the same level of functionality for a signficantly reduced level of effort. You can even combine the techniques, toss in a pinch of Azure AppFabric cacheing to add more flexibility and features if needed.
