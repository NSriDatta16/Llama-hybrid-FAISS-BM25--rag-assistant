@Scortchi has provided a good answer here. Let me add one small point. Even using the stricter definition of indicator variable, this can still be associated with (at least) two different coding schemes for categorical data in a regression-type model: viz. reference level coding and level means coding . With level means coding, you have a categorical variable with $k$ levels that are represented with $k$ indicator variables, but you do not include a vector of $1$s for the intercept (i.e., the intercept is suppressed). (For a fuller explication, with example model matrices, see my answer here: How can logistic regression have a factorial predictor and no intercept? ) When there is only a single categorical variable, this yields model output in a way that is simple and may be preferred by some people. (For an example where using this scheme facilitates comparisons of interest, see my answer here: Why do the estimated values from a Best Linear Unbiased Predictor (BLUP) differ from a Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE)? )
