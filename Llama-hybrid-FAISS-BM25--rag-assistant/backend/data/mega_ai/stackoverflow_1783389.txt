What are the uses of recurrent neural networks when using them with Reinforcement Learning?

I do know that feedforward multi-layer neural networks with backprop are used with Reinforcement Learning as to help it generalize the actions our agent does. This is, if we have a big state space, we can do some actions, and they will help generalize over the whole state space. What do recurrent neural networks do, instead? To what tasks are they used for, in general?
