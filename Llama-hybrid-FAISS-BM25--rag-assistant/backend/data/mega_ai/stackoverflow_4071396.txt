How to split by comma and strip white spaces in Python?

I have some python code that splits on comma, but doesn't strip the whitespace: >>> string = "blah, lots , of , spaces, here " >>> mylist = string.split(',') >>> print mylist ['blah', ' lots ', ' of ', ' spaces', ' here '] I would rather end up with whitespace removed like this: ['blah', 'lots', 'of', 'spaces', 'here'] I am aware that I could loop through the list and strip() each item but, as this is Python, I'm guessing there's a quicker, easier and more elegant way of doing it.
