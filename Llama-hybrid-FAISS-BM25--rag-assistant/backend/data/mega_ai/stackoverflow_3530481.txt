One implementation defined way would be to use the pragma directives to print during compilation. #pragma message "Compiling " __FILE__ "..." Or, you could do this with some macros and a printf (but not without introducing UB in some aspect or the other) at runtime. #define exit(x) printf("Hello, world!") int main() { exit(0); return 0; /* if pre-C99 */ }
