The specification has changed quite a bit since the working draft that was up-to-date when this answer was first posted five years ago. As @Andre Figueiredo righly points out in the comments, the published HTML5.2 specification is very clear on this specific use case (emphasis added): h1 – h6 elements must not be used to markup subheadings, subtitles , alternative titles and taglines unless intended to be the heading for a new section or subsection. In short, use an appropriately classified p element inside a header element: A BLOG TITLE the best blog in the world In HTML5, there's an obvious solution: A BLOG TITLE the best blog in the world When using HTML4 I personally tend to replace the h2 with p class="tagline" , or something similar. Edit: To motivate the use of h2 in HTML5, think of the title of Dr. Strangelove : Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb Does a p element make sense here? Not really — it's not a paragraph, it's a title. Does h2 work as-is? No, we might confuse it with subtitles of the text itself. So what do we do? We use h2 and group it with h1 using a header element, thereby getting rid of the ambiguity concerning the subtitles in the text.
