Filtering Asynchronous OData Queries on Windows Phone 7

I am working on an application for Windows Phone 7 that makes asynchronous queries to OData. I use the following general form for the query: DataServiceQuery query = ourEntities.CreateQuery ("Entities"); entities.BeginExecute(QueryComplete, query); I am having trouble adding filters to these queries, though. Using LINQ did not seem to be an option for asynchronous queries, so I tried adding OData filters using the AddQueryOption method mentioned in this article (trying to get results for when the Id is 1): query.AddQueryOption("$filter", "Id eq 1"); If we take the URL from the async result and paste it into a browser, it works properly and returns the expected result. However, attempting to evaluate the result of the query always seems to result in a NotSupportedException with no message or inner stack trace. Ideally, I'd like to be able to use LINQ, like Scott Hanselman did in his blog post about OData . If that is not an option for asynchronous data retrieval, how can I achieve filtering on the query?
