Dynamic two level list php

I know, that this might be super easy, but probably, working late just halted my brains... All right. Here is my PHP, which is making two level dynamic list for me. http://robertr.pastebin.com/K2XvruPr \n"; $result = mysql_query($query); while($list = mysql_fetch_array($result)){ if($last!=$list['sect_name']) { echo " ".$list['sect_name']." \n"; $last = $list['sect_name']; } echo " "; echo " ".$list['cat_name']." "; echo " \n"; } echo " "; ?> Everything on view output looks nice, but source view is not like i want. robertr.pastebin.com/J7bPQeXj (copy paste in address bar). Could anyone help me understand, how to make those second level UL tags only once for all categories, not for each. Thanks!
