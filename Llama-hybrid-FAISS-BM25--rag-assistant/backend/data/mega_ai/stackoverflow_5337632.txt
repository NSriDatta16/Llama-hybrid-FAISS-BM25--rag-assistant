jquery - how could prevent clicked link when I move links with drag&drop?

I allow move (drag&drop) some elements which contains inside link ( a ), After user drop it, it redirects browser to href of moved element. How could I allow to click that element and drag&drop its also? I use http://dragsort.codeplex.com/ plugin.
