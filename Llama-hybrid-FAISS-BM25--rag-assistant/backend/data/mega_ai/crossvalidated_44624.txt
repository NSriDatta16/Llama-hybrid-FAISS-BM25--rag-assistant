Your interpretation looks correct. You can check it yourself by calling predict on some data and comparing your calculations to predict . I first did this in a spreadsheet, and then I calculated an R neural network using metaprogramming . By the way, the R package neuralnet draws nice diagrams, but apparently it supports only regression (not classification?).
