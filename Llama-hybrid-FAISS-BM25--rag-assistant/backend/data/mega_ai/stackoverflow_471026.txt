How do I make cron run something every "N"th minute, where n % 5 == 1?

I know that I can have something run every five minutes in cron with a line like: */5 * * * * /my/script What if I don't want it running at 12:00, 12:05, 12:10, but rather at 12:01, 12:06, 12:11, etc? I guess I can do this: 1,6,11,16,21,26,31,36,41,46,51,56 * * * * /my/script ...but that's ugly. Is there a more elegant way to do it?
