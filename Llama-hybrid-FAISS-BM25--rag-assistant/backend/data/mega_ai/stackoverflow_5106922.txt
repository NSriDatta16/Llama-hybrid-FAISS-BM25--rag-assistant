Be it for motor control, tuning the brightness of an led, etc, essentially it is used as a 1 bit DAC. If you have something that ideally wants a DC voltage but something in the system doesnt react very fast (like your eyes watching an led, or the rotor on a motor) if you feed it a waveform (often sine or pwm) you will basically get the integral. A pwm is not as fancy as a real one bit dac like you would see in a stereo system (one bit dac was an advertised feature for cd players back in the day), you are not using it to make an output change on a per cycle basis, but over many pwm cycles. If you think about a square wave being a 50% duty cycle half high, half low, take an average or integral of it and you can sorta visualize that half the time it is above the midway point between the high and low voltages. If you had a pwm output where it was high 3/4ths of the cycle then low 1/4th of the cycle that average is now 3/4ths the difference between the low voltage and the high. If you fed a DC motor or led or something like that you would get what appears to be 3/4ths of the output of what you would have if you had the output set at the high voltage. A 25% high, 75% low would give you 25% of that always on voltage and so on. So yes, PWM is mostly used like a DAC but as a DAC in the sense that it is used to drive motors and backlights and leds and other things that may want to be voltage controlled and somewhere in the system, be it a capacitor that integrates, a motor with physical response time limitations or the human eye that cannot see the led blinking. so mostly used as a DAC and mostly used for motor control are both correct statements. You find them on microcontrollers for that reason, think about the places where you use microcontrollers and you find places where you also want to control something with pwm.
