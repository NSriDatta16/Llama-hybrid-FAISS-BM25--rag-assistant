js. scripts are not included into Drupal

For some reason one of my Drupal installations doesn't include jquery.js automatically. The most strage thing is that on local hosting all themes include jquery, but on remote hosting the theme I am using - wabi - for some reason doesn't include jquery, and as I see, $scripts variable in page.tpl.php is empty. My initial expectation was this code to appear automatically : How can I find out the reason why jquery is not included? Is it some settings?
