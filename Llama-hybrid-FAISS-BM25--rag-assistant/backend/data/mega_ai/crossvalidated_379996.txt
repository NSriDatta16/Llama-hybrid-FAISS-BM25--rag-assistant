Most statistics in which you test your sample parameter estimate against the population parameter assume that the values of the population are unknown. That is why a sample is taken. You test whether the sampled parameter is significantly different from zero by using a one-sample t-test. https://www.statisticssolutions.com/manova-analysis-one-sample-t-test/ You substract from your sample mean the population mean. As already said in real-life application the population mean is not known and usually a guess based on theory or previous research is used. In your case, the population is known and renders the estimation through a sample obsolete. However to test whether your sample mean differs from the population mean you can just simply use the same one-sample t-test. In R the code is t.test (a, mu) where a is the vector containing the sample values and mu is the population average. @Sal commented that an issue of independence arises because you would compare a group to a subgroup of that group which would violate the assumption of independence. This would only apply to a two-sample t-test. ut because you exercise specifically states that the group is defined as the population this is not an issue and a two-sample t-test is not an appropriate test for your question
