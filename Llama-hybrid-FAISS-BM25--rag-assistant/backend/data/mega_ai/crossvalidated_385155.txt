The first formula is not more or less the same with the second one. Just substitute a few values, you'll see the difference. Or, you might set $n_1=n_2$ , choose them very large etc. you will obtain very different results. For the second one, the intuition is very simple. For the sake of simplicity assume we have $n_i$ instead of $n_i-1$ , which comes due to Bessel's correction . What you do is just weighted averaging based on how many samples each set has, i.e. $s_1^2\frac{n_1}{n_1+n_2}+s_2^2\frac{n_2}{n_1+n_2}$ .
