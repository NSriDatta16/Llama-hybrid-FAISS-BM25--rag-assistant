Why does my OpenGL Phong shader behave like a flat shader?

I've been learning OpenGL for the past couple of weeks and I've run into some trouble implementing a Phong shader. It appears to do no interpolation between vertexes despite my use of the smooth qualifier. Am I missing something here? To give credit where credit is due, the code for the vertex and fragment shaders cribs heavily from the OpenGL SuperBible Fifth Edition. I would highly recommend this book! Vertex Shader: #version 330 in vec4 vVertex; in vec3 vNormal; uniform mat4 mvpMatrix; // mvp = ModelViewProjection uniform mat4 mvMatrix; // mv = ModelView uniform mat3 normalMatrix; uniform vec3 vLightPosition; smooth out vec3 vVaryingNormal; smooth out vec3 vVaryingLightDir; void main(void) { vVaryingNormal = normalMatrix * vNormal; vec4 vPosition4 = mvMatrix * vVertex; vec3 vPosition3 = vPosition4.xyz / vPosition4.w; vVaryingLightDir = normalize(vLightPosition - vPosition3); gl_Position = mvpMatrix * vVertex; } Fragment Shader: #version 330 out vec4 vFragColor; uniform vec4 ambientColor; uniform vec4 diffuseColor; uniform vec4 specularColor; smooth in vec3 vVaryingNormal; smooth in vec3 vVaryingLightDir; void main(void) { float diff = max(0.0, dot(normalize(vVaryingNormal), normalize(vVaryingLightDir))); vFragColor = diff * diffuseColor; vFragColor += ambientColor; vec3 vReflection = normalize(reflect(-normalize(vVaryingLightDir),normalize(vVaryingNormal))); float spec = max(0.0, dot(normalize(vVaryingNormal), vReflection)); if(diff != 0) { float fSpec = pow(spec, 32.0); vFragColor.rgb += vec3(fSpec, fSpec, fSpec); } } This (public domain) image from Wikipedia shows exactly what sort of image I'm getting and what I'm aiming for -- I'm getting the "flat" image but I want the "Phong" image. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you! edit: If it makes a difference, I'm using PyOpenGL 3.0.1 and Python 2.6. edit2: Solution It turns out the problem was with my geometry; Kos was correct. For anyone else that's having this problem with Blender models, Kos pointed out that doing Edit->Faces->Set Smooth does the trick. I found that Wings 3D worked "out of the box."
