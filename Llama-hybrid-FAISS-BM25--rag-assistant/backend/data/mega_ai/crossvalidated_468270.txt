My suggestion, an exploratory analysis: Step 1: Normalize the data. For example, from the population of scores by country, sample (with replacement) 12 scores from the same country and compute their average score. Repeat the process to generate a set of approximately normalized score values by country. Basis, the average of 12 random deviates, even from a Uniform distribution, will approximate a normal distribution (source, see discussion/graphs here ). Step 2: Apply Factor Analysis. I would expect if a country is distinct, it may be isolated into a separate factor. If so, create a dummy variable for that country (or countries) and proceed with your data modeling. [EDIT] If you have data access issues, like only the categories percent distributions, try employing a Kolmogorovâ€“Smirnov statistic against a selective reference grouping. See Wikipedia discussion here .
