Here's a recent post at SO on wind turbines. My answer on that link has three links that you might be interested in: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4843194/r-language-sorting-data-into-ranges-averaging-ignore-outliers/4844783#4844783 I just checked one of the Weibull links in the above SO answer. For some reason, the link is down. Here are some links that provide the same basic information: http://www.gso.uri.edu/ozone/ http://www.weru.ksu.edu/new_weru/publications/pdf/Comparison%20of%20the%20Weibull%20model%20with%20measured%20wind%20speed%20distributions%20for%20stochastic%20wind%20genera.pdf http://www.kfupm.edu.sa/ri/publication/cer/41_JP_Weibull_parameters_for_wind_speed_distribution_in_Saudi_Arabia.pdf http://journal.dogus.edu.tr/13026739/2008/cilt9/sayi1/M00195.pdf http://www.eurojournals.com/ejsr_26_1_01.pdf Also, from the power generated from wind, the seasonality is obvious.
