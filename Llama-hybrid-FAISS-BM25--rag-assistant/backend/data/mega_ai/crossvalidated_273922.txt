What concepts in optimization do I need for machine learning?

I am a Math/CS dual major. As part of my math major, I have the option of taking optimization and mathematical programming classes. I am also interested in machine learning. I know that a lot of machine learning algorithms are theoretically grounded in optimization techniques. I have to decide which optimization classes to take. What optimization concepts should I make sure I cover? Some examples of topics in the classes: gradient descent, conjugate gradient descent, BFGS, KKT, simplex method, ellipsoid method, golden section, knapsack problems, SDP, SOCP, Barrier methods, Mehrotra Predictor-Corrector. What topics do I need to know? Could someone answer? I need to choose classes relatively soon.
