Modern browsers have decided that local files ("file://" URLs, in other words) are not all to be considered members of a common "domain", at least for some purposes. Chrome seems to be the strictest, but maybe in the HTML5 features Firefox is also as strict. It kind-of makes sense: if somebody invents some kind of TiddlyWiki-like tool that uses HTML5 storage, you wouldn't want its stuff to be available to some random other HTML file you download for totally unrelated reasons.
