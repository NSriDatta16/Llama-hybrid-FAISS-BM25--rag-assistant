Source Control folder organisation for distributed team

Our team is distributed across two geographic locations. We share and use similar scripts for the automation of different tests we perform. We have recently decided to use source control to manage the different scripts that are being used. So far whatever scripts we generated was shared across to the other location, they would make minor local modification appropriate to their needs and use it. That is we would be using the same version of the script with few minor modification specific to our local setup. How best to organise this in a source control. We are planning to use Subversion with the repository duplicated across the two location. One solution I was thinking was making two folders one for each location. Thus any scripts they upload, we will copy to our own directory and make local modification. Any other suggestions? Thanks...
