BTW, iOS does offer custom ttf font support. You drag the fonts into your resources folder, and put a UIAppFonts array key in your info.plist, with the names of the font files. You don't get IB integration but you can call [UIFont fontWithName:@"MyFontName" size:mysize]; where the name is the name of the font as seen when you open the ttf font viewer on the .ttf file. iOS also does offer shadowOffsets on labels. But certainly, such a highly custom look is mostly likely done with images.
