How best to describe a model's predictions in terms of the input variables depends on the model. In the case of linear regression, for example, this question is directly answered by the coefficients. Neural networks, by contrast, tend to be black boxes with no easy way to see how the input relates to the output. A model-independent way to approach this question is the experimental approach of asking the model to make predictions for fake data you've made in which you vary a single input variable of interest.
