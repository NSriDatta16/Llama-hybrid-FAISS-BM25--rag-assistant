jquery cancelling select event

Whenever the user does a mousedown on an HTML document and drags the mouse before he releases the button, the content he's moving over becomes selected. I'm creating a jquery slider and I'd like to cancel this event so that when the user drags his mouse with the mouse down over when the mouse is over text, the text isn't selected. This example works: http://www.filamentgroup.com/examples/slider/index2.php If you start the mousedown when the cursor is over the "This is an example from the..." text, the text is selected. However, if you start the mousedown when the cursor is over the scroll elevator and then move the mouse over the "This is an example from the..." text, the text is NOT selected while you're moving the cursor over the text . How did they cancel the selection of the text? Thanks.
