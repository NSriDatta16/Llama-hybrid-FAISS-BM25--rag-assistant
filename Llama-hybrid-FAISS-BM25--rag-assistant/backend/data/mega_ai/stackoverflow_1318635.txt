Drag Table Rows in jQuery

Using jQuery (and UI), I want to be able to drag table rows out of the table and drop them on some element. The rows themselves should not leave the table, similar to how iTunes works when dragging multiple selected songs. I need to use a table since this is tabular data and I already have a table sort plugin in place. Any idea how to achieve this?
