OpenNLP parser training

I've tried asking this before on the OpenNLP sourceforge page, but it is still sadly languishing in the Help forums: I have a treebank and I would like to train a model based on it. There was some code lying around using ParserME but that class doesn't seem to exist anymore. It looks like its been possibly replaced by TreebankParser but I can't seem to find any train tools in there. Is there a way of doing this? Any hints welcome
