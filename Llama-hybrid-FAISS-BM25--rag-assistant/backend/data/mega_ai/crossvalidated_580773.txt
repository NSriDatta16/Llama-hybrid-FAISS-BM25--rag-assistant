If you have so little data then you could use multiple graphs or sparklines to display the data all at once. Possibly you could also find out some clusters and order the participant according to these clusters. In the comments a suggestion came up to plot the curves on top of each other (with some jittering to have them not exactly on top of each other) and use colour coding to make differences clear. I tried to do that, but the lines do not stand out much from each other. There are also no clear clusters with a similar pattern that could be made more clear in that way. Such plotting on top of each other could be worthwhile if you have more curves and the colour coding can help to highlight specific cases or groups. An example is And in another question ( How to plot trends properly ) similar curves appeared. In those cases the data are time series and there is more structure on the data with peaks and parts that are specific to some but not all.
