Moment Conditions for Stochastic Discount Factor (SDF)

Following extract has been taken from Computing Generalized Method of Moments and Generalized Empirical Likelihood with R , the Vignette of gmm R package. In some cases the theory is directly based on moment conditions. When it is the case, testing the validity of these conditions becomes a way of testing the theory. Jagannathan et al. (2002) present several GMM applications in finance and one of them is the stochastic discount factor (SDF) representation of the CAPM. The general theory implies that $\mathbb{E}\left(m_{t}R_{it}\right)=1$ for all $i$, where $m_{t}$ is the SDF and $R_{it}$ is the gross return $\left(1+r_{it}\right)$. It can be shown that if the CAPM holds, $m_{t}=\theta_{0}+\theta_{1}R_{mt}$ which implies the following moment conditions: $$ \mathbb{E}\left[R_{it}\left(\theta_{0}-\theta_{1}R_{mt}\right)-1\right]=0~~\mbox{for}~~i=1,...,N. $$ which can be tested as follows: g5 I wonder how the moment conditions are obtained and how they are coded in R. Any help will be highly appreciated. Thanks in advance for your help.
