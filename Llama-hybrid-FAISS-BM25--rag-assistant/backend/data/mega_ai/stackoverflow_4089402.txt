This is a case where the phrase " Composition over Inheritence" actually fits... I would create an interface that combines the functionality of both classes that I want to fit. I would then create a class that implements my new interface. That class would contain an instance of both ModalWindow and SkinnableWindow. Depending on what functionality is called, my class would simply pass the method call on to the appropriate class, leverage each class' functionality when needed.
