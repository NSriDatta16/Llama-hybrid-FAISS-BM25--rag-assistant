Lua: How to reference a lua method inside a lua class from C for later use?

I get a reference to a lua method which is inside a class with the funcion luaL_ref. When I want to call that method I use the function lua_rawgeti to push the function into the stack and then I use lua_pcall to actually call the method.Everithing works fine except that I cannot acces other class members from the method because self is nil. Does anyone know how can I fix this ? Thank you!
