Yes. The predicted probability vector $p$ from logistic regression satisfies the matrix equation $$ X^t(p - y) = 0$$ Where $X$ is the design matrix and $y$ is the response vector. This can be viewed as a collection of linear equations, one arising from each column of the design matrix $X$. Specializing to the intercept column (which is a row in the transposed matrix), the associated linear equation is $$ \sum_i( p_i - y_i) = 0 $$ so the overall average predicted probability is equal to the average of the response. More generally, for a binary feature column $x_{ij}$, the associated linear equation is $$ \sum_i x_{ij}(p_i - y_i) = \sum_{i \mid x_{ij} = 1}(p_i - y_i) = 0$$ so the sum (and hence average) of the predicted probabilities equals the sum of the response, even when specializing to those records for which $x_{ij} = 1$.
