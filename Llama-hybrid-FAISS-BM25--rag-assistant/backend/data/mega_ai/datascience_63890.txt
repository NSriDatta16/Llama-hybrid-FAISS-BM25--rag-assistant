what do you mean "outliers"? if you mean new behavior based on numbers then just go row by row, see if new observation is in some safe bounds based on historical data and update these bounds based on new observations (because trades volume may increase over time and you would like to take that into account), maybe some RNN would learn pattern of behavior, or you can look into some solutions of Kaggle contests where target was to identify suspicious behavior
