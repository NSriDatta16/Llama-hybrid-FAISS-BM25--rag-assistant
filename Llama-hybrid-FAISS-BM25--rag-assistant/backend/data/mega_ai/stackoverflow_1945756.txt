Embedding literal strings in Perl source code is easy. Use the utf8 pragma. ( Do not use the encoding pragma , it is highly problematic.) use utf8; my $perl_string = '你好，张ＨＹ'; Your text editor must save this file as UTF-8, too. Then, if you want to output Perl strings, you must encode them first, see perlunitut and perlunifaq . use Encode qw(encode); use Encode::HanExtra; # for example, printing to STDOUT print encode('UTF-8', $perl_string); # in a Linux environment print encode('GB18030', $perl_string); # in a Windows environment I also want to advise you that since the year 2006 support for the national standard GB18030 is mandatory for all software products in the PRC - you have to install Encode::HanExtra from CPAN.
