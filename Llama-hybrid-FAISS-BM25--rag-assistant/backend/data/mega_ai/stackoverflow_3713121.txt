You're overthinking this. While Apple does discourage the beginAnimations:context: methods in iOS 4, they provided a WONDERFUL new way to do this that is even easier than before. It's still part of the UIView class, it just uses a great new feature provided with the update: blocks. In fact, Apple even encourage using block-based animations instead. Taken from the UIView class reference: "Use of this method is discouraged in iOS 4.0 and later. You should use the block-based animation methods instead." Block-based animations are really simple to use. They take the form of the following: [UIView animateWithDuration:5 animations:^{ self.yourView.frame = CGRectMake(100, 100, 100, 200); self.yourView.alpha = 0.3; } completion:^(BOOL finished){ self.yourView.alpha = 1.0; [self.yourProperty doSomethingReallyCool]; } ]; Look familiar? It's very similar to the beginAnimations:context: method. The little ^{} section is the block. Blocks maintain state, so they work pretty well for this kind of thing. For more information about blocks, check out http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/Blocks/Articles/00_Introduction.html . Make sure you view the UIView class reference located here . There are a number of new block-based animation methods. Also, it's worth noting that block are iOS 4 only. So, provided back-up code for SDK 3 or lower devices. Or, just keep using beginAnimations:context: for now, but be aware its days are numbered.
