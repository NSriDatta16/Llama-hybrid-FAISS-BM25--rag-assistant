Well, I think XQuery is something worth to be distinguished. XPath and XPointer are almost the same and are used for XML nodes selection. XQuery on the other hand is quite a big extension of XPath. For example it gives possibility of declaring custom functions. So it's more something like programming language, which works natively with XML. You can check out some samples here: embedding-xquery-in-java Regards
