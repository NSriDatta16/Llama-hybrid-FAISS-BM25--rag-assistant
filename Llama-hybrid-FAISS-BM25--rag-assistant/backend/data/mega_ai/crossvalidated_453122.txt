How to interpret coefficient of continuous predictor in logistic regression?

I have the following logistic regression in R: glm(FundingSuccess ~ FundingGoal+ VentureTeamDiversity, data = df, family = "binomial") The VentureTeamDiversity variable is a Blau diversity index that ranges from 0 to 1. The regression coefficient of VentureTeamDiversity is 4.75 (p VentureTeamDiversity by 10 percent affect the probability of successful funding (holding FundingGoal constant).
