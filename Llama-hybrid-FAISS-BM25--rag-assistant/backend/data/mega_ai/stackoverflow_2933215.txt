If you really think this will be a memory issue, store an NSNumber attribute for the Foundation double type NSTimeInterval , the value for which is derived from NSDate methods that measure the number of seconds since the epoch. You'll trade memory savings for a performance hit, especially if you have to do a lot of conversion between the time interval's object representation and NSDate objects, but that's one option. Another is to just use NSDate and see if you actually run into memory issues. My suspicion is that you won't. If you do all the Core Data tricks that Apple recommends, you'll be faulting data, among other things. What this means is that your app will do as little actual data retrieval as necessary, until the app actually does need the data.
