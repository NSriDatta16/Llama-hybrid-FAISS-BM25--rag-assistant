non-standard find method

Usually when you call root.find('.test') , it'll return all elements with test class inside root . Is there any way to consider root as possible candidate too? In other words, with html , $('#x').find('.test') would return 1 element instead of zero. If we generalize it, in expression root.find('condition1 condition2 condition3') I would like condition1 to be tested against root also. I'm considering creating a custom helper method, but maybe there's something more elegant. Thanks!
