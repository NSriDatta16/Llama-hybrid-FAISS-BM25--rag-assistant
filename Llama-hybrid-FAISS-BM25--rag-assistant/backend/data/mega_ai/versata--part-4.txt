. This became a set of lawsuits centered around cross-border insolvency. The next month, Versata FZ-LLC (ESW Capital's business unit related to Versata in the US, but organized in a Dubai free-trade zone) entered into a licensing agreement with Think3, giving Versata FZ-LLC the rights to the intellectual property (IP). In March 2011, several creditors began insolvency proceedings against Think3 and its Italian subsidiary and the next month they were declared bankrupt in an Italian court and the court appointed a trustee to look after the interest of Italian creditors. The trustee terminated the license agreement with Versata FZ-LLC and claimed that the Italian subsidiary still owned the IP. Versata maintained that they bought the IP when the bought Think3, Inc., the US parent company. In May 2011, the US Think3 filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in an American court. The debt continued to balloon, the assets were worth less than $10 million, and Think3 had no US employees. The Italian court ordered Versata-FZ-LLC to stop using the Think3 trademark. The US bankruptcy court ruled that US law applied. The people at the Italian subsidiary formed DPTLab S.R.L. and make a software named ThinkDesign. Versata uses the Think3 name for their Mergers & Acquisitions division, and continue the software rebranded as SmartForm Design's SmartForm Engineering MCAD and SmartForm PLM. Trade secrets case with Ford Like the legal disputes with Selectica and SAP, Versata's dispute with Ford Motor Company was rooted in the software Trilogy created before it acquired Versata. In 1998, Ford licensed Trilogy's Automotive Configuration Manager (ACM) to manage configuring vehicle models, signing and renewing a legal contract outlining the terms of the subscription multiple times from 2004 through 2014. Ford created a proprietary software to do the same thing, called Product Definition Optimization (PDO) and in 2014 they discontinued their subscription for ACM to use their own PDO. Versata believed that Ford's PDO used elements of the ACM software and in February 2015 they sued Ford for trade secret misappropriation, breach of contract, and patent infringement. Versata asked for $1.4 billion in damages. In October 2022, a jury agreed with Versata and awarded them $105 million in damages. In May 2023, a judge reviewed the case and made a judgment as a matter of law (JMOL) ruling. That is, the judge decided that no reasonable jury would reach the verdict they did based on the evidence presented during the trial, and so he threw out the jury's verdict in favor of Ford. He reduced the award to just $3. == References ==
