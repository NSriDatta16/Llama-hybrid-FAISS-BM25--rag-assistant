In what situations would cross validations scores be inaccurate?

I'm trying to fit a SVM model on times series stock return data, predicting a buy, hold, or sell signal of the stock. I'm using 10-fold cross validation (using the R package caret ), and I'm getting very high precision and recall scores. However, when I test the model on a new sample the performance is much worse (i.e. 40% precision in new sample vs 80% precision in 10-fold cv). I thought that the cv process would prevent overfitting, but the results suggest otherwise. Can anyone provide some thought as to what might be going on here and some ways to deal with this? Thank you!!
