Preserving the most important features of the data is indeed the point of dimensionality reduction. Simplifying data allows you to plot them nicely in a 2D or 3D space, but you also have other possible applications: PCA allows to identify strongly correlated observations, and hence to reduce redundancy in data; it saves computation time while running a leaning algo on your data; you can also see it as a noise reduction technique. For more details, I strongly recommend Andrew Ng's lecture notes on PCA , which are very concise and simple.
