It's not clear what you mean by "clustering" but it seems like you're interested in the number of co-occurring symptoms. In that case, one simple model would be to just count the number of symptoms, and model this count as a function of A. Then you end up with four classes of patients that can be analyzed with multinomial logistic regression with one input, A. In your question you implicitly assume that symptoms appear independently. I don't think that's a good assumption, but if you think it's plausible you can also use binomial regression with 3 "trials" (or "size" of 4 or just k=4 depending on who you ask) since you have one trial representing each symptom.
