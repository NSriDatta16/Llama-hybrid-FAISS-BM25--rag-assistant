The statements made in your first code chunk are all correct. char **char_ptrs = new char *[50]; ...means you have an array of 50 char * s. Your assesment of char_ptrs[0] = new char[20]; node_ptrs[0] = new Node; is correct as well. ** simply means a 'pointer to a pointer'. It's not an operator. When you write new char *[50]; ...you are saying 'allocate storage for 50 char * s'.
