Integrating Events into Wordpress

I'm in the process of developing a website for a not-for-profit organization, and I thought that Wordpress would be a great tool to use as the base CMS for the site. Building the site into Wordpress has not been a problem, but I have been having a difficult time finding a plugin to use to help them organize and advertise upcoming Events. Currently, they use Google Calendar, but are trying to move to something that integrates more cleanly into their site. Essentially, I need a Wordpress events/calendar plugin with these features: + Add reoccurring events with start and end time + Each event should have its own page (reoccurring events should be shown as a single page) + Display all events in a mini-calendar and a full calendar/list view It would also be nice to have these features: * Ability to categorize/tag events * Ability to add a picture to go with the event I'm indifferent on these features: - Being able to RSVP - Paying for events - Import/Export calendars There are many Events/Calendar plugins out there for Wordpress, but I can't seem to decide which one is worth me spending time to use for this website. Any suggestions?
