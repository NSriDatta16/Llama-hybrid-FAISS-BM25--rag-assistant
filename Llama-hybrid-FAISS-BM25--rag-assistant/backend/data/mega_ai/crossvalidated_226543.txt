Ground Truth vs Labels in LSTM classifications

In many papers and articles related to Recurrent Neural networks(RNN) with specific (LSTM)Long short term memory technique I have seen that in training phase labels and ground truth data are fed with the input data.Whereas In most of the classification techique only the labels are required with the data in the training phase. Please help me understand why we need both labels and ground truth in training phase. Reference LSTM Paper
