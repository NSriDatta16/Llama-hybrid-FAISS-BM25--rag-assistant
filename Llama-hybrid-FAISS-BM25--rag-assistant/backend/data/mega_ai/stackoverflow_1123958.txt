Get a random subset from a set in F#

I am trying to think of an elegant way of getting a random subset from a set in F# Any thoughts on this? Perhaps this would work: say we have a set of 2 x elements and we need to pick a subset of y elements. Then if we could generate an x sized bit random number that contains exactly y 2 n powers we effectively have a random mask with y holes in it. We could keep generating new random numbers until we get the first one satisfying this constraint but is there a better way?
