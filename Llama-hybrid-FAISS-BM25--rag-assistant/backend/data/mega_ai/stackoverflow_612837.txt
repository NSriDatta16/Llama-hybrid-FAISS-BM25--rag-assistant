The partial keyword is typically used in code generation utilities to allow developers to add additional functionality to the generated code without the fear of that code being erased if the code is generated again. With C# 3 the partial keyword can be applied to methods to allow users of generated code to fill in blanks left by the generator. The Linq To Sql designer for example provides partial methods that allow you to add logic to the classes that the framework will call if implemented. The benefit here is that the C# compiler will completely remove unimplemented partial methods, so there is no performance hit at all for not implementing them. Partial classes can also be used to organize very large classes into separate code files, although this sort of usage is usually a sign that your classes are too large and are taking on too many responsibilities.
