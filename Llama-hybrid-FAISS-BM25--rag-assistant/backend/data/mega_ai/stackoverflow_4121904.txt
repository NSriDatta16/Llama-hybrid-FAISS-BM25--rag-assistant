Midas is the easiest way to do it, but it isn't free. (It's more than worth the money in overall time saved, but if your organisation is anything like the ones I've worked for, the entire cost of the tool is going to be foisted off on the billing unit that owns the current project, rather than have it amortized over the entire org, and they're likely to change their requirements before agreeing to the cost.) There is another approach, and that's to export the database to DXL (Domino XML) using the export option ConvertNotesBitmapToGIF. The images will turn up in the XML as elements with the data Base64-encoded. If you're operating entirely within the Notes environment, you'll need to create a temporary document with a rich text field used as a NotesMIMEEntity to transform the encoded picture to binary before streaming it to a file (using NotesStream). All of this assumes that you are working with version 6 or higher; if you are on R5 or earlier, Midas or directly accessing the CD records using the C API are the only way to fly.
