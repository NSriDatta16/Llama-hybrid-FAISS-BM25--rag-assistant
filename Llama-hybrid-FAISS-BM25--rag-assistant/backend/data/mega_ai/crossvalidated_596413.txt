Do you use the PC1, PC2, PC3 or do you use PCA for feature selection in supervised learning?

My goal is to understand what is PCA for in supervised learning. Do we use the PC1, PC2, PC3 to the supervised learning? Do we use the generated labels to the supervised learning? If we use the PC1, PC2, PC3 and/or generated labels, do we use the original numerical features in supervised learning? What I understand is that: PCA generates PC1, PC2, PC3, ... (and so on). The goal of PCA is to reduce the numerical features i.e 17 features to just 2-3 PC (PC1, PC2, PC3) to explain the variations. In every PC we get the loading score to see which features have the most importance to explain the variations. I use PCA for unsupervised learning, ie to label customer segmentation. We use these PC1, PC2, PC3 to KMeans, DBSCAN, AgglomerativeClustering, and so on to generate labels.
