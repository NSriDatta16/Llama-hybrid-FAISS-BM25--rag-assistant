Get drag event from flash object in javascript?

I'm trying to make a draggable instance of FlowPlayer using jQuery, but I can't get any mouse events to work over the Flash object. If wmode is 'opaque' or 'window' I only have mouse events working inside the flash object, whereas with wmode set to 'transparent' I get the mouse events in jQuery but not in the flash object...does anyone know if there is a way to have mouse events working in both?
