Q1: I suppose you're not asking whether the variable names have anything to do with imputation. I suppose you're asking whether to do multiple imputation on your raw data or on "scales" which means sum scores of raw data variables which are assumed to measure the same construct. Given that you are concerned about the right method (which is good), well, then how do you want to compute scale scores before you do anything about the missing data? Answer: you need to work with your raw data. Q2: Multiple imputation works by estimating missing values from values of the other variables in your data set (this being a non-technical explanation). So it does not matter if you recode your variables or not, if by recoding you mean changing the sign of the relation from one var to the other variables. Still I would recommend recoding before the imputation so that you don't get confused afterwards. Q3: I don't know why AMOS does not calculate estimates. I don't really know AMOS, but the user guide seems to say it should be able to calculate estimates for multiply imputated data sets. But there is a general answer anyway: The whole point of multiple imputation is that you get point estimates but also incorporate the additional variation introduced by the imputation process. This means: You should not use a single "averaged" data set. Instead you work with all of your imputed data sets. First, you get point estimates for your model parameters by running your model (I suppose a structural equation model) for each of the data sets and taking the mean of the point estimates, and then you compute standard errors by combining between-imputation variance (variance of the parameter estimates between imputed data sets) with within-imputation variance (mean of the estimated standard errors from the different models). See any text on multiple imputation. A short and freely available tutorial is here: http://rhowell.ba.ttu.edu/Enders-MissingHancock.pdf
