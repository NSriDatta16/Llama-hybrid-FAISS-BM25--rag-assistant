Neural networks used in Reinforcement learning (RL) models can be evaluated by amount of reward over time. A neural network that accumulates more reward is better than another neural network that accumulates less reward in the same amount of time. The process of experimenting and improving neural networks for RL can often take longer because the learning process for RL is typically longer.
