What's the trick to display a text from MySql/PHP back to its original HTML layout?

It still keeps the original text layout (I mean the spacing, offsets, new line, paragraphs) while the text fragment is stored in MySql ('text' type) field - I can tell when I peer into it in my DB browser (Adminer:) but it gets lost when I output it from the DB: it becomes a single line string of my text characters. How can one restore it its original layout? I've tried to reshape the text fragment using the PHP nl2br() function with some success: it brought back the newline breaks, but the text words positioning is not kept, everything shifts to the left. Thanks in advance for a good idea.
