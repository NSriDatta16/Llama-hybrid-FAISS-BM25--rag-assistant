Can I use Magento without the sales features? Or am I better off with a scratch build?

I have a site build which would seem to suit Magento up to a point, but the client doesn't actually want to sell anything - at the end of the process of choosing a product the user would simply be redirected to another site to complete the transaction (or not). I would like to avoid just hacking these features out of Magento entirely so we can upgrade the site as automatic updates come out... Anyone done anything like this before? Or would the resident gurus recommend a more 'from-scratch' build recreating the necessary features? Sorry, I should have made it clear, I am the developer. I'm familiar with writing modules/plugins/themes for other platforms - Wordpress and Drupal for example - specifically so my clients have a 'pure' core structure which can be upgraded in the usual way... But not everything has a hook just where you want it... There's only so much you can do with Wordpress (for example) until it departs so far from what the platform was designed for that you have no choice but to hack the core. So I guess I'm asking - does Magento have all the right hooks? Has anyone actually tried to do this? Will it be as simple as: add_listener('checkout', my_func_without_checkout); my_func_without_checkout() { stuff... } Or is the transaction processing functionality so tightly integrated that it will be difficult to remove entirely?
