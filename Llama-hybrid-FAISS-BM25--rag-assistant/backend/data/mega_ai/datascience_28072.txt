TL;DR: It depends on who is asking. The answer to this question depends largely on the expectations, knowledge, and experience of whomever is asking. An analogous question with just as fuzzy of an answer is: What is the difference between a software developer, a software engineer, and a computer scientist? To some people, particularly people who study or teach computer science and software engineering, there is a large and defined difference between these fields. But to the average HR worker, technical recruiter, or manager, these are all just "Computer People". I love this quote by Vincent Granville , emphasis mine: Earlier in my career (circa 1990) I worked on image remote sensing technology, among other things to identify patterns (or shapes or features, for instance lakes) in satellite images and to perform image segmentation: at that time my research was labeled as computational statistics, but the people doing the exact same thing in the computer science department next door in my home university, called their research artificial intelligence. Today, it would be called data science or artificial intelligence, the sub-domains being signal processing, computer vision or IoT.
