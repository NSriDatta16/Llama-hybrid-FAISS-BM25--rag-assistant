Enable drag&drop from explorer to Run-As-Administrator application

I built a winforms application, and implemented drag&drop functionality. this functionality works great in WinXP or in Win7 from Run-As-Administrator applications. The problems become when tring to drag from non-admin application in Win7 to my program, it just not working. I understand this because the OS filtering the messages. I found a solution for that here: http://blog.helgeklein.com/2010/03/how-to-enable-drag-and-drop-for.html but it does not seems to work. here is the workaround code: [DllImport("user32.dll", SetLastError = true)] static extern bool ChangeWindowMessageFilter(uint message, uint dwFlag); private const uint WM_DROPFILES = 0x233; private const uint WM_COPYDATA = 0x004A; private const uint WM_COPYGLOBALDATA = 0x0049; private const uint MSGFLT_ADD = 1; ChangeWindowMessageFilter(WM_DROPFILES, MSGFLT_ADD); ChangeWindowMessageFilter(WM_COPYDATA, MSGFLT_ADD); ChangeWindowMessageFilter(WM_COPYGLOBALDATA, MSGFLT_ADD); How to make it work?
