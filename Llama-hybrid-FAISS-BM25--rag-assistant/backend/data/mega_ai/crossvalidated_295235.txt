To answer your question on how to construct the $F$ statistic from the sum of squared residuals in this case: $F = \frac{ \left. \left[ RSS_{1+2} - \left( RSS_{1} + RSS_{2} \right) \right] \right/ k }{ \left. \left( RSS_{1} + RSS_{2} \right) \right/ \left( n_{1} + n_{2} - 2k \right) }$ where $RSS_{1+2}$ is the sum of squared residuals over the entire time series, $RSS_{1}$ and $RSS_{2}$ are from the upper and lower half, $n_{1}$ and $n_{2}$ are the number of observations in those halves, and $k$ is the number of parameters estimated (I assume this number is equal for both halves). This statistic has an $F_{k,\left( n_{1} + n_{2} - 2k \right)}$ distribution. As glen_b has pointed out though, this statistic is sensitive to serial correlation and non-normality. In fact, the F ratio only has a small-sample F distribution if the population error follows a normal distribution, see Hayashi's proposition 1.4 .
