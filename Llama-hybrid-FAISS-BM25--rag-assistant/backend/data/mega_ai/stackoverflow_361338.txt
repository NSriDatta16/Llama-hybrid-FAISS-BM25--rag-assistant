It's going to be different depending on the library and organization. For the developer utility library I'm building, for example, I'm including friendly wrapper modules for various conventions in the style of the convention. So, for example, the MFC wrapper module uses the 'm_typeMemberVariable' notation for members, whereas the STL wrapper module uses 'member_variable'. I'm trying to build it so that whatever front-end is used will have the style typical for that type of front-end. The problem with having a universal style is that everyone would have to agree, and (for example) for every person who detests Hungarian notation, there's someone else who thinks not using Hungarian notation detracts from the basic value of comprehensibility of the code. So it's unlikely there will be a universal standard for C++ any time soon.
