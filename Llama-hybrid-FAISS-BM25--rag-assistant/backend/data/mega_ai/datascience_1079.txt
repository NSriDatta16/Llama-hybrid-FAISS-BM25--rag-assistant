Data sets for evaluating text retrieval quality

I'm searching for data sets for evaluating text retrieval quality. TF-IDF is a popular similarity measure, but is it the best choice? And which variant is the best choice? Lucenes Scoring for example uses IDF^2, and IDF defined as 1+log(numdocs/(docFreq+1)). TF in lucene is defined as sqrt(frequency)... Many more variants exist, including Okapi BM25 , which is used by the Xapian search engine ... I'd like to study the different variants, and I'm looking for evaluation data sets . Thanks!
