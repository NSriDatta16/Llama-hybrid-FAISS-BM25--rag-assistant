wpa_supplicant / wpa_cli not able to detect wrong key of access point

I am developing a handheld device based on IMX233 running embedded linux and is using Unifi CSR6026 for connecting to the WiFi networks. I have got the basic WiFi connectivity running using the wpa_supplicant and wpa_cli utilities. But i'm not able to detect when the user has entered a wrong key for the access point. The 'wpa_cli status' shows 'wpa_state=COMPLETED' and the iwconfig also returns the correct ESSID and MAC address of the access point as currently connected. Is there any other way to find out whether the user has entered a wrong key or not ?? root@freescale ~$ wpa_cli status Selected interface 'eth0' bssid=00:24:01:6a:3f:26 ssid=FirstFloorBGN id=1 pairwise_cipher=WEP-40 group_cipher=WEP-40 key_mgmt=NONE wpa_state=COMPLETED root@freescale ~$ iwconfig lo no wireless extensionsunifi1: unifi_giwencode: Surprise, do not have a valid key index (0) . eth0 IEEE 802.11-b/g ESSID:"FirstFloorBGN" Mode:Managed Frequency:2.422 GHz Access Point: 00:24:01:6A:3F:26 Bit Rate=24 Mb/s RTS thr=0 B Fragment thr:off Encryption key:off Power Management period:500ms mode:All packets received Link Quality=25/40 Signal level=-47 dBm Noise level=-72 dBm Rx invalid nwid:0 Rx invalid crypt:0 Rx invalid frag:0 Tx excessive retries:0 Invalid misc:0 Missed beacon:0
