If the Visual Studio editor works fine for you, there is no point in switching. And if you don't like WYSIWIG editing, then there's no point in learning it. I stopped using WYSIWIG years ago, and like you, I've found it to be much more flexible and reliable to edit HTML/CSS by hand. If you like DreamWeaver more and the organisation is willing to pay for it, then go for it!
