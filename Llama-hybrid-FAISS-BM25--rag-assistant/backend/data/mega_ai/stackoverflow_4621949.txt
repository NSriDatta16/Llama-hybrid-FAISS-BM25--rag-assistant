After looking over the factory_girl documentation again, I realized that you can specify a class using either a string or a class constant. So I tried using a string and it worked: Factory.define :interest, :class => "Term::Interest" do |f| f.name {"#{Factory.next(:lipsum_word)}ing"} end Also, a comment about the nested classes. I initially did that to keep the classes a little more organized, but given the complexity it's created (especially for routing), I'm just going to move each subclass to its own model file. (If I were to un-nest them without putting them in separate files, rails seems to fail to find the subclasses sometimes--namely if the parent class hadn't been referenced (forcing the load of that file) before.
