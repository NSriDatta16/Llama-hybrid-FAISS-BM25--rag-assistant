The performance may really change. For N Then there are 3 main possibilities on how to arrange the items in the array: sorted is probably the best choice to keep things simple: constant time to determine whether to insert a new item (compare with lowest) O(N) time to insert - but this only happens for items that are in the N best-so-far. And if your input is sufficiently random, the average time will be even lower because most insertions will only move a few elements at the bottom of the top. unsorted: O(N) time for each input element, that's too much compared to "sorted" binary heap that implements a priority queue: more complex to implement but maybe even faster than "sorted" constant time to determine whether to insert a new item (compare with lowest) O(log N) time to insert - and this only happens for items that are in the N best-so-far
