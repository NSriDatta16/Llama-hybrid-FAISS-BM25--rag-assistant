You may consider the response as a sum of random variables, some that can be decomposed into models based on other variables, some that cannot. If you are estimating monthly costs, then you report having a decent model for the covariates you know, and then you may add to this costs that you cannot decompose as a function of other covariates. Some might call this a random effects model. Others may invoke the name of Bayes. I do neither, but acknowledge that some people have these cravings. At an annual level, your estimates may be the sum of the monthly estimates, but I doubt that errors by month are independent of each other. I'll assume you know what to do here. If billing corrections are applied at an annual level, then this is simply a random variable term that you may add to the model, with its own assumptions about its distribution. You may be able to get information from the utility or utility regulator(s) about its past corrections for other large customers (I assume you're a large customer if you have such concern). This may help in deciding on the assumptions for the distribution to use for the random variable for billing corrections. I know this is very general, but it's pragmatic. Just because a random variable isn't decomposed into a model isn't bad - that's real the essence of so-called error terms: those elements of a stochastic phenomenon for which we accept that we cannot model them. It doesn't mean they cannot be modeled, but due to some limitations of our expertise, model, data, and so on, we simply push them into a separate catch-all. We may add some assumptions about them, such as normality (which can and should be tested), but that doesn't mean we've said more or less about them. We might even be more honest about the error term than about the model, because all too often people do not test their model itself, just the residuals.
