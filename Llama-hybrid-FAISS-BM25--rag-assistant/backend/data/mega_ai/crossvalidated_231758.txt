First calculate the temporal distance between each event in x and each event in y . Now you have a list of temporal distances ( diffs in example below). If you bin those temporal distances (with histogram for instance), you can see the cross-correlation between the two time series. function diffs = xcorrTimestamps(x, y) diffs = []; for i = 1:length(x) diffs = [diffs, y-x(i)]; end histogram(diffs)
