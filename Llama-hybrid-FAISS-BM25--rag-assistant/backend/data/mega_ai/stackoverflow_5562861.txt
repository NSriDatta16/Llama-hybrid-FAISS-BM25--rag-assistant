Teamcity agent timeout connecting to CVS

Does anyone know a reason why a Teamcity build agent would timeout when connecting to a successfully tested CVS repository? So, I have a CVS repository (don't ask!) which I'm trying to hook up to a TeamCity build. I've added the VCS root, and pressed the "Test Connection" button and been told "Connection Successful". Yet, when I come to use the VCS root in the build agent I just get a timeout. java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: jetbrains.buildServer.vcs.VcsException: Problem collecting changes for 'TMC :: Map Client' : Error collecting changes for VCS root 'InVehicle\MapClient' java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out The version of TeamCity is the latest one available (6.0), and it's currently running on the Professional License. Our lan has a proxy, but when I put the proxy details into TeamCity I can't connect via the dashboard. The Build Web Server and Build Agent are both on the same machine and they are both running as Local System accounts, so I'm failing to see why one works and the other doesn't.
