Model with 2 datasets: combine time series data and statistics

I am new to data science modelling so apologies if using wrong terminology in advance. I have a standard time series dataset of historical prices which is used to train/test a simple Random Forest classifier model which predicts the returns direction (+/-). I also have a few general statistics for 'day of the week direction' eg. frequency counts: Monday UP=120, Monday DOWN=90, Tuesday UP=67, Tuesday DOWN=50, Friday UP=55, Friday DOWN=181. How can I combine the results from the time series RF model with the bias from the statistics into a new model? eg. give more weight to positive/up predictions on Monday, and more weight to negative/down predictions on Friday?
