If my options where totally open, I'd pick a database tool ( MySQL is overkill, SQLite would be perfect) because the tool can deal with sorting, IO access, file locks (if multiple instances are possible), deleting, defragmenting/cleaning/vacuuming. On the other hand... there's a pair of standards for storing mail: MBOX and maildir ( nice primer here ) which it wouldn't be too hard to adopt into your programme. What of attachments, text encoding and transfer encoding? That's where the real work's going to lie (unless it's out of scope of the assignment).
