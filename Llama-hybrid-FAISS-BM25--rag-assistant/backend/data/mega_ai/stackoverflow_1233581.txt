IMO you should normally only worry about making your public properties/methods testable. I.e. as long as Select(int agentId) works you normally don't care how it does it via GetAgentFromDatabase(int agentId) . What you have seems reasonable, as I imagine it can be tested with something like the following (assuming your class is called AgentRepository) AgentRepository aRepo = new AgentRepository(); int agentId = 1; Agent a = aRepo.Select(agentId); //Check a here As for suggested enhancements. I would recommend allowing the AgentRepository's connection string to be changed, either by public or internal access.
