This is a well-known problem with utilizing the Wald confidence interval for binomial distributions. It's typically referred to as "overshoot." There are many alternative to Wald confidence intervals that avoid overshoot and also have better nominal coverage for binomial distributions. I'd suggest the Wilson score interval but there are other alternatives. This article provides a detailed comparison of the Wald and Wilson score interval. You'll find the relevant formula in the Wikipedia entry as well as lots of references on binomial confidence intervals that you might find helpful.
