I attempted to find a more elegant solution, but the best I could do was basically the same thing that Dyno Fu said: from copy import copy def subtract_lists(a, b): """ >>> a = [0, 1, 2, 1, 0] >>> b = [0, 1, 1] >>> subtract_lists(a, b) [2, 0] >>> import random >>> size = 10000 >>> a = [random.randrange(100) for _ in range(size)] >>> b = [random.randrange(100) for _ in range(size)] >>> c = subtract_lists(a, b) >>> assert all((x in a) for x in c) """ a = copy(a) for x in b: if x in a: a.remove(x) return a
