Which is more readable to your average programmer: int size = length * 2; int size = length Unless they come from a strong C++ bit tweaking background I'd wager your average programmer knows immediately what the first line does (it even has the number "2" for "double" in it) but would have to stop and pause for the second line. In fact I'd feel inclined to comment the second line explaining what it does which seems redundant when you can get the code do the talking as in the first line.
