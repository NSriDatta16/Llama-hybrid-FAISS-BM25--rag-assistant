Welcome! If your aim is to classify into good or bad, having a binary variable is the best option. On the other hand if you want to have more classification within good (good to best) or bad(neutral to worst), you can have 5 point scale. With your idea of having the ratings 4 and above as good and the rest as bad is not justifying the efforts put forth by the respondents for filling the questions (they need to think a fraction of a second more than that they do for binary response). Moreover, the respondents would be feeling easier to answer good or bad than to answer a five point scale. Unless, you want to draw more inference from the responses, you can go for binary. If you are going for binary response, binary logistic regression would be a better option.
