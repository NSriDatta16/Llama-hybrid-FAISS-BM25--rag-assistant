As is universally said, the answer is dependent upon the distribution of when people "arrive." If it's equally likely for someone to arrive at 3:23 AM as at 9:01 AM, max_concurrent is low; if everyone checks in between 8:55 AM and 9:30 AM, max_concurrent is high (and if response time slows depending on current load, so that the 'average' time on the site goes up significantly when there are lots of people on the site...). A model is only as good as its inputs, but having said that, if you have a good sense of usage patterns, a Monte Carlo model might be a good idea. (If you have access to a person with a background in statistics or probability, they can do the math just based on the distribution parameters, but a Monte Carlo model is easier for most people to create and manipulate.) In comments, you say that it's a "self-serve reference app similar to Wikipedia," but your relatively low usage means that you cannot rely on the power of large numbers to "dampen out" your arrival curves over 24-hours.
