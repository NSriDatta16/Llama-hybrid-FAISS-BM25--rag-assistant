When is it convenient dropping duplicates when performing Time Series Prediction?

I have this Dataset. Head(df): Ã¯..date store item qty unit_price item_category 1220 2017-03-15 38 295 255 13.30 13 1453 2017-03-15 41 43 291 10.08 13 3181 2017-03-15 75 186 324 28.59 13 3541 2017-03-15 42 295 133 13.30 13 3624 2017-03-15 56 127 969 55.23 13 4657 2017-03-15 52 75 121 27.23 13 4702 2017-03-15 13 413 75 18.55 13 There are clearly a lot of duplicates in the date column (since it depends on the stores and the items , that was expected), and since my task is to make a prediction and return predicted values in numeric of the qty variable - the target prediction variable "qty", represents the total quantities sold at the ITEM/DAY level- i think i can drop the duplicated dates (I'll be using the ARIMA model) and keep only the date , item and qty column for my prediction . I wanted to know if my approach was right, any suggestion would be much appreciated , Thank you.
