A lot of this stuff is historical hangover. But that doesn't mean it's useless. Commenting the changes on a file is pretty pointless, the file stopped being the unit of code organisation many years ago. I put headers on my functions, but that's to explain the purpose of the function/method (plus it makes the code easier to scan). I also put concise change histories in those function headers... not because a change history in code is necessary, but because SCM systems aren't perfect, and I've seen SCM databases lost before. It's like backups - the disaster only has to happen to you once before you start worrying about this stuff on a daily basis. My buddies at work drive me nuts because they rely religiously on the SCM to track their changes, but don't put proper comments in the SCM either . So when the inevitable management post-problem fault-analysis happens they have to sit there for hours on end trying to figure out why they made a given change three years ago.
