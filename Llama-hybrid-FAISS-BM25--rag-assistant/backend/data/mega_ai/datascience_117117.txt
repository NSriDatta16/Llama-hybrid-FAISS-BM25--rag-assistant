Your problem most likely does not require a machine learning solution. If you are interested in the task, "given that a customer is from state X, predict how much the customer will spend", you can compute the median/mean of TotalSpent for each state. Consider plotting the result to display both variance and median/mean, e.g., by using a boxplot. import seaborn as sns import pandas as pd df = pd.read_csv('data.csv') sns.boxplot(data=df, x="Province Code", y="Total Spent")
