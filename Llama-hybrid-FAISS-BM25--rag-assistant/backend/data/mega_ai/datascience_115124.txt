Which metrics that can be use to know "overfitting" model"?

Hello everyone i'm new to data science world. So i want to know if my model is overfitting. Usually i'm comparing training accuracy and testing accuracy. But on some reference many people using roc_auc score from training and testing and compared it to know if the model is overfit. Which metrics evaluation better? I have imbalanced data, but already using SMOTE oversampling. The second question i want to ask if i'm decided to use accuracy method to know if my model is overfitting, should i try using k cross validation with scoring='accuracy' to prove more?
