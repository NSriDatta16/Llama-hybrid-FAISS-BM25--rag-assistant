I hope the following clarification helps. Please contact us at contact@genivia.com for questions. The gSOAP software requires a commercial license for commercial product development if any one of the following conditions hold: If you use wsdl2h to generate code. Because the generated code is GPL by default, you should obtain a commercial license from Genivia ( www.genivia.com/Products/gsoap/contract.html ). The wsdl2h tool itself is GPL, and we hold the copyright rights to it. Or you use the web server code in gsoap/samples/webserver. This component is GPL by default. Or you use the UDDI components in gsoap/uddi2, which are also GPL by default. The commercial license is a development site license. There is a one-time fee for perpetual use of gSOAP to develop a product (a "target application"). No royalties. The other good news is that all other parts of the software are released under the gSOAP public license, which allows commercial use without fees. So the answer is that as long as you do NOT use wsdl2h, do NOT use the web server code, and do NOT use the UDDI code then you can use the gSOAP public license for free (which is based on the MPL1.1 open source license and a copy of the gSOAP public license is included in the package). Hope this clarifies our licensing model. Robert van Engelen, Genivia Inc.
