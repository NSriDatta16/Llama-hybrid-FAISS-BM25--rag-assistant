The paper AdaBoost with SVM-based component classifiers by Xuchun Li etal also gives an intuition. In a short but maybe biased summary: they are trying to make svm classifiers "weak"(slightly over 50%) by tuning the parameters to avoid the cases one classifier may have too much weight or all the classifiers fire similarly.
