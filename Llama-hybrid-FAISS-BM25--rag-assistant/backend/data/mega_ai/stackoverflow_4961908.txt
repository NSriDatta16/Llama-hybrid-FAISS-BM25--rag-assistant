Have you heard of alpha blending? Colors have 4 channels. Red, green, blue, and alpha (rgba). The alpha channel determines the transparency. You can set it to anything in between 0 (fully transparent/invisible) or 1 (fully solid). To make your object invisible, simply set alpha to 0! For example in your frag shader: gl_FragColor.a = 0; You can achieve this without using shaders by changing the alpha value from your program. For example: glColor4f(1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5); //Draws something red with half transparency (hence the 0.5) glVertex3f(...); glVertex3f(...); glVertex3f(...); Just make sure you have alpha blending enabled: glEnable (GL_BLEND); glBlendFunc (GL_SRC_ALPHA, GL_ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA);
