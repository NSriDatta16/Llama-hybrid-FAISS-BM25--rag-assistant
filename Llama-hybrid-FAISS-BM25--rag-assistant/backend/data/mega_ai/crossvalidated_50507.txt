When do you stratify an analysis versus including an interaction term?

I’m not very familiar with when and why you would stratify on a variable or set of variables in a regression analysis generally and would like to know what the issues are particularly in contrast to including the variable (by itself or as an interaction term) in the model without stratifying. I’m somewhat familiar with the example in Cox regression where you would stratify when the baseline hazard functions differ across levels of a variable, the variable is discrete and you don’t care if you have an estimate of it. In this case stratifying may be preferable to including an interaction with time term. But I’ve never really considered it in other regression contexts. What am I missing and what do I need to pay attention to? Also, I’m only talking about the analysis side of things, not in the design phase or sampling. I am only working with secondary analysis on observational data that hasn’t been taken from a stratified sample or design if that helps narrow the focus. And a specific question within this – would I really check each predictor in my model on whether to stratify? I understand with interactions that you wouldn’t necessarily check for interactions if you didn’t have an a priori reason to and they are not of primary interest. Thanks.
