Just to add a bit of context to Michael's answer: empirical is a more general term which describes a scientific approach based on observations/experiences, as opposed to theory. The empirical approach exists for a long time and can be used in many different contexts, including when the process is manual and the observations are not very formal (e.g. feelings in psychology). Data-driven is a recent term which usually refers to Machine Learning (although not exclusively), i.e. using a formal set of observations in order to build a representation of a population of interest (usually through automated methods). So data-driven can be seen as a formal, usually automatic version of the empirical approach.
