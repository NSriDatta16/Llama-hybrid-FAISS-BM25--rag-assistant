You are right in suspecting that the ANN optimisation problem of the cross-entropy problem will be non-convex. Note: we are talking about a neural network with non-linear activation function at the hidden layer. Also, non-linearity has the potential of introducing local minima in the optimization of the objective function. If you don't use a non-linear activation function then your ANN is implementing a linear function and the problem will become convex. So the reason why the optimisation of the cross-entropy of a ANN is non-convex is because of the underlying parametrisation of the ANN. If you use a linear neural network, you can make it convex (it will essentially look like logistic regression which is a convex problem).
