There are several approaches. If you know for sure that your method addComponent will only act on JTextField and JButton parameters, you can do explicit casts if (component instanceof JButton){ ((JButton)component).addActionListener(this); } else if (component instanceof JTextField){ ((JTextField)component).addActionListener(this); } Not very elegant, not very good practice, but it might suffice in your scenario. If you want to invoke addActionListener if the Component has that method, you can use reflection - but I suspect this would be overkill for your goal. PS: In case its more clear to you, this would be equivalent to the second line: JButton button = (JButton)component; // explicit cast -we know for sure that this is a JButton button.addActionListener(this);
