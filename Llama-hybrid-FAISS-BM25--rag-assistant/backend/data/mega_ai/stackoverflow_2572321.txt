I hit this issue as well. In my case I was dragging images from one panel into the WebBrowser, but of course as soon as my image moved into the browser it was hidden. Currently working on the following solution: When the Image drag starts, create a Bitmap of the WebBrowser using "RenderTargetBitmap" Add your Bitmap to the canvas, using the same width/location as the webbrowser webControl.Visibility = Visibility.Hidden. When the drag is released, remove your bitmap and set webControl.Visibility = Visible. This solution is very specific to my situation, but maybe it will give you some ideas.
