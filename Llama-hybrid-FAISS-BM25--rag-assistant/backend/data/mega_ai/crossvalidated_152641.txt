The number of columns (i.e., time series) in x(t) is "nX" and is what SAS calls "r", and the coefficient vector "b" is its regression coefficient. I think the distinction here, and perhaps your confusion, is that SAS incorporates exogenous data x(t) as what's generally called a "distributed lag structure" in which they specify an r-by-T predictor time series and allow this entire series to be lagged using lag operator polynomial notation as are the AR and MA components of the model. MATLAB's Econometrics Toolbox, adopts a more classical regression component approach. Any exogenous data is included as a simple regression component and is not associated with a lag operator polynomial. In this convention, if the user wants to include lags of x(t), then they would simply create the appropriate lag of x(t) and include it as additional series (i.e., additional columns of a larger multi-variate exogenous/predictor matrix, say X(t)). See the utility function LAGMATRIX. Note that both conventions are perfectly correct. Personally, I feel that regression component approach is slightly more flexible since it does not require you to include "s" lags of all series in x(t). Interesting. I'm still wrapping my brain around the use of regression to determine lag coefficients. It turns out the the multitude of online tutorial info & hard copy library texts that I've looked at haven't really given much explanatory transition between the theoretical projection of new values onto past values versus actual regression using sample data. Your description is making this more concrete. Thank you.
