Not sure of the utility of this but maybe that is what you are looking for... An easier way to compare values is to use the ORDER BY clause. I took the liberty of adding an id column to the table which I call tblTst. This is convenient to select some specific values (see the WHERE id in (...) clause), and also it is used to only avoid duplicates in the cross product. To compare the whole table, simply omit the WHERE clause. The join condition can be changed to strictly less than ( With 100 values in the table the bottom (or top) triangle of the matrix will include 5,000 comparisons. (again, I'm puzzled as to how this can be useful or fun...) select T1.value AS Operand1, CASE WHEN T1.Value ' END AS Comp, T2.Value AS Operand2 FROM tblTst T1 JOIN tblTst T2 ON T1.id 8.76 9.99 > 9.88 8.76 = 8.76 8.76
