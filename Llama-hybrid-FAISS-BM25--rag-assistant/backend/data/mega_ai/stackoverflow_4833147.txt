selection of text and then split it into three parts with jQuery for AJAX

I would like to take a bunch of HTML inside a container(DIV) then let the user select part of it. Its not an "editable area" that I am looking for. As we dont want the user to be able to overwrite/change the text. Just mark it. After the user has selected it, I would like to know what was selected BUT also WHERE that selected part IS. Eg. We have a bullet list and the users selects bulletline 3 and 4. We have some Headline1 and three paragraphs. Then the user selectes part of the middle paragraph. I would like to know where in that paragraph. I've research a little and from what I understand MSIE has a problem with selection, if it comes to the startPos and endPos of the selection. Secondly, what if the marked text is multiple times inside the whole container? Here is an example: Here is a nice headline Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit. Pellentesque non tempor metus. Ut malesuada posuere nunc eu venenatis. Donec sagittis tempus neque, tempus iaculis sapien consectetur id. Nulla tempus porttitor pellentesque. Curabitur cursus dictum felis quis tempus. Vestibulum ante ipsum primis in faucibus orci luctus et ultrices posuere cubilia Curae; Quisque fringilla massa id libero commodo venenatis. here is a bullet line #1 here is a bullet line #2 here is a bullet line #3 here is a bullet line #4 here is a bullet line #5 here is a bullet line #6 here is a sub-headline Aenean auctor fringilla dolor. Aenean pulvinar tortor sed lacus auctor cursus. Sed sit amet imperdiet massa. Class aptent taciti sociosqu ad litora torquent per conubia nostra, per inceptos himenaeos. Fusce lectus neque, rhoncus et malesuada at, blandit at risus. Vivamus rhoncus ante vel erat mollis consequat. The problem is here if the user selects "tempus" its not good enough to know the word, I also need to know WHICH of the words (what paragraph/headline/bullet element) it is. Reason is that we want "readers" to be able to spot things of interest/attention. Sometimes whole paragraphs, sometimes just a single word or headline. The perfect solution would be if we somehow could detect in which "element" (counting from top I guess) in the DOM that is selected. Secondly how much (start and end point) inside that particular element. Because then we could do some sort of Ajax back to our ASP.NET which tells the backend what has been marked and then do what ever ... I've found some online-code editors that does a BUNCH of the above + a lot more than needed, but believe the solution is much more simple on this one. Just cant find the proper way to get started with a jQuery solution. In hope of a jQuery Yoda reading this. :-)
