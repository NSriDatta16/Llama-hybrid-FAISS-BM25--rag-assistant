Straight line planar embedding of a graph structure

Here is my problem: I have a graph structure (with straight line edges) which I know to be planar (i.e. there exists an embedding of the graph where no edges cross). I need an algorithm which will take my graph and produce a straight line planar embedding of it. The algorithm does not need to be too efficient (an O(N^2) algorithm would do fine). Any ideas/suggestions?
