Design Patterns for Functional Strategic Programming http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.PL/0204015 In previous work, we introduced the fundamentals and a supporting combinator library for strategic programming. This an idiom for generic programming based on the notion of a functional strategy: a first-class generic function that cannot only be applied to terms of any type, but which also allows generic traversal into subterms and can be customized with type-specific behaviour. This paper seeks to provide practicing functional programmers with pragmatic guidance in crafting their own strategic programs. We present the fundamentals and the support from a user's perspective, and we initiate a catalogue of strategy design patterns. These design patterns aim at consolidating strategic programming expertise in accessible form. Incorporating Functional Design Patterns In Software Development http://essay.utwente.nl/631/ This thesis proposes a method for the incorporation of Functional Design Patterns in the software development process. The goal of the method is to enable functional and technical designers to make more efficient use of Functional Design Patterns at different phases of development. The method does not focus solely on functional design but ranges from acquisition all the way to maintenance.
