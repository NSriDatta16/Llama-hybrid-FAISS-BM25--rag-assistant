Why are IOC containers unnecessary with dynamic languages

Someone on the Herding Code podcast No. 68, http://herdingcode.com/herding-code-68-new-year-shenanigans/ , stated that IOC containers had no place with Python or Javascript, or words to that effect. I'm assuming this is conventional wisdom and that it applies to all dynamic languages. Why? What is it about dynamic languages that makes IOC containers unnecessary?
