The name is separated from the value by = and name/value pairs are separated from each other by & .

The PHP manual states the same (see How do I create arrays in a HTML ? ): Specifying an arrays key is optional in HTML. If you do not specify the keys, the array gets filled in the order the elements appear in the form.
