Is there a way to get predicted returns from a predicted covariance matrix?

To obtain an "eigenportfolio" of returns based on PCA analysis of the covariance matrix of a basket of $M$ stocks, we have the formula [1] [2] $$ P = RW_k\Lambda^{1/2}_k $$ where $R$ is a matrix of returns (transposed: $N\times M$ ) $W_k$ is a matrix of the first $k eigenvectors of the covariance matrix $\Lambda_k$ is a matrix of the first $k sorted eigenvalues So $P$ can be thought of a portfolio of the dominant ( $k$ ) factors in the basket of stocks. To obtain $P$ , we need returns $R$ up to the current time $T$ . Say I have a prediction of the covariance matrix at time $T+10$ , $\Sigma^{(T+10)}$ ; from this, I can obtain $W_k^{(T+10)}$ and $\Lambda_k^{(T+10)}$ . Is there some way to use $\Sigma^{(T+10)}$ to predict $R^{(T+10)}$ , the returns at $T+10$ ? I would have thought there would be a formula similar to the one above, but I haven't managed to find any resources that explicitly show this.
