I'm pretty sure you are talking about the automatic image resizing when you open an image which is bigger than your browser window. That means if you go to www.blabla.com/verybigimage.jpg the image is automatically resized by Firefox. This behavior can simply not be overwritten with any kind of jQuery. The only way to disable that automatic resizing is to go to about:config in your Firefox and set browser.enable_automatic_image_resizing to false . The only way to have control over these images is by embedding them into some kind of server side code.
