The best approach I found is in Apple's Technical Note TN2262: Preparing Your Web Content for iPad . Test your website on iPad, and update user agent detection code if necessary Use W3C standard web technologies instead of plug-ins Check your viewport tag settings Modify code that relies on CSS fixed positioning Prepare for a touch interface Use textareas instead of contenteditable elements The user agent thing under the Simulating Safari on iPad HTTP requests in Safari on the desktop was really helpful.
