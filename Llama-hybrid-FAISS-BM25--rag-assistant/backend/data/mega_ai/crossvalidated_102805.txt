For text vectors, there are good known similarities - cosine, and the variations used e.g. in Lucene for text retrieval. k-means, however, may be a bad fit. Because the means computed will not have a realistic sparsity, but will be much more dense. Anyway, there exist some k-means variations for text, such as spherical k-means. You may want to try CLUTO, which seems to be a more popular tool for clustering text. Hierarchical clustering is probably a good candidate, too. But it does not scale to large data sets, as the usual implementations are $O(n^3)$. For 80000 documents, this will take quite some time.
