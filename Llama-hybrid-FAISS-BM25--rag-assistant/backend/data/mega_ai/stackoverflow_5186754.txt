Magento - Show same item with different colors underneath the item

i’m new to magento and was wondering if someone can help me. i have a product that comes in multiple colors, but if i set it up as a configurable product it just gives the user the option of choosing a different color (but doesn’t show an image to him/her) what i would like to do is have the other colors appear underneath just like up sells would (the same design) if anyone can help me i would greatly appreciate it
