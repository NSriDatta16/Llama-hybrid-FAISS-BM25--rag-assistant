As far as I understand, consistency implies both unbiasedness and low variance and therefore, unbiasedness alone is not sufficient to imply consistency. Right. Or using the slightly more lay terms of "accuracy" for low bias, and "precision" for low variance, consistency requires that we be both accurate and precise. Just being accurate doesn't mean we're hitting the target. It's like the old joke about two statisticians who go hunting. One misses a deer ten feet to the left. The other one misses ten feet to the right. They then congratulate each other on the basis that, on average, they hit the deer. Even though their bias is zero, to actually hit the deer, they need low variance as well.
