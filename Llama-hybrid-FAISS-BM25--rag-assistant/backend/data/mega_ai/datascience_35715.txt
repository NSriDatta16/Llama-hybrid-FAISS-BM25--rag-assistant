Computational aspects are typically ignored by statisticians

In the introductory chapter of "Process Mining: Data Science in Action" (2016 - Van der Aalst, pag 11) the author says that : Although data science can be seen as a continuation of statistics, the majority of statisticians did not contribute much to recent progress in data science. Most statisticians focused on theoretical results rather than real-world analysis problems. The computational aspects, which are critical for larger data sets, are typically ignored by statisticians. The focus is on generative modeling rather than prediction and dealing with practical challenges related to data quality and size. The bold phrase is not clear to me. In fact, since a generative model is the model that generates the data, once we obtain it we can do predictions. So, to me generative modeling and prediction are not opposing concepts. What do you think ?
