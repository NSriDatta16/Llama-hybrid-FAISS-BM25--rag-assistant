display/retrieve image from sql database in vb.net

This should be pretty simple for a pro. I have images in sql server database and I want to retrieve them in my aspx (vb.net) file. I have in aspx this image control - in vb.net i have started this code - Private Sub ImageDisplay() Dim SqlCnn As SqlConnection = Nothing, sql As String = "" ConnectDB(SqlCnn) Try sql = "SELECT image FROM employees (NOLOCK) WHERE ID =" & emp_id sqlcmd = New SqlCommand(sqlstr, SqlCnn) Dim imageData As Byte() = DirectCast(sqlcmd.ExecuteScalar(), Byte()) Dim newImage As Image = Nothing If Not imageData Is Nothing Then Using ms As New MemoryStream(imageData, 0, imageData.Length) ms.Write(imageData, 0, imageData.Length) newImage = Image.FromStream(ms, True) End Using image1.Image = newImage End If Catch ex As Exception ReportError(ex) Finally CloseDB(SqlCnn) End Try End Sub I am getting error on 2 places. - newImage = Image.FromStream(ms, True) - image1.Image = newImage Fromstream is not a member of system.web.ui.webcontrols.image and second error Image is not a member of system.web.ui.webcontrols.image
