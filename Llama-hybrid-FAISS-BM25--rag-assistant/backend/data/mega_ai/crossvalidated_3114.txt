Dimensionality reduction is basically applying clustering algorithm to the attributes (columns). Because of the fairly large dimensionality of your dataset, you might try to use SOM (self-organizing map/Kohonen net) to create a map for individuals or pages. You can then seen whether the are meaningful (interpretable) patterns.
