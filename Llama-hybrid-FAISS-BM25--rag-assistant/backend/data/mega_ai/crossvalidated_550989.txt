how to explain a hypotesis testing result to non technical people?

A little exercise. Let's suppose we are working in company which tell us : our bulbs light have a average duration of 800 hours. So our null hipotesys is 800 hours. We make aleatory test of 50 light bulbs and we get: $$ \bar x = 750 \text{ hours}\\ s = 120\text{ hours}\\ n = 50\\ H_0 = 800\text{ hours}\\ \dfrac{750 - 800}{\frac{120}{\sqrt{50}}} \approx - 2.91 $$ When we looking for in the Z score table we get 2.91 have a probability distribution of 0.0018. This would be equivalent to 0.18%. So we say we have 0.18% of probability to make type I error, and we say we have very little probability to make a mistake. Until here all is right. But How to explain this result to low level people ? QUESTION IS : Is this the same as saying : " We have $99.82\%$ $(100-0.18) $ of probability the average of bulbs lights is $750$ hours or less "
