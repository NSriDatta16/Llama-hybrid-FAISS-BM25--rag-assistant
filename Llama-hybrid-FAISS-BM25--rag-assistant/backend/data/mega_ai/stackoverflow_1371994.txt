Importing external module in IronPython

I'm currently working on an application written in C#, which I'm embedding IronPython in. I generally have no problems about it, but there's one thing that I don't know how to deal with. I want to import an external module into the script. How can I do that? Simple import ext_lib doesn't work. Should I add a path to the lib to sys.path ? Maybe it is possible to copy the lib's .py file into app directory and import from there? EDIT: I finally chosen another solution - compiled my script with py2exe and I'm just running it from main C# app with Process (without using IronPython). Anyway, thanks for help ;)
