This might not be a great answer to your question, and if not, I apologize. However, I just ran into a very similar problem, albeit using Visual Basic. The solution wasn't elegant in my eyes, but I used VB's MouseUp event, which fires when the mouse button is released. On release (i.e., at the end of the previous action), I save all the information in the elements into an array, and then on the next click, before anything else happens, I can check against that array. Edit: Gah, looks like you posted essentially that solution while I was typing. Sorry I didn't notice.
