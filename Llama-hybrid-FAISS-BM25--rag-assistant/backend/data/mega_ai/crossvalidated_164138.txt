Help: Text Mining + Classification - From customer comments to predicted solution

I have a data set that consists of the information generated by a service call for a home appliance. The data set consists of a column with the sentence of the customer's complaint and a corresponding column of the part that the service technician replaced. I am new to machine learning algorithms and I was wondering if anyone could help me get started using a text mining algorithm that will classify the customer's comments into one of the 56 parts that should be replaced. In short, I want to use this data set as a training set in order to predict the repair needed based on the customer's comment. Any help is appreciated!
