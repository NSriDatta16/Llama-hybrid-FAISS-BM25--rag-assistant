If you own the code, it would be better to add an Initialization method or property of some kind that could be used by calling code to tell the assembly where it's running. In fact, you might add a static property that is the location of the config file. This would help you in other scenarios as well, such as during testing, where you might want to explicitly specify which configuration file should be used, rather than embedding the logic to guess which configuration file to use.
