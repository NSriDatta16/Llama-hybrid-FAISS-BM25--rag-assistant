How can I drag from a connected vertical list to the first item of a another list below with jQueryUI Sortable?

I have have several ULs vertically down a page. They are setup using jQueryUI's sortable(). My live example is: http://jsfiddle.net/GVqPF/2/ I can drag from answers to make it the final element in questions. But when I drag from questions to answers the placeholder jumps to the second item in the questions list. At that point I can then drag it to the top. But i can't drag directly to the first position in the Answers list. Here is a video that demonstrates the problem. Any ideas why I am having this issue dragging from a list above to the first element of a list below? I've tried editing the padding and margin on both the lists and the sortable items. Thanks, Denis
