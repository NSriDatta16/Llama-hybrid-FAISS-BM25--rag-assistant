What you have is a type of survival analysis : you have an event and you want to know if some treatment (with other variables taken into account) is associated with the time to the event. Your initial data format could have been appropriate for formal survival analysis. In this case, with all cases eventually having the event, survival analysis can be just a simple linear regression (via lm() in R) of time-to-event against your set of predictor variables, as @sashahafner suggested in a comment. That would evaluate the association between time-to-event and treatment with the other predictors taken into account. You could extend that to assess the possibility that the effect of treatment depends on the values of the other variables, by adding interaction terms among them. More generally, you would need to take "censoring" into account: for example, it would be "right censoring" if some cases never developed the block before the end of your study so you only had a lower limit to the time-to-event. There is one caution related to survival analysis that you should consider: if you only evaluated blockage "once a week" but your time-to-event values are on the order of 20 days, you don't really have precise time-to-blockage data, just times to when you found the blockage. That's called " interval censoring "; the link points to over 90 questions about that on this site, with more available via a text search for "interval censor*". Example Here's some sample data, with type=copper taking 10 days longer to block on average and each extra unit of dist leading to 1 day faster to block. Add in some random error with a standard deviation of 3 days. Also, provide for a situation when observations stopped at 35 days so longer event times are right censored. pipeData $dist + 10*(pipeData$ type=="copper") +rnorm(40,0,3) pipeData[,"event"] $blockedTime blockedTime pipeData[pipeData$event==0,"censTime"] If there are no censored event times, this is nicely handled by a simple linear model with both type and dist as predictors. summary(lm(blockedTime~type+dist,data=pipeData)) # # Call: # lm(formula = blockedTime ~ type + dist, data = pipeData) # # Residuals: # Min 1Q Median 3Q Max # -6.008 -1.791 0.395 1.913 4.575 # # Coefficients: # Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) # (Intercept) 30.2971 1.1233 26.97 The coefficient for typecopper is the estimated difference in days to blockage between normal and copper , at the same value of dist . The "significance" of that coefficient represents the "significance" of type . The coefficient for dist is the change in number of days to blockage per unit of dist . If there is right censoring, you can use survival analysis. For example: library(survival) summary(coxph(Surv(censTime,event)~type+dist,data=pipeData)) # Call: # coxph(formula = Surv(censTime, event) ~ type + dist, data = pipeData) # # n= 40, number of events= 24 # # coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(>|z|) # typecopper -3.92281 0.01979 0.74573 -5.260 1.44e-07 *** # dist 0.49910 1.64724 0.17492 2.853 0.00433 ** # --- # Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 # # exp(coef) exp(-coef) lower .95 upper .95 # typecopper 0.01979 50.5425 0.004588 0.08533 # dist 1.64724 0.6071 1.169131 2.32086 # # Concordance= 0.87 (se = 0.024 ) # Likelihood ratio test= 47.21 on 2 df, p=6e-11 # Wald test = 28.35 on 2 df, p=7e-07 # Score (logrank) test = 46 on 2 df, p=1e-10 Here, the coefficients are the log-hazard differences associated with type and dist . The negative coefficient for typecopper means that the hazard of blockage is lower for copper than for the reference normal .
