This is a known bug in jQuery UI with "revert" and "grid". There is a ugly workaround in the bug comments, but it involves changing jQuery UI itself. I've created a much simpler workaround: $(".formsection").draggable({ grid: [20, 20], zIndex: 9700, stop: function(event, ui) { this._originalPosition = this._originalPosition || ui.originalPosition; ui.helper.animate( this._originalPosition ); } }); The first time the Draggable is dragged, it saves the orginalPosition, because that's the only time it's correct, and then use the animate method with our saved position the consecutive times, instead of using the built in "revert". Example on jsfiddle
