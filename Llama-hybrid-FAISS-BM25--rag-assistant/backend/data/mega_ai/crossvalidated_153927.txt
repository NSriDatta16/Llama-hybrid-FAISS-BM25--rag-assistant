Choosing the correct anova model

How does one choose the best model based on ANOVA's result? I mean I have 3 model outputs 1st is linear+all interaction, 2nd is linear+pair wise interaction and 3rd is linear and I am asked to choose the best model out of those. What things should I look for making my decision? Is it residuals degree of freedom that I should pay attention to mostly? Please answer with explanation.
