WPF drag and drop: need a big flat drop target

I am trying to implement a very simple application where you drop a file anywhere in the client area and it gets converted. Here's my XAML: Drop .dds files here and they will be converted to .png files in their original directory However, when I do this the only allowable drop target is the , not the rest of the big flat white space. When I put a file over any area where there's not text, I get a "no" cursor and the drop event does not get triggered. How can I bend WPF to my will? Why is it doing this to me?
