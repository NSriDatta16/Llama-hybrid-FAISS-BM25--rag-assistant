I think the inelegance you feel about your solution comes from duplicate code for the zero priority exception. The Pragmatic Programmer explains that each piece of information in your source should be defined in "one true" place. To the naive programmer reading your function, you want the exception to stand-out, separate from the other logic, in one place, so that it is readily understandable. How about this? if(comp1.nPriority == comp2.nPriority) { // unchanged } else { int result, lowerPriority; if(comp1.nPriority > comp2.nPriority) { result = 1; lowerPriority = comp2.nPriority; } else { result = -1; lowerPriority = comp1.nPriority; } // zero is an exception: always goes last if(lowerPriority == 0) result = -result; return result; }
