In addition to Xavier's answer: why does LOOCV still have higher variance in estimating MSE and why does it have lower bias Do we know whether the situations where high variance for LOO is observed are the same where it also has low bias? I'm aware of one particular situation (LOO, small sample size, classifiers that take into account relative frequency of classes in training) which causes high pessimistic bias. Now for certain highly used figures of merit such as % misclassifications or accuracy or a similar fraction of tested cases, the large pessimistic bias often leads to larger variance because for these figures of merit the variance is mathematically tied to their size (with highest variance for 50 %). The "low [pessimistic] bias of LOO" is usually argued from the learning curve: if, instead of taking away $m$ training cases, only 1 training case is left out, the surrogate models are on average less worse than those where $m$ cases were removed. Implied: All other things being equal (which is not the case in the peculair situation above). One would also expect the instability (B&G's Ï‰ variance component) to be lower for LOO as more training cases are available. Unfortunately, for LOO this cannot be measured.
