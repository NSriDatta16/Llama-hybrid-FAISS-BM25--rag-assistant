I have compiled the following tiny list of literature for someone who wants to get to know and start to apply Data Clustering. I start by suggestions made in the comments. 1) James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. (2013). An introduction to statistical learning. New York: Springer. 2) Hastie, T., Tibshirani, R., Friedman, J., Hastie, T., Friedman, J., & Tibshirani, R. (2009). The elements of statistical learning (2nd ed.). New York: Springer. These books are not about Data Clustering but cover a wide range of subjects under the label "Statistical Learning". The first book appears to be undergraduate-level, and deals with Data Clustering in ch 10, "Unsupervised Learning" (together with Principal Components Analysis). Data Clustering gets 15 pages and two "Labs" (applications with some R-code). The second book is apparently graduate-level. Here, Unsupervised Learning is ch. 14, and Data Clustering gets 30 pages, obviously more advanced in concepts and a bit more mathematical (but not much), compared to the previous book. Both books are officially freely downloadable from the links I provide, in .pdf format and corrected prints. 3) Jain, A. K., Murty, M. N., & Flynn, P. J. (1999). Data clustering: a review. ACM computing surveys (CSUR), 31(3), 264-323. This is a long review paper. It may be 15 years old, but it contains distilled knowledge of decades of exploring the subject (well-written too). Also, a lot of references to dig deeper. 4) Jain, A. K. (2010). Data clustering: 50 years beyond K-means. Pattern Recognition Letters, 31(8), 651-666. This is a lecture delivered on the occasion of receiving a scientific prize, so understandably it is more general -and so perhaps a good first taste of the subject for a researcher. 5) Gan, G., Ma, C., & Wu, J. (2007). Data clustering: theory, algorithms, and applications. Siam. This is a rather recent compendium of knowledge about Data Clustering, including algorithms and code. The authors are commendable for including in ch. 1 a list of 13 surveys and 10 books on Data Clustering, together with more than 100 journals and proceedings that host research papers on the subject. It appears "necessarily" very useful for applications. The link I provide gives only the table of contents - I don't think the book is freely available. ...and following @gung's suggestion, 6) Jain, A. K., & Dubes, R. C. (1988). Algorithms for clustering data. Prentice-Hall, Inc. ..which is "dated, but introductory, comprehensive, & still good, & which is freely available for download".
