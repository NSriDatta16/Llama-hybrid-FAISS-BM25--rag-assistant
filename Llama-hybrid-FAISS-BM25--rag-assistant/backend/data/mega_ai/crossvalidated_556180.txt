Central Limit Theorem Practically Speaking

Suppose that $s=\{a, b\}$ where $a$ is the event that Tom takes a pill on a single day and $b$ is the event that Tom doesn't take a pill on a single day. Let $$ X(x)=\left\{\begin{array}{ll} 1 & x=a \\ 0 & x = b \end{array}\right. $$ and $$ \begin{array}{r} P(X=1) =0.9 \\ P(X=0) =0.1 \end{array} $$ If we track this random variable for a year, can we say that the distribution approaches a normal distribution even though it was initially highly skewed to to the left. Would this only hold if the events were independent? What is there was some weak dependence of the events realistically speaking. Can we still use CLT? I guess since $n=1$ , the average of a number is just the number. But would we need more than 365 repetitions to use CLT (assuming we can even use it)?
