I'll address the issues relevant to either discrete or continuous possibility: A problem with the description of the mean You have a bounded response. But the model you're fitting isn't bounded, and so can blast right through the bound; some of your fitted values may be impossible, and predicted values eventually must be. The true relationship must eventually become flatter than it is at the middle as it approaches the bounds, so it would be expected to bend in some fashion. A problem with the description of the variance As the mean approaches the bound, the variance will tend to decrease as well, other things being equal. There's less room between the mean and the bound, so the overall variability tends to reduce (otherwise the mean would tend to be pulled away from the bound by points being on average further away on the side not close to the bound. (Indeed, if all the population values in some neighborhood were exactly at the bound, the variance there would be zero.) A model that deals with such a bound should take such effects into consideration. If the proportion is for a count variable, a common model for the distribution of the proportion is a binomial GLM. There are several options for the form of the relationship of the mean proportion and the predictors, but the most common one would be a logistic GLM (several other choices are in common use). If the proportion is a continuous one (like the percentage of cream in milk), there are a number of options. Beta regression seems to be one fairly common choice. Again, it might use a logistic relationship between the mean and the predictors, or it might use some other functional form. See also Regression for an outcome (ratio or fraction) between 0 and 1 .
