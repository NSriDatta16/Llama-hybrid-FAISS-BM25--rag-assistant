Optimization of a custom loss function

I want to implement a deep learning model in Keras, but I want to use my own loss function, i.e. custom loss. If I implement some loss function and use Keras Functional API for the model, do I need to change the way the optimizer works, because the optimizer will minimize my loss function? If I need to do that, what is the way to do that?
