In short, I'd say your safest using frequentist vs Bayesian. Classical is tricky from a historical perspective because "classical" Bayesian probability actually predates our "classical" frequentist statistical methods. Occasionally I'll hear people refer to frequentist Statistics as "Fisherian", but you're probably best avoiding that. That said, I don't think anyone would turn up their nose at you using Classical vs Bayesian, but since you asked that's what I'd recommend.
