PCA followed by Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test on PC1: is it problematic?

I have two groups of animals and 60 to 100 variables per animal (describing their behavior during 24h). I want to know whether the two groups of animals behave differently (I have 11 data points per group), and I do not care much about knowing what is different. I started by doing a SVM followed by a permutation to assess the accuracy of the SVM statistically. Got a good accuracy (5/6 correct prediction) but it is far from getting to the significant threshold (p>0,2), due to the over-dispertion of the distribution of accuracy scores, probably linked to the the low sample size. Now I am wondering about a most simpler approach: making a PCA and do a basic wilcox test on the first component (keeping p
