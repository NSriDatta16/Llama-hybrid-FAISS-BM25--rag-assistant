That is the density notation in the paper. He reserves $\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ for referring to (normal) random variables (i.e. the distribution), and uses $\mathcal{N}(X|0,I)$ to refer to densities. For example, if $Z$ is distributed normally with zero-mean, identity covariance, we'd write $Z\sim\mathcal{N}(0,I)$ , (as is in Page 11). When we're talking about $p_Z(z)$ , that is something like $\mathcal{N}(z|0,I)$ in the paper. However, notice that Eq. 12, I believe mistakenly, doesn't follow this convention. This notation is also prevalent in the original VAE paper of Kingma.
