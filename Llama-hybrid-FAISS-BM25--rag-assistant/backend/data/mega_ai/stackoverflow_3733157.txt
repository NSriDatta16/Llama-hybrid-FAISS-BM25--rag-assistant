The problem is that param (and the load of other HTML usually used for embedding Flash into webpages) are not valid HTML, as you can probably see in this case. Instead, you should try to use another method to embed your Flash content, like swfObject . With this, you can handle cross browser compatibility issues and Flash player version checking using Javascript and get valid HTML.
