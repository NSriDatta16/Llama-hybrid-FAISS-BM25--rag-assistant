Whats a good way to approach a development environment when working with Magento?

I am working on a multi-site Magento implementation and I need suggestions. I am working on a dual core 1.8ghz machine at work with 3GB ram and have found it to be very slow when using MAMP for my personal development environment, so I have set up a virtual machine using CentOS that mimics the actual staging and production server. The problem is I have to do my changes, commit them to SVN and then update the repository on my virtual server which is using a crap load of production time. This Magento implementation is a multi site/store so it uses a lot of RAM and I need a stable file system with speed. I am on a Windows XP Pro machine using WAMP normally but like I said I have found that to be slow. Is there any way I could develop it on my machine without it slowing down every other process? I have my IDE (Aptana) open and most the time Thunderbird open as well as MySQL Workbench so I have a lot of programs running and the Virtual Machine dedicates those resources, but like I said it it tedious to continuously update the repository. Can any Magento or expert developers weigh in? I really want to plan ahead for when I get more projects like this, and I would love to hear what some of you other developers do. Thanks, Darren
