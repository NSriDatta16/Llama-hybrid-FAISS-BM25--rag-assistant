You can indeed compute an effect size in multilevel models. The one provided is called delta total, where total is the total of the variance components. I generally use it when the co-variate in the model is categorical. It should be close to cohen's d, but I would not call it that. Rather, I would refer to it as an effect size parameter. Computing the interval will be challenging in a frequentist framework, but is easily done using Bayesian methods. Since Bayesian methods provide entire posterior distributions, calculation of delta total is done on the posterior distributions, which readily allows for computing credible intervals via the quantile function in r or some package for obtaining high density intervals. This is a simple case, however, and I would recommend reading the paper cited for other ways to compute effect sizes in multilevel models. $$ \delta_t = \frac{beta_{treat}} {sqrt(sigma_{visitor}^2 + sigma_{date:id}^2 +sigma_{display}^2 + sigma_{resid}^2 )} $$ Hedges, L.
