First, there's no real contradiction. The statistical significance of any statistic is only partly due to its size, it's also a function of sample size. How many people did you have? Second, since "opting in" is a binary variable, and since you are treating it as a dependent variable with multiple independent variables, you really want logistic regression, not correlations.
