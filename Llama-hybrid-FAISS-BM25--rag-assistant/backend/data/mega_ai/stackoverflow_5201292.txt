A good Java wrapper for TAPI 2?

Does anyone know of a good JNI/Java wrapper for TAPI 2? I need to interact with the Avaya phones on the desks of my users for a CRM web application (based on GWT), and all computers have a TAPI 2 driver already installed (no TAPI 3 driver is available). Unfortunately the phone server does not produce events for calls-in-progress in a centralised form, or provide an API for initiating calls centrally. I plan to use a signed Java Applet in the background of the web app to connect via TAPI and interact with the GWT client code via GWTAI. I found the JTAPI implementations XTAPI and GJTAPI - but they are convoluted (due to the big differences between JTAPI and TAPI), buggy, and don't implement all TAPI functionality (e.g. XTAPI only provides 2 lines of call info of the dozen available). Helen Warn's C# Wrapper provides a fantastic wrapper for TAPI 2 in C#, that does exactly what I want, providing direct access to the simple TAPI 2 interface. The only problem is that embedding an ActiveX control in a web page is off-limits as we really don't want to be locked into IE! So it looks like I'm going to have to port Helen Warn's wrapper to Java using JNI? (not a trivial task). Any other ideas?
