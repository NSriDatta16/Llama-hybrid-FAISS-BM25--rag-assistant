Firstly generalise; whilst you are currently wanting enemies to follow waypoints it seems to me that what you have is a specific instance of the map determining where something moves. Let's call enemies an instance of "GameEntity" (possibly MoveableGameEntity). What you should be doing is to tell the map to manage the relevant GameEntities, and then the Map can keep a list of these objects and move them as needed. Code fragments. interface MoveableGameEntity { void positionNotify(Position new_postition); }; public class Barbarian implements MoveableGameEntity { void positionNotify(Position new_postition) { // do something } }; // during initialisation. map.Add(new Enemy("Barbarian 1")); map.Add(new Enemy("Barbarian 2")); //during map processing Position new_position = new Position(); for (MoveableGameEntityList moveable : moveable_game_entity_items) { new_position = get_new_posistion(moveable); item.moveTo(new_position); moveable.positionNotify( new_position ); } The map will need to have a method get_new_position(MoveableGameEntity ge) which will determine the new posisiton and the enemies will only be told their new posistion via the positionNotify method. The MoveableGameEntityList is an object that will tie together a game entity and it's position. This way the game entity doesn't contain any position information and this is managed by another object.
