Hugh has given you a good suggestion. This kind of question is a tipical Bayesian method in medicine. Suppose $P(D)=5\%$ is the prevalence of the disease of the overall population. We have the information $\text{the test has a 90% chance[probability] of correctly indicating that the person has it}$ We wrtite this as $P(+|D)=90\%$. This is also called $Senstivity$ in Epidemiology We also have the informtion $\text{"If a person does not have the disease, then the test has a 15% chance of incorrectly indicating that the person has it"}$ $P(+|D^-)=15\%$ Now we have evrything to calcultate the probability $\text{"If a patient tests positive, what is the probability that they actually have the disease"}$ We write this sentence as $P(D|+)$ Now let us use Bayesian theorem to calculate this probability $$P(D|+)=\frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+)}=\frac{P(+|D)P(D)}{P(+| D)P(D)+P(+|D^-)P(D^-)}$$ Note for the denominator we use the law of total probability i.e $P(A)=P(A \cap B)+P(A \cap B^c)$ You have evrything to calculate the probability. $P(+|D)=90\% \\ P(D)=5\% \\ P(+|D^-)=15\%\\P(D^-)=1-5\%=95\%$ $$\therefore P(D|+)=\frac{0.9*0.05}{0.9*0.05+0.15*0.95}=0.24$$ This means even you are test postive your chance to have the disease is $24 \%$ which is quite low.
