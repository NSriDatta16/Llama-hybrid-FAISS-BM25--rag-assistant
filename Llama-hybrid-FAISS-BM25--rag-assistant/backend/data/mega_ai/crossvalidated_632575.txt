If so, is MLE then not merely a special case of Bayesian analysis, and what's the big deal of pitting those two school of thoughts against each other (aside from their choice of a different prior, There is a difference but it is only not appearing when we consider the location parameter. That is an exception and not a general rule or principle that makes confidence intervals and credible intervals the same. In the case of a location parameter then the likelihood function (which equals the posterior for flat prior) $\frac{\partial F(x|\theta)}{\partial x}$ and the fiducial distribution $\frac{\partial F(x|\theta)}{\partial \theta}$ coincide. If you consider other parameters then there is a difference between confidence/fiducial intervals and credible intervals, also when you consider a uniform prior. The reason for the difference is that the fiducial distribution (and related confidence intervals) and posterior distribution (and related credible intervals) relate to different type of probabilities. The confidence intervals condition on the true parameter value, the credible intervals condition on the observation. In this example, this would give us a Bayes Factor K of Âµ being = 0 of (1-0.07)/0.07 = 13 I guess that part of the difference here is not so much the use of a Bayesian approach versus a frequentist approach. After all, the credible intervals and confidence intervals coincide here. I see two other issues. The use of Bayes factor for a composite hypothesis. Those K values and characterizations for strength of evidence are different when you consider densities or when you compare cumulative probabilities. Imagine a posterior distribution that is uniform between -0.05 to 0.95 that makes a K value of 19 for hypothesis $\theta > 0$ versus $\theta \leq 0$ . However if we compare two point hypotheses in those ranges, e.g say -0.025 and +0.025 then the K value is 1. The p-value and choice of low significance cutoff value is similar to assigning a higher prior to the null hypothesis. If the Bayesian technique would use a prior with more density close to zero, then the Bayes factor would be smaller as well. The discrepancy between the p-value 0.07 that is not deemed significant and the Bayes factor of 13 that is considered strong evidence is in the prior information. If prior information places little weight on either hypothesis, then not so much evidence from data is necessary to get a strong factor.
