Why are VIFs below ten not still considered very worrying?

I've been trying to read up on multicollinearity, and I think I have a decent grasp of it, and of what VIF tells me. But there is one aspect of the advice that seems quite universal, but makes me worry that I've misunderstood something. I think I might be being too first order with my thinking. So, as I understand it, the VIF represents the inflation in the variance of the parameter caused by multicollinearity. My guess (though I haven't seen this written anywhere) was that that would mean, for a population with given slope and spread around the line, we would need VIF-times as many participants (on average) to counteract the multicollinearity and restore the t-statistic to where it would otherwise have been, and so to distinguish it from a zero-slope null... But, if that is the case, then the standard guidelines of "worry when VIF goes above 10" seems crazy to me (do we only worry when we'd need an order-of-magnitude-larger sample size?). It seems the mostly likely cause of this mismatch is that I have mis-thought this through. But what am I missing? Thank you!
