In Xcode, how to exclude a file with a set name from being put in the app bundle

When I start an Xcode project I drag in a blank readme.txt file that I use to take notes with while I'm figuring things out. The thing is, the file gets put in the app bundle at build time. Then I have to deselect it in the Detail view so that won't happen. Is there a way to automatically exclude a file with a known name from every build? I know Xcode is automatable, but I don't know where to look. Using the latest non-beta Xcode version.
