Averaging Likert Scales and PCA

I am attempting to conduct a logistic regression on the average of items in a Likert scale. The scale is: strongly oppose, somewhat oppose, neutral, somewhat support, strongly support and is coded 1 to 5 respectively. I'm rounding the average to reduce the number of classes. One practice I noticed in the literature is that people performed principal components analysis on the items in the Likert scale, confirmed that there is one loading that explains most of the variance before they did the average. Is it necessary to perform PCA and notice one loading with the majority of the variance to take an average of a likert scale?
