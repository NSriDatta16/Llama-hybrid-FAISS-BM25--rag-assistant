XML is a storage format for structured data. It has no dynamic properties at all. XForms is merely a specification of how to represent structured forms in XML, it has no dynamic properties either. While XSLT is a programming language, it does not really have the capabilities to function as a web application stack. It usually works in conjunction with some kind of "outer" programming language that does HTTP handling, file IO and application logic. You will not get around programming for this idea of yours. At least one of the "seasoned programmer's tools" on the server and probably a lot of JavaScript on the client will be necessary.
