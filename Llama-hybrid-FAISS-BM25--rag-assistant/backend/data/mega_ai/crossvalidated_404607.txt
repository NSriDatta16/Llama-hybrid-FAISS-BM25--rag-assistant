Censoring linearly splined predictor in regression

I'm developing a logistic regression where one of the independent variables has a non-linear relationship to the probability of the event occurring. I have created linear splines based on this variable - the reason being that for its intended application, its relationship to the response must be monotonic, and the knots set to specific values. The coefficient of the last spline however makes the relationship non-monotonic (i.e. it has a different sign than the other splines). What are the potential issues that might arise if I were to not include the final spline in the regression (in effect censoring the original variable)? Is there any other way of addressing this problem?
