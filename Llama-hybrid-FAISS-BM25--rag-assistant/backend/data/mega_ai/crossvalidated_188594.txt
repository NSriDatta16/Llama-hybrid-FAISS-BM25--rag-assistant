Confidence Estimate in classification (or regression)

I am using the sklearn SVC algorithm in the context of a time series, classifying the next time step as either being a positive increase or a negative increase. My SVC is, right now, predicting the change with 65% accuracy... Obviously, some of the predictions are going to be more certain than others. Is there a way to determine the level of confidence of a support vector classification? And if not, is there a classification or regression system that takes an n-dimensional array of input data, and will make a prediction with a confidence score?
