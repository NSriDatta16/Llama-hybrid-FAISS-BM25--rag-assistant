Offline web application + ipad bug

I am trying to get a simple (all front-end) application working offline on ipad, but safari keep telling my that I am not connected to the internet. I uploaded my cache manifest, added AddType text/cache-manifest .manifest in my .htaccess I use 1 ajax request, BUT, I store it in localstorage and I check navigator.onLine, should it be offline it use the localstorage item, on ajax error it also use the localstorage item I don't know what to investigate next. Also it work on safari desktop , I can view the app offline. the prototype url : http://www.position-absolute.com/creation/ipadproto/demos/main/index.html
