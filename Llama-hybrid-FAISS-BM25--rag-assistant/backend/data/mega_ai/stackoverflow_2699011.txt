How To Protect Sensitive Keys in Adobe Air Apps?

What are the best practices for delivering an Adobe Air app that needs a private key in order to communicate with some online API? Adobe Air apps seem like they are delivered to the user with full source code, so storing any keys within the source would be a really bad idea. I've read some suggestions saying to download the key from your server, but that has the same problem because the url allowing the download would have to be stored in source code. Also, suggestions saying to store in the encrypted local storage don't make sense to me either, because I still have to obtain the private key somehow.
