Pairwise may be too large to present, but it's certainly not too large to explore. You could make a 30x29 table and have each cell be the number of cases where both are present. Then you can look. You might even do this for 3 way by looking at 27 such tables. See if you find anything interesting. Depending on how the frequency of data pairing, you might ease the visualization of a table by using colors. In some cases you say "occur with" and in some you say "predict". If you have hypotheses about prediction you could use logistic regression. Another purely exploratory idea is to run 30 logistic regressions, each predicting one variable from the other 29. The idea here wouldn't necessarily be to use the models as models, but to use them as tools. Just find big regression coefficients for exploration. Yet another idea is to create a new variable equal to $\text{var30}*2^{30} + \text{var29}*2^{29} + \dots $ then find which combinations occur most frequently. Yet another idea is to do cluster analysis on the binary data. (that should give you some things to explore!)
