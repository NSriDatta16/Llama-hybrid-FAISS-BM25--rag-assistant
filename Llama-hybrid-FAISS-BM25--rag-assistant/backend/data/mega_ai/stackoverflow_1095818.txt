What's the right way to define the style of the images inside my gallery div?

I have a div with an id of 'gallery' and I want to style the images inside it. Specifically, I want to give each of the images a 1px solid yellow border except on the bottom because they sit on top of each other, so I don't want to double the border on the bottom. What I'm confused about is how to choose between the different border style elements: border, border-style, border-width. I tried this: div#gallery img { border-width:1px; border-style:solid; border: solid yellow; border: 1px 1px 0px 1px; } I managed to get a yellow border with this css above but the border seems more like a 2px border - it's quite thick - and, besides that, the syntax I'm using doesn't look very elegant. Any recommendations on how to do this more concisely/elegantly?
