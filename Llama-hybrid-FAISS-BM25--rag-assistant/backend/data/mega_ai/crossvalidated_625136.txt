Your approach looks correct but it's incomplete. Here is a schematic of all the ways you can form $6$ from a sum of values of $X_i,$ organized by their unordered values: N | Total ways | X's - | ---------- | ---- 1 | 0 | [Omitted: 6] 2 | 3 | 24, 42; 33; [Omitted: 51, 15] 3 | 10 | 114, 141, 411; 222; 123, 132, 213, 231, 312, 321 4 | 10 | 1113, 1131, 1311, 3111; 1122, 1212, 2112, 2211, 2121, 1221 5 | 5 | 11112, 11121, 11211, 12111, 21111 6 | 1 | 111111 Thus, when $N=2$ the chance of forming $S=6$ is $3/4^2;$ when $N=3$ the chance of $S=6$ is $10/4^3;$ and so on. To obtain the answer (which a quick simulation suggests must be close to $0.082$ ), apply the rules of conditional expectation: $$\Pr(S=6) = \Pr(S=6\mid N=2)\Pr(N=2) + \cdots + \Pr(S=6\mid N=6)\Pr(N=6).$$ The pattern of total ways $0,3,10,10,5,1$ (beginning with $N=1$ ) derives from the sequence $1, 5, 10, 10, 5, 1$ of binomial coefficients counting the compositions of 6 . The first two values are reduced from $1$ to $0$ and $5$ to $3$ because the compositions $6=6$ and $6=1+5=5+1$ are not available since no $X_i$ can exceed $4.$
