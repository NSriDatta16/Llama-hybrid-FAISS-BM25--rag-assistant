Delphi and Outlook TaskItem: How to know if DueDate is empty?

This seems like a no-brainer but I couldn't find anything on it. How do I detect if a date variant in Outlook is "empty"? For example TaskItem.DueDate - the duedate is not necessarily filled. If it's not filled Outlook returns "4501.01.01." - I can test for this value, but this just doesn't seem "elegant" enough. Thanks!
