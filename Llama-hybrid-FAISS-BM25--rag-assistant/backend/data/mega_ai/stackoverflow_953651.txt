My team faced a similar problem. We needed to run our .NET 3.5 WPF app under Windows PE, which has no usable .NET framework. I evaluated all the options and found Xenocode PostBuild to be the best. It's GUI is a bit counterintuitive and there were some bumps in the road getting it working, but it's been reliable since. If you go that route, be advised you need to make sure your code is fully debugged before you generate the unmanaged executable, as you cannot debug the resulting app (unless you like assembler). Also note that embedding the .NET framework makes for a big executable. ~20MB for 2.0, and ~40MB for 3.5.
