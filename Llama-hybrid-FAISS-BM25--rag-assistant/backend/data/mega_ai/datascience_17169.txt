Expanding Standard deviation

The problem I face is of a language barrier. I have a set of samples consisting of the following data: Sample number Organism Count 1 5 2 8 3 5 4 7 5 13 ... ... I need to find the number of samples required to make an accurate estimate of the organism within a square meter of ground. This is for a school assignment. I don't need an answer to that. What I need to do is find the standard deviations between the set like follows: (sample 1) = Standard deviation (sample 1, sample 2) = standard deviation (sample 1, sample 2, sample 3) = standard deviation In a rolling way like that. The only information I can find about rolling standard deviation is with a specific window of samples. What I need is to grow from the first one. What is this called? I'm writing a program in python to calculate and display it in a graph. I want to know the name so I can prevent reinventing the wheel in a likely less performant way (if there is a name to this specific question). It is likely that the libraries I'm working with already provide a method to calculate what I'm asking. So the problem is: I need to find the standard deviation of a 'growing set' and I want to know if that has a specific name, so I can look for it in the documentation of the python library I'm using. Feel free to change the name of the question to make it better fit, since I didn't know the name I couldn't state it in the title.
