funcall does not accept a string as a function designator. You need to give it a symbol instead. What you probably want to do is: Convert the string to upper case (Lisp symbols are usually upper case, and even though it may look like Lisp is case-insensitive, that's just because the reader upcases all symbols it reads by default) ( string-upcase ). Create or find a symbol with the given name ( intern ). Note that, if *package* is not set according to the package your function's name lives in, you need to supply the package name as the second argument to intern . For instance (for a function named dot in package cl-user : (funcall (intern (string-upcase "dot") 'cl-user) ...)
