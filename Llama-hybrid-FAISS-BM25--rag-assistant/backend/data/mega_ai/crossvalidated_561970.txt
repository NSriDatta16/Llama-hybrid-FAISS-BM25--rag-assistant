Two different sources return similar results on a specific field: which should I refer to?

I have information extracted from two different sources. source 1 returns the following data Name Evaluation A 50 B 100 C 57 D 212 E source 2 returns instead the following data Name Evaluation A 51 B 100 C 57 D 240 E 28 I would like to ask you which criteria would allow me to select the most 'reliable' data and how to justify the choice. For instance, should I take the average of the values and rename as Evaluation including the error? Or should I consider the percentage of missing, if any, and go for the dataset which has less missing? Has someone had any experience with managing a such situation?
