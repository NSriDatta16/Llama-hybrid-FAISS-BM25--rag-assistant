Starting out with forecast package in R

I am new to forecasting in R and am trying to automatically fit an ARIMA model to what I believe is a univariate dataset. > str(p1.z) 'zoo' series from 2009-04-05 to 2010-10-31 Data: int [1:83] 360 570 540 585 570 690 495 660 510 690 ... Index: Class 'Date' num [1:83] 14339 14346 14353 14360 14367 ... > head(p1.z) 2009-04-05 2009-04-12 2009-04-19 2009-04-26 2009-05-03 2009-05-10 360 570 540 585 570 690 But when I try to fit the model, I get the error as seen below. > p1.arima It is my understanding that the forecast package and the auto.arima function would be able to fit my data seasonal or not. I am trying to learn time series forecasting and am using a dataset that appears to be ideal for this sort of task . Also, the function ets() was able to find a model. Any help you can provide will be greatly appreciated
