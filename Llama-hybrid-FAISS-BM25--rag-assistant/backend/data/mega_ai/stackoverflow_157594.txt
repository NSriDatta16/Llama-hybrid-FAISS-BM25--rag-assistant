I've successfully used Archiva as my repository for several years ... see http://archiva.apache.org/ . It's easy to administer and allows you to configure as many repositories as you need (SNAPSHOT, internal, external, etc). According to the book " Better Builds with Maven ", the most common type of repository is HTTP, this paragraph describes what I think you need: This chapter will assume the repositories are running from http://localhost:8081/ and that artifacts are deployed to the repositories using the file system. However, it is possible to use a repository on another server with any combination of supported protocols including http, ftp, scp, sftp and more. For more information, refer to Chapter 3. A Maven 2 repository is simply a specific directory structure, so once you get the transport and server specifications right for the repository and deployment portion of your POMs, it should be completely transparent to your users.
