Drupal Ajax data retrieval delayed

I have a simple click function with the code below, but I can't seem to get the data on the first click. $.ajax({ type: 'POST', url: 'test/get/1', success: function (result) { testit = result; }, dataType: 'json', data: 'js=1' }); alert(testit); In my callback function I simply have return drupal_json('hello'); but it doesn't show up until the 2nd time around. For example, if I click the button, nothing will happen, but if I click it again, it will alert 'hello'. In a case where there is dynamic data, then it will also be delayed by one click. For example, let's say clicking the first time should alert 1, 2nd time should alert 2, and so on. Instead, the first click will do nothing, the 2nd click will alert 1, the 3rd click will alert 2, etc. Any ideas why that is happening? Thanks.
