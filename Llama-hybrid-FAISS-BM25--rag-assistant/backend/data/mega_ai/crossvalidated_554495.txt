Adjust 95% CI and P value if I scale up predictors in the logistic regression?

I am conducting a logistic regression in R and trying to understand whether to adjust the p-value and 95% CI, in the same way, I did for the coefficient/odds ratio if I want to report "every 5-units increase" in BMI (pls see the code below)? If so, how can I do that? model
