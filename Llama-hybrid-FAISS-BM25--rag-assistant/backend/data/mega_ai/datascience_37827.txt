How to check two images(one is original image and other one captured by mobile) similarity using deep learning?

My problem statement is - In my project, original image of product is stored in database. Now whenever any person uploading that product's camera pic( for internal audit process ) then I need to verify whether this uploaded image is similar of original image or not. So can anyone help me on this, how can I achieve this verification automated using deep learning or tensor-flow ?
