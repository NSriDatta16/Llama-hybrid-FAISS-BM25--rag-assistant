HowTo: Teamcity + GitHub

Has anybody successfully configured Teamcity to monitor, extract, and build from GitHub? I can't seem to figure how where and how to configure the SSH keys for Teamcity. I have Teamcity running as a system service, under a system account. So where does Teamcity stash its SSH configuration? EDIT To get this to work, I needed to stop the agent from running under a system account.
