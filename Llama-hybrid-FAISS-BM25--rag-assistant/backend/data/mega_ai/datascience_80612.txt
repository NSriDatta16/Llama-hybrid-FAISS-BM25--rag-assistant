To use SVM you have to first convert your text features to numeric. You can for a start use the below features: Date: Day of the Week, Month, Day of the Month all encoded as numbers. email address: Make a list of popular domains (ex: gmail, hotmail, yahoo) and an unknow (UNK) domain. Encode the email address domain as hot one encoding of this list. subject : Use sklearn CountVectorizer or TfidfVectorizer to convert subject into a vector. Put a limit of vocabulary size to have a manageable vector size. text: Do same a subject. Additional Features: Make a list of possible spam words, and see if they appear in subject/text. Also have a count of how many times they appear. Additional Features: Is the subject/text all caps ? what is the % of all caps in the subject/text. You can start by these features and train a SVM.
