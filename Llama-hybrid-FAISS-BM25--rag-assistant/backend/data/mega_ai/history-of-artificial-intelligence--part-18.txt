el and later Elon Musk. The founders and financiers were deeply concerned about AI safety and the existential risk of AI. DeepMind's founders had a personal connection with Yudkowsky, and Musk was among those who was actively raising the alarm. Hassabis was both worried about the dangers of AGI and optimistic about its power; he hoped they could "solve AI, then solve everything else." The New York Times wrote in 2023, "At the heart of this competition is a brain-stretching paradox. The people who say they are most worried about AI are among the most determined to create it and enjoy its riches. They have justified their ambition with their strong belief that they alone can keep AI from endangering Earth." In 2012, Geoffrey Hinton (who been leading neural network research since the 80s) was approached by Baidu, which wanted to hire him and all his students for an enormous sum. Hinton decided to hold an auction and, at a Lake Tahoe AI conference, they sold themselves to Google for a price of $44 million. Hassabis took notice and sold DeepMind to Google in 2014, on the condition that it would not accept military contracts and would be overseen by an ethics board. Larry Page of Google, unlike Musk and Hassabis, was an optimist about the future of AI. Musk and Paige became embroiled in an argument about the risk of AGI at Musk's 2015 birthday party. They had been friends for decades but stopped speaking to each other shortly afterwards. Musk attended the one and only meeting of the DeepMind's ethics board, where it became clear that Google was uninterested in mitigating the harm of AGI. Frustrated by his lack of influence he founded OpenAI in 2015, enlisting Sam Altman to run it and hiring top scientists. OpenAI began as a non-profit, "free from the economic incentives that were driving Google and other corporations." Musk became frustrated again and left the company in 2018. OpenAI turned to Microsoft for continued financial support and Altman and OpenAI formed a for-profit version of the company with more than $1 billion in financing. In 2021, Dario Amodei and 14 other scientists left OpenAI over concerns that the company was putting profits above safety. They formed Anthropic, which soon had $6 billion in financing from Microsoft and Google. Large language models, AI boom (2017â€“present) The AI boom started with the initial development of key architectures and algorithms such as the transformer architecture in 2017, leading to the scaling and development of large language models exhibiting human-like traits of knowledge, attention, and creativity. The new AI era began in 2020, with the public release of scaled large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. Transformer architecture and large language models In 2017, the transformer architecture was proposed by Google researchers in a paper titled "Attention Is All You Need". It exploits a self-attention mechanism and became widely used in large language models. Large language models, based on the transformer, were further developed by other companies: OpenAI released GPT-3 in 2020, then DeepMind released Gato in 2022. These are foundation models: they are trained on vast quantities of unlabeled data and can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks. These models can discuss a huge number of topics and display general knowledge, which has raised questions around whether or not they are examples of artificial general intelligence. Bill Gates was skeptical of the new technology and the hype that surrounded AGI. However, Altman presented him with a live demo of ChatGPT-4 passing an advanced biology test. Gates was convinced. In 2023, Microsoft Research tested the model with a large variety of tasks, and concluded that "it could reasonably be viewed as an early (yet still incomplete) version of an artificial general intelligence (AGI) system". In 2024, OpenAI o3, a type of advanced reasoning model developed by OpenAI, was announced. On the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus for Artif
