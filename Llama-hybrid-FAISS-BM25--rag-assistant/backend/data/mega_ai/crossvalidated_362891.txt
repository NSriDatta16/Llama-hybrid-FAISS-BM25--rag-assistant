You can think of this as a binary classification problem; there are a number of different algorithms you can use. @kjetilbhalvorsen points out a commonly used one, logistic regression. Logistic regression need not be used purely for parameter estimation, as you seem to think; any fitted model can be used for prediction. In this case, a fitted logistic regression model can be used to predict the probability of belonging to either class/population. Aside from logistic regression, you could use decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, or neural networks, among others.
