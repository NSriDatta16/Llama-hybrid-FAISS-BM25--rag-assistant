I've had good luck using a SQL Linked Server object to connect the Progress Database, via the Microsoft OLE DB Provider for ODBC Drivers. You need to use the OpenQuery object to query the linked server, which looks like: select MyField, MyOtherField from OpenQuery ([MyLinkedServer],'select MyField, MyOtherField from PUB.My_ProgressTable where dtLastUpdated > {d ''2009-01-31''}') For the ODBC DSN setting the Default Isolation Level on the Advanced Tab to 'READ UNCOMMITTED' This is using SQL 2005 against a Progress 10.1B db on a Linux server. Not the most elegant or efficient solution perhaps, but it's been pretty reliable.
