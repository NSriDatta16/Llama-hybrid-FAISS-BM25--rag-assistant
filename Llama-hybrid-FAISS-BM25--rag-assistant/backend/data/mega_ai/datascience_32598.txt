You can use a sequence-to-sequence model based on different RNN (LSTM for example) types. As far as I know, seq2seq models has been applied to spell checking. You should take a look to the existing work on spell checking and figure out how to use them in your problem. Maybe you can treat correct word - misspelled word pairs as paraphrases and solve the problem as a paraphrase generation task.
