Plotting smoothed hazard ratio intervals for interaction terms

I don't know if it is possible. I am following Terry Therneau's Spline terms in a Cox model vignette available for survival package. In Section 3, Splines in an interaction, he shows how to visualise the interaction between sex and age where age is included in the model using splines. The command he uses are library(survival) library(splines) nfit3 Which end up with the with plot with the relative risk with respect average population I would like to have a plot where x axis shows age and y axis shows the effect of being male of certain age with respect being a female of the same age . Is that possible?
