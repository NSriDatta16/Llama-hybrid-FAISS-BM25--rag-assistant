Providing a data sample would get you a more precise answer, but you have two general options: Using the existing plot.zoo() function, you can add annotations after the plot is finished using (for instance) the text() function. Or using ggplot2 , you can take a similar approach of creating the plot and adding the annotations (although it doesn't natively accept zoo objects as input). Alternatively, chartSeries in quantmod has many functions designed with this purpose in mind, and it accepts zoo as input. Edit: One quick comment about how to deal with the data that you posted in your question. The second set of dates should be converted into a zoo object (possibly with some kind of signifier as the data, such as the word "tweet"), and then merged with the original series. So you will have an additional column in your time series that represents these infrequent events. In most cases, this column will be NA .
