Logistic regression, goodness of fit interpretation

I'm having some trouble interpretting whether the model is a good fit. Below is an extract from some output from R. (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 3946.2 on 2999 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 3924.3 on 2991 degrees of freedom AIC: 3942.3 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 4 > 1 - pchisq(mylogit$null.deviance - mylogit$deviance, mylogit$df.null - mylogit$df.residual) [1] 0.004985122 So, as the p-value is low, this would indicate that model is a good fit ie. it is significant right ? Many thanks
