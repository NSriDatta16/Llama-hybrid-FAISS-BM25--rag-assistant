Problem embedding a cgi within PHP using system

Hi I am using php system to embed a cgi-script like this Problem is my cgi-script writes print "content-type: text/html^/" so that PHP will show up "content-type: text/html" above the html page. This is an unwanted artefact, what's the optimal way to remove it knowing a whole html page is returned from the cgi to be embedded in php ?
