Problems publishing website

Recently I've began experimenting with ASP.NET MVC and the Entity Framework. Since my hostingprovider only provides me with MySQL I've been trying to set that up. Locally everything works fine, but after I publish it I get the following error: [ProviderIncompatibleException: The store provider factory type 'MySql.Data.MySqlClient.MySqlClientFactory' does not implement the IServiceProvider interface. Use a store provider that implements this interface.] Since I'm rather inexperienced with the configuring this and google is lacking a good answer I thought I'd try here. My best guess is something missing in the web.config file, but can't really make out what it is. Any help would be greatly appreciated!
