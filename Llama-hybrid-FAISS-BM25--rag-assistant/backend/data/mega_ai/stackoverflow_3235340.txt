Assistance with SQL statement

I'm using sql-server 2005 and ASP.NET with C#. I have Users table with userId(int), userGender(tinyint), userAge(tinyint), userCity(tinyint) (simplified version of course) I need to select always two fit to userID I pass to query users of opposite gender, in age range of -5 to +10 years and from the same city. Important fact is it always must be two, so I created condition if @@rowcount Now the problem is that I sometimes have two returned result sets because I use first @@rowcount on a table. If I run the query. Will it be a problem to use the DataReader object to read from always second result set? Is there any other way to check how many results were selected without performing select with results?
