Update your mousemove function to contain this instead: $(this).css("position", "absolute"); $(this).css("left", e.pageX - $(this).width()/2); $(this).css("top", e.pageY - $(this).height()/2); $(this) refers to your draggable object. Then all you need to do to see if the draggable object is contained inside the #container is if an if statement that checks if $(this).css("left") is greater than the X position (not offset: see http://api.jquery.com/position/ ) of the container. Of course you might want to do some checks as well to look at the width of the draggable item and ensure that it sits entirely inside the container.
