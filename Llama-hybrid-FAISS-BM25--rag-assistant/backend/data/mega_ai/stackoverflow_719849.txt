Is physical file fragmentation of the mdf file an issue?

I have ran a defrag report on a SQL server and the mdf file for the database is being reported as 99% fragmented. I asked a colleague and they said this may be normal as it just the way that type of file works internally. Is it an issue and would running a disk defrag for this file improve DB performance? It is a pain to because it requires a lot of space on disk as it is a huge file so I want to be sure whether it is necessary. Update Another linked question leading on from the answers. How would a RAID striped configuration affect this. If the data is striped over multiple disks would defragmentation be less of an issue?
