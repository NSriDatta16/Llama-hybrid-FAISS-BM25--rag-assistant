I would continue to tune everything; how are is the disk subsystem performing? What is the average disk queue length? If I/O's are backing up, the real problem might not be these two queries that are deadlocking, it might be another query that is bottlenecking the system; you mentioned a query taking 20 seconds that has been tuned, are there others? Focus on shortening the long-running queries, I'll bet the deadlock problems will disappear.
