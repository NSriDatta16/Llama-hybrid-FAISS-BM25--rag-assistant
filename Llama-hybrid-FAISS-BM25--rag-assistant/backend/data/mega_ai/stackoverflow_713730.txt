I'm not a fan of C++, mostly because of its syntax. I find it horrible and very problematic in use, and I'm not alone with this opinion. Perhaps, if you spend enough amount of time to master it, it will be no problem anymore, but I prefer to choose much more elegant Java that lets me creating desktop apps faster and making them more portable, and pure C to deal with system- or performance-oriented jobs.
