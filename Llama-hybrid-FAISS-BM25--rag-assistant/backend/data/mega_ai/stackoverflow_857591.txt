Database purists will say a key should have no meaning in the business domain, and that you should create a status table where you look up the description and other meanings of the status. But for operators and end users, having a descriptive status code can be a blessing. And it doesn't even have to be char(4), you can make it varchar(20). This allows them to query without joins, and inspect the database in an easier way. In the end, I think the char(20) organization will run more smoothly, and go home earlier on Friday. But the int organization has a better abstraction of the database, and they can enjoy meta programming on friday evening (or boosting on forums.) (All of this assuming that you're writing business support software. One of the more succesful business support systems, SAP, makes successful use of meaningful keys.)
