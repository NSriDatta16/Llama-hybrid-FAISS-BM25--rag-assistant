The more difficult sample size estimation problems are (1) $n$ needed for reliable model development and (2) $n$ needed for reliable external validation. For internal validation using resampling, averaging 100 repeats of 10-fold cross-validation will seldom provide an unreliable estimate of likely future performance, and the same can be said for running 400-600 bootstrap resamples, unless $n where the bootstrap will underestimate the amount of overfitting (but still usually tell you the modeling process is awful). Said another way, it is not too difficult to estimate how poorly a model is likely to perform in future data from the same series. It can be quite difficult to get the model to perform well . The key to resampling is repeating all supervised learning steps, and sometimes also repeating unsupervised learning steps.
