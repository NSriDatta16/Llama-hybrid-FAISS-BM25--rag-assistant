You are probably experiencing an issue with a firewall. The 'problem' is that the port you specify is not the only port used, it uses 1 or maybe even 2 more ports for RMI, and those are probably blocked by a firewall. One of the extra ports will not be know up front if you use the default RMI configuration, so you have to open up a big range of ports - which might not amuse the server administrator. There is a solution that does not require opening up a lot of ports however, I've gotten it to work using the combined source snippets and tips from http://forums.sun.com/thread.jspa?threadID=5267091 - link doesn't work anymore http://blogs.oracle.com/jmxetc/entry/connecting_through_firewall_using_jmx - link doesn't work anymore, see Wayback Machine http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/guides/management/agent.html It's even possible to setup an ssh tunnel and still get it to work :-)
