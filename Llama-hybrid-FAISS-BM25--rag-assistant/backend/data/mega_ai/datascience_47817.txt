How to prepare the data for text generation task

First, I'm not sure whether the model contains the encoder during training. EOS means end-of-sentence. Encoder and decoder are part of transformer network. If without-encoder, training time: target: [E, F, G, H, EOS] decoder input: [0, E, F, G, H] If without-encoder, testing time: decoder input: [0] If with encoder, training time: encoder input: [A, B, C, B] target: [E, F, G, H, EOS] decoder input: [0, E, F, G, H] If with-encoder, testing time: encoder input: [A, B, C, D] decoder input: [0] Am I exact right?
