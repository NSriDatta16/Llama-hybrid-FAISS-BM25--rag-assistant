I have used Castle Active Record with ASP.NET MVC. I highly encourage this model, as ActiveRecord/NHibernate are much more mature that LINQ to SQL or the Entity Framework. I think that ASP.NET MVC has a bright future and would recommend it over Monorail for new projects. However, as I said, ActiveRecord is (in my view) a superior ORM to LinqToSQL.
