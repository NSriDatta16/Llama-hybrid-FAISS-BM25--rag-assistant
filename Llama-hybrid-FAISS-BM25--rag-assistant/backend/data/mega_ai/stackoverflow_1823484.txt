Well this sounds like you want a simple stream (E.g. just use MemoryStream as a wrapper around your byte array: stream = new MemoryStream (data)). Just wrap the byte array into a stream and every object reads as much from the stream as it needs and then hands over the stream to the next item. It even has the benefit that you aren't forced to loading the entire byte-array at once. Other than that you can use pointers in C# exactly the way you did in C++ (though pointers require the unsafe keyword and they are discouraged) Alternatively you could just pass data and an index variable and then increment the index (which is, in effect, the same as using a pointer but doesn't need unsafe).
