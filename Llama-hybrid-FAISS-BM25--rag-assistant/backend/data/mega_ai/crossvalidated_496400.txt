as mentioned by Robert the first issue you faced was an overspecified model. When you remove so many of the interaction effects (you could have used also likelihood ratio tests to identify which vc should be removed) you can see that the variation gets absorbed by the different terms in what would be their REML estimates. There's nothing wrong with that, just because you expect the main effect to be more relevant doesn't mean that's the case in a model with a different variance structure, you cannot compare that with the raw data. You fit variance structure models (main effects, diagonal, compound symmetry, unstructured, etc.) depending on your hypothesis and you get REML estimates for those structures so keep that in mind (I recommend you get yourself familiar with variance structures to wrap your mind around it). Given said that, if you decide you want to force the initial variance components from the main effect, you can fit a second model where you force some initial values from the first model and see if the interactions still explain certain variation. Since you didn't provide your data I will make my point with a genetics example included in the package where you fit a second term but because of the known fact that the second term is not orthogonal to the first one and you expect will absorbe some or all the variation you fixed the variance component from a first model so those don't change using the Gti and Gtc arguments. data(DT_cpdata) DT $varcomp # VarComp VarCompSE Zratio Constraint # u:id.Yield-Yield 650.4145 325.5562 1.997856 Positive # units.Yield-Yield 4031.0153 344.6051 11.697493 Positive ####=========================================#### #### adding dominance and forcing the other VC's ####=========================================#### DT$ idd $id; D sigma_scaled $`u:id`, Gtc=mm) + vs(idd, Gu=D), rcov=~vs(units), data=DT, verbose = FALSE) summary(mix2)$ varcomp # VarComp VarCompSE Zratio Constraint # u:id.Yield-Yield 650.4145 507.0538 1.2827326 Fixed # u:idd.Yield-Yield 156.1547 293.1392 0.5326982 Positive # u:units.Yield-Yield 3946.8524 360.4550 10.9496404 Positive In you case would be like fitting first a model with SP1 and SP2 and fitting a 2nd model adding the interactions but fixing the ones for SP1 and SP2. Also, once you obtain adjusted means using the predict() function (recommend you to get the newest version in GitHub 4.1.2) whether the variance goes to SP1 or SP1:location the adjusted means for SP1 will include the BLUPs for both terms so it doesn't matter that much where the variation went. All the best.
