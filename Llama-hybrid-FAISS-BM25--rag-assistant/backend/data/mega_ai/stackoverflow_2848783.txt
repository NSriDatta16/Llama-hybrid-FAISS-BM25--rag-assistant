In the first edition of "XP explained", there was twelve practices. In the second edition, the practices have been reorganized: some have been renamed or merged, some have been removed (Metaphor), and there now are: thirteen primary and eleven corollary practices. Under the "First Edition Practices" topic in the page you mentioned, one can find the original list of twelve practices and how they appear in the update. While reading, you'll certainly will people differentiating XP and XP2e (XP second edition). Likely, there was four principles in the first edition and a fifth one (Respect) was introduced with the second edition.
