In beta-binomial model beta distribution is a prior for binomial distribution . It is co-called conjugate prior , i.e. there exists closed form for beta-binomial distribution . If you recall, Bayes theorem states that to obtain posterior we need likelihood function and a prior $$ \underbrace{P(\theta|D)}_\text{posterior} \propto \underbrace{P(D|\theta)}_\text{likelihood} \times \underbrace{P(\theta)}_\text{prior} $$ then in beta-binomial model you use binomial distribution as a likelihood function and beta distribution as prior for $p$ parameter in binomial distribution, i.e. $$ x_i \sim \mathrm{Binomial}(n, p) $$ $$ p \sim \mathrm{Beta}(\alpha, \beta) $$ where you need to assume some $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters for beta. If you want to assume that each value of $p$ has the same probability, i.e. you have no out-of-data (prior) information that you would like to include in your model, that you can set $\alpha = \beta = 1$, that is uniform for all the values of $p$ in $[0,1]$ interval. You can look at this thread for understanding beta distribution better, so it is easier for you to choose other values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ if needed. You can find code example of such A/B test, you cal look at this thread . If you are looking for examples, I would recommend this blog entry by Rasmus Bååth on binomial test implemented in Bayesian First Aid package for R. This topic is also covered in probably any handbook on Bayesian data analysis, e.g. Gelman eta al. (2004), or Kruschke (2010). Google search also reveals multiple worked examples of such model (e.g. this blog for introductory example). Gelman, A., Carlin, J.B., Stern, H.S., and Rubin, D.B. (2014). Bayesian data analysis.
