What you might want to look into is fuzz testing and code coverage . Fuzz testing is, in effect, what you suggest: sending trash to the interface and see if anything "interesting" happens.

In the worst case, a buffer overflow can take the whole HTTP server process down, although it may not happen immediately. The code coverage part is how you turn the carpet bombing fuzz testing approach and make it surgical. Code coverage analysis let's you look at what part of the source code you exercise when you send it different inputs, so that you can make sure you touch everything . This takes a lot of skill, effort, and motivation. Unfortunately, bad guys have a tendency to have all three.
