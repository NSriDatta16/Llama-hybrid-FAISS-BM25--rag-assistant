Can I continue a machine learning process after shutdown?

I use Mask RCNN for object detection and instance segmentation. I am new to neural networks, this is my first project. I use jupyter notebook. Can I continue learning after shutdown? I would like start learning from 6 epoch. How can I do it? One epoch ~ 1h. I don't want to waste time, and continue this process. Is it possible?
