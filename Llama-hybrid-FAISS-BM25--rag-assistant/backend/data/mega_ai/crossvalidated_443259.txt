how to avoid overfitting in XGBoost model

I try to classify data from a dataset of 35K data points and 12 features Firstly, I have divided the data into train and test data for cross-validation. After cross validation I have built a XGBoost model using below parameters: n_estimators = 100 max_depth=4 scale_pos_weight = 0.2 as the data is imbalanced (85%positive class) The model is overfitting the training data. What can be done to avoid overfitting?
