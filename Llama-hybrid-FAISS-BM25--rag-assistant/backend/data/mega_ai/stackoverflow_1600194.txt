There isn't a definite list, it's up to the browser. The only standard we have is DOM Level 2 HTML , according to which the only elements that have a focus() method are HTMLInputElement , HTMLSelectElement , HTMLTextAreaElement and HTMLAnchorElement . This notably omits HTMLButtonElement and HTMLAreaElement . Today's browsers define focus() on HTMLElement, but an element won't actually take focus unless it's one of: HTMLAnchorElement/HTMLAreaElement with an href HTMLInputElement/HTMLSelectElement/HTMLTextAreaElement/HTMLButtonElement but not with disabled (IE actually gives you an error if you try), and file uploads have unusual behaviour for security reasons HTMLIFrameElement (though focusing it doesn't do anything useful). Other embedding elements also, maybe, I haven't tested them all. Any element with a tabindex There are likely to be other subtle exceptions and additions to this behaviour depending on browser.
