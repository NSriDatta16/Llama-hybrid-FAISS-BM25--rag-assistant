I'd say you simply cannot cast the result of xamlReader.Parse() into a FlowDocument (I'm not sure why). you should rather try something like this as your converter: FlowDocument myFlowDoc = new FlowDocument(); myFlowDoc.Blocks.Add(new Paragraph(new Run(value))) return myFlowDoc; (I find FlowDocument management lacks simplicity and tends to be a hassle)
