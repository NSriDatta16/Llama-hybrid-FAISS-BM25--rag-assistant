Reporting models: Add intercept from fixed effect including confidence intervals

Suppose I have a fixed effect model where I investigate a time series of measurements. My estimate + CI gives me the changes from intercept and a p-value. So stage 1 is baseline and the output gives me the change from baseline for each timepoint. The output is not the change since last time point, but the change from baseline for each time point. It would be nice to report the estimate +CI as the absolute number instead of the change because it would be easier for the reader. Am I allowed to add my intercept est. to estimate for stage 2 and do the same for the low and high CI. So for stage 2 I would add 73.69 to 2.01 to get my estimate and and add 69.14 to 1.01 to get lower CI and add 3.01 to 78.248 to get my higher CI. So for stage 2 I would report that the estimate was: 75.7 [95%CI 70.2-81.3] I would then do the same for the other stages. Output from model:
