Deep CNN-BLSTM network's loss and cost suddenly start fluctuating - is this normal?

I have a CNN feeding into a BLSTM feeding into a fully connected layer trying to do classification. I've noticed some odd behaviour approx. 70% into my epoch - the accuracy and cost start fluctuating wildly. See graphs below. Framework: TensorFlow v1.0.0 Optimiser: tf.train.AdadeltaOptimizer Cost function: Cross-Entropy Fluctuation starts: Step ~7600 Total steps: 11200 Accuracy Graph Cost Graph Note that the y-axis is log scale for the cost graph Is this normal?
