This is called importance sampling . Here's my wild guess based on intuition and gut feeling. Your positive was sampled at 20:1 rate to negative. So your logistic probability should be: $$y=\frac{e^{X\beta}}{20+e^{X\beta}}$$, where $X\beta$ is your logistic regression part. This is in contrast to a standard binary logit $$y=\frac{e^{X\beta}}{1+e^{X\beta}}$$
