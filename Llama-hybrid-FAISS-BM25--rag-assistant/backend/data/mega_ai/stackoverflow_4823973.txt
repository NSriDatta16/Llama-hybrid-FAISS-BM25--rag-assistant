Javascript: Page reloads with eventListener click

In trying to understand javascript best practices, I'm attempting to recreate a piece of inline javascript by adding an event listener from an external javascript file. The inline code works fine and looks like this: This is a body paragraph which changes alignment when a user clicks on a link below Align Right Concerning my problem, the important thing to note here is that return false; prevents the page from reloading (I'm not actually sure why, and wouldn't mind finding out, especially if it relates to the solution to my problem...). This is what I want. I don't need the page to reload to move the text to the right. However, I have no idea what the best way to keep the page from reloading is when my javascript is in an external file. Here's what my first attempt looks like. I started with html that looks like this: This is a body paragraph which changes alignment when a user clicks on a link below. It uses an external .js file. Align Right And javascript that looks like this: function alignListener () { document.getElementById('external').setAttribute('align', 'right'); } function installListeners () { var aRight = document.getElementById('aRight'); aright.addEventListener('click', alignListener, false); } This almost works, but not at all how I would expect. When I click on the 'Align Right' link, the text briefly aligns right, but then, I follow the link to the current page, which resets the alignment back to the left. I found a way to sort of fix that problem, by using instead of . While this doesn't reload the page (so the text stays aligned), it does take me to the top, which isn't really what I want. I'd like a solution similar to the return false; that works with the inline javascript. Is there a simple way to do this? Or am I doing it wrong completely?
