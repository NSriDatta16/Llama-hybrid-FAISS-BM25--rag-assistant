Embedded Framework conflict with version located outside the bundle

One of my Mac applications contains a framework which I embed into the application bundle. Now I have found some evidence that on some customer machines the application links against the same framework located in the /System/Library/Frameworks folder. I'm obviously missing something when it comes to linking the embedded framework to the application in XCode, so here's how I've done it.. and perhaps you can point me to the missing step: 1) I drag the framework project into my project and set up the dependency between both projects 2) I drag the build product of the framework project to the "Link Binary with Libraries" build phase of my target 3) I drag the build product of the framework project to the "Copy Framework Files" build phase of my target set to "Destination: Frameworks" This all works great but somewhere I need to specify that I want to link with the embedded version of the framework rather than any framework version that might be found on the system. Is there a search path to be set somewhere? or "static" link? Any help would be appreciated. Best regards, Frank
