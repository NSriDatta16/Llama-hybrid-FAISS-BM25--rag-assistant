It is tough to say based on your details, but if you are looking for mostly css menus I believe many of the free themes that come with magento have drop-down menus. Also, there are several free and paid extensions that have slightly different functionality from the stock themes. Check them out by searching Magento Connect . One that I used before was ExplodedMenu (it also has a paid big brother, SuperMenu ), but your requirements aren't really that clear, so it is tough to say. If you are talking about select-box dropdowns, I am not so sure. You can certainly build your own extension, possibly starting with ExplodedMenu as a template. Good luck. :)
