Database Matching Algorithm

I am working on a system which will match members based on exact or/and closeness of their choice of product categories. For eg. Would suggest to a member other members whom have the same choice or likely or close selections. Eg. Fred selects (Cereals, Fruits, Beverages, Apparel) Mike selects (Cereals, Fruits) Jane selects (Fruits, Beverages, Apparel) I want to match and suggest to Fred that a member Jane has categories in common Any pointers?
