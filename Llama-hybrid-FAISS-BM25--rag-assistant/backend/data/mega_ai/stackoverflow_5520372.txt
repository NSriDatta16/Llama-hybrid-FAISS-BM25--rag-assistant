As a double it probably doesn't matter, but if you'd used float , the first code fragment might not even work. Due to limited precision, after a while, incrementing a float will not change its value. Of course with (signed) integer types, you get UB on overflow, which is arguably worse. Personally I would recommend always using integer types for a variable that contains something like a count/index that is naturally an integer. Using floating point types for this just feels wrong . But please remove the useless cast in the last line of the second fragment.
