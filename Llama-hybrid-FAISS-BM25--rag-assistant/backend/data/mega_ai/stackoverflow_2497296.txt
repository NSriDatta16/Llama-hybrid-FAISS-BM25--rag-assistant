What about the event before order save in onepage checkout in Magento 1.4?

I write a function use observer in 1.3.2.4,the event name is "checkout_type_onepage_save_order". Now I want to move it to 1.4,but I see that the event "checkout_type_onepage_save_order" is disappeared,so I want to know how to write a observer before order saved in onepage checkout?
