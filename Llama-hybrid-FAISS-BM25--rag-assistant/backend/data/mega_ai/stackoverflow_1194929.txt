For the same problem the approach I've taken is: Hudson simply does the builds and runs the unit tests. It doesn't report on coverage, code quality etc. Sonar is then used to collect and display the code metrics. Sonar can give easy to see breakdowns of metrics per package. So it is easy with a naming convention to see if code is old and has a lower target for code coverage, findbugs etc. Importantly though it also has very good trend metrics so regardless of whether it is old or new code you can see if the metrics are going in the right direction. In many ways this is the key point - its the direction that matters!
