BNLearn Bayesian Networks - how is the structure decided?

I'm currently playing around with BNLearn on Python, and creating BN's from Pandas datasets. I'm not really sure why/how the package decides on the structure of the BNs it creates; see for example this BN generated from the Titanic dataset: I got the above from an example on Kaggle , with the relevant code being # Structure learning DAG = bn.structure_learning.fit(dfnum, methodtype='hc', root_node='Survived', bw_list_method='nodes', verbose=3) # Plot G = bn.plot(DAG) # Parameter learning model = bn.parameter_learning.fit(DAG, dfnum, verbose=3); I would have thought that all variables affect Survived (ie more being a Naive Bayes classifier than a full on BN here). How has this structure been generated, and what difference does this make (in terms of accuracy and applicability) from Naive Bayes?
