How to interpret regression coefficients when response was transformed by the 4th root?

I'm using fourth root ( 1/4 ) power transformation on my response variable, as a result of heteroscedasticity. But now I'm not sure how to interpret my regression coefficients. I assume that I would need to take the coefficients to the fourth power when I back-transform (see below regression output). All of the variables are in units of dollar in millions, but I would like to know the change in dollar in billions. While holding the other independent variable constant, a billion dollar change in fees, on average, leads to a change of 32 (or 32,000 dollars) in collections. I take 0.000075223 * 1000 (to get to billions) ^ 4 = 0.000032 . Now do I multiply this number by 1 million or 1 billion (the original unit of the dependent variable is in millions)? lm(formula = (Collections^(1/4)) ~ Fees + DIR) Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) 2.094573355 0.112292375 18.653 0.0000000000000151 Fees **0.000075223 **0.000008411 8.943 0.0000000131878713 DIR 0.000022279 0.000004107 5.425 0.0000221138881913
