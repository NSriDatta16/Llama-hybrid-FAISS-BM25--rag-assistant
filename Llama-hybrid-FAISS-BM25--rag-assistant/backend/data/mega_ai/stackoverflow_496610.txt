Where I work, we have a windows service that runs under a specific domain account. That account is setup in SQL Server as a login and it has a matching user in the DB it needs access to. We have never had any problems with this. I think the most important thing is to properly configure your database user (or role) so it only has access to what it needs. I have considered using AD to manage SQL access in a similar manner that you describe in your first paragraph. (AD Group -> SQL Server login -> DB User -> DB objects) The only drawback I can see so far is, if a user connected directly to the database, they would bypass any logic you have in your app. One benefit is, you know what domain users are accessing your database.
