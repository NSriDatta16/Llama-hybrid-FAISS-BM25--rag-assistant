Jaynes' reasoning here is essentially Bayesian , where the probability is a measure of uncertainty of our knowledge about something. This is opposed to frequentist reasoning, which is based on the assumption that one could potentially know the whole population, its parameters, and the underlying probability distribution (such knowledge is often impossible - e.g., the population can be infinite, or we might be dealing with a series events that may continue far into the future - like sunrise.) Thus, Jaynes bases his reasoning on the knowledge available to him (such as sample average $\bar{m}$ ), but does not make assumptions about what the "true" population average $\mu$ is or whether such a population average even exists.
