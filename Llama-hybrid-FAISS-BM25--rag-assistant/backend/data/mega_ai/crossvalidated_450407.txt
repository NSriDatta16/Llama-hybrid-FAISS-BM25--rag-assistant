Proposal Function For Variables That Sum To 1 (Dirichlet Prior)

Recently I've been trying to use MCMC to infer a set of 50 random variables (species frequencies) that sum to 1 with the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. However, the algorithm is not working well because of a poor proposal function. So far I've tried two proposals that theoretically should cover the range of the prior: (1) Add X ~ Uniform(0, 0.02) to each variable, and divide by the resulting sum of all the variables, and (2) Same as above except X ~ log-normal. For example, if I had 4 random variables that were .25,.25,.25,.25, I might have added X ~ Uniform(0,0.02) to each of them, to get .26,.27,.27,.26, and then divided by the sum 1.06 to get .245, .255,.255,.245 But for metropolis-Hastings, you have to correct for the proposal probability, and the issue is that these proposal functions are not very reversible. That is, most proposed steps cannot be reversed, so the algorithm will never select them. For a reasonable proposal step-size, only ~1% of proposals are even theoretically reversible. Are there any known proposal functions that work well with these types of variables? Thanks!
