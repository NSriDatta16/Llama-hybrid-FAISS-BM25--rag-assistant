How to turn off dragable behaviour on Google Maps V2 (javascript)

I'm trying to set up a Google Maps on device and on top of it show some simple buttons. But events that I attach to those buttons seems to interferee somehow with map drag functionaliy. Basically drag completly doesnt work and also gives me this button not workin. I really dont care about this drag (I dont need it) - but i cant figure out how to disable it. Does any of you tried that? (I dont want to use static google images only, I still want to have an option to move around, zoom in and out, but on my own buttons). Biggest problem is markers - because I want to have them be clickable. So There might be 2 solutions: How to disable dragable behaviour? How to make only markers clickable (outside of a Map layer somehow, but able to move together with map). I was thinking in hacky way to create an overlay that would pass only few events but this doesnt work... Anyone has any ideas? Thanks in advance,
