Determining what objects fall within a selection rectangle (marquee)

I'm writing a program that (amongst other things) provides an IDE-like environment for the user where they can select one or more objects with a rectangualr selection tool. All selections will be a simple rectangle, and all selectable objects will be simple rectangles as well. I already have the code (VB.Net) to create the rubber-banding effect visually - what I need is an efficient algorithm that will tell me what objects have at least a portion of their area within the final selection rectangle. If it helps to visualize, what I want to do would be identical to dragging a selection box over icons on the Windows desktop... whichever icons have even a portion of their areas located within that selection marquee are highlighted (selected). Any help would be appreciated... thank you in advance
