how to create a buttonbar with a sliding control in android?

The footprints and clock app on a HTC sense phones use a slider control on the bottom buttonbar (see this movie for an example: https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=0B9hmEy_z2CRzOTJmYTVlNDktYjkwMS00YTM5LTk3ODQtYmIzODU4Yzk1YjA0&hl=en&authkey=CMWwwegG ). From the hierarchy viewer I can see that they use a custom control for this. I'm looking for a way to achieve the same effect. I want a buttonbar on the bottom of my app with a movable selector which I can drag from left to right and back, thereby selecting the different tabs. Can anyone give some tips on how I might achieve this? Which layout controls could I use for this purpose? I know how to create the tabs and the button bar, but I'm a bit puzzled on the sliding selector. Thanks and kind regards, Ivo
