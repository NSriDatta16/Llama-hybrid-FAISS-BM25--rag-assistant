You may want to look at templating (such as Smarty for PHP). I agree that markup shouldn't normally be held in the database. However, you might also consider implementing a "pointer" concept, where at each link, you break your storage of the page, add a pointer in the table to the link, then a pointer in the link table to the next segment of content for the page. (I have no idea how complicated that would be - just an idea.) Or look at how various CMS tools handle the idea. Some just put everything in the database as one big block of text, while others rely on templating, and others may do something else entirely (like object-oriented environments such as Plone ).
