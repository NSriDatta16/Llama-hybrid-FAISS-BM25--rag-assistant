Not sure what your ideas were for splitting and iterating, but it seems like it wouldn't be slow: Split the domains up and reverse, like you said. Storage could essentially be a tree. Use a hashtable to store the TLDs. The key would be, for example, "com", and the values would be a hashtable of subdomains under that TLD, iterated ad nauseum.
