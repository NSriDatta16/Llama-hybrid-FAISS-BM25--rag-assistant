Your query (reformatted for clarity): SELECT DISTINCT f.catID AS catID, c.cat1, c.cat2, c.cat3, c.cat4, SUM(f.view) AS sum_views, COUNT(f.id) AS count_posts, c.pri_color, c.sec_color, c.name AS cat_name, f.userID AS userID, f.id AS forum_id, f.title, u.alias, MAX(f.created) AS created, f.paragraph FROM forum f JOIN users u ON (u.id = f.userID) JOIN category c ON (f.catID = c.id) WHERE f.approved = 'yes' GROUP BY f.catID ORDER BY c.name The issue with your query is that the aggregated data cannot be logically related to the unaggregated data. For example, the aggregated count for a particular category does not apply to any particular user. So either you want to get your aggregate data separately or you also want to group by user info: SELECT c.name,c.pri_color, c.sec_color, cats.ualias, cats.sum_views, cats.count_posts, cats.created c.cat1, c.cat2, c.cat3, c.cat4, FROM categories c JOIN (SELECT f.catID, u.alias AS ualias SUM(f.view) as sum_views, COUNT(f.id) as count_posts, MAX(f.created) as created FROM forum f JOIN users u ON (f.userID=u.id) WHERE f.approved='yes' GROUP BY f.catID, u.alias) AS cats ON (c.id=cats.catID);
