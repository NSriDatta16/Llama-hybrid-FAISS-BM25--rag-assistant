Calculating PCA variance explained

I've read through this explanation here regarding calculating the variance explained from PCA output. I think I got it right but might be off in my interpretation of R output. In the example below, I would like to calculate the percentage of variance explained by the first principal component of the USArrests dataset. pca I assumed that R uses sdev as the square root of the eigen values. So I square it and divide the first value by the total. Is this correct?
