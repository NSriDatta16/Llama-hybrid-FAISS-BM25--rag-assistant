We've just been looking into this when I came across this post (first time we've used the magento platform and our first project with it). Typically we'd ensure that every site we develop degrades gracefully without javascript, but this is looking like it might be too much work for us on this particular project at least for the first phase (tight deadline alongside steep learning curve). While I agree that javascript can offer some great usability enhancements, providing a non-javascript fallback isn't just about supporting the odd akward person who insists on turning it off. Some users using disabled access devices (screen readers etc) as far as I know, might not have the option to use javascript either (or may find javascript interfaces more troublesome to use if not impossible in some cases). In these cases if it doesn't degrade gracefully for them, then I'm a bit concerned that it may conflict with disability discrimination legislation in the UK/EU (where our client operates). For this reason, I'm not sure we can take the position the magento developers have in the long run (we'll probably end up backtracking and resolving this ourselves ultimately and I'm guessing that will take us longer than if it degraded gracefully from the start and we could simply build upon that). The admin area is less of an issue, but the front end should work without javascript imho and I was a bit surprised when I discovered that it didn't work without it (the client came to us specifying magento so there isn't much we can do but run with it at the moment).
