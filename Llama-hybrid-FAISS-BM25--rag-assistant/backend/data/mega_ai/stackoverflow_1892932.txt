As stated, "password recovery" is not a decision problem. You have not proved that "password recovery" does not have a polynomial-time algorithm, you have merely argued on intuitive grounds that it does not. Just because a solution space is gigantic does not mean there are not fast algorithms to find the solution; for example, there are n! permutations of a set of n distinct integers but only one is sorted ascending yet we can find it in n log n time. For a more fun example, see Project Euler #67 . Even if you did rephrase "password recovery" as a decision problem and were able to show that there is not a polynomial-time algorithm for solving it, you now have to prove that "password recovery" is NP-complete. For details on P/NP/etc. see this previous question .
