Alternative to multinomial logistic regression that doesn't use a reference/baseline?

I am on a project developing a model to predict which of 3 groups customers will belong to. I am currently using multinomial logistic regression. The three customer groups are the Loyals, who regularly purchase from our company; the Switchers, who sometimes purchase from our company, and the Nevers, who never purchase from our company. The Nevers are currently serving as the reference category in my model. My current model makes its predictions from 3 variables: customer age, customer rating of our advertising, and customer price sensitivity. The output shows the following: For example, I predicted for a customer who is 38 years old, has a value on the advert variable of 8 and a value on the price variable of 4 and got the following: Using this information, how can I calculate the probability of this customer being Loyal? Being Lapsed? Being a Never? I am asking for absolute probability, not the probability of being Loyal vs Never or Lapsed vs Never.
