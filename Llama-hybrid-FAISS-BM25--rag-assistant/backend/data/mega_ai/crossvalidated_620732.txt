Singular gradient errors in nls in R studio

I make fisheries work, and I need to estimate some parameters from the von Bertalanffy equation: Lt=Linf*(1-exp-K(t-t0)) here Linf, K, and t0 are the parameters that I want to estimate by FSA package and nls function While using R studio this error occurs at the step of nls as shown in the image: My data are Fish age by day (age or t) VS length by mm (CL or Lt) as shown in the image: I want to solve this problem is the problem in my data(I import data from Excel sheet) or not
