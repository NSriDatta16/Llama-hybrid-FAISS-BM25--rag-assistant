People who work on data-efficient algorithms often bring up robotics for "motivation". But even for robotics, large datasets can be collected, as is done in this data-collection factory at Google: What if I want to (for example) use reinforcement learning on a task involving underwater robotics to classify arctic ocean fronts? Or train a vision module to classify extremely rare objects in space through a fly-by probe? I may have very limited data and the cost of gathering new data may be extremely expensive. Often in robotics simulators are not accurate enough (especially when natural phenonmena are involved) to really generate accurate training data (this is called the sim2real problem). Additionally, gathering real-life data for every possible task you would like your robot to accomplish can be prohibitive, especially if you want a wide variety of tasks accomplished by something like an in-home robot.
