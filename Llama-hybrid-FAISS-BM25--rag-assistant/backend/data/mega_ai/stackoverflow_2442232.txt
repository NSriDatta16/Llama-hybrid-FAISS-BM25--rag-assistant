Getting the position of the element in a list when it's drag/dropped (ui.sortable)

I have a sortable list like this one: http://jqueryui.com/demos/sortable Is it possible to get the start and end position of the element in the list, when it has been moved? I'm talking about their position number, in the list. For example, if I move element 2 to position 5 in the list, I'd like to assign those two numbers to variables. I'm new to jQuery - any help would be much appreciated.
