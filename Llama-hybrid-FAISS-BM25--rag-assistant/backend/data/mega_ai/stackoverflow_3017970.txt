I recently had the problem of detecting overlapping date ranges in Python. I was deeply impressed by the elegance of this solution , and in particular the unit tests that accompanied it. They are short, clear, and exhaustive. Also, drawing the cases in ASCII art in the docstring is a stroke of genius, in my opinion. The only change I made was to split each assert into a separate test, for improved isolation.
