A 'semi random' AR model

Let $\phi$ and $\psi$ be two sets of AR model parameters. Let $(Y_n, 0\leq n\leq N)$ be a time sequence, and let $T\subset [0,1,...,N]$ be a set of times. The time series is defined as follows: $$\begin{cases} Y_n=\sum_{i=0}^k \phi_i Y_{n-i} + \varepsilon_n, n\in T\\ Y_n=\sum_{i=0}^k \psi_i Y_{n-i} + \varepsilon_n, n\notin T \end{cases} $$ where $\varepsilon_n$ is some i.i.d sequence. That is, the process is defined using two AR-type parameters, chosen by the set T. Denote this model as Model A. Now, consider the case in which $T$ is not known but is estimated from the data, say by another time sequence, $Z_n$, and we have $\hat{T}(\{Z_n\})$ as an estimator for the (random) set $T$. Denote this model as model B. I was wondering if any of these models are known in the literature, since they aren't strictly AR, etc. I'm looking to estimate their parameters in some sense. Thanks
