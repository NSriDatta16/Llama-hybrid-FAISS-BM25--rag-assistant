You have to go back to the algorithm behind the random forest to have an insight of what you should do. If the variable happened_or_not is relevant, you would expect your classifier to produce trees with logic formulaes such as if event happened AND date_ago > 2.5 THEN probability of other event = 0.5 and other branch where the condition would be if NOT event happened THEN probability of other event = 0.2 Now, the question you ask can be translated into "how can I encode, with these two variables, the fact that an event happened ?" What you could do, in this case, is to replace the NaN s in date_ago with a negative number (say -1), and get rid of the other column. It will not cause any confusion to the random forest algorithm, now the rule if date_ago will simply be equivalent to NOT event_happened . Note that this work only if date_ago is positive. Otherwise, you could just replace the NaNs by any value smaller than the smallest element (or larger than the largest element).
