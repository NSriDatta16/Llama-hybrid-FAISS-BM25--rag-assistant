Classifier feature importance

If I train a GNB/LDA/kNN/other classifier I would like to know, in the model built, how important are features to classify or which feature(s) drives the classifier. For example in SVM models the importance of the feature is sometimes evaluated looking at weights magnitude, but for non-linear and generative models is more difficult to extract weights. Do you know a book/paper that could be useful to solve my question?
