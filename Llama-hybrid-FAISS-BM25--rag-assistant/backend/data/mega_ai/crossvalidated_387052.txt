Bayesian inference for non-Gaussian errors

Following from a previously unanswered question , regression tasks involving measurements with normally distributed noise apply Gaussian processes. But are there any recommended approaches for regression when the uncertainty is not necessarily Gaussian but may follow an arbitrary distribution function? References to relevant literature and especially numerical packages tackling this problem would be greatly appreciated.
