Large topic my friend. If you want to learn about the theory the best place to go is 'the Dragon Book': http://www.amazon.com/Compilers-Principles-Techniques-Tools-Gradiance/dp/0321547985/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1297801900&sr=1-2 Another good place to look if you want to devlope for .Net is the F# power pack. THis contains fsLex and fsYacc. Good luck! GJ
