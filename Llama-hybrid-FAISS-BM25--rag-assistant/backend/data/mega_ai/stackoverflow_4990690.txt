By default, MySQL assumes the client uses the latin1 character set. If you're using UTF-8 in your PHP scripts, then this assumption is false. You need to specify to MySQL that you're using UTF-8 by issuing this SQL statement just after the database connection is opened: SET NAMES utf8 Then the data inserted by the following SQL statements will use the correct character set. This means that you need to re-insert your data or follow the MySQL conversion procedure (see the last paragraphs). It is recommended that your tables are configured to store data in UTF-8, too, to avoid unnecessary read/write character set conversions. That's not required, though. More information is available in the MySQL documentation . Specifically, Connection Character Sets and Collations .
