How to allow user to move a control on the form

I have a winform on which i want to allow the user to move a control. The control is (for now) a vertical line : label with border and a width of 1. The context is not very important but i'll give it to you anyways. I have a background with some graphics and i'd like the user to be able to slide a guideline above the graphics. The graphics are made with the NPlots library. It looks something like this: http://www.ibme.de/pictures/xtm-window-graphic-ramp-signals.png If i can find out how the user can click and drag the label/line control around the screen, i can solve my guideline problem. Please help.
