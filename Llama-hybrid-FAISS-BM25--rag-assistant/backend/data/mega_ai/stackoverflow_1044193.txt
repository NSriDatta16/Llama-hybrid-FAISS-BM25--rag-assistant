Have you looked at the benefit of being able to be a better employee by handling so many different kinds of positions in the past? I'm possibly taking your question in a different light, where I'm looking at all the different experiences I've had and how they benefit me. For example, do you want just be a coder or do you want to a vast array of duties while being a "developer" in title? What kinds of career progressions and working conditions bring out the best in you? I can look back at the few different kinds of companies I worked and contrast what worked well here, what was crap over there, etc. While the marketability of this is questionable as everyone who works for x years has the same number of years of experience to use and some companies can go through enough changes that it is almost like a different company at times. Harnessing this into a way to tell an employer or perspective employer, "Could we work like this?" or "Where I used to work, we did things like this, this and some of those and it worked out awesomely. Could we try that here?" The ability to analyse the past and leverage that is my main point here as everyone's experiences are what puts them in their current spot.
