I think the answer to your problem may be more related to your field of study (say, molecular dynamics) than statistics. Statistics deals with probability distribution of random variables and, it does not matter what your distribution is, for applying central limit theorem, for making inferences about population (with large samples). However, since you have mentioned that such simulation does not work in your case with mean changing randomly every time, it is quite possible that the 'time spent in the region' may be a random variable with no finite mean at all (for example, a random normal distribution assumes that, even though the variable is random, the variable will tend towards a central value i.e. mean, so is the case with other known standard distributions which mimic some natural phenomenon). But if the 'time spent' variable is completely random, whose value is affected by other variables in your model, you cannot expect 'any mean value' whatever time you spend in simulation. For example, movement of stock prices over a time interval are completely random in nature, and it cannot be modeled under any known probability distribution and it cannot have any mean related to it. If your theory, however, indicates that there should be finite mean for time spent (which I intuit very unlikely for molecular movements) and if you are sure about it, then you should work on finding out the distribution function and its moment generating functions etc., to arrive at the mean function. Note: If finite mean is a sure theoretical possibility, another statistically sound method to estimate the mean is MLE estimation methods (especially in data science paradigm). But, MLE methods, that estimate population parameters, mandatorily require an assumption about the nature of population distribution and its density function (which is not required for CLT based inferential statistics that makes inferences on sample). But there could be other techniques available in data science paradigm, which could estimate population parameters, but they may rely on quantitative and computationally intensive algorithms.
