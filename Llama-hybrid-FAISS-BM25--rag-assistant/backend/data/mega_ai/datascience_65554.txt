The simplest pipeline would be to do the following: OCR Named Entity Extraction Entity Disambiguation OCR This is basically transforming your receipts into plain text. If you have scans (pictures) of the receipts, then you need a method that can deal with images. For example, you could use tesseract . Named Entity Extraction This is detecting the parts of interest in the text. This includes detecting dates , prices , currency , locations , names , and so on. Once you detect a named entity, for example: price=2.59 , you still don't know if that is the unit cost , or total cost after tax , or total cost before tax , but that will come in the next step. All you know that this is an area of interest. There are tools that are able to detect most named entities that you might want to use. For example: spaCy . The cool thing about spaCy is that you can train it to recognize more named entities that you might want. Entity disambiguation This is identifying the purpose of the named entity that you extracted. For example, given price=2.59 , is it the unit cost , or total cost after tax , or total cost before tax . This is where rules might come in handy, because it will be difficult to teach a machine learning model to identify them. You can have rules like: highest value = total cost after tax unity quantity × unit price = total cost before tax total cost before tax × 1.21 = total cost after tax and so on...
