I'm going to hopefully clarify some things about the likelihood ratio test. If you still disagree, comment below. First, a nested model is (pragmatically) a model for which we assume the value(s) of the parameter(s). Consider a vector of parameters partitioned into two disjoint sets $\mathbf{\Theta} = [\theta; \theta_0]$ . In this case, we are free to estimate $\theta$ but we assert that the value of the other parameter(s) is $\theta_0$ . When we do this, the likelihood is exactly the same, we are just interested in the manifold where the other set of parameters is $\theta_0$ . We then compare this nested model where we are free to estimate every parameter from the data. If the likelihoods are drastically different (read, more different than we would expect by chance given that the parameter values are actually $\theta_0$ ) then we conclude that the model for which we can estimate all the parameters better fits the data. So the likelihoods are in fact the same. We are just comparing different parts to one another.
