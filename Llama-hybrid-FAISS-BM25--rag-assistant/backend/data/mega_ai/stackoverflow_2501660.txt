You should definitely disable them in some way for now. Whether that's done by commenting, deleting (assuming you can get them back from source control) or some other means is up to you. You do not want these failing tests to be an obstacle for people trying to submit new changes. If there are few enough that you feel you can fix them yourself, great -- do it. If there are too many of them, then I'd be inclined to use a "crowdsourcing" approach. File a bug for each failing test. Try to assign these bugs to the actual owners/authors of the tests/tested code if possible, but if that's too hard to determine then randomly selecting is fine as long as you tell people to reassign the bugs that were mis-assigned to them. Then encourage people to fix these bugs either by giving them a deadline or by periodically notifying everyone of the progress and encouraging them to fix all of the bugs.
