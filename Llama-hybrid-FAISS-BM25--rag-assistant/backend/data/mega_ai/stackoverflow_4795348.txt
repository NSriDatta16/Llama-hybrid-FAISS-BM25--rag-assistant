Your best bet is to use the navigationClick, navigationMovement and navigationUnclick methods in Field: http://www.blackberry.com/developers/docs/4.2.1api/net/rim/device/api/ui/Screen.html#navigationMovement%28int,%20int,%20int,%20int%29 Or if you want to get the events before any of the fields do, override the same methods on the top-level Screen. RIM strongly discourages the use of the old trackwheel API. Navigation is the way to go.
