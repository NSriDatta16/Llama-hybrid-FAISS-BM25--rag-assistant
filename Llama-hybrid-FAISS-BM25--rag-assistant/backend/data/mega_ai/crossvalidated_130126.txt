I disagree with your characterization of B median as "upper 2", because its mean is 16/7=2.29. You alluded to the fact that you didn't like mean for the distribution is skewed, so characterizing the median as "upper 2" would be inconsistent with the sample mean. Mean of sample A is 1.71. Hence, the the central tendency is probably high 1 and low 2 for samples A and B. I propose to use a weighted average of mean and median: $m=w*mean+(1-w)median$. In your case median = 2, and A and B means are 12/7 and 16/7. So, if you use $w=1/3$, then m=1.9 and 2.1 would be consistent with proposed above high 1 and low 2 characterization. You can play with weights w to get a better metric for your study. High $w$ will make it look more like mean, and low $w$ will make it more like a median.
