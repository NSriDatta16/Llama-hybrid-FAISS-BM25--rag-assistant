How to make a Power Spectral Density Plot in R

I have a time series point process representing neuron spikes. I have computed and plotted autocovariance using acf but now I need to plot the Power Spectral Density. Power Spectral Density is defined as the Fourier Transform of the autocovariance, so I have calculated this from my data, but I do not understand how to turn it into a frequency vs amplitude plot. I have used the following code # X is some set of Wait times between spikes, below is just an example X Now psd is a complex valued array across the default 24 lags from the acf function. How do I turn this array into a PSD plot?
