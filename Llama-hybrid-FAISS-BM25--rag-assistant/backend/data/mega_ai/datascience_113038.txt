Good starting point for Natural Language Processing thesis

I want to do a masters thesis on Natural Language Processing, where I want to evaluate if given definitions meet certain criterias. Problem is, I'm new to NLP and I don't know where to start. I need a paper with a NLP method appropriate for my problem so that I can build on that paper.
