Priors in a bayesian model? Equivalent GLMM

I have this mixed effects logistic regression model. All the predictors are categorical (I need to maintain also age categorical, not as a continuous variable). The predictors are codified with orthogonal sum to zero contrasts. However, I have a problem of near to perfect separation of data. mod I have read from the link here that for mixed models the only solution is to switch to a Bayesian model since a penalized regression is not available for mixed models. I have decided to use the brms package since it has a syntax very similar to lme4 . However, I am not confident with Bayesian models and priors, and I am not sure about the results. mod_bayesian Are mod and mod_bayesian equivalent? Or, better, what is the Bayesian equivalent to mod ? How can I detect how to select priors?
