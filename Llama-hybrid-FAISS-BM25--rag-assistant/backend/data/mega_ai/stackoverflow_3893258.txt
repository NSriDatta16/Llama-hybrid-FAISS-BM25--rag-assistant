The $ is a variable that references the jQuery object. I'm guessing the other scripts on the page also use the $ for a variable and this is causing the problem. You'll want to use the jQuery.noConflict() method, but you must assign it to a variable that you'll replace in your code. var jq = jQuery.noConflict(); This will change your usage from: $category = $('topcat').options[$('topcat').selectedIndex].value; to something like this: $category = jq('topcat').options[$('topcat').selectedIndex].value; You don't have to use jq like I did, any variable should do the trick. Hope this helps.
