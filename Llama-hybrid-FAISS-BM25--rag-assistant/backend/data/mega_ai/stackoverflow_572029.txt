Pseudocode for getting the average : double mean = 0 int count = 0 foreach int number in numbers count++ mean += number - mean / count round(mean) // rounds up floor(mean + 0.5) // rounds up ceil(mean - 0.5) // rounds down Rounding generally involves adding 0.5, then truncating (floor), which is why 3.5 rounds up to 4. If you want 3.5 to round down to 3, do the rounding code yourself, but in reverse: subtract 0.5, then find the ceiling. Edit: Updated requirements (no overflow)
