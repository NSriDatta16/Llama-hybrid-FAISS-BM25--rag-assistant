Datasets and XML in place of proper db: Not a good idea?

In continuation of: Storing DataRelation in xml? Thanks to everybody for answers to my earlier thread. However, could I ask the reason why everybody is not supporting this XML based approach? What exactly will be the problems? I can apply connstraints to dataset, and I can, I guess, also use transactions. I am new to this. So if you could point me to some link, where I can find some sort of comparisons, that would be really helpful. According to FAQ, discussions are not very encouraged, but I guess this is quite specific. I hope, not to be fired for this... :) Thanks for reading, Saurabh.
