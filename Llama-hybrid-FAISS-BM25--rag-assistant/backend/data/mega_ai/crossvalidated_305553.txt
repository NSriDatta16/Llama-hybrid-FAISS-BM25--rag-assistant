My guess is that this hasn't been really worked out. Most researchers size the study to achieve 0.9 power at the final analysis, relegating interim analyses to just 'hope for the best' in detecting an early, large difference. The early look will have low power because of fewer events and because of the conservative group-sequential cutoff. A full Bayesian method would help a bit, because there is no penalty for multiple looks. Because of no penalty, you can look as often as desired without planning for it.
