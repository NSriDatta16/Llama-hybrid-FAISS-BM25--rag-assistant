open source (or otherwise) versions of Matlab toolboxes

I have a project in a course at the university that requires various Matlab functions. My version of Matlab is supplied by my workplace, and it doesn't have some of the toolboxes that are required for the project. Is there some repository of such implementations anywhere? I couldn't find anything relevant when I googled. While my question is general, I'm listing the functions that I need and can't find, since my question is also specific: knnclassify - an implementation of K-nearest neighbors svmclassify - an implementation of Support Vector Machines svmtrain - part of the SVM implementation mapstd - normalizes a matrix to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 An alternative I'm considering is working in Python with Numpy and Pylab. Are there toolboxes in Pylab that are equivalent to these Matlab functions?
