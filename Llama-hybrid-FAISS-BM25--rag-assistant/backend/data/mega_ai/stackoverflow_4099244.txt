Building, and Publishing, and User-Data (oh my!)

What is the best way to update a "Web-Application" ("re-publish" from dev server to live server) while preserving user-data (such as images, videos, and audio stored in the filesystem) in a VS 2010 build/publish setup? Additionally, what is the best way to minimize site downtime during these updates? My backstory: Usually I "build/publish" the site to a folder on my dev machine, ftp:// into the live server, then drag-and-drop the new "published" files and folders to the live site while making sure not to overwrite any user-generated directories. Obviously this method comes from my static-html days where it didn't matter. And obviously this is dangerous, flawed, and counter-productive for any Web Application with user-generated data in the FS.
