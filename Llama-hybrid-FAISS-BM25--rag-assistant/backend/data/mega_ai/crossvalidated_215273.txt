Preprocessing in predictive models

I'm trying to make a predictive model using logistic regression but before that I'm wondering what kind of explore I can do on my data to get a better understanding or even help me with the model selection and analysis that follows. I'm thinking of things like tables, plots. What are some good general practice?
