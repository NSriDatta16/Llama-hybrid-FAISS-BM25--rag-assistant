Bell shape of student in a class has a height mean of 68 inches with 16% of them taller than 71 inches. What % of students are taller than 65 inches?

The distribution of height of students in a class has a bell shape. Moreover: the average height is 68 inches and 16% of students were taller than 71 inches What percentage of students in this class are taller than 65 inches? Since it's bell-shaped, and the distance of 65 from 68 and distance of 71 from 68 are both 3 inches, can we assume that 16% students are shorter than 65 inches since 16% are taller than 71 inches, leaving us with 100%-16%=84% of the class taller than 65 inches? Can we assume this graphically? Or do we have to use Chebyshev's rule for finding $k$ and then input it into $mean-k*\text{standard deviation}=\text{lower limit}$ ?
