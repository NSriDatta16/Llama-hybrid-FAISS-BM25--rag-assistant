Why not look for yourself? Open up Microsoft.Common.Targets (found under %windir%\Microsoft.NET) and you'll see a section like so: BeforeClean; CleanReferencedProjects; UnmanagedUnregistration; CoreClean; CleanPublishFolder; AfterClean Keep reading to see exactly what each of those sub-targets does. (Some, of course, are just stubs for the user to override). Personally, I like to see what shenanigans my fancy-pants IDE is up to behind my back. To this end, I'd recommend increasing the amount of info written to the Output window. Tools -> Options -> Projects & Solutions -> Build & Run -> MSBuild verbosity -> change from "Minimal" to "Normal" or "Detailed." Try your Clean operation again and watch the output now! Correlating what you see to the *.targets files is a good way to start learning MSBuild.
