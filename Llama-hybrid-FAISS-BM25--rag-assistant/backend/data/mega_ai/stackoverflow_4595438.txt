My applet doesnâ€™t see the external libraries. ..They are just native libraries, .. .class files .. OK. If then, you mean 'natives' as in files of type .dll, .so etc., that is problematic for an applet in that they cannot use the natives unless they are already installed in the appropriate directory of the user system. Having said that, recent developments allow us to deploy an embedded applet using Java webstart (JWS). JWS makes use of natives easy. Simply put them in the root of a Jar file and add them to a nativelib element in the (XML based) launch file (file type .jnlp). Even better, JWS can separate the downloads into resources for different operating systems, so Windows gets the .dll natives, while *nix get the .so natives. JWS offers many more useful features, but the important thing here is that they can make natives available to applets. Use of native libs in an applet, requires the applet to be trusted.
