logistic regression's criteria of prediction probability in r

I performed classification analysis as using the glm() . The dependent variable has a value of 0 and 1, and the probability is measured using the predict function as follows. glm.prob If it exceeds 0.5, it is 1, and if it is less than 0.5, it is considered as 0. But I have a question. Why is the standard 0.5? 0.7 or 0.3 etc .. Can not other values?
