Are you using IE? IE doesnt recognize SVG anyway. Microsoft is always ten years behind, yet they are more popular and far more costly, for some reason. Name brand propaganda? SVG loads in Firefox. Both as an XML document referenced directly in the URL, and also if you embed it into an XHTML (fully XML compliant) document with proper namespacing, the SVG should render properly. The great thing about this option is that DHTML can manipulate your SVG. Everything I said in this paragraph also applies to MathML, if youre curious. Aside from that, SVG doesn't load from an image tag. I do believe Firefox is working on this upgrade, though. Im not entirely sure. Using the object or embed tag is reasonable, I suppose... but one of my earlier fixes was to use an iframe. Embed an iframe in your html that references the complete SVG file. Using CSS you can make the iframe look flush with the rest of your document, appearing and acting like an image. Encased in a div or span tag, you can have onhover and onclick event handlers. Using the image tag, your src can be a PHP file on server side. If properly coded and with the appropriate cgi apps, you can rasterize your SVG on server-side, and have that PNG data sent back to your image via the PHP src.
