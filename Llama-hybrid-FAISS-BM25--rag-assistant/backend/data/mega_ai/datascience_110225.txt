Simply extract feature from temporal data and add it to your columns and use it for prediction. This is the simplest approach. Another one is to use any embedding method for converting temporal data into vectors and use those vectors along with other features (what you call static features). Autoencoders, graph-based time-series embeddings or transformers (from NLP field) can be used for such embeddings. In general you can do a simple research to see what kind of methods are out there for embedding of time-series .
