split XML file by elements

This is similar question with few differences : Split XML file into multiple files based on a threshold value My root element is called stores, and elements to split are called store. And I want to do this from java with xsl or without, here is my java code which I used to trigger the xsl : public void transform(String transformator, File source, String destination) { try { TransformerFactory tFactory = TransformerFactory.newInstance(); Transformer transformer = tFactory.newTransformer(new StreamSource(transformatorLocation)); try { transformer.transform(new StreamSource(new InputStreamReader(new FileInputStream(source), "UTF-8")), new StreamResult(new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(destination), "UTF-8"))); } catch (TransformerException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } catch (FileNotFoundException e) { System.err.println("File is missing"); e.printStackTrace(); } catch (UnsupportedEncodingException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } catch (TransformerConfigurationException e) { e.printStackTrace(); } } I've tried both solutions in this question, but they both produce erros, one is : ERROR: 'Unsupported XSL element ' http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform:for-each-group '' javax.xml.transform.TransformerException: java.lang.RuntimeException: Unsupported XSL element ' http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform:for-each-group ' Other is that style sheet can't be compiled. What I try to accomplish ? Pass argument to java class how many stores do I want in one file, and split it into n parts.
