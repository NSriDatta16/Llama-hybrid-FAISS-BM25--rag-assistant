The solution you are looking for is called Bayesian decision theory. It constructs the Bayesian posterior density function as you would for any purely statistical question, but then minimizes a cost function over that posterior density to find the lowest cost point solution. You could treat different models as parameters themselves and solve for the probabilities that the models are good models, and then over that space, which would be discrete, impose a cost so that if you had two models that were close in probability but vastly different in cost you could allow the interaction of costs and probabilities to decide your model. The model could then be used predictively, again with a cost function, and then scored based on the cost of the prediction being wrong. Parmigiani produces a good book on introductory Bayesian and Pearson-Neyman decision theory. Its ISBN-13 is 9780471496571. This may cause your business office to rethink their costing as well. When you impose discipline and structure on the decision making, people start talking about their hidden assumptions. It does happen, from time to time, that when people talk about things out loud with others a better model appears.
