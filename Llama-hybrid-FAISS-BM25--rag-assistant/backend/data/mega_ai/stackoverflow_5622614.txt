Maybe the google maps API for flash can help you: Here's a beginners guide http://code.google.com/intl/nl-NL/apis/maps/documentation/flash/intro.html#SettingUp UPDATE: Maybe I can guide you in the right direction on how to do it: You'll need two movieclips. One for zoom (scale adjustments, use a slider, scroll up / down events , or provide both), and one for dragging (just use the builtin StartDrag on movieclip.MOUSE_DOWN / MOUSE_UP), put one inside the other, so that your map zooms in as you'd expect it. Good luck.
