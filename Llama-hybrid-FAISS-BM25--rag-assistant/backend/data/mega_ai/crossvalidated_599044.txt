What can cause prediction delay in decision tree-based regressions?

I am experiencing a delay between the test data and predictions after some time: The first row is earlier than the second row. Data are residuals calculated on time series velocity data. Why does such a delay occur? How can I investigate this further? Edit: To clarify, in the first row that corresponds to the first 50k points, there is no delay, in the second row that corresponds to the last 50k points, there is a delay. So delay occurs after some time.
