So my question is, is logistic regression only used in classification tasks? Name Logistic regression indicates that we could use this algorithm for regression problems. Or can it be used for curve fitting? It could be used to curve fitting. If not what are the other available techniques to fit a logistic like curve to a set of data points? Try numpy or scipy: https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.optimize.curve_fit.html https://lmfit.github.io/lmfit-py/model.html
