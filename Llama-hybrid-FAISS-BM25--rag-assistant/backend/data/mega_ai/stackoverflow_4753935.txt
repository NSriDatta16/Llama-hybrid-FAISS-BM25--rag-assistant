One thing that many people don't realize is that the LinkChild/LinkMaster fields can actually be any valid expression. So, you could have subForm1's LinkChild/LinkMaster properties be: LinkMaster CustomerID LinkChild CustomerID Then subForm2 could have this: LinkMaster subForm1.Form!InvoiceID LinkChild InvoiceID ...and so forth. I can't imagine going much deeper than that, but it's possible. You might also consider if a cascading datasheet form might do the trick, using subdatasheets. You can even have a datasheet display a non-datasheet form as its subdatasheet (something I disconvered entirely accidentally when I switched a a parent form having a subform into datasheet view -- the subform remained displayed in form view). With subdatasheets, you don't have any issues with number of forms, or the limitation on embedding continuous forms.
