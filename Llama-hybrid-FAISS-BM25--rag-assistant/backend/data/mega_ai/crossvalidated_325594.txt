"Introduction to Time Series Analysis and Forecasting" (Wiley Series in Probability and Statistics) 2nd Edition by Montgomery,‎ Jennings,‎ and Kulahci has a nice (but very brief) introduction to the topic in Chapter 7. There is also "Bayesian Forecasting and Dynamic Models" by West and Harrison (I personally haven't read it). Many texts and tutorials treat Bayesian forecasting under the more general category of State Space time series models. You might want to look those up.
