I suggest just taking something from http://openlayers.org/dev/examples/ and changing it to suit your needs. Convert the multipolygon field to JSON data, read in the JSON data in javascript (see the OL parser documentation) and display it on the map. Others may suggest some way of leveraging the django-admin js, but I never found that to be sufficient. If you have specific questions about any of these steps, just ask another question and hopefully I'll be able to answer.
