TFSBuildServiceHost start error referencing Elmah SQLite.dll

Installed the TFS 2010 build service and when trying to start the tfsbuildservicehost I get the following errror (this is on a Windows Server 2008, patched and updated, and we are not using SQLite). This is happening twice for the build controller, the build agent and the build service. TFSBuildServiceHost Service 'MVC Build Agent' had an exception: Exception Message: Problem with loading custom assemblies: API restriction: The assembly 'file:///C:\Users\Administrator\AppData\Local\Temp\BuildAgent\1\Utilities\Elmah\lib\x64\System.Data.SQLite.DLL' has already loaded from a different location. It cannot be loaded from a new location within the same appdomain. (type Exception)
