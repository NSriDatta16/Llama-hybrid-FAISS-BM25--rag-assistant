If I understand correctly, you are looking to conduct a bootstrap to estimate the sampling distribution of the mean and standard deviation. The following R code would suffice: # using dplyr, purrr, and ggplot2 packages from the tidyverse library(dplyr) library(purrr) library(ggplot2) # your data my_data That being said, if you just want to estimate the mean and standard deviation of your data, then you can use the method of moments (sample mean and bias-corrected sample sd) or maximum likelihood (sample mean and sample sd). If you are looking for a Bayesian approach (where uncertainty in the parameters is described as a probability distribution) you could use the normal-inverse gamma distribution as a conjugate prior.
