TheSam is right, you can create collapsible chunks with the #pragma region and #pragma endregion statements. Here is a sample: int main(array args) { Console::WriteLine(L"This"); Console::WriteLine(L"is"); Console::WriteLine(L"a"); #pragma region Console::WriteLine(L"pragma"); Console::WriteLine(L"region"); #pragma endregion Console::WriteLine(L"test."); return 0; } In the above sample, everything between the samples can be collapsed. You can also specify what text is displayed when it is collapsed. You can do that like this: #pragma region The displayed text That would obviously display "The displayed text" when the region was collapsed.
