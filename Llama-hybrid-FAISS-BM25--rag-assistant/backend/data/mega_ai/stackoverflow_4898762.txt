WP7 - IsTrial() method - always returning false (SIDELOADED and PRODUCTION)

Am I doing something incorrectly with this? My app went out last night, but I noticed that my code for the free trial wasn't firing. This method is being called and it always returning FALSE (Full Mode) . What am I doing wrong? Right now my app is free :( private static Boolean IsTrial() { #if DEBUG return false; #endif var license = new Microsoft.Phone.Marketplace.LicenseInformation(); return license.IsTrial(); } Currently I have this app sideloaded on my machine. I am updating my pivot header and setting the status for the various checks I have. Right now in the SIDELOADED version it always returns false. I downloaded my app from the MarketPlace last night (as a Free Trial). The production version is always returning False and so is the Sideloaded version. Any ideas? This is my calling code (just in case anyone is interested): private void MainPage_Loaded(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e) { pivotPills.Title = "PillBox v1.2 - Checking Mode:"; App.ViewModel.RefreshTrialMode(); pivotPills.Title = "PillBox v1.2 - Count:" + App.ViewModel.trialItemCollection.Count.ToString(); //Checking Trial Mode: if (App.ViewModel.trialItemCollection.Count == 0) { trialMode tm = new trialMode(); tm.IsTrial = true; tm.Save(); pivotPills.Title = "PillBox v1.2 - Trial Mode:" + App.ViewModel.trialItemCollection.Count.ToString(); } else { if (App.ViewModel.trialItemCollection[0].IsTrial == true) //If saved isTrial = true (still a trial) then check MarketPlace Task { if (IsTrial() == false) //Purchased App { App.ViewModel.trialItemCollection[0].IsTrial = false; StorageHelper.Save >(App.trialModeData, App.ViewModel.trialItemCollection); pivotPills.Title = "PillBox v1.2 - Unlimited"; } else //Still in Trial Mode { //show marketplace window NavigationService.Navigate(new Uri("/MarketPlace.xaml", UriKind.Relative)); } } } }
