You might prevent the noobish crackers from finding references to "SignerIdentity" in your code by applying ROT13 or a similar simple obscuring algorithm http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13 After applying ROT13, "SignerIdentity" would become "FvtareVqragvgl". Anyway, the answer to your question (how you get the size of the Info.plist file): NSBundle *bundle = [NSBundle mainBundle]; NSString* bundlePath = [bundle bundlePath]; NSFileManager *fileManager = [NSFileManager defaultManager]; NSString* path = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%@/Info.plist", bundlePath ]; NSDictionary *fileAttributes = [fileManager attributesOfItemAtPath:path error:NULL]; if (fileAttributes != nil) { NSNumber *fileSize; if (fileSize = [fileAttributes objectForKey:NSFileSize]) { NSLog(@"File size: %qi\n", [fileSize unsignedLongLongValue]); } } Also keep in mind that the size (in bytes) of the Info.plist in your Xcode project directory and the Info.plist inside the bundle may differ. You probably want to build the game once, then look at the size of /Info.plist and then update your antipiracy code.
