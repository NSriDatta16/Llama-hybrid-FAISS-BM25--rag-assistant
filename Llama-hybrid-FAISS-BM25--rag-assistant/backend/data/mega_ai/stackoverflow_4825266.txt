There is no such thing as __usercall. Hex-rays uses this to represent a non-standard calling convention. This can happen in three ways: The programmer used assembly The programmer is using Open Watcom's #pragma aux to define a custom convention The programmer is using Visual C++ 7+, which optimizes register allocation to prevent thrashing In cases like this, there are only two ways to go, use assembly or use Open Watcom (which just got an update after years of abandonment). Inline assembly works best IMO, but you'll need a wrapper going in (to call the original) and a wrapper coming out (to hook the original).
