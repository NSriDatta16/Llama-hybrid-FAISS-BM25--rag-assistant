Your question includes aspects of basic longitudinal data analysis, time-series analysis, and multi-state time-to-event analysis. Each of those is complicated enough; combining them can be even trickier. As you seem to be starting out with this type of study, I recommend that you find an experienced local expert to help with this. There is no way that a question-and-answer site like this can provide enough help. Here are links to some general principles to understand and apply, which should make your conversations with a statistician more fruitful. You seem already to understand of the role of serial correlation with single outcome variables, as indicated by your related question . Chapter 7 of Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies is a useful introduction to the general problem of dealing with longitudinal responses, discussing the relative advantages of several approaches. Note that standard mixed modeling can make hidden and potentially invalid assumptions about serial correlations. The problem of multiple types of correlated observations over time, which you seem to be getting at in another question , is addressed by time-series analysis . Forecasting: Principles and Practice by Hyndman and Athanasopoulos is an accessible resource. The simplest methods rely on having evenly spaced observations in time, which you don't seem to have. Nevertheless, understanding those simplest methods will help you understand the additional considerations with unevenly spaced observations. Time-to-event analysis is sometimes just called "survival analysis" for simplicity. Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies starting from Chapter 17 is a good introduction to the principles. As explained in vignettes for the R survival package , the methods are readily extended to time-varying covariate values and to multiple types of events . Chapter 22 of Regression Modeling Strategies explains approaches that are particularly helpful with ordered outcomes, as for cancer stages. An important trick with time-varying covariates in time-to-event analysis is finding an appropriate model of the association between covariate history and event risk. Simple models associate the current values of covariates with current risk of an event (e.g., a step up in cancer stage). What's more likely, however, is that some integrated or rolling-average measure of past covariate values is what's associated with current event risk. That requires applying your understanding of the subject matter. A properly constructed joint model of covariates over time and times-to-events should be able to put all this together, in principle. The R Survival Task View has links to many tools for constructing such models. As you seem to be starting out with this type of analysis, I'd recommend that you study and apply Bayesian approaches to this problem. My sense is that Bayesian approaches are increasingly favored over frequentist approaches, although I'm certainly not an expert on that. The rstanarm package in R is one choice for implementation; it has a vignette specifically on joint models. The vignette doesn't seem to illustrate a multi-state model like you would seem to need, but it should provide a useful introduction to principles that can then be extended to more complex scenarios.
