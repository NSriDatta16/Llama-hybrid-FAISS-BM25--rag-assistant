SQL Server Agent job fails with "The step was cancelled (stopped) as the result of a stop job request"

Since 3 days ago, an SQL Server 2005 Agent job that's used to retrieve data from an odbc data source (Microsoft XAL) fails with the following error: "Executed as user: NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM. The step was cancelled (stopped) as the result of a stop job request.". As far as I can tell, we didn't change anything in the configuration of the job in the last few days. Any ideas what settings I should check to find the cause of the problem? Or had somebody had similar problems? Thanks in advance!
