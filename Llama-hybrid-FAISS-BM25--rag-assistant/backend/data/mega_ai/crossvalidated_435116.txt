So what you have is a logistic regression model, where $\boldsymbol\beta$ are your regression coefficients and $\boldsymbol X$ is your data. Now, the likelihood function for your model is: $$\prod_{i=1}^{4}\text{Pr}(Y=y_{i}\,|\,X=x_{i})=\prod_{i=1}^{4}p(x_{i};\boldsymbol\beta)^{y_{i}}\big(1-p(x_{i};\boldsymbol\beta)\big)^{1-y_{i}}$$ where $y_{i}\in\{0,1\}$ is your outcome. Now, what you are being asked to do is to evaluate the likelihood function given the parameters and data. So what this means is, to take the likelihood function and input the data and the parameter values you've been given using the function you'd originally provided (with a small correction) $$ \begin{align} p(x_i;\boldsymbol\beta)&=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-b_{0}-b_{1}\cdot x_{1,i}-b_{2}\cdot x_{2,i})}\\ \end{align}$$ So, for example, for $i=1$ (your first observation) $$ \begin{align} p(x_1;\boldsymbol\beta)&=\frac{1}{1+\exp(-b_{0}-b_{1}\cdot x_{1,1}-b_{2}\cdot x_{2,1})}\\ &=\frac{1}{1+\exp(0.75+0.03\times 0.5-0.01\times5)}\\ &\approx 0.3285 \end{align}$$
