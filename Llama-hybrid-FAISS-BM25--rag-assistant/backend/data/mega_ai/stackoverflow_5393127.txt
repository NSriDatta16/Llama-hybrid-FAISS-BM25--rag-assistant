It doesn't seem to be too straightforward to use the iPhone Simulator on PPC Macs. Issue the command file with the path in the first error you get (right after the first ld warning: ). Check out this related question , maybe these steps help. Old answer: Did you link libsqlite3.dylib in your project? In Xcode 4 this can be done like shown in the screenshot: Press the plus sign and add libsqlite3.dylib . Afterwards, you can drag the library into the Linked Frameworks folder. (The screenshot shows a Mac OS X application, it's the same for iOS applications.)
