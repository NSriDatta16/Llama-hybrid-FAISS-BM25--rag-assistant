If you don't want a Windows service then starting the application with windows is an option. You can use the following code to do that. Dim regKey As RegistryKey regKey = Registry.CurrentUser.OpenSubKey("Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run", True) regKey.SetValue(Application.ProductName, Application.ExecutablePath) regKey.Close() What did you mean by schedule the sync? Is it a diff service? Then you can use the timer and then store the user settings in an xml file or a DB. If you want a simple storage then you can use My.Settings . Edit: I think the only way is to check for the date when the app starts and then check the date periodically. Another option is to use the task scheduler programatically. Task Scheduler Managed Wrapper is an open source wrapper which you can try out.
