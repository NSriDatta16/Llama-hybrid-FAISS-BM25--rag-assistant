what tends to happen in large organizations is that over time everything is either monolithic or disparate systems everywhere or a little of both. Someone eventually comes in and says we've got a mess. Now, you want to re-design (money to someone) everything to be oriented in a sort of monotlithic depends on who you pay paradigm but at the same time be able to add pieces and parts independently of the master/monolith. So you buy Oracle's SOA and Oracle becomes the boss of all your parts. All the other players coming in have to work with SOA via a service (web service or whatever it has.) The Oracle monolith takes care of everything (monolith is not meant derogatory). Oh yeah, you got ASP.NET MVC on the front or something else. main thing is moving things in and out of they system without impact and keeping the vendor Oracle SOA, Microsoft WCF, as the brains of it all. everything's all oop/ood like, fluid, things moving in and out with little to no impact, even human services, not just computers. To me it just means a bunch of web services (or whatever we call them in the future) with a good front end. And if you own the database just hit the database and stop worrying about buzzwords. it's okay.
