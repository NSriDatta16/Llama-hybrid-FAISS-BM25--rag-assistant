Taking the difference of two Markov chains produced by the same (?) Gibbs sampler does not tell us much about the stationary distribution of these Markov chains and about their convergence properties. It will mostly reflect on the noise at each iteration and on the impact of the starting values. The relevant thing to check in my opinion is whether the stationary distributions of both chains are the same, which can be evaluated by averages and frequencies. For instance, here are two chains created by Gibbs sampling from two different starting points T=1e3 x=y=z=w=rep(0,T) x[1]=y[1]=-1 z[1]=w[1]=+1 for (t in 2:T){ x[t]=.9*y[t-1]+sqrt(.9)*rnorm(1) z[t]=.9*w[t-1]+sqrt(.9)*rnorm(1) y[t]=.9*x[t]+sqrt(.9)*rnorm(1) w[t]=.9*z[t]+sqrt(.9)*rnorm(1) } plot(x,y,type="l",col="steelblue") lines(z,y,col="sienna") plot(x-z,y-w,type="l",col="gold4") The plot of the difference (right) does not tell much about the different behaviour of the two chains (left):
