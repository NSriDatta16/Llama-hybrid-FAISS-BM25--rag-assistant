What are good metrics to assess the quality of a PCA fit, in order to select the number of components?

What is a good metric for assessing the quality of principal component analysis (PCA)? I performed this algorithm on a dataset. My objective was to reduce the number of features (the information was very redundant). I know the percentage of variance kept is a good indicator of how much information we keep, be are there other information metrics I can use to make sure I removed redundant information and didn't 'lose' such information?
