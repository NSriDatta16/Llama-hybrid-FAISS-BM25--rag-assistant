Predict the missing pixel value by CNN

The data is images which resize to 256*256. And for per 8x8 area, we remove 4 pixels from the 8x8 block. Then iter this process to whole image. So the task is how to use per block pixels value(60 pixels value) to predict removed 4 pixels value. Use deep learning, especially CNN. Please give me some advice.
