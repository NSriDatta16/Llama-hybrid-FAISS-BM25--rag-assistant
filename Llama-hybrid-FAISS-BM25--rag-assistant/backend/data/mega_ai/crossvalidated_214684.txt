Is this controversial that in PCA, we want the variance as large as possible, while in bayesian, a large variance means a low precision?

I am wondering about the variance. We say the variance is inverse proportional to precision, then we also say the variance is proportional to the information, which means that a large variance means you have a lot of information. In my mind, this is a bit controversial. I am confused about that whether a large variance is good or not? or do we need a trade-off criteria?
