Is there a good natural language processing library

I need to implement some NLP in my current module. I am looking for some good library that can help me here. I came across 'LingPipe' but could not completely follow on how to use it. Basically, we need to implement a feature where the application can decipher customer instructions (delivery instructions) typed in plain english. Eg: Will pick up at 12:00 noon tomorrow Request delivery after 10th June Please do not send before Wednesday Add 10 more units of XYZ to the order
