How to add the effect of structual change points (level shift, local time trends, changes in seasonal pulses ) in ARIMA IN PYTHON?

I am working on a time series forecasting problem. As I came to know that I was not considering structural changes and seasonal dummies and was building a simple ARIMA that was causing a very poor fit . I added monthly and day dummies and provided them as exogenous variable in seasonal ARIMA (SARIMAX) ,which improved the model somewhat. with respect to the the ARIMA model- I want to ask how to add the effect of change points in ARIMAX/SARIMAX in python and I also want to understand the conceptual understanding of after adding these change points how does the cost function/parameter estimation of the of the model changes ?
