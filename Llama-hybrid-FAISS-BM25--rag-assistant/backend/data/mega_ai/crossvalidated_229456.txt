Logistic regression with multi-level categorical predictors

I am working through the examples in Andy Field’s Discovering Statistics with R. I am stuck on the last Task (Task 3) of the Smart Alex exercises for Chapt 8 logistic regression (tasks are here: https://studysites.uk.sagepub.com/dsur/study/DSUR%20Smart%20Alex-Labcoat%20Leni-Self%20Test%20Answers/DSUR%20Chapter%2008%20Web%20Material.pdf , data are here: https://studysites.uk.sagepub.com/dsur/study/articles.htm . The example starts on page 25 of the Pdf). The example looks at predicting the probability of condom use based on several predictor variables (output for the coefficients and odds ratios pasted below). What I’m stuck on is the interpretation of the coefficients and odds ratio for a predictor variable that is categorical and has three levels (the predictor in question is previous condom use, labelled “previous” in the example). There are three categories of previous condom use ("No condom", "Condom used", "First Time with Partner"). In the model summary, there are coefficients for 1)"PreviousCondomUsed" and 2)"PreviousFirst Time with Partner". I would interpret these parameters as 1) "PreviousCondomUsed": the difference in the coefficients and odds ratio between "Condom Used" and the reference category "No condom", and 2)"PreviousFirst Time with Partner": the difference in the coefficients and odds ratio between "First Time with Partner" and the reference category "No Condom". However, the answers to Task 3 (in the Pdf) explain the "PreviousCondomUsed” coefficient, for example, as comparing group "CondomUsed" with the other two groups. I don’t think this is correct, I would have thought that this parameter was comparing group "CondomUsed" with the reference group "NoCondom". Am I correct in assuming that when there are more than 2 levels of a categorical predictor variable in logistic regression, a level is chosen as the baseline level, and then pairwise comparisons are made between each level of the predictor and the baseline? In relation to the example, am I correct in assuming that the parameters "PreviousCondomUsed" and "PreviousFirst Time with Partner" are comparing level "CondomUsed" with level "NoCondom", and comparing "First Time with Partner" with "NoCondom" respectively?
