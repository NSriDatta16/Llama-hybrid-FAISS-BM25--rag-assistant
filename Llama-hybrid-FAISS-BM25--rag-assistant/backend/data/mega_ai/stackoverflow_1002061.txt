adding new arifacts to archiva

I'm using Archiva as my repository manager. It is setup so the users hit the archiva repo and if it doesn't hvae it, the archiva repo will then check the maven central repo (the internal repo proxies the maven central). Now if I want to add a new dependency to the archiva repository, is there a command I can run to tell it to go fetch it from the maven central repo or do I need to manually upload it? thanks, Jeff
