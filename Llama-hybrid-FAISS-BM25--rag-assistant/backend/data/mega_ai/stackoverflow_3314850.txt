The Intel Fortran and C++ compilers can certainly do this, use the -sox option. So, yes there is a way. I don't know of any widespread convention for embedding such information in a binary and I generally use Emacs in hexl-mode for reading the embedded information, which is quite hackish. '-sox' also embeds the compiler options used to build an executable, which is very useful.
