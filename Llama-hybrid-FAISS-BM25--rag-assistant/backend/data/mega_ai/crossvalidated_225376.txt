If they're doing it right, something happens approximately three-fourths of those times when they say it had a 75% chance of happening. (or more generally, the same idea adapted over all percentage forecasts) It is possible to ascribe more meaning than that depending on our philosophical opinions and how much we believe the models, but this pragmatic point of view is something of a lowest common denominator â€” at the very least, statistical methods try (although possibly as a side effect rather than directly) to make forecasts obeying this pragmatic point of view.
