Anomaly detection can be supervised, unsupervised, or semi-supervised. In the supervised case, each point in the training set has a given label that says whether or not it's an anomaly. The anomaly detector is trained to correctly reproduce these labels. In the unsupervised case, no labels are available, and anomalies are defined as points that are dissimilar in some sense to most of the points in the training set. In the semi-supervised case, a subset of training points is labeled, and the anomaly detector is trained to correctly identify the labeled points, but also take advantage of information in the unlabeled points. What if data show clustering structures (not a single chunk)? In this case do we resort to unsupervised clustering to construct the density? If yes, how to do it? If labels are available, it would make sense to take advantage of them by training in the supervised or semi-supervised regime. If there are no labels, there's no choice but to go unsupervised. In either case, one could explicitly try to account for clustered structure or not. For example, methods like Gaussian mixture models treat clusters explicitly. Alternatively, methods like one-class SVMs and isolation forests can handle clustered data, but don't explicitly model clusters.
