How to get the wattage recorded by a dlsr from an image?

I am doing a physics lab where I need to take photos of a light and the intensity of the light changes. I have the photos but I need to understand how to get the average wattage from the images. There are open CV examples of seen but they don't tell me the units of the output of the example.
