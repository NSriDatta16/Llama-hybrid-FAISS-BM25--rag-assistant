The downvotes are because of the topic, but I'll attempt to answer your question as best I can since it's here. Data science is a term that is thrown around as loosely as Big Data. Everyone has a rough idea of what they mean by the term, but when you look at the actual work tasks, a data scientist's responsibilities will vary greatly from company to company. Statistical analysis could encompass the entirety of the workload in one job, and not even be a consideration for another. I wouldn't chase after a job title per se. If you are interested in the field, network (like you are doing now) and find a good fit. If you are perusing job ads, just look for the ones that stress statistical and informatics backgrounds. Hadoop and SQL are both easy to become familiar with given the time and motivation, but I would stick with the areas you are strongest in and go from there.
