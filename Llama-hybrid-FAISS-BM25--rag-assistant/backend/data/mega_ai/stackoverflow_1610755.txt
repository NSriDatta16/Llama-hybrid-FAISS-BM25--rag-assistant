How to recover repository using SVN hotcopy?

Okay. I used svn's hotcopy to make incremental back-ups, now how do I test that the hotcopies will work properly? I searched the posts here regarding hotcopy. Most of them seem to just be encouraging the use of the svn hotcopy, but not talking about how to recover using hotcopy once made. Is there any advice about how to recover using the hotcopy that I've made? I also checked http://svnbook.red-bean.com/ , but couldn't really find anything. Thanks.
