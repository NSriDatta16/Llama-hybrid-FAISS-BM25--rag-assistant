One straightforward method you can consider is to try to estimate the probability of the error classes using a Bayesian approach. The beta distribution is the conjugate prior of the binomial distribution, so you could fit a beta distribution to your true/false positives to get an estimate of the confidence. I think that's essentially what's going on in this paper: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e399/9a46cb8aaf71131a77670da5c5c113aad01d.pdf
