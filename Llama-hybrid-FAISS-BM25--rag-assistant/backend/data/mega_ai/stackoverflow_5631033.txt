Dragdrop from listbox to listbox in silverlight

I am using a listbox to bind the data coming from the database, once the binding is done there is another listbox where i have to drag and drop the contents of the first listbox. I am able to drag and drop it but nothing is visible in the 2nd listbox(but the content is moving from the 1st to 2nd listbox). The same thing i tried by hardcoding the items in the 1st listbox and everything worked fine. If anybody has experienced similar kind of problem, please help.
