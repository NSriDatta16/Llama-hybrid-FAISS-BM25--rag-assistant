Probability based on aggregated data with overlapping data points

Say I have 20 individuals: 2 of them did event $A$ 8 others did event $B$ 10 did both events $A$ and $B$ Therefore, I can build the following table: Did 1 action Did 2 actions A 2 10 B 8 10 Here is how I want to interpret this: Given that someone did event $A$, they have a 10/12 (80%) chance to have also done $B$ Given that someone did event $B$, they have a 10/18 (55%) chance to have also done $A$ On average, given that someone has done an event, $A$ or $B$, that person has a 67.5% chance to have done another Now if I describe my data like this: Did 1 action Did 2 actions 10 10 I'm not sure how to interpret this compared to the data above. In the first table, I think I have the probability of $A+B$ given $A$ and the probability of $A+B$ given $B$. In the other table, I have the probability of $A+B$ given ($A$ or $B$). But if this is a real world example, and I want to know what is the likelihood that someone will commit the second action given that they have already committed one, what probability should I retain? Can these figures be interpreted as probabilities at all or am I making a mistake there as well? Am I using the wrong metrics / methodology?
