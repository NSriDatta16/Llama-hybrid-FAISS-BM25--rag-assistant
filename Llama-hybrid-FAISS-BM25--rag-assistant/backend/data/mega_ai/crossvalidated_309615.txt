If variables represent different physical quantities their scaling can be different. By changing units (e.g. from measuring distance in kilometers to measuring distance in nanometers) you can change the scaling of a variable arbitrarily, so why would you even consider removing low-variance variables? What does make sense though is that if you have a large number of predictors, they are probably highly correlated with each other. So you can use PCA on the training data to collect correlated features into principal components. Again, however, the scaling is relevant here. So unless all your variables are really measured in the same units, I would z-score (remove mean, divide by std) the data first and then apply PCA.
