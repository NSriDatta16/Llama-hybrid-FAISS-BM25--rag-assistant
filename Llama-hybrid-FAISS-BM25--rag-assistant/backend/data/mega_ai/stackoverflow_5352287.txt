I see you have the code if (n.left != null) { current = n.left; sort(current, a); } but I can't seem to find at which point you set current back at the current node so that when you do a[i] = current.obj; you get the correct result. That's probably why you're not getting all the results. In any case I don't see (at least from the code fragments you have posted) why current needs to be a class variable and not just declared in the sort method. In general you shouldn't be using class variables if you don't really need them. Edit: You can either set current back to the node you are processing after calling sort on the left child like this current = n; a[i] = current.obj; i++; Or not use current at all in which case you'd have something like if (n.left != null) sort(n.left, a); a[i] = n.obj; i++; if (n.right != null) sort(n.right, a);
