Multiple Hypothesis Testing with Categorical Variables and Alternatives

Suppose we have a variable $Y_i$ which is a binary categorical variable, and we have a variables: $X_{i,1}$, $X_{i,2}$, ....$X_{i,n}$ ($i=1,2,....N$ where $N$ is sample size, and $n$ is the number of variables, and $n >N$), which are also binary categorical variables. And, suppose we want to understand the relationship between $Y$ and these variables individually (not controlling for a certain $X$). We could do $n$ Chi-Square tests (assuming the appropriate cell counts) between $Y$ and each $X_i$. However, with large $n$ (say >100) we would expect to have at least a few false positives. Using a Bonferoni correction might severely limit your power. Another alternative I was thinking of was a forward stepwise logistic regression where you only let a variable enter the model if the associated p-value is less than some criteria say 0.05. Yet, that has its own challenges like conveying statistical significance if the p-value of one variable changes by introducing another. I suspect there is no "best practice", but please let me know if I am incorrect. My question is are any of these ideas just bad practice? Is there literature showing one of these ideas is much better than others? (I can't find any).
