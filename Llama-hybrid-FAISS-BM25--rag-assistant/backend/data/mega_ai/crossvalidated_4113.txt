I've found that the books I've read tend to mention the "why" behind diff and log. And it's easy to see for yourself. Try this: data (AirPassengers) plot (AirPassengers) Notice the seasonal pattern, but also notice the upward trend. So try plot (diff (AirPassengers)) See how the upward trend is gone? By looking at the change each month instead of the actual data, you're seeing the patterns more clearly. You've stabilized the time series in some sense. But also note that the pattern gets larger towards the right side of the graph. That's because the pattern is not additive (add amount Y), but rather multiplicative (add a percentage, or multiply). Logs turn multiplication into addition, so: plot (diff (log (AirPassengers))) and you have a stable pattern that you can better perceive what's actually happening over time to the pattern, independently of the trend. A time series with this kind of stability is called "stationary". (Of course, "stationary" has a very technical meaning beyond looking "stable", but let's not go there for now.) Obviously, the first step to analysis is to understand and preprocess your data and a graph of the raw data is an essential step in the process. Graphing the diff(log(foo)) is just confirming that you understand the data and the results look appropriate, and it gives you a bit more insight into the seasonal patterns of the data. There are also tests (ADF, etc) and graphs (ACF) that would be used to confirm that differencing of a series is called for, but it can't hurt to look at things as well. So the transformation reveals the de-trended data (if the transform is indeed called for) for you to look at, and it is the data that you will actually feed into follow-on analysis. (Though some software you use will do the diff and the log under-the-hood for you and you'll only ever see the output which is reversed back to the original data scale)
