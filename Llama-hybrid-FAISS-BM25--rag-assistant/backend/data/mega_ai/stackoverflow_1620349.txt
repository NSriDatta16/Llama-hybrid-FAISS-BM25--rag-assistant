The main flash window can be linked to a custom class of your choice that inherits from MovieClip. You'll see at the bottom of the Flash UI a property called document class. If you set this to a class of your own choice you can start using it as the main window. For example say you have a class called MainWindow (for simplicity) that you link to your .fla through the document class property. If you then drag a movieclip named car onto the stage and give it an instance name of "theCar" you could access it through the MainWindow class file by simply typing: theCar.alpha = .5; Or if you wish to dynamically add items you would have to link the movieclips themselves to classes that you can then create instances of. For example if you link the care movieclip to a class called Car_mc you could instantiate it in the main window class like this: var car:MovieClip = new Car_mc(); addChild(car); This would instantiate the movieclip and add it to the stage as a child of your main class. To link a movieclip to a class you simply right click the symbol in the library and choose "linkage" and then check "export for actionscript" then you can fill in a class name and a baseclass for that symbol and instantiate it as I described above.
