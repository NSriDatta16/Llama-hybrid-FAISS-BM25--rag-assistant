Before answering your questions, let's understand a few points - 1. Model training is nothing but finding the right weights going through the guiding path based on the loss function o/p using y_true and y_pred. Training starts with random initialization of weights( definitely following some rules ) 2. Neural Network training is an incremental training approach i.e. it doesn't see all the data in one go like the DecisionTree Can I use the current model with weights and bias to retrain on augmented data (from the same initial dataset)? I am guessing there are 2 possible outcomes, it tunes the model or it "resets" the weights and bias Yes, learning will continue without any big disruption as augmented images will produce a similar gradient like the real images. It will not reset, as I said the training is an incremental process. Any new image which has completely different features can definitely cause a large gradient to flow and might disrupt the weights but with augmented images, I don't think any such thing should happen . Can I perform hyperparameter tuning with RandomSearchCV or GridSearchCV using on my existing model? I believe this will tune the model. You can do this but you don't have too many hyperparameters left as Model is fixed. You may tune Learning rate.
