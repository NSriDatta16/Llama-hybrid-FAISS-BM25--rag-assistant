How to tell if there is any improvement, statistically

My statistic knowledge only goes so far as to understand those basic statistic terms, instead of applying them, yet this is a questions on applying statistic knowledge into real world case. For statistic terms like Mean , Median , & Mode etc, my knowledge only limits to a simple distribution like this: However, from histogram, I found the actual distribution that I'm getting is more or less like this: It's not 100% like this, but the point is that there are multiple distributions apparent within the histogram . I.e., I'm able to identify observations from several different populations from the histograms. UPDATE: To give a more detailed explanation, think of the time when manufacturing was label intensive -- each person carries out the same task at different speeds than others; Moreover, each time your measure their speed to finish the work, the measures are slightly difference than others even for the same person. This is the situation. The goal is to measure if a new approach can improve the overall speed or not. UPDATE 3: , Having provided "UPDATE 2" as per request, I'd like to stress that my focus is not on any specific set of data, or any specific scenario, as you can see that I've kept changing the situations that my question would apply. The reason is that, I want to know, conceptually, how to solve all these kind of problems statistically. I.e., I believe the scenario I describe above is a rather common one. I'd be surprise that there is no existing statistical theory/practice that covers this -- finding the "truth" while eliminating the impact of the outliers. Intuitively, I was first thinking, if the variation is so big, and representing them with a single line (value of Mean or Median etc) is not enough, then how about representing them with a band? I.e., there ought to be some statistical theory/practice that covers this common problem. Now I'm forced to pick up statistics books again myself, and I've started reading for several days. For the representing them with a band idea, I found the interquartile range somewhat close to what I was thinking. It is resistant to the influence of outliers, but I'm more interested in value of interquartile's Q1 and Q3, than their differences, i.e., the band rather than the gap . Further on finding exiting statistical theory/practice, I also found Median Absolute Deviation (MAD) , which is a robust measure of central tendency. I also found the term Robust statistics which are " statistics with good performance for data drawn from a wide range of non-normally distributed probability distributions " (ref: here ), which looks to me quite close to what I'm searching for. These are the finding I got from these several days of quick brush up, meaning, I am now knowing more terms now, but still not know how applicable they are to the above problem. These, are what I'm asking for, the exiting statistical theory/practice that deal with this situation. Please help. Talking about different situations that my question would apply, now here is another one -- think of the case that different people would bid on different prices for a stock. This is for sure a non-normally distributed probability distributions. So in scenario, my question is, when situation changed, are most people bidding more, or bidding less? and how much differences (in %) than before. This the exact same question I'm asking here. UPDATE 2: , actual data The three sets at the end of this post are the actual data I'm talking about. The sample numbers are only around 50, too low for the multiple distributions case, but if you plot the histogram, you can see the hint that there are multiple distributions in them. The Val is my target. There are many many factors contributing to its variation. I think the major one is cause by the random sampling method I explained below, and I believe it is a running average of all players in the game, just like averaging all bidders bidding price in the stock. Some bidders bid aggressively (higher value) and some don't. But at the end of the day, its measured value is all that I collect and compare. All three sets are taken under the exactly same condition. Measuring using Mean , or even Medium , the variation alone is too much to be useful to gauge the improvements between different conditions. Given a situation like this, how can I tell if there is any improvement between different tests? The challenges here are, We are only picking a limited number of samples, as the total samples are too big To try to accurately represent the whole spectrum, we use random sampling This random sampling alone will cause problem for us even if everything else remaining the same. Sometime we see changes between each sampling are over 15% (in Mean , yeah I know, we shouldn't use Mean ) Thus so far I just cannot tell for sure if things get any better after an improvement attempt has been made, because an improvement rate of 10~15% is already a significant improvement. However, because of the variation above, I'm really not sure, which is contributing to the change. So, the question is, for situation like this, What the systematic method(s) we should use to gauge the improvements. If Mean is the worst statistic measurement to use, then what measurements are best suit for cases like this?
