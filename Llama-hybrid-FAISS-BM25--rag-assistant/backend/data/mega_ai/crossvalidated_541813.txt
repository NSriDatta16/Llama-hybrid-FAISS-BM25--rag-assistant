First, if you are testing whether the true mean of the population (in which you have collected a sample of size 7) is equal to μ0 = 4 or not, it should be "3.07 - 4" [sample mean - μ0] in the formula. Secondly, since the population variance is unknown, you need to use t-statistic instead of z-statistic. Finally, the small p-value tells you that if the true mean of the population is really 4, the probability that you get that kind of sample {2.5, 2.8, 1.9, 3.7, 4.2, 3.5, 2.9} with an average of 3.07 (or more extreme) is low. In other words, the true mean of the population is unlikely to be 4.
