If you have a recent compiled exe that works, you can use a resource-editor, like PE Explorer , to get the dfm-definition. Then you can compare the one from the exe with the one that you now have. I believe there is tools to convert binary dfm-files to text-files too. This will give you a better view on the file, and help you decide if it's really corrupted or not. I see Felix has something on the topic . If the Delphi IDE shows the form ok without errors, I can't believe there is a corruption-error. Could there be a package problem? Do you use runtime-packages? Update: Hvae you tried Eurekalog or madExcept or something similar to get a more detailed error message with callstack and memorydumt? Maybe that will give you some clue about the problem. But generally i think this error comes from missing runtime package, or a missing unit in the uses-clause. If you think you know witch component causes the error, search the source for the call to RegisterClass( ), and see if that unit somehow is included in the projcets uses-clause. If not, add it and try again.
