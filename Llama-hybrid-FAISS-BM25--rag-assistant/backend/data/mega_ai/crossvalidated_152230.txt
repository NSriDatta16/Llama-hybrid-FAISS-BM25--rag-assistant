Image recognition broadly involves two steps : feature extraction classification 1) For the feature extraction step, you can use PCA (principal component analysis) which is easy to implement yet very powerful when it comes to feature extraction and dimensionality reduction. You can omit this step but if you do the input to the neural network will be the image directly ( let say for 250 * 250 pixel that many input neurons) which is too much. So better to do feature extraction. Other feature extraction methods include 2D-PCA , wavelet transform, LDA. 2) You can feed the feature extracted in first step into the neural network. A feed forward neural network would be good choice. A single layer is capable of approximating any function with reasonable accuracy. As per heuristic number of hidden neurons should lie between num_input_neuron and num_output_neuron. Best way to find out is try to build different model with different neurons. The number of neurons in output layer is number of classes you want to classify. You can try with tansig activation function or logsig depending on what range you want your output to come.
