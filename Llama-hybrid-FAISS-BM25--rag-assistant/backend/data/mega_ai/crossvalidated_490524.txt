In almost every textbook or publication that I have read it is said that MLR is not applicable if we have more variables than samples, because the inverse of the $\mathbf Xâ€²\mathbf X$ matrix, where $\mathbf X$ is the predictor block, doesn't exist. You'll want to look up classical (aka ordinary) vs. inverse models here. In chemometric (or chemistry), a classical calibration model follows the direction of the causality: A concentration $c$ causes some signal (here absorbance) $A$ and thus the would primarily predict spectra from concentrations. So this model for UV/VIS absorption is basically the Beer-Lambert-Law: $$\mathbf A = \mathbf C \mathbf S$$ with $\mathbf A^{(n \times p)}$ the measured spectra with $p$ different wavelengths (variates, channels), $\mathbf C^{(n \times m)}$ the concentrations of the $m$ different constituents aka components*, and $\mathbf S^{(m \times p)}$ the pure component* spectra. Estimating $\mathbf S$ needs only $n > m$ (of course, the more the better), and calculating the pseudoinverse is also possible. In contrast, the inverse model is set up to directly predict concentration as function of signal (spectrum): $$\mathbf C = \mathbf A \mathbf B$$ here, the coefficients are $\mathbf B^{(p \times m)}$ , and need $n > p$ in order to estimate. There are a number of differences between the two models: The classical is efficient at estimating the calibration curve/pure component spectra, but (if available) the inverse model is more efficient at predicting concentrations. The classical model assumes the error to be on the signal, whereas the inverse assumes the error to be on the concentration. This has yielded some discussion whether the inverse models (such as PCR or PLSR) are really appropriate. But a point has been made that nowadays the instrument error on the signal is actually often lower than the error on reference analyses. (And I remember a slightly sarcastic comment that it is certainly lower than the usual preparation error in student labwork practica) The inverse needs many training samples, the classical needs all spectroscopically relevant constituents to be known. This includes the interferents. I.e., to properly set up a classical model here, you need reference interferent concentrations. All in all, inverse calibration is typically preferred. Thus, if there are too few samples/cases $n$ , some sort of regularization (such as PLS) is used. Now, you describe the opposite: the PLS regression (which is a regularized inverse model) performing worse than the presumably classical linear model. This can happen: there is no guarantee that the PLS regularization is sufficienty good to do better than a classical linear model, in particular if you have very few samples compared to the number of wavelength channels (features, predictors). It may thus happen that the unchecked cross-sensitivity of the classical model is less of a problem than instability and/or bias of the PLSR model. Now, 2500 channels for a UV/VIS spectrum sounds like Also, if there are spectral regions that you know do not contribute information (neither about analyte nor about interferents), you may cut that manually. (Such external information is very powerful, good external knowledge can save you a whole lot of samples) Literature search terms: classical/ordinary vs. inverse calibration, and forward vs. backward prediction yield you a buch of relevant papers. Textbook: Brereton's "Chemoetrics" (Wiley, 2018, 2nd ed.) discusses classical and inverse calibration (not sure about the 1st ed., but I'd expect it to be there as well).
