although your question does not provide any details about the methodology but based on my own learning and study, what you want to do is interpretation of PCA/EOF output. That is usually consist of three parts, Variance, Eigenvectors and Principal component (PC). Now what does this PCA/EOF do is only shows the pattern in a bulk of data. The importance depends on many things but usually variance is the prime one and should be noted. Principal component provide the deviation/temporal evolution over time showing certain degree of deviation while eigenvalue is spatial evolution over a grid or pixel scale or individual data. the PC sign(either +/-) is used along with variance of each mode (eigenvectors of pixel or individual data) to quantify the temporal evolution of the data in both space and time. I hope this is what you wanted to know, otherwise please refer to a cautionary note on the interpretation of EOF .
