You're preprocessing the data before it goes for validation, so you're taking some control away from validation. As you seem to be making the decision (in code) whether or not certain fields need to be artificially populated you are rendering those parts of the validation redundant and you should remove them. If you have multiple validations in php, you're going to end up confused. Where to do this or how to do it more cleanly? Well beforeValidate might be the 'correct' place to do this, but I would do it wherever it best fits with the logic of your application. Function should come before elegance.
