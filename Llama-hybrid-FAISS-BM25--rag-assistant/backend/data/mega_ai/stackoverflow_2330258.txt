Don't query using first-order logic (FOL) unless you absolutely have to: first-order logic is not decidable, but only semi-decidable, and so queries will often, unavoidably not terminate. Description logic is essentially a decidable fragment of first-order logic, reformulated in a manner that is good for talking about classes of entity and their interrelationships. There are many engines for description logic in Python, for example seth , based on OWL-DL. If you are really sure that you need the vastness of FOL, then FLiP is worth a look. I've not used it (not really keen on Python, to be honest), but this is a good approach to making logic checking available to a programming language.
