With setting Content-Disposition to attachment is actually intended to be used not to display the resource directly: Bodyparts can be designated `attachment' to indicate that they are separate from the main body of the mail message, and that their display should not be automatic, but contingent upon some further action of the user. But although the Content-Disposition header field is rather part of MIME and not part of HTTP, it “has been proposed as a means for the origin server to suggest a default filename if the user requests that the content is saved to a file.” (See HTTP/1.1 – 19.5 Additional Features ) Additionally to that, the use of the special media type application/octet-stream is recommended to imply a download: If this header is used in a response with the application/octet-stream content-type, the implied suggestion is that the user agent should not display the response, but directly enter a `save response as...' dialog. But since you want to resource to be displayed directly, use the Content-Disposition value inline instead. With this you can use the filename parameter as well to specify a file name different from the URL’s. See also Julian Reschke’s Test Cases for HTTP Content-Disposition header field and the Encodings defined in RFC 2047 and RFC 2231/5987 for some further information on the encodings used to encode the filename parameter.
