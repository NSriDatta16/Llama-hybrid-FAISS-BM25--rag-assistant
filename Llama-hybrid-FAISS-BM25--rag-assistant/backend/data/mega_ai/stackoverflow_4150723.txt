HTML5 manifest and chrome

I am seeing this error in my console for chrome. Application Cache Error event: Failed to commit new cache to storage, would exceed quota it means what it seems to mean right? That my app is trying to cache too much data? Is there anything that can be done about it? Same site works in FF no issues.
