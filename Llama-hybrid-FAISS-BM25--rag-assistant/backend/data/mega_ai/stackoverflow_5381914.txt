Efficent way to manage 100 items in C with little overhead

I am on a system with only about 512kb available to my application (the rest is used for buffers). I need to be as efficient as possible. I have about 100 items that are rapidly added/deleted from a list. What is an efficient way to store these in C and is there a library (with a good license) that will help? The list never grows above 256 items and its average size is 15 items. Should I use a Binary Search Tree? Red Black Tree
