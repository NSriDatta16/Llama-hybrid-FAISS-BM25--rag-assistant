How to quantify intangible costs for decision making

In many situations, decision-making requires weighing multiple losses. For example, you might determine the optimal threshold for a churn classification problem by comparing the cost of offering a reduced rate and the cost of losing the customer. In any case, it is necessary to convert both costs into the same unit of measure in order to make a decision. However, some losses are very difficult to quantify and resist being converted to any sort of standard unit. These are intangible or unquantifiable losses. Despite the challenges, these losses are often evaluated against each other and against quantifiable losses. This is done by organizations (government agencies have to compare economic costs with costs to human-life) and by individuals (people compare comfort, perception, safety, and cost when purchasing a car). My question is not about any specific case, but about the process of quantifying non-quantifiable costs for the purpose of decision making. To simplify things, I'm asking specifically about the case where you have access to a representative stakeholder (could be an individual, a group, or even yourself) that can answer simple questions. What is the process of translating their thinking into a representative loss function? Let me give an example. Your mom is deciding how much food to order for the Christmas party and she requests your help. Let's say you're given the maximum likelihood estimate for the amount of food that will be consumed and the error distribution is known. You want to decide how much food to purchase in order to minimize your mother's dissatisfaction . Now in the case of overestimating, you know that a serving of food has a fixed cost and you might conclude the loss is linearly related to how much extra food you purchase. However, your mom really hates not having enough food. You know that the loss of underestimating will be higher, and likely non-linear, but you have no idea what form it takes, and you don't want to choose something arbitrarily. You might assume a sort of model for the loss exists in your mom's head since she is capable of making decisions that weigh the two losses against each other. My question is, how do you go about translating a stakeholder's subjective preferences into a quantifiable loss function? What questions do you ask? Does a methodology exist for doing this?
