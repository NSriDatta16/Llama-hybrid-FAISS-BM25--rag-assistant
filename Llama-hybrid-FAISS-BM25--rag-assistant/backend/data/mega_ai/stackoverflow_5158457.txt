Javascript Auto-Refresh Class Elements

Problem: Values constantly change on db. Need to auto-reload certain elements values without reloading all page. Very similar to collective bidding pages as attached image. A simple page Dashboard type with three columns of grid organized data. How can I effectively reload (AJAX CALL) certain class types, content? Since these column values change as time goes from db, they have to auto refresh on time interval. Code Sample: 26 20 96 Maybe Jquery has a method.
