From a psychological point of view, users will upgrade software due to one of the following reasons: - Need (they have to have feature) - Benefit (they'd like to have a feature) - Fear (they perceive some sort of damage if they don't have a feature) Based on how well you know your users, you can use one of these approaches to motivate them to upgrade. I.e., Provide extra functionality in your software that works only in new browsers (suggestion: use Ajax for better page update, without the need to call another page or refresh the current). Make those users aware that new, better, safer functionality is available, if they just upgrade their browser. But remember the following caveats: Not everyone can upgrade on his own. OS and browser versions are often dictated by IT policies in medium-large organizations. Not everyone is tech-savvy enough to upgrade - you may need to explain the process. If the user can dictate behavior, he may require you to provide the shiny new functionality in the old browser - be careful how you present those benefits!
