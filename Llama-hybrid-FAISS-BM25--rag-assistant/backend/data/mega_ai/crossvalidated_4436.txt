I'd probably take a look at a ridge regression or, better, the lasso. These techniques are often used when there is multicollinearity. There are several options for doing this in R: See the Regularized and Shrinkage Methods section of the Machine Learning & Statistical Learning Task View on CRAN. You don't have enough data to start thinking about some of the techniques listed in other sections of that Task View.
