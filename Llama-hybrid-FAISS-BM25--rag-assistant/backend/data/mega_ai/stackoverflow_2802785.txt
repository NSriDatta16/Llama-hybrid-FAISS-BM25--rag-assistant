ASP.NET MVC - Organizing Site / URLs

My question is around the best practice for dividing up an asp.net mvc web app. I am building a fairly simple application which has two main sections, public and private. Basically I am running up against the issue of collisions between controllers. What I want is to have urls like /public/portfolio, but also have /private/portfolio. Looking into some options, it seems that areas would work well for this situation. Are there other alternatives, such as some creative routing scheme that I should consider?
