so do you want to split the text into paragraph and store each in its own row like: (paragraph_number, text_of_paragraph) that would be: create table paragraphs (paragraph_number, text_of_paragraph); then in what ever language you use split the text into a list of (pn, tp) named l and do like: executemany("insert into paragraphs values (?, ?)", l) or do like: for p in l: execute("insert into paragraphs values (?, ?)", p)
