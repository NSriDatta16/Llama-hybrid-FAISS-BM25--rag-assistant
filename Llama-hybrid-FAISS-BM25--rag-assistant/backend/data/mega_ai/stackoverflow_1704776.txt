Looking briefly at those two URLs, they're running different HTML! For example, http://www.ece.ualberta.ca/support/ has this text: Windows Vista/7 (volume license) Activation While http://www1.ece.ualberta.ca/support/ has this text: Windows Vista (volume license) Activation I suspect that different HTML accounts for the difference you're seeing. If these are actually the same servers hosting the same content, this kind of disparity could be caused by intermediate caches (e.g. proxies, CDN's, etc.) refreshing at different rates. For example, if www points to a load-balancing, caching proxy and www1 points directly to the host, this may cause the difference. You might also be seeing a bug or lag in how content is updated to different servers in a load-balanced cluster.
