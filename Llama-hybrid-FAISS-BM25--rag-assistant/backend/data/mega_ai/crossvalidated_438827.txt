How to calculate 'times likely' for a percentage and whole number data set?

I'm analyzing speech data for single people vs those in group. I have two types of datasets for which I want to calculate "times likely". Data 1 (probability). Low Music Single 0.6 Group 0.8 #This refers to probability of a person speaking when single, and when in group. For example, out of 100 "singles", only 60 spoke. Thus, probability of the singles speaking is 0.6. Then out of 100 "group", only 80 spoke, this the probability of speaking in a group in 0.8. Data 2 (in whole number) Low Music Single 43 Group 33 #Of those who spoke, this refers to average number of words uttered when single, and when in group. Singles spoke 43 words on average, and those in group spoke 33 words on average. I want to infer the following: In low music conditions, single adults were __ times less likely to speak than those in group (Data 1). But those singles that did speak, uttered ___ % more words than those in groups (Data 2). I'm awfully confused on what parameters I need to divide by for each case to get the inferences right. I would appreciate if you included detailed calculations
