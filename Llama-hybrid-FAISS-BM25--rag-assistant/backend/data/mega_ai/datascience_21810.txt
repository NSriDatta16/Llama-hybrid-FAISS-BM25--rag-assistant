Advice on how to get started for someone a bit later in life?

I am 33 years old and graduated in 2006 from college with a degree in analytic philosophy. For a long time I thought that I was going to get a phd in phil and teach but that dream is long gone, and I am intent on having a career in data science/analysis. I do have a history in mathematics; I finished calculus 3 in high school and finished a set theory course in college as well as advanced logic courses (symbolic, modal, predicate, etc), but I have never studied how to code, nor have I taken any statistics courses. Are there any suggestions on how to best proceed? I of course want to be as attractive to employers as possible. I have no debt or family and am open and willing to take multiple years (and take on loans) studying for this profession. Would getting a math degree (with an emphasis in statistics and taking courses like linear algebra) be the right (or at least, good) way to go? A local university offers a concentration in data science within the mathematics department, so I could do that as well. And in addition, taking courses in computer science to learn how to code? Basically I'm looking to push a reset button (well not entirely since I have a background in mathematics, and I believe my background in philosophy will help too) on my career path and will do whatever it takes. I want a career with a future and with hopefully opportunity to choose where I work (city), and a career that fits with how my mind works (I believe I could thrive in this field). Jobs that I have had since college will not help in any way towards future jobs in this field, so I will be fully leaning on future classes/preparation. Thanks in advance and for reading this partial ramble! I'm motivated but don't know exactly what I should do. I realize that there are many paths people take to get into this profession but would love advice for someone like me in my situation.
