I think you need to look into the Device Context documentation for wxWidgets. I have some code that draws like this: //screenArea is a wxStaticBitmap int startx, starty; void OnMouseDown(wxMouseEvent& event) { screenArea->CaptureMouse(); xstart = event.GetX(); ystart = event.GetY(); event.Skip(); } void OnMouseMove(wxMouseEvent& event) { if(event.Dragging() && event.LeftIsDown()) { wxClientDC dc(screenArea); dc.SetPen(*wxBLACK_PEN); dc.DrawLine(startx, starty, event.GetX(), event.GetY()); } startx = event.GetX(); starty = event.GetY(); event.Skip(); } I know it's C++ but you said the language was irrelevant, so I hope it helps anyway. This lets me do this: which seems significantly smoother than your example.
