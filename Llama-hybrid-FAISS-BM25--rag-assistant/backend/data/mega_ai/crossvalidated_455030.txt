Interpreting quadratic trend coefficients in a repeated measures logistic regression

I conducted an experiment where people either endorsed or did not endorse a statement at the commencement of a one-week training session, at the end of the one-week training session, and at a follow-up interview one week later. I hypothesised that the odds of endorsing the statement would increase between pre-training, and post-training measurement, but would decrease between post-training and follow-up. Here is the graph of the proportions endorsing the statement at each time point (pre-training = pre , post-training = post , follow-up = fu ). I turned the three-level time predictor into an ordered factor ( pre post fu ) in order to estimate linear and quadratic trends across the three time points and ran a repeated-measures logistic regression (i.e. a mixed effects model). Here is the output of that analysis Estimate Std.Err z-value p-value (Intercept) 2.9262 0.5042 5.8036 After exponentiating the log-odds coefficients and confidence intervals these are the results. or lowCI hiCI p linear trend 2.36 1.07 5.21 0.033 quadratic trend 0.19 0.04 0.86 0.031 So for the linear trend I gather the interpretation would be "the odds of endorsing the statement at each time point increase an estimated 2.36 times, compared to the previous time point." However, I am struggling with how to interpret the quadratic trend . This post has some clues but that is for a model where the time predictor is continuous rather than a factor with three levels.
