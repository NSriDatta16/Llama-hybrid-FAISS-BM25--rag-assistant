Help needed with InvokeRequired for Web.UI

I have a multi-threaded application in C# which tries to write to a TextBox in a Windows.Forms created by another thread. As threads cannot modify what has not been created by them, I was using InvokeRequired as shown on the code below, to solve this problem. public delegate void MessageDelegate(Communication message); void agent_MessageReceived(Communication message) { if (InvokeRequired) { BeginInvoke(new MessageDelegate(agent_MessageReceived), new object[] { message }); } else { TextBox1.Text += message.Body; } } Now I need to do the same for a TextBox in an ASP.NET app, but apparently neither InvokeRequired nor BeginInvoke exist for TextBox in a Web.UI. What can I do?
