Feature Engineering of mixed data type column

I have a data set in which I have to predict the price of a building. Among many features there is a feature called Availability which has two type values like : "Ready To Move" and a date (e.g. "20-Jan", "18-May", etc.) For example: Availability Price ------------ ----- Ready To Move 55 18-Apr 38 How would you engineer this column to find its relationship with price and to draw other conclusions.
