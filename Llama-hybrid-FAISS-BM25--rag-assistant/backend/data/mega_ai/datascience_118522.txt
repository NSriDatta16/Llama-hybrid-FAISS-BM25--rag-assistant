Does GPT-3 remember data from prompts used to fine tune it?

I am trying to fine tune a model using OpenAI's fine tuning API. I am passing bodies of text (for example, news paper articles) as prompts and the data I want from it as completions. Let us consider the following: if a newspaper article I passed as a prompt to fine tune the data, consists of some information that GPT did not know before, like 'lithium ores are found in India'. If I use the completion API after that to ask GPT 'are lithium ores found in India?' as a prompt, will GPT be able to answer 'yes'?
