One option is to include a variable that is 1 if symptom severity was not measured and 0 otherwise, then code all the symptom severities that were not measured as 0. The coefficient on the 0/1 variable will represent the average test score for those that did not have the severity measured and the slope for the severity will be computed based on those that had severity measures.
