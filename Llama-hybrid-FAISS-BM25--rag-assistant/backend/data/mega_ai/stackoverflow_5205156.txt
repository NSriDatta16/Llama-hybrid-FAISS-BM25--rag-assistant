The Bioconductor IRanges and GenomicRanges packages have findOverlaps , countOverlaps , coverage and other interval-based functions that are designed to do these operations. You'd use the GRanges function to represent each of the subject ("larger intervals") and query ("smaller intervals") objects above. See the installation instructions and then vignettes, e.g., browseVignettes("GenomicRanges") In a little more detail, here's your data sdf and here we convert these to GRanges and find the intersection between query and subject library(GenomicRanges) subj The answer isn't very exciting here > intersect(query, subj) GRanges with 0 ranges and 0 elementMetadata values seqnames ranges strand | seqlengths chr7 NA To be a little more useful, here's a query that tiles across your total region tiles We find the intersecting ranges, find which subject is overlapped by each intersecting range, and summarize the width of the overlapping ranges int leading to 1 2 3 65800 6500 20400
