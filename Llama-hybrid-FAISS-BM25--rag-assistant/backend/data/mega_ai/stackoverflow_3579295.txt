How do you know this is where you are hanging? Was it from printf/cout debugging? If so, you're on the right track. That can be a powerful tool in situations like these. I agree with Gangadhar, check your types. If you specify other optimization levels, does it still hang? What if you turn off optimization and don't include debug symbols (no -O or -g options)?
