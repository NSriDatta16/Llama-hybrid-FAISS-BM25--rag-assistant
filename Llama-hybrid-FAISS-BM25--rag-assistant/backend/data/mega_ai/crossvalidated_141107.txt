I will demonstrate using an AR(1) model. Consider a variable, $\left(y_{t}\right)_{t=0,1,\ldots} $. Then consider the AR(1) model: $y_{t}=\rho y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t},\quad\varepsilon_{t}\thicksim N\left(0,\,\sigma^{2}\right) $. Solving the AR(1) model we get:$y_{t}=\rho^{t}y_{0}+\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}\rho^{i}\varepsilon_{t-i} $ where $y_{0} $ is the initial value of the process. Finding the variance we get: $\sigma^{2}\frac{1-\rho^{2t}}{1-\rho} $. Clearly this process is not stationary nor weakly mixing (hence its not ergodic since weakly mixing imlies ergodicity) as both the conditional mean and the conditional variance depend upon time. We can therefore write:$y_{t}=\rho^{t}y_{0}+\sum_{i=0}^{t-1}\rho^{i}\varepsilon_{t-i}\stackrel{D}{=}N\left(\rho^{t}y_{0},\,\sigma^{2}\frac{1-\rho^{2t}}{1-\rho^{2}}\right) $ If however the condition $\left|\rho\right| since when $\left|\rho\right| To illustrate I will simulate the AR(1) model: $y_{t}=y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t} $: We see that the autocorrelation function decays very slowly and from the time series graph the series does not look very stationary. Therefore we can say that clearly the assumption about stationarity and weakly mixing (hence ergodicity) does not hold when $\left|\rho\right|=1 $. For information about the autocorrelation function see here . For the second illustration I will simulate the AR(2), $y_{t}=0.3y_{t-1}+0.4y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t} $ model but I will try to model it with an AR(1) model to see how the residuals look like. We see that the time series graph looks stationary and the ACF goes exponentially towards zero indicating stationarity and weakly mixing. By fitting an AR(1) model to the data we get the following model: $y_{t}=0.54y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t} $. If we now look at the residual ACF we see that they are not white noise (a martingale diff. seq. is white noise) and the portmanteu test rejects the null of no autocorrelation. If we then fit an AR(2) to the simulated data we get an estimated model of: $y_{t}=0.37y_{t-1}+0.32y_{t-1}+\varepsilon_{t} $. Now the residuals do look like white noise and we cannot reject the null of no autocorrelation. If this did not answer your question then let me know.
