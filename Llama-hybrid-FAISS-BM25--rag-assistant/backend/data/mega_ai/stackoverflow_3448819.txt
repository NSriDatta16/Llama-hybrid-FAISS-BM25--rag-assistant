Inside MyEclipse IDE, please add 'javaee.jar' in your Project's build-path. This will solve your mentioned error about "request.setCharacterEncoding("UTF-8") " Usually, during run-time (within web-server container) this jar will be already in classpath. But during development inside IDE, you may face this compile time error. You will find this JAR at path depending upon your installation path:For example, C:\MyEclipse6.0\myeclipse\eclipse\plugins\com.genuitec.eclipse.j2eedt.core_6.0.0.zmyeclipse60020070820\data\libraryset\EE_5
