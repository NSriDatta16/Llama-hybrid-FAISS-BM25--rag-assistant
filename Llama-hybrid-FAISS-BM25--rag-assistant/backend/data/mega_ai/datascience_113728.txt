Classification: ClassA vs. "everything else"

I am trying to create a neural network for recognizing a particular object. Maybe I am approaching this task from the wrong side, but, in my mind, this task boils down to teaching the network to do a binary classification: "Object" or "Not object". When I was playing with MNIST, it was simple: I had 10 outputs (one per digit) and I trained the network to maximize the corresponding output for a corresponding input digit. But when the network should recognize only one object, how do I teach it? Intuitively, it should have only one output, which would give something like 1.0 for "Yes, this is the object" and 0.0 for "No, this is something else". I have a training set with a lot of pictures of that object. But...what would be the counter-samples during training? How do I create a set of "not objects"? I mean...it is literally anything, but the object .
