Try: import itertools def mean(i): (i1, i2) = itertools.tee(i, 2) return sum(i1) / sum(1 for _ in i2) print mean([1,2,3,4,5]) tee will duplicate your iterator for any iterable i (e.g. a generator, a list, etc.), allowing you to use one duplicate for summing and the other for counting. (Note that 'tee' will still use intermediate storage).
