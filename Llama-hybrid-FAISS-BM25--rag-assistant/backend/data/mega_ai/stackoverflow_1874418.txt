How to make a list of arrays, not their symbols, in Lisp?

I'm trying to make a function to get a delta between arrays, but right now just want to make a subset: get Nth element. (defvar p1 #(1 2)) (defvar p2 #(3 4)) (mapcar '(lambda (x) (aref x 0)) '(p1 p2)) debugger invoked on a TYPE-ERROR in ... The value P1 is not of type ARRAY. The same error if I make it with make-array. How do I apply the lambda function, or how to apply (aref x 0) , or (aref x N) in general case? In the end I want to make a function that returns a delta: p2 - p1.
