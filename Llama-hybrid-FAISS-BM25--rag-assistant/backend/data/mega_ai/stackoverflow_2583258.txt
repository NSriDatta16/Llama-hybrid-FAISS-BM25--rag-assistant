You need somewhere to save the previous hash list of your users passwords, and check this list, just before accepting a password change. Update Where to start: Start from the all ready existing password change control. Here is a password change example. http://www.asp.net/cssadapters/Membership/ChangePassword.aspx In this control, (that you can easy drag and drop on your page) capture the events, ... Make your function to check for old passwords protected void ChangePassword1_ChangingPassword(object sender, LoginCancelEventArgs e) { if (PasswordFoundOnList()) { ... show an error.... e.Cancel = true; } } Now save somewhere the last passwords, for example you can saved them on user profile, or on your database. here are some more informations for user profile. http://www.asp.net/Learn/Ajax/tutorial-03-cs.aspx Hope this help you make it.
