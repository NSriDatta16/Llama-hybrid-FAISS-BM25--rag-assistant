You made two mistakes: The first was assuming that the transforms would alter the location of the geometry as combined - my testing shows that they are ignored so I've used the other Rect constructor which takes a Point for the location. The second was a more fundamental mistake which Anurag corrected â€“ you weren't actually putting your geometry into the CombinedGeometry . I solved it a different way using the constructor as shown below. Path e1 = new Path(); Path e2 = new Path(); e1.Data = new EllipseGeometry(new Rect(new Point(100,100), new Size(100, 100))); e1.Fill = Brushes.Transparent; e1.Stroke = Brushes.Black; e2.Data = new EllipseGeometry(new Rect(new Point(140, 140), new Size(120, 120))); e2.Fill = Brushes.Transparent; e2.Stroke = Brushes.Black; Path p = new Path(); CombinedGeometry c1 = new CombinedGeometry(GeometryCombineMode.Union, e1.Data, e2.Data); p.Stroke = Brushes.Black; p.StrokeThickness = 1; p.Data = c1; canvasMain.Children.Add(p);
