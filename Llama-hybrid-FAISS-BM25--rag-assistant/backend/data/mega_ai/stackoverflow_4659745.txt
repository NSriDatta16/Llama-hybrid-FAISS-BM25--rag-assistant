Correct association mapping in Entity Framework

Trying to change two relationships in our entity framework from many-to-one to many-to-many relationships. So I tried the obvious thing: clicked on each association on the diagram, changed the appropriate end of the association accordingly and then changed the name of the navigation property to a plural to reflect the change. This lead to the following build error, or one each for the two changes I've made: Error 3002: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 1761:Potential runtime violation of table CustomerServices's keys (CustomerServices.Id): Columns (CustomerServices.Id) are mapped to EntitySet CompiledDatabaseCustomerService's properties (CompiledDatabaseCustomerService.CustomerService.Id) on the conceptual side but they do not form the EntitySet's key properties (CompiledDatabaseCustomerService.CompiledDatabase.Id, CompiledDatabaseCustomerService.CustomerService.Id) I'm not entirely sure why this is happening, so unsurprisngly I haven't had much luck fixing it. I've tried fiddling with the mapping details and adding referential constraints to no avail. Anyone point me in the right direction? cheers, Matt
