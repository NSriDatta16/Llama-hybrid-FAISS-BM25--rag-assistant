Er, hey Ender. How's them bugs? I wrote StrikeDisplay, which is mentioned in geckojsc's response here. I think it pretty much addresses what you're asking; essentially creating "Sprites" in the AS3 sense, seamlessly and with their own mouse events in a single canvas element. It automates all the matrix manipulations of the canvas element itself and redraws the necessary shapes on each frame, using a secondary hidden canvas in monochrome to catch point level mouse positions and z-order. (I'm wondering when the guy who wrote Radi is gonna catch onto this). Anyway, I'd encourage you to check it out and throw me any questions that come up with it. It's still in its infancy, but then again, so's this whole ludicrous idea of drawing pixels in a browser anyway, and no one's really sure yet what the paradigm for it's gonna be. Far as I'm concerned, AS3's as good a screen graph paradigm as any...
