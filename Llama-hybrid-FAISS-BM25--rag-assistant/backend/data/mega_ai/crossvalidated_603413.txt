Consider the $\sf AR(1) $ model: $$ Y_t= c+\rho Y_{t-1}+v_t.\tag 1$$ For $|\rho| the process is covariance stationary and the stable solution is $$Y_t = \sum_{j\in \mathbb N\cup \{0\}}[\rho^j c +\rho^jv_{t-j}].\tag 2\label 2$$ From $\eqref 2,$ it can be easily deduced \begin{align}\mathbb EY_t&=\frac{c}{1-\rho}\tag{3.1},\\\mathbb VY_t&= \frac{\sigma^2}{(1-\rho^2)}\tag{3.2}\end{align} Since $\langle v_t\rangle$ is Gaussian, $Y_1$ is also Gaussian. Therefore, for $c=0, ~Y_1\sim\mathcal N(0,\sigma^2/(1-\rho^2).$ Reference: $[\rm I]$ Time Series Analysis, James D. Hamilton, Princeton University Press, $1994, $ sec. $5.2, $ p. $118.$
