You can either use IE Conditional comments or you can do this with php by checking HTTP_USER_AGENT (not safe, as this is user variable and can be changed to anything). I suggest you to use this great class from Chris Schuld: http://chrisschuld.com/projects/browser-php-detecting-a-users-browser-from-php/ p.s. There is also this function in php get_browser() http://php.net/manual/en/function.get-browser.php
