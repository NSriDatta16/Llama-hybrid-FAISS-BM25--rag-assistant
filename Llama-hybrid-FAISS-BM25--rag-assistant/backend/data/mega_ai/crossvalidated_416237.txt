Time Series and regression analysis online course

I am going to pursue my PhD in Data Science. My BS and MS degrees are in Mathematics. I would like to learn some self-paced statistics online courses to make my PhD journey more comfortable. I never took any undergrad/grad courses on time series, and regression analysis. I was wondering if you could tell me some good online resources (video lectures) about time series, and regression analysis. I sincerely appreciate your favor.
