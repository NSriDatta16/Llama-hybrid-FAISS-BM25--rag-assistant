Jquery: get the TOP and LEFT coordinates of the 5th paragraph?

I need to get the TOP and LEFT coordinates of the 5th paragraph on my page, or maybe the 6th paragraph, or the 8th, im just trying to figure out how to get the coordinates for any paragraph on the page I choose. I then need to insert a div 20px to the left of the top left of the paragraph i choose. Can anyone help?
