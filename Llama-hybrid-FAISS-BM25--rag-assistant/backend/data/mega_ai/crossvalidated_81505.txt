If you don't know the number of clusters ahead Bayesian nonparametrics may be appropriate. Loosely these methods work by assuming there is an infinite number of clusters and using a prior, such as the Chinese restaurant process , which favors only using a small number of these clusters for any given finite data set. This allows one to do things like fit a Gaussian Mixture Model without specifying the number of mixture components. There is a lot of good, freely available information out there on the subject, but I recommend starting with A tutorial on Bayesian nonparametric models by Gershman and Blei. It is a short and fairly easy read.
