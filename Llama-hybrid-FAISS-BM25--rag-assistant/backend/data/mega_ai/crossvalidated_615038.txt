What is the difference in interpretation between adding ellipse.type = "confidence" in PCA biplots?

I am trying to identify if three groups of species (like here) overlap or seperate out. I tried a popular method to identify ellipses: data(iris) res.pca The first produced: I think this draws ellipses of some kind around the centroid. I would interpret this as blue and green species share common traits but red uses completely different traits This is the second one: I think this draws 95% confidence ellipses of some kind around the centroid. I would interpret this as all three blue, green and red have completely different traits. I am trying to understand how to interpert each of these graphs? More importantly, what kind of statistics should I be reporting to talk about extent of overlap? Alternately, I tried to look up ellipses from the vegan package sensu Oksanen. But I only found NMDS plots not regular PCA
