In SPSS, you have to use the MMATRIX subcommand of the GLM procedure. In your case it would be (assuming you want to test that time 3 - 5 are higher on average than 1- 2): /MATRIX = "last three higher than first two" ALL -1/2 -1/2 1/3 1/3 1/3 In STATA this requires the manovatest postestimation command of the MANOVA procedure: gen groups = 1 //since all participant belong to a single between-subject group MANOVA time1 time2 time3 time4 time5: groups, noconstant Matrix M = (-1/2, -1/2, 1/3, 1/3, 1/3) // the desired contrast weights manovatest groups, ytransform(M) All this and much more (covering between-, within- and mixed designs, as well as contrast specific effect sizes) are covered in: http://pareonline.net/getvn.asp?v=23&n=9
