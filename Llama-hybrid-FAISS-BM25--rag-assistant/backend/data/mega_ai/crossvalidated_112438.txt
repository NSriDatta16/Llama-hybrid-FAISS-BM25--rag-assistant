Stationary processes I(0) cointegration, does it make sense?

I'm looking at two time series and I would like to determine how they move together. They both are however stationary. Would it make sense to test for cointegration? Linear relationship between both series has a very low R^2 and correlation but I think that there might be a lag or something and that they move together.
