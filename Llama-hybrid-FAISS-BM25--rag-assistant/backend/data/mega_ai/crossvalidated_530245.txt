It seems to be a self-study question so let me just give you some hints to figure it out by yourself. Mean is sensitive to outliers. MAD is an acronym generally used for median of deviations from median . MAD is a robust measure of variability , so it is insensitive to outliers (see also other questions tagged as mad ). You may want to use it if you have clear outliers in your data. The MAD acronym is sometimes is also used for mean absolute deviation , you'd need to consult your materials for which one is it. If that is the case, if it is defined as an average absolute deviation from the mean, your reasoning is correct.
