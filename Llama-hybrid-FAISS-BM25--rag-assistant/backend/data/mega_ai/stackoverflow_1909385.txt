Force.com is absolutely a PaaS offering making SFDC more than a CRM SaaS player. That being said I do not see them offering Chatter as a stand-alone application anytime soon, if ever. Force.com does have it's own pricing model. This is all readily available on their web site. As always, it depends on what you want to achieve. Force.com is ideal for forms based, data-centric application development - check out Jason Ouelette's book on Force.com if you're interested in learning ideal app dev situations for Force.com. I suspect even the most aggressive Force.com supporters would not think of Force.com as being ideal for your purposes. Zoho and Caspio offer data driven PaaS as well, but again I do not think this is ideal for your application. If I were in your position I would try to leverage a platform already developed for social networking purposes like Ning or even something like Google Groups. Can you achieve 90%+ of the end user functionality you're looking for with free services readily available? This article is old but perhaps some of these examples other than Ning might help: http://www.techcrunch.com/2007/07/24/9-ways-to-build-your-own-social-network/ The Force.com developer challenges have shown you can build just about anything on Force.com, but just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. To the other respondents - if you're not taking PaaS, in general, and Force.com, specifically, seriously as Custom App Dev platforms then you're behind the curve. Force.com is a great platform but I do not think it is well suited for your particular needs.
