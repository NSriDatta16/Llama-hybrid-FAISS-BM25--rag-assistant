Yes, it is possible to extract causal interpretations from an RF model but certain requirements will need to be met by the model for the extraction to be valid. Similar requirements are also necessary before extracting causal inferences from a simple linear model. The issues around doing so are discussed in Zhao & Hastie (2017), "Causal Interpretations of Black Box Models" . Beginning of paper's conclusion, " In contrast to the conventional view that machine learning algorithms are just blackbox predictive models, we have argued that it is possible to extract causal information from these models using the partial dependence plots (PDP) and the individual conditional expectation (ICE) plots. In summary, a successful attempt of causal interpretation requires: (1) A good predictive model, so the black-box function g is (hopefully) close to the law of nature f. (2) Some domain knowledge about the causal structure to assure the back-door condition is satisfied.(3) Visualization tools such as the PDP and its extension ICE. "
