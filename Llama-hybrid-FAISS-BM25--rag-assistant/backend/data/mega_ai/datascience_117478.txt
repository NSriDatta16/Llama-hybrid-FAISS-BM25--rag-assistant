SVM may perform worse than Logistic Regression when the dataset is small, thus data points near the decision boundary (Support Vectors) may not be a true representation of the actual decision boundary, and thus may form a false maximum margin classifier boundary. I don't have any dataset example in mind but theoretically, that should be it
