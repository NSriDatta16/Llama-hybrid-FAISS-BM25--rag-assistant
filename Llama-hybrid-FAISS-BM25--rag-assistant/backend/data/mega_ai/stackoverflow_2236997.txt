Static methiods should be invoked with the class name, without the need for creating an instance of the class, as in ClassName.methodName(args); or methodName(args); // from other static methods of the same class. You can also refer to static methods with an object reference like instanceName.methodName(args) but this is discouraged because it does not make it clear that they are class methods. So in your case: Test.test(); or test(); from the main method will do.
