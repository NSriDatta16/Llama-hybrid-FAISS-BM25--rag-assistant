Fully Bayesian hyper-parameter selection in GPML

Is it possible to perform an approximated fully Bayesian (1) selection of hyper-parameters (e.g. covariance scale) with the GPML code, instead of maximizing the marginal likelihood (2) ? I think using MCMC methods to solve the integrals involving hyper-parameters prior should lead to better results when dealing with overfitting. Up to my knowledge, the GPML framework doesn't include these computations, but perhaps there are goods other third party codes.
