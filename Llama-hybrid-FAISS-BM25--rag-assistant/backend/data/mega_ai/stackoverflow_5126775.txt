NSApplication Delegate Question

I was wondering if - (void)applicationWillTerminate:(NSNotification *)notification is still called when the system shuts down and the application is told to quit. I'm working on an agent that needs to perform some actions when quitting, but I'm not sure if the delegate is called or not. Thanks!
