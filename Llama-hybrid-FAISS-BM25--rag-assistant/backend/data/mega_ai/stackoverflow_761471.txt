Keeping VBScript Organized

I maintain a good number of vbscripts for performing various startup scripts on my network and have a handful of functions that I use in almost all of them. Short of copy and paste, does anyone have suggestions for how I can go about creating libraries of reusable vbscript code. I'm not averse to using a code generator for doing so as long as it isn't more of a headache than copy and paste is. But any recommendations would be appreciated. Thanks
