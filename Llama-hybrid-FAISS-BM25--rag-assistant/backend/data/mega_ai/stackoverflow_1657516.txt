Hard to say exactly what the problem is, classloader issues can be very situation specific in OSGi and hard to debug. If guice really is a core to your application it may make sense to make it a Fragment bundle of the System Bundle. The System Bundle is the root node in the classloader tree for ALL bundles. If classes exist in this bundle, they'll be accessible everywhere. This is a technique I've used successfully to wrap Swing LAF (Substance, Alloy, Jide) as OSGi bundles. They've gotta be at the root level since all of my bundles use Swing (especially the Swing classloader) You'll want to check the OSGi specs for creating a Fragment bundle and making that fragment bundle a framework extension fragment. I've only been able to do this using Eclipse's Equinox runtime. At the time I wrote most of the supporting classes, Apache Felix did not yet support framework extension fragments. It may have changed now. I have no idea about frameworks (knopplefish, spring-dm)
