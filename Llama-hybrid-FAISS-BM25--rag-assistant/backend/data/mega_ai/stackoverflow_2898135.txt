Opera Mobile for Windows + Reported Screen Size

I know this isn't a direct programming question, but's it's kinda relevant as I'm trying to get a good testing environment set up before I embark on my latest project. I'm trying to set up Opera Mobile for Windows to allow me to test a new website. The UserAgent I get is a fairly generic one, so my workaround is to tweak my mobile.browser file to have the correct screen width and height of the target device. Is it possible to add to the list of "fake" user agents that Opera Mobile for Windows can pretend to be? It currently supports S60, Android and Windows Mobile.
