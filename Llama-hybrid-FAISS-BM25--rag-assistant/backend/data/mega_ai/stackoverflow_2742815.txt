Don't pay any attention to those RFCs; they diverge from reality pretty badly. There's currently an IETF WG that's documenting actual cookie behaviour; their document, while just a draft, is much better source material. See: http://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-httpstate-cookie/ If you don't find text that addresses your question in the draft, bring it up with the Working Group!
