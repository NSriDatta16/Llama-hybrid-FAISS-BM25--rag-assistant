It seems like you're trying to use view helpers and controller logic where a model would be ideal. You should stick the average_rainfall method in your Location model, then use that in the view like so: Then in your Locations controller use it by calling /locations/1/avg_rainfall from the javascript. def avg_rainfall @location = Location.find( params[:id] ) render :json => { :avg_rainfall => @location.average_rainfall } end
