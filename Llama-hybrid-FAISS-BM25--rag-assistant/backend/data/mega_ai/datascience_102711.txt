You can embed your categorical features into some continuous space, and then perform any classification method on the embedding. For example, use spectral encoding ( link 1 ) or other types of encodings ( link 2 ). You can use techniques from language modelling, for example this paper ( link 3 ) where it is shown how to learn numeric representations of words (which are nominal things). Logistic regression might still show poor results if the embedded data are not linearly separated. In that case, try non-linear methods such as decision trees, support vector machines, $k$ nearest neighbors, random forest, etc. Alternatively, try to write an algorithm that learns the rules that separate your data into classes such as if var1 == value1 and var2 == value2 and var3 == 0 and var4 == 1 and var 5 == 0 then class1 If your nominal variables don't have too many values, the rules can be learned fast.
