Thanks for the clarification; you should probably edit to include the additional clarification in the text of your question. This is basically asking 'What do I call the function describing $P(Y=1|X=x)$?' ... (as one might do for example in a logistic regression or a probit model or whatever) where in this case the x's identify your time-slices. There are various names for such a thing; you're right that it's not normally called a distribution*. If I wanted a general name I'd probably call it a response function or the probability response function. But in different contexts people would call it other things (the conditional mean, for example). *However there is a close connection to a conditional distribution; specifically a Bernoulli distribution is completely specified by its parameter, $p$, which is $P(Y=1)$. In that sense, $P(Y=1|X=x)$ can be seen as specifying a conditional distribution.
