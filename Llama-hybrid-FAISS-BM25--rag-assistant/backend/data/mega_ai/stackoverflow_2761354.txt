How to Synchronize Windows Service Access to SQL Server Database on Startup?

I have a WCF service that is running as a windows service. As soon as the WCF service starts it will try to connect to the DB and do some initialization processing. I'm having an issue when I restart my machine (the wcf service is set to start automatically), the service would get an exception as too sql is busy. So it seems like the sql is trying to start and at the same time my service is trying to communicate with it. For now, I did something like try/catch and I sleep for like 10 sec in my catch and I retry again until my initialization is successful. This works pretty well. But I'm looking for a more elegant solution. I don't want to set a dependency on sql on my windows service as the service can be installed on a different machine that the DB.
