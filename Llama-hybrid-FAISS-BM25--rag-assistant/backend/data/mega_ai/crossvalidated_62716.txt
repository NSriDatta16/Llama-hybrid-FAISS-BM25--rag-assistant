Here are a few clues. Depending on what the variables are, the loadings themselves can be very informative. For example, in PCAs derived from gene expression data, I can use the loadings in combination with Gene Ontology to test for enrichment of particular terms in the variables with large absolute loadings. Biplots are very useful if you have just a few variables, as they can neatly visualise which variables are important for which component. However, they are not very practical if there are too many variables (my package, pca3d , allows to select N "top" variables from each component to be shown of the plot; it's called "pca3d" but also has a "pca2d" function for regular 2D plots). If you have categorical variables that group the samples into different groups, then simply colouring the points on a standard plot can be very informative (this is the main purpose of pca3d).
