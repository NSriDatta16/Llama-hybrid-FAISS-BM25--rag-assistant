How does the predictive distribution affect Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection?

In Bayesian Online Changepoint Validation (1), we try to segment a time series by changepoints. The crux of the algorithm, I think, is calculating the probability that a new datum has experienced a changepoint versus being part of the previous run, which intuitively should rely on the predictive probability $\pi_t = P(\mathbf{x_t} \mid \theta)$ . This is calculated in the format algorithm, which I have included from the paper here: However what confuses me is that both the changepoint probability $P(r_t=0, \mathbf{x_{1:t}})$ and the growth probability $P(r_t=r_{t-1}+1, \mathbf{x_{1:t}})$ are both multiplied by this predictive probability $\pi_t$ . Considering this, how is the predictive probability affecting anything in the algorithm? Couldn't it be removed as a common factor? I clearly don't understand the algorithm very well, but I would have expected the changepoint probability to be proportional to $1-\pi_t$ since the less likely the incoming data point, the more likely we have encountered a changepoint.
