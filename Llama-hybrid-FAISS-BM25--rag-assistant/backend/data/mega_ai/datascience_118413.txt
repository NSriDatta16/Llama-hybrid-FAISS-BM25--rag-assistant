What is ROC curve based on for SVM?

I was studying about the ROC curves for Logistic regression. There is a threshold in this method that determines the classification. By changing this threshold we get different confusion matrices and different Sensitivity rates and False Positive rates. Based on them we can draw the ROC curve. My question is, when we use SVM, what do we draw the ROC curve based on?
