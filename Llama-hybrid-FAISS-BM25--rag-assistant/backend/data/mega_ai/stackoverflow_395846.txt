How do I send an ARP packet through python on windows without needing winpcap?

Is there any way to send ARP packet on Windows without the use of another library such as winpcap? I have heard that Windows XP SP2 blocks raw ethernet sockets, but I have also heard that raw sockets are only blocked for administrators. Any clarification here?
