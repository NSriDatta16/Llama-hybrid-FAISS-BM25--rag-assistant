Once a form is embedded, it's original widget schema and validator schema do nothing - they've been merged into the top level schemas. Thus, you need to set the form formatter before embedding: $this->getWidgetSchema()->setFormFormatter('list'); $innerForm = new sfForm(); $innerForm->getWidgetSchema()->setFormFormatterName('table'); $this->embedForm('inner', $innerForm); It's worth a look into sfForm::embedForm to see what's going on internally.
