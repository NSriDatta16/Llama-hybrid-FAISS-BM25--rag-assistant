If all of your curl requests are coming from a single or otherwise manageable group of IPs you can exclude them from your logs with a configuration similar to the following: # Set your address here, you can do this for multiple addresses SetEnvIf Remote_Addr "1\.1\.1\.1" mycurlrequest CustomLog logs/access_log common env=!mycurlrequest You can do something similar with the user agent field which by default will indicate that it's curl. You can read more here: http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/logs.html#accesslog (conditional logging is the last section under this header) and here http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/mod/mod_setenvif.html#setenvif If you want to conditionally exclude logging I would to it by the most precise method possible such as the ip address. In the event the server is externally accessible you probably don't want to find yourself NOT logging external requests from curl. Using conditional logging you can also segment your logging if you want to multiple files one of which you could roll more frequently. The benefit of that is you can save space and at the same time have log data to help research and debug.
