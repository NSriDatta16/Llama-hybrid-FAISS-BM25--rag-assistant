Can't view full-text catalogs in SQL Server 2008 with Advanced Services

I'm using SQL Server 2008 with Advanced Services on my Vista Home Premium. I'd installed Full-text searching during installation, The SQL Full-text Filter Daemon Launcher is running thorough an admin user account. When I go to a database through the SQL Server Management Studio, I don't see the "Storage" option under the database, so I can't create/edit my Full-text catalogs. I was able to create a Full-text catalog through T-SQL, and can run Full-text searches on the columns I've selected in the database. I'm just not able to see the "Storage" option. Any idea what's missing?
