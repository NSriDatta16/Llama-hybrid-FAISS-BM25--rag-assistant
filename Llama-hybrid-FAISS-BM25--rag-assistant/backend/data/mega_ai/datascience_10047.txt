On coursera what exactly does Andrew Ng say in videos Lectures 60 & 61 of machine learning?

Model Selection and Train/Validation/Test Sets - Stanford University | Coursera: At 10:59 ~ 11:10 One final note: I should say that in the machine learning as of this practice today, there aren't many people that will do that early thing that I talked about, and said that, you know...​ Is my comprehension correct? Because English subtitles on coursera sometimes are not correct. As I konw, here what Chinese subtitle means is opposite to what English one does. So I am not sure whether Andrew Ng said "there aren't " or "there are " Thanks for your reading.​ I would like to ask another one . Diagnosing Bias vs. Variance - Stanford University | Coursera: At 02:34 ~ 02:36 , what Andrew Ng said is not quite clear as well as the English subtitle. My comprehension is as following If d equals 1,.... to be high training error. It's not that complete. Would anyone like to identify that? Thank you...
