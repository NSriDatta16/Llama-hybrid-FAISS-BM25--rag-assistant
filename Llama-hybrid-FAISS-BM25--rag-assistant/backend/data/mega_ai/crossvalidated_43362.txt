If your residual is high enough I believe you have explained the variance of the dependent variable by the independent variables. However, if the variance isn't explained sufficient by the independent variables you might want to consider to do a little further analysis with the help of some of the time series analysis packages that are available in R. Decomposing or STL might give you an insight into the components of the time series (trend, seasonality and randomness).
