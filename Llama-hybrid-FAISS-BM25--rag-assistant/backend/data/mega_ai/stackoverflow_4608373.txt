Binary protocols are a bit easier to deal with. Just prepend the length to the message (or just the variable part of it) - TCP doesn't know about your application-level message boundaries. Pay attention to number endianness . On the other hand, text-based protocols are more flexible. Also, take a look at Google Protocol Buffers - could be very useful, though I'm not sure ajax is supported.
