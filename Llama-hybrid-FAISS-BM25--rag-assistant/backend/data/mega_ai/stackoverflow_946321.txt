What's the Right Tool for automating refresh+scrub of a page behind a login?

A friend just asked me if I could help him in automating something that is taking up a lot of his time. He grades essays online so basically there is a website that he logs into and sits on a page refreshing it until some data appears (new essays to be graded). Instead of doing this he would like to simply be notified when there are new items that require his attention. There is no API to work off of and a login is required to access website. What in your opinion is the right tool for this job? I'll post my idea as an answer but I'm curious as to what everyone suggests. Edit: He is running windows (Windows Vista). Browser doesn't really matter as long as the site runs in it.
