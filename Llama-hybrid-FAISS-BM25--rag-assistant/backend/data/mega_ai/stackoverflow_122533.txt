How can I downgrade the format of a Subversion repositiory?

Is there any way to down-format a Subversion repository to avoid messages like this: svn: Expected format '3' of repository; found format '5' This happens when you access repositories from more than one machine, and you aren't able to use a consistent version of Subversion across all of those machines. Worse still, there are multiple repositories with various formats on different servers, and I'm not at liberty to upgrade some of these servers. ~~~
