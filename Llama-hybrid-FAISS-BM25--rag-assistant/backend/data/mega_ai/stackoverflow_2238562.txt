Namespaces are important in XML as you may have nodes that have the same local-name in the same xml hierarchy. Imagine an xml document that describes a journal article. You might have a element that defines the author(s) of the article: Emily Berthenstien .... Further down the article you may have citations that list authors that have been cited. Bernard Rightofen How do you distinguish the 2 "author" nodes? Adding a different namespace to the "author" element in the head and the citation nodes will create a QName for each of the author nodes that you can then use to access them specifically (with XPath or whatever) and not get confused. For example, you can now select only the citation authors using XPath and its QName: declare namespace citauths="http://citation/authors/only" //citauths:author and just the article authors: declare namespace auths="http://article/authors/only" //auths:author
