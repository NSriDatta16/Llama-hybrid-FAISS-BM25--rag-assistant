Testing functions with random output

I am working on a test project to test a neural networks library... The problem is that this library sometimes uses random numbers.. I need to derive test cases (input,expected output,actual output)... Does anybody have an idea how to derive test cases (input,expected output,actual output) to a function that uses random numbers when taking actions and evaluating outputs??
