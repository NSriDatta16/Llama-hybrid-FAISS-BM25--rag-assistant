Add another fact table for number of Employees in each store for each month -- you could use max number for the month. Then average months for the year, use this as "number of employees in a year". Load your new fact table at the end of each month. The new table would look like: fact table: EmployeeCount KeyEmployeeCount int -- surrogate key KeyDate int -- FK to date dimension, point to last day of a month KeyStore int -- FK to store dimension NumberOfEmployes int -- (max) number of employees for the month in a given store If you need a finer resolution, use "per week" or even "per day". The main idea is to average the NumberOfEmployes measure for a given store over the year.
