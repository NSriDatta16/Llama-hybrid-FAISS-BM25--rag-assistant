class FxActionData; is a *forward declaration. It doesn't hurt anything but allows for not dragging in a full header file for, say, just a pointer to a class. It's useless in your case here. The CP_M_RefCounted is probably a template (or might be declared in a namespace). Look into what's in CP_M_RefCounted.h
