The variances are so nearly equal that any impact of unequal variances on inference will be small. Normality in such large samples may not be a big issue either. With such big samples you should have good level-robustness, and if you have so much data that the potential adverse impact on power may be a nonissue. If this was the only problem, you could always look at permutation tests for this. The main issue as I see it will be that you have sequences of measurements of dilation over time for a given subject -- effectively repeated measures/time series data. These will be dependent (two measurements taken a few milliseconds apart are much more likely to be very similar than two measurements taken minutes apart). You can't avoid this issue and must tackle it head on, I think by explicitly including the tendency to be correlated in any modelling and any inference. Does the mean of dilation change over time (what does a time series plot look like, for example)? What does the ACF and PACF of each time series look like (or of the residuals for some suitable model for the mean)? This can certainly impact significance levels, perhaps a great deal.
