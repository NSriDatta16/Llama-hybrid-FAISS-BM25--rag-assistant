Is there a specific reason beside the fact that you would like to contribute? I am asking because there is always pyspark that you can use, the Spark python API that exposes the Spark programming model to Python. For deep learning specifically, there are a lot of frameworks built on top of Theano -which is a python library for mathematical expressions involving multi-dimensional arrays-, like Lasagne, so they are able to use GPU for intense training. Getting an EC2 instance with GPU on AWS is always an option.
