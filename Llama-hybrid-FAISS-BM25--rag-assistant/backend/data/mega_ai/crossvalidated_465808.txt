Don't use the hit rate as a quality measure for interval predictions. (Or if you do, do not be surprised if your winning algorithm predicts an interval of $(0,300)$ for all instances and gets a hit rate of 100%.) Your quality measure needs to balance coverage and length of the prediction intervals: yes, we want high coverage, but we also want short intervals. There is a quality measure that does precisely this and has attractive properties: the interval score . Let $\ell$ and $u$ be the lower and the upper end of the prediction interval. The score is given by $$ S(\ell,u,h) = (u-\ell)+\frac{2}{\alpha}(\ell-h)1(h u). $$ Here $1$ is the indicator function, and $\alpha$ is the coverage your algorithm is aiming for. (You will need to prespecify this, based on what you plan on doing with the prediction interval. It makes no sense to aim for $\alpha=100\%$ coverage, because the resulting intervals will be too wide to be useful for anything.) You can then average the interval score over many predictions. The lower the average score, the better. See Gneiting & Raftery (2007, JASA ) ] for a discussion and pointers to further literature. A scaled version of this score was used, for instance, in assessing predictions intervals in the recent M4 forecasting competition. Now, as to whether your algorithm is clairvoyant or your black box "works"... well, you will need to figure out whether it is "clairvoyant enough ". A clairvoyant should be able to perfectly predict all heights, shouldn't they? So all $u=\ell=h$ , and the score should be zero. This sounds like a rather high (or low) bar to clear. So the question really is whether your algorithm is good enough , or better than some competing algorithm or a simply benchmark - for instance, you should certainly test whether your algorithm performs better than just taking empirical intervals over all your training data, which would be the simplest naive benchmark. This may be helpful once you have arrived at this stage.
