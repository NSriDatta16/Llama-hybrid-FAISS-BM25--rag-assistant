Send An Action Cocoa - IBAction

I'd like to send an action to another object using cocoa. Ideally i would also like it to appear in the Interface builder. I've tried the apple documentation, but there is something i'm missing. Adding the following, the interface building only shows the action as a received one. - (IBAction)setTarget:(id)anObject; - (IBAction)setAction:(SEL)aSelector; could someone please give me an example of how to create a sent action. Thanks I have the receive action defined in my controller1. I then want my controller2 to be able to send an action to controller1 (like NSButton does). In interface build you can drag a line FROM NSButton to the control that should receive the signal. This functionality can't be limited to just apple objects there, must be a way to do it.
