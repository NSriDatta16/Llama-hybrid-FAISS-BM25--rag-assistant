Assuming you are using MySQL as a database to store your enums, the enum values are stored as numbers not as the strings. So you don't lose space by using an enum vs using an integer FK. See How Does MySQL Store Enums? Enums are elegant as they are simple to use vs creating another table and then referencing it via an FK. If they refer to application logic it's better to have them as part of the schema/program than as part of the data (i.e. rows in a table). See http://www.databasesandlife.com/mysqls-enum-datatype-is-a-good-thing/ See here for how to use enums with Hibernate . (I wish this was a lot easier, I don't get why Hibernate doesn't support Enums out-of-the-box). http://community.jboss.org/wiki/UserTypeforpersistingaTypesafeEnumerationwithaVARCHARcolumn
