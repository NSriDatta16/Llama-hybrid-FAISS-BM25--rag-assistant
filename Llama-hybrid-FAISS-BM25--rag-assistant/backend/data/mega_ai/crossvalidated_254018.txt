Why is the $1-\alpha$ Bayesian credible interval for $\lambda \sim \chi^2_{v}$ have endpoints $\chi^2_{v, 1-\alpha/2}$ and $\chi^2_{v,\alpha/2}$?

Suppose that a posterior distribution $\lambda$ has distribution $\lambda \sim \chi^2_{v}$. Then, it is often written that a $1-\alpha$ Bayesian credible interval for $\lambda \sim \chi^2_{v}$ will have have lower and upper endpoints of $\chi^2_{v, 1-\alpha/2}$ and $\chi^2_{v,\alpha/2}$, respectively. I am wondering why the lower endpoint starts at $1-\alpha/2$ instead of $\alpha/2$? If $\alpha = 0.05$, then it seems weird for the lower point to start at $\chi^2_{v, 1-0.05/2} = \chi^2_{v, 0.975}$, which is the UPPER endpoint of a frequentist interval. Thanks.
