This is a very very good question. I asked this question myself. This problem is equivalent to logistic regression for instance when you calculate the residuals and sum them up. So because you are discrete for both the curves you can just calculate: $MSE = \frac {1}{n}\sum_{poins} (y_i-y_j)^2$ where $i$ and $j$ denote first and second curve. Note: sum is for all points.
