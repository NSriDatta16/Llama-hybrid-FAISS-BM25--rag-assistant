I would try a mixed ordinal model, e.g. check out clmm from R's ordinal package, with teacher as a random effect (grouping variable). Unbalanced designs should be fine (but with max two observations per teacher you definitely might want to check out Gauss-Hermite quadrature/the nAGQ argument. You might also want to add school as a random effect (although you will no longer be able to use Gauss-Hermite quadrature with this package). The MCMCglmm package also allows an ordinal response.
