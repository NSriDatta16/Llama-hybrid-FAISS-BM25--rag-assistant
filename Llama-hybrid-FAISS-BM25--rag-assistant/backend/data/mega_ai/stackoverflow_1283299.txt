I would highly, highly, HIGHLY (can I make it any more clear) recommend reading and understanding almost everything on this question: What should a developer know before building a public web site? It outlines all the big things you need to know about Security and Performance for Public Websites, a lot of which apply to e commerce sites. (When people's money is involved, it needs to work right). Furthermore, you should make sure any certificates you should have are there, encryption, etc. For Client's Specific Needs: Signing Up: Do they want to have promo codes to discount stuff? Is there a trial period? Billing: When does billing occur? (Probably should be doled out throughout the month) Should there be an interface to change the billing date? Leaving: How long does Customer Information stick around? How much access does a person have to the site when they unsubscribe Is there a day of grace period (Useful for file-storage sites) Some of this stuff might be dictated by the package you are using, but still good to have figured out.
