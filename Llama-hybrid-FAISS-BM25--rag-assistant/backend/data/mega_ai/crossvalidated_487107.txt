Your analysis result is correct. To illustrate, let's see what happens if a '1' and a '2' are returned. In such case, the conditional probability that P(a '1' and a '2' are returned | the true integer is 1) = 0.8 * 0.2 = 0.16 which equals P(a '1' and a '2' are returned | the true integer is 2) = 0.2 * 0.8 = 0.16. Since P(A=1) = P(A=2) = 0.5, when applying Bayesian, we see that the conditional probability P(the true integer is 1 | a '1' and a '2' are returned) = 0.16/(0.16+0.16) = 0.5, which is the same as the initial probability P(A=1) = P(A=2) = 0.5. This indicates that a pair of returned '1' and '2' does not provide any extra information about whether the true value is 1 or 2. In other words, the information provided by a returned '1' and '2' cancels each other. Thus, when you receive N returned '2' and (N+1) returned '1', the information provided by the N pairs of '1' and '2' cancels each other, and only the information provided by a single '1' is useful. Thus, the final probability is same as a single '1' is returned, as long as the model is symmetric, that is, P('1' is returned | true integer is 1) = P('2' is returned | true integer is 2).
