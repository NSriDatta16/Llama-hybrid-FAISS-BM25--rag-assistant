Bayesian analysis of Plausible Values in large-scale education surveys

Surveys like PISA, TIMSS etc. do not report individual achievement scores per observation, but five (sometimes ten) so-called "plausible values", drawn from a constructed probability distribution that represents the students achievement. The general way to analyse this (as given in many papers in technical reports) is to do five analyses on each set of PVs and then calculate the mean of interesting descriptive statistics (mean, variance etc.) How do you proceed when doing Bayesian analysis? I suppose you do the analysis five times, get five posterior probability distributions, and then? How do you combine those five distributions?
