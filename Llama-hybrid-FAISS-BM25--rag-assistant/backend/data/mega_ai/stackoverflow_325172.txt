Usually JSON is more compact, and faster to parse. Prefer XML if: You need to process the data on the client, and you can leverage XSL for that. Chances are the XML + XSL chain will work faster than JSON + JavaScript especially for big chunks of data. One good case is to convert the data into an HTML snippet. Various legacy cases: There is an existing XML service, and it is a hassle to rewrite it with JSON for some reasons. You have to post this data back as XML after some light processing using user's input. One important case of (almost) XML: try to detect when sending HTML snippets is more beneficial than sending raw data. AHAH can do wonders in simple applications, yet frequently overlooked. Usually this style assumes that a server sends HTML snippets that will be inlined in the web page without processing. Usually in AHAH cases CSS is being leveraged to the max to massage snippets visually and implementing simple conditionals like hiding/showing relevant parts of the snippet using user-specific or application-specific settings.
