Sounds like Google's CausalImpact method might be useful (python implementation here ). Briefly, you use pre-sale data to train a model that forecasts impressions, then forecast them for the sales period, and estimate the sales effect as a difference between observed and predicted impressions. CausalImpact uses a specific bayesian model to produce forecasts which is useful to estimate uncertainty, but in general this idea could be used with any (good enough) model.
