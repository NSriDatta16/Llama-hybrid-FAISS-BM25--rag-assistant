java is rather simple, when you give it a class file it will load it and try execute a program. Java programs are defined to start in the "public static void main(String... args)" method. So a class file missing this function has no valid entry point for a program. To make java call your paintComponent() method you have to add an instance of your class to a toplevel container like JFrame or for web applications an JApplet. (Applets don't use a main method as they are executed as part of a web page and not a standalone app.) Example: import javax.swing.* public class MyDrawPanel{ public static void main(String... args) { JFrame frame = new JFrame(200,200);//A window with 200x200 pixel MyDrawPanel mdp = new MyDrawPanel();//Panel instance frame.add(mdp);//Add the panel to the window frame.setVisible(true);//Display all frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);//exit when the window is closed } }
