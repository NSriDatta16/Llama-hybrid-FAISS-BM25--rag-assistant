I suppose you could create a local proxy, point these tools through that, and then have the local proxy interactively ask the user for the external proxy password which it would then apply. It could optionally remember this for a few minutes in obfuscated internal storage. An obvious attack vector would be for a privileged user to modify this local proxy to do something else with the entered password (as they could with anything else such as an email client that requests it or the windowing system itself), but at least you'd be safe from inadvertent viewing.
