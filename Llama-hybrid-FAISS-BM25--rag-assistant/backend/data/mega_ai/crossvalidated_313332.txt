What is the definition of a "main effect" of a factor when it has more than two levels?

In a factorial experiment the definition of the main effect of a factor A with two levels, 0 and 1, is the difference in outcome means between the two level averaging over all other factors, $\bar{y}_{A=0} - \bar{y}_{A=1}$. What is the extension of this definition to factors with more than two levels? Some possible ideas are The difference between a factor level and the grand mean giving us one main effect for each factor level. The difference in mean outcome between each pair of factor levels. The anova sum of squares associated with the factor giving us one main effect per factor. Is there a formal definition of 'main effect' when factors have more than two levels?
