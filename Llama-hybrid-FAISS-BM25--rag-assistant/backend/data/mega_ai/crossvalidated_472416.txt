Is there a "piecewise linear fitting" for logistic regression?

For regression problem we can fit the data with a piecewise linear function (Linear Splines). Is there a "piecewise linear fitting" for binary classification? Is that using spline basis expansion for logistic regression? For example, some model to fit data like this (for logistic regression the decision boundary is a line. in the picture, the decision boundary is a piecewise linear function.)
