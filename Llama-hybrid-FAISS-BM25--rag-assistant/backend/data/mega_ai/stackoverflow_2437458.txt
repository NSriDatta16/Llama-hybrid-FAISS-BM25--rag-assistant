You want to use Ping to check whether a PC is connected to the LAN. Here's a sample: var ping = new Ping(); var options = new PingOptions { DontFragment = true }; //just need some data. this sends 10 bytes. var buffer = Encoding.ASCII.GetBytes( new string( 'z', 10 ) ); var host = "127.0.0.1"; try { var reply = ping.Send( host, 60, buffer, options ); if ( reply == null ) { MessageBox.Show( "Reply was null" ); return; } if ( reply.Status == IPStatus.Success ) { MessageBox.Show( "Ping was successful." ); } else { MessageBox.Show( "Ping failed." ); } } catch ( Exception ex ) { MessageBox.Show( ex.Message ); } To check if you own machine was connected, you could do the same to an address you know should resolve like say the domain controller.
