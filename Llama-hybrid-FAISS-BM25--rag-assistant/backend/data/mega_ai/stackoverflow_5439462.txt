HTML Canvas draw arc between two points

I have found similar questions out there, but no answer. I have sketched a circle like so ctx.strokeStyle='rgb(0,0,0)'; ctx.lineWidth=10; ctx.beginPath(); ctx.arc(100,100,45,0,Math.PI*2,true); ctx.closePath(); ctx.stroke(); which gives a circle situated at (100,100) with radius 45, plus 5 for the linewidth, making it a circle of radius 50. Now, I want to sketch the exact same circle, but another color, and only 1/4 of the original circumfrance (think the XBOX 360 red ring of doom). So I tried this ctx.strokeStyle='rgb(0,250,0)'; ctx.lineWidth=10; ctx.beginPath(); ctx.arc(100,100,45,0,Math.PI/2,true); //use 1/4 of original angle ctx.closePath(); ctx.stroke(); But that has the really annoying aspect of connecting the first and last points (sometimes I wonder who created the canvas element, like when embedding text, but don't get me started on that...)
