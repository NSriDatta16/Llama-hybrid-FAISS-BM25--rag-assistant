Assuming that these declarations are at global scope (i.e. aren't member variables), then: static means 'internal linkage'. In this case, since it is declared const this can be optimised/inlined by the compiler. If you omit the const then the compiler must allocate storage in each compilation unit. By omitting static the linkage is extern by default. Again, you've been saved by the const ness - the compiler can optimise/inline usage. If you drop the const then you will get a multiply defined symbols error at link time.
