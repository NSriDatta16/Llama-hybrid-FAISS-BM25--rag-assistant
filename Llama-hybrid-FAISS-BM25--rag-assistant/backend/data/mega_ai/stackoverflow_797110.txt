Whichever you use, just avoid using anything that post all the form values. Update Panels is one of those. That means: Extenders with the ajax control toolkit. These imposes limitations on your code. JQuery + JSON. Simple service calls. Leverage the same skills for client side as in other platforms. Ajax Pro. Don't know, so can't say anything about its strengths/weaknesses. I would stick with JQuery. It works great, and you get skills that work in other platforms :).
