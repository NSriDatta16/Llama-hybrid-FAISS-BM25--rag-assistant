If you want to remove all other lines aside from those with if, else or fi you can use this %v/\(if\|else\|fi\)/d 'v' is the opposite of 'g' and will remove any lines that don't match the regexp. To add to what strager said, the pipe character '|' is escaped in Vim, I imagine because Vim assumes you'll be looking for literal characters more often than you will have need of extensive RegExps. You can make Vim use less escaped RegExps by setting the 'magic' level to 'very' when in ex mode: Use of "\v" means that in the pattern after it all ASCII characters except '0'-'9', 'a'-'z', 'A'-'Z' and '_' have a special meaning. "very magic" See :he /magic for more information It is not recommended that you set the default magic level to 'very' in your vimrc though (as the help file notes).
