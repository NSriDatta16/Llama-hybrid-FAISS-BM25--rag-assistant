How to enforce a monotonic answer in a single feature in a Binary classification problem

I am trying to use sklearn Random forest to predict the probability of win/lose in a card game. There are 4 features in my data set. Feature $X_4$ is the hand strength of the player and y (the winning probability) is monotonically increasing in the hand strength. Thus I have a cutoff decision: for every combination of the first three features $(X_1,X_2,X_3)$ there is a Threshold $T$ such that, for $X_4 > T$ , play Right, otherwise play Left. The prediction isn't monotonic, that is, for some $(X_1,X_2,X_3, X_4=x')$ the predicted label is $1$ however for $(X_1,X_2,X_3, X_4=x'')$ where $x''>x'$ the predicted label is $0$ . How can I enforce this monotonicity? Should I use a different classifier? is DecisionTreeClassifier better suit this problem? my data labels are unbalanced at 65:35
