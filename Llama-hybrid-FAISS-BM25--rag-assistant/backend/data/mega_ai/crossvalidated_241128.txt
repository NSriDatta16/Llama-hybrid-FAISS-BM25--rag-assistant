PCA can be used as a step for pre-processing the model features. From my experience: Pros: Reducing dimensionality. Reducing noise and possibly improving model performance. Cons: Sensitivity to original features scale. Transformed space new features might not have any representation in the real world, and reverse transformation might be messy.
