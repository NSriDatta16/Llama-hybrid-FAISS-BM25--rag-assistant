Predicting outcome of binary data

I have a time series data structure in the form: $$ \stackrel{\mbox{Time $t$}}{% \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 1 & 1 & \dots & p_{t} & p_{t+1} \end{bmatrix}}\ $$ where each entry is a binary result for some task, I would like to know if it is possible to predict the probability that the next outcome p_t is correct. The assumption regarding the data that is made is that the user performance in the task increases over time and then stabilizes to some value. Thanks, Sagar
