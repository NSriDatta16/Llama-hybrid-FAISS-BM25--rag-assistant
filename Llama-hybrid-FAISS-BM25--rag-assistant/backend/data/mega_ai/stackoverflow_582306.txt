You will need to handle your file access through web programming language, such as PHP or ASP.net. To set this up, you would: Create a script that handles the file reading and writing. This should be visible to the browser. Send jQuery ajax requests to that script that either write data or read data. You would need to pass all of your read/write information through the request parameters. You can learn more about this in the jQuery ajax documentation. Make sure that you sanitize any data that you are storing, since this could potentially be a security risk. However, this is really just standard flat-file data storage, and is not necessarily that unusual. As Paolo pointed out, there is no way to directly read/write to a file through jQuery or any other type of javascript.
