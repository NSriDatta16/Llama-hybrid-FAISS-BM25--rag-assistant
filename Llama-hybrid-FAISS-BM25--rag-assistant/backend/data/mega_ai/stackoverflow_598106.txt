It's easier to understand the meaning of the File's Owner reference if you read about and understand the nib loading process. https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/LoadingResources/CocoaNibs/CocoaNibs.html Cocoa's frameworks handle many nib loads automatically on your behalf, with one of Cocoa's own built-in classes serving as the controller class that manages, or "owns" the nib file's instantiated objects. When you load your own nibs manually, you get to choose which class will serve as the file's owner.
