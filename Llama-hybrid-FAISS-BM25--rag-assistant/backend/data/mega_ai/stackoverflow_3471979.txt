You can use JavaMail immediatly for accessing IMAP and POP3-Stores, not for filesystem storage. In JavaMail the access to email is organzied via implementations of javax.mail.Store. You can check JavaMail API - Third Party Products for implementations of javax.mail.Store for your special file format. Maybe you will implement javax.mail.Store by yourself, if you cannot find something appropriate. With using your Store, you can use all of the features of JavaMail eg attachment handling, all weird MIME stuff etc.
