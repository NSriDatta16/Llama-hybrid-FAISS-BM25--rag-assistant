python import problem

although there are many posts on the internet as well as some posts on stack overflow, I still want to ask about this nasty python "import" problem. OK. so, the open source code organization is usually like this: project/src/model.py; project/test/testmodel.py if I put the famous __init__.py in project directory and also in src/ and test/ subdirectories, and then put "from project.src import model" for the testmodel.py. it does not work! keep telling me that the Module named "project.src" is not found! how can I solve the problem without changing the code structure?
