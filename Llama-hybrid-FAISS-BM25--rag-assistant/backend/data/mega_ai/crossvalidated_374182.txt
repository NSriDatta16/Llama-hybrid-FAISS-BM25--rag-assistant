The plots have been made on hourly wind speed readings. Most weather phenomenon like wind, temperature, humidity are continuously changing with time and do not occur spontaneously. This is also seen from the ACF plot you've shared. If the wind speed was 100 km/hr right now, it was 80 km/hr an hour ago and 70 km/hr 2 hours ago; thus indicating that speed picked up gradually and didn't just shoot up to 100 km/hr from still air conditions. So, in a way the ACF chart does help you by improving your understanding of how current wind conditions can help predict the wind speed after 1 hour. But tha ACF and PACF do not provide sufficient information to be able to deduce which type of time series model will be the best for the problem you're trying to solve. For trends and seasonality, you need observations that span longer time periods.
