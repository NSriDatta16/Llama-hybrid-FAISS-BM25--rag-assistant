I think you are interested in equivalence testing. See this other question on testing a hypothesis of no group differences . There are various approaches that can be adopted to assess whether the null hypothesis is true. In general, the absence of statistically significant effect is very week evidence for the truth of the null hypothesis. Three common approaches include (a) looking at confidence intervals; (b) looking at bayesian posterior densities on the parameter of interest; or (c) setting up two one-sided significance tests. The confidence interval and Bayesian posterior density approach are often used to quantify uncertainty of a parameter of interest. The Bayesian approach is arguably more aligned with the question of interest where the parameter is seen as unknown. Looking at such intervals you could judge that if the interval includes the null hypothesis and other plausible values are sufficiently close to zero, then this means that the null hypothesis or something sufficiently similar is the most likely the truth. A similar approach is to set up two one-sided significance tests. E.g., when testing whether the means are the same for two groups ($\delta = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\sigma}$) you could test whether $\delta$ is significantly less than .1 and significantly more than -.1. In this cases you could calculate the statistical power of such tests assuming: the null hypothesis is true alpha sample size Or if you wanted to hold power constant, then you could assess what sample size would be required. You could also vary the threshold for equivalence and see how as you expand the width of the equivalence threshold your power increases. This is a common applied problem in the context of equivalence and non-inferiority testing for drugs (e.g., Walker and Nowacki, 2011). References Walker, E., & Nowacki, A. S. (2011).
