firefox (Gecko) conditional style sheet

today I'm trying to optimize my website for a better rendering in firefox! my problems are the text-shadow and font-weight properties ... I would like to set custom values only for firefox (my website is mac only compatible so I don't need IE compatibility) but I don't wont to use separate style sheet for only these two properties!!! There is any way to do that? Or I must use a php script to filter the user agent and load customized style sheets for firefox? Thanks in advance!
