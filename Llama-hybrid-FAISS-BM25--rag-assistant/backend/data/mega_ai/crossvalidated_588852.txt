If I understand your use case correctly, it is important to keep the time between the sensor measurements and the failure evaluation approximately comparable. So one approach could be to bin the time before the failure evaluation (FE) in equal intervals, e.g. monthly intervals before the failure evaluation (e.g. use the boundaries [n month before FE, n-1 month before FE, ..., two months before FE, FE]), and average the available measurements within each month. That way you get time series which might contain missing values. Here, you could apply one of the many imputation methods available. Which one is the most appropriate very much depends on your situation, but for your time series, a good choice could be Kalman filter smoothing . This would leave you with a set of comparable time series without missing values that you can use as input to your binary classification algorithm.
