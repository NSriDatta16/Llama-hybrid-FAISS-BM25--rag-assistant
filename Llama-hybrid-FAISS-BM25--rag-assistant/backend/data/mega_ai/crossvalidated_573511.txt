You are working in a function space, specifically, the space of probability distributions equipped with some useful topology. In this case, we can choose two probability distributions in that space - $F$ and $\Delta_x$ - and we can "draw" a "straight line" between them by varying $\epsilon$ from $0$ to $1$ : $$F_{x,\epsilon} = (1-\epsilon)F(x) + \epsilon\Delta_x$$ We have to do it as a weighted average (as opposed to what you are used to seeing in college Calculus classes where we have $f(x+\epsilon)$ and $f(x)$ ) because otherwise $F_{x,\epsilon}$ wouldn't be a probability distribution (as it wouldn't integrate to $1$ ) so wouldn't lie in our space of probability distributions. Conceptually you can see that all finite mixtures lie in this space too. We are simply taking one that is very convenient for analyzing the robustness of a functional. The space we have constructed is analogous to the real line in traditional calculus. Instead of a function $f(x)$ whose derivative with respect to $x$ we would like to calculate, we have a functional $T(F)$ whose derivative with respect to $F$ in the direction of $\Delta_x$ we would like to find. The derivative is not at a (real-valued) point $x$ , but at a (probability distribution valued) point $F$ . In this use case, $x$ merely indicates which $\Delta$ (i.e., which direction) we are finding the derivative with respect to. How do we do this? Well, trying to write more intuitively than mathematically, $F_{x,\epsilon}$ varies continuously with $\epsilon$ (for any $x$ ), and as $\epsilon \rightarrow 0$ , $F_{x,\epsilon} \rightarrow F$ monotonically. It seems natural, then, that we would measure the distance between $F_{x,\epsilon}$ and $F$ by $\epsilon$ . This leads to the Gateaux derivative, customized to the definition of our space, as: $$dT(F; \Delta_x) = \lim_{\epsilon \rightarrow 0}{T((1-\epsilon)F + \epsilon\Delta_x) - T(F) \over \epsilon}$$ which is easily seen to be equivalent to the definition of influence function.
