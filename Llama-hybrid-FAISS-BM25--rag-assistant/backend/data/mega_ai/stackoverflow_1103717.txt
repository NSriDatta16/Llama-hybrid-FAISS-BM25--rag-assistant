I think your best approach here would be to take periodic "snapshots" of the full state data, say every 1000 samples (for example), along with recording the deltas. When you're storing your data as offsets from some original value (aka deltas), you don't have any choice but to reconstruct the full data starting with the original values. Storing periodic snapshots will lessen the amount of reconstruction you have to do - the design tradeoff is between low storage requirements but long reconstruction time on the one hand, and higher storage requirements but shorter reconstruction time on the other. MPEGs, for example, store each frame as the differences between the current frame and the previous frame. Ordinarily, this would force an MPEG to be viewed from the beginning, but the format also periodically stores full frames so that the decoder doesn't have to backtrack all the way to the beginning of the file.
