Is there such a quality measure for pHDRs? A relative quality measure is the Bayes' factor comparing two model specifications $\alpha_i$ and $\alpha_j$ for the single observation $Y_t$ . Model weighting in the mixture model context is based upon the relative predictive densities of observations $Y_t$ : $$ H_t\left(\alpha_i,\alpha_j\right) = \frac{p\left(Y_t | \alpha_i,D_{t-1}\right)}{p\left(Y_t | \alpha_j,D_{t-1}\right)} $$ See West, Mike, and Jeff Harrison. "Bayesian forecasting and dynamic models." (1997) Ch 12.2 Multi-Process Models: Class I. The above is slightly off what you requested; it compares the predictive density functions of two models, rather than provide a performance measure for the pHDR of one model. However, it is perhaps in the spirit of remaining open to better models, as discussed in Skilling, John. "Nested sampling for general Bayesian computation." (2006).
