First off, you need to understand that, because the "regression function" is S-shaped, the first derivative is not constant. You therefore need to calculate the marginal effect at a certain point . Comparatively, in a linear regression, we do not have to care about that since the slope of a line is the same everywhere on this line. You have different possibilities: calculate the marginal effect at the mean (in general the default option), at the median, or at particular data points. That being said: The intercept is the probability of buying a car when all the other characteristics are zero. Make sure that zero is in the definition domains of your data. The values of the coefficients evaluated at a certain point give the usual interpretation: "if I face a client in the category 31-40, I have an increase of XX% to sell him a car, with respect to my referent class and all else being equal." What do you mean ? Yes, in my opinion it makes sense to use a logistic regression in this context. You can use categorical data but pay attention to your referent class.
