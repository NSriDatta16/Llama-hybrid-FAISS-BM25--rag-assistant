Good NTFS question and not all the information here. What is the directoriy structure?. Are there any LINK files on this? Are you using compression on the drive? Volume Shadow copies? You do not run out of MFT space, since there is a constant # of files / directories. That means that the MFT is static. Also the MFT reserve space will be ued in low-disk space scenarios. I've used up every cluster on an NTFS volume. There are several explanations as to what is happening: 1) The $Log file might have grown. This is a roll-back log. 2) The @SII file for the security info for file might have grown if there are non- uniform permissions on the drive 3) If some of the files on that volme have .lnk/ shortcut files pointing to them, the system puts a GUID for each target into an index. ( you get .lnk files if you 2x click on a file in explorer - in recent documents!) 4) the directory structure is NOT static ( or the file names are not uniform in length) the $index buffers of directories might grow in size. 5) If you have a system volume directroy on that drive, you might have volume shadow copies and othe OS specific data. 6) Alternate Data streams are not shown in the file's size. Are there any? 7) TxF - Under vista and higher there might be a transactional layer that takes up variable space. 8) Bad clusters? Clusters can go bad ( but chkdsk might note this .. ) 9) The files become fragmented and the list of fragments alson with the other meta data is too big to fit into a MFT record (unlikely nince your files are small and you don't have massively long files) 10) The use of hardlinks also puts more data on the drive. I've listed all of these as a reference for other people! Final note - sometimes you can create and write a small file even if there are 0 bytes free, since NTFS resident files only take up an MFT record (they resue a deleted free one)
