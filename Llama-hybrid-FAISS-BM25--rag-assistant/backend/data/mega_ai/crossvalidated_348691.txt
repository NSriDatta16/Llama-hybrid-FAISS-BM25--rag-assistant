I don't have an answer, but I do have an advice, and it's the same advice my mother used to give me The first thing you do, with any sort of data, is you plot it. In lieu of real data I've had to do with simulations. Hope it fits somewhat. set.seed(1) ee As you can see, the three judges are in broad agreement, but there are some idiosyncrasies. For example: Judge A gives on average lower scores than the other two. There are a few obvious instances where one of the judges has had a very different impression from the other two. Like with subject 4, 5 and 11, where judge C gives by far the highest grades. Less obvious is the case with subject 15. Although the score given by judge A isn't all that high compared to the other two's, it is significant in that it's the only case where judge A gives the highest score of all. So which of these are outliers? Which of these should be removed? Maybe 6, maybe 12, maybe half, maybe none? It all depends. Maybe outliers shouldn't be removed completely, but rather given less weight in further analysis? Maybe the distributions should be scaled or transformed in another way? It all depends.
