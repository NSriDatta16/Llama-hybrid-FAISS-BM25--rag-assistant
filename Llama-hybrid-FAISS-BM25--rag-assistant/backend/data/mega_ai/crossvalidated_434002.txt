Why does the 'weighted' f1-score result in a score not between precision and recall?

On the F1 score sklearn page there's a section that explains each of the options for the average parameter. Under the weighted option, it says: "it can result in an F-score that is not between precision and recall." I would like to know why this happens. Thanks
