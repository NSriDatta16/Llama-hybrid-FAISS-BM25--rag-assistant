How can I interpret what I get out of PCA?

As part of a University assignment, I have to conduct data pre-processing on a fairly huge, multivariate (>10) raw data set. I'm not a statistician in any sense of the word, so I'm a little confused as to what's going on. Apologies in advance for what is probably a laughably simple question - my head's spinning after looking at various answers and trying to wade through the stats-speak. I've read that: PCA allows me to reduce the dimensionality of my data It does so by merging / removing attributes / dimensions that correlate a lot (and thus are a little unnecessary) It does so by finding eigenvectors on covariance data (thanks to a nice tutorial I followed through to learn this) Which is great. However, I'm really struggling to see how I can apply this practically to my data. For instance (this is not the data set I'll be using, but an attempt at a decent example people can work with), if I were to have a data set with something like... PersonID Sex Age Range Hours Studied Hours Spent on TV Test Score Coursework Score 1 1 2 5 7 60 75 2 1 3 8 2 70 85 3 2 2 6 6 50 77 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I'm not quite sure how I would interpret any results. Most of the tutorials I've seen online seem to give me a very mathematical view of PCA. I've done some research into it and followed them through - but I'm still not entirely sure what this means for me, who's just trying to extract some form of meaning from this pile of data I have in front of me. Simply performing PCA on my data (using a stats package) spits out an NxN matrix of numbers (where N is the number of original dimensions), which is entirely greek to me. How can I do PCA and take what I get in a way I can then put into plain english in terms of the original dimensions?
