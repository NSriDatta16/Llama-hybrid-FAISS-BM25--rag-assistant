convert HTML ( having Javascript ) to PDF using JavaScript

I want to convert HTML (containing JavaScript ) to a PDF. How can I do that? I just want to show what is being shown in web page. I am displaying a gantt chart that is generated by a JavaScript library. Now I want to save that HTML web page as a PDF, how to do that?
