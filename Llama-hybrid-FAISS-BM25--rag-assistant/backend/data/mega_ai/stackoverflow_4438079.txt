RBF neural networks

I would like to apply RBF neural networks to teach my system. I have a system with an input: | 1 2 3 4 5 6 ... 32 | 33 | | 1000 0001 0010 0100 1000 1000 ... 0100 | 0 0 1 | You have to read this without the "|" character. I just wanted you to see that the last three elements in the input are staying together. The result have to be a number between 1-32, which has the value "1000" in the input. In my training set I will always have a result for an array of this kind. What kind of functions can I use for the teaching algorithm? Can you point me please to the right way? If you can't understand my description please don't hesitate to ask about it. Thank you guys for your help!
