transformations of empirical distributions for multi class logistic regression

I am working on a multiclass logistic classification problem where two of the predictors (features) have highly skewed distributions. One is visibility (in m), which looks something like this: Another is precipitation rate : NB: there are a few high-precipitation rate points that are not visible on the histogram; sample summary statistics: count 746300.000000 mean 0.000036 std 0.000192 min 0.000000 25% 0.000000 50% 0.000000 75% 0.000000 max 0.017100 What transforms should I use to reduce skewness of these empirical distributions? I've tried the Box-Cox / Yeo-Johnson and quantile transforms. The output of the former is still skewed; the output of the latter is close to uniform (as it should be), but I lose distance information. Any other ideas? And, as a more fundamental question, should I really aim to reduce skewness ? I'd like my logit model to be able to pick up on certain data "signals" such as exceptionally high precipitation rates and / or low visibility events. Should I transform both precipitation and visibility to categorical variables instead?
