What is going on in an MCMC chain?

I'm currently running some data through the MCMCglmm package in R. I was wandering what actually happens in the chain that is created? I have a multiresponse model (as a quick overview of the data: I'm trying to estimate variance and covariance within and between 6 traits - e.g. body size, these traits are measured on multiple individuals of 80 families, and there are some random effects such as experimental block). I would like to know what is actually happening inside that chain making process - what is going on and how are the prior distributions and the data involved? It's obviously not just plucking numbers of thin air, it's using the prior and data in some way. What are the calculations or processes underlying this?
