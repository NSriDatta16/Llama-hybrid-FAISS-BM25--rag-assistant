Can I interpret the inclusion of a quadratic term in logistic regression as indicating a turning point?

In a Logistic Regression with linear and quadratic terms only, if I have a linear coefficient $\beta_1$ and quadratic coefficient $\beta_2$, can I say that that there is turning point of the probability at $-\beta_1 / (2\beta_2)$?
