Problem formulating a hypothesis test for the mean

Suppose that I would like to support the following hypothesis: h = The average weight of people in New York is 70kg. If I take h to be the null hypothesis then I can only reject it (I assume that failing to reject h will not support h). So, how can I formulate a hypothesis test for supporting h?
