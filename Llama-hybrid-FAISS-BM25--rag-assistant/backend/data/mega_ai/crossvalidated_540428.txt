How to use Logistic Regression/Decision Tree with 'inflated' responses

I'm struggling on how can I use logistic regression when I have a database where 99% of the responses are 0 ('NO') and 1% are 1 ('YES'). I'm afraid by using somethin like zero-inflated, since it is not counting. Any hint on where I can find a solution, or some technique to apply? I'm not 'stuck' in this model, I ` d like to compare with others, like Decision Tree. But I had this same problem using this approach.
