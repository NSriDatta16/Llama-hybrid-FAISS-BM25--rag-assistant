How does the mice imputation function work?

I was wondering if anyone had experience using the mice function, as described in mice: Multivariate Imputation by Chained Equations in R (JSS 2011 45(3))? I have a dataset with a number of variables, each with varying degrees of missing data. My primary question is: say I use Bayesian linear regression to impute missing data, does mice automatically use predictor variables from most significant to least significant to impute? Also, is it common to perhaps average all the imputed datasets?
