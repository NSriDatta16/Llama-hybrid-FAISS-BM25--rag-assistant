Sure you could bootstrap this to get a handle on uncertainty -- after all, that's one of the reasons for bootstrapping in the first place. First, ensure that the entire "raw" dataset with $n=460$ cars are lined up in rows of an e.g. spreadsheet, database, etc. Assume there are 50 classes of cars based on your partitioning scheme, so make a 50 x 500 array $\bf{X}$ , where $B=500$ is the number of bootstraps you will perform. Next, "perform a bootstrap" by randomly drawing $n=460$ cars with replacement , and for each car ensure you know the make, model, engine size, and anything else you need, to parse the cars using the same rules (partitioning characteristics) you already used. (randomly drawing means select an integer at random between 1 and 460, and with replacement means an integer can be selected multiple times). Calculate the statistics and fuel economy the same way. There will be a different number of Honda's and other models of various model/engine size after each bootstrap. There can even be no Tesla's selected, but that's ok, so just ensure there is no average if no Tesla's are randomly drawn. Also, don't create a mean value of zero if there are no Tesla's selected, since the sample size is $n=0$ -- so there can't be an average. Store the results in column 1 of array $\bf{X}$ . Repeat steps 2 and 3 $B=500$ times, for a total of 500 iterations (bootstraps). Using the data in $\bf{X}$ , generate histograms of the calculated statistics in the 50 rows. The 50 histograms, based on 500 values will reveal the uncertainty around the calculated statistics. (note: you may not have 500 statistics for e.g. Tesla's or other cars with a small model, since the sample size can be zero during any bootstrap. Just make sure you don't e.g. set an average to zero if no Tesla's are drawn during a bootstrap -- since there won't be an average, it will result in an empty matrix element of $\bf{X}$ .
