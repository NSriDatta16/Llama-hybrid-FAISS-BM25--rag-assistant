Simple distance measure for financial time series

I have a large quantity of financial trading systems that I believe are highly duplicative, meaning that I believe a large number of the trading systems are essentially the same thing. I am looking for a way to measure the differences between each of the trading systems. One simple way to do this is correlation of daily returns, although that limits me to linear relationships and a correlation matrix of 100k x 100k, which is not really useful. What methods can I use to measure differences between the time series and then to cluster them together, with the eventual goal of removing the trading systems that are highly similar? I'm new to this, so if I'm leaving out relevant information please let me know and I will modify this question. Thanks. Sample data is below: StratID SystemID Date Daily Simple Return 1 1 1/25/2011 0.04 1 1 1/26/2011 0.49 1 1 1/27/2011 -0.02 1 1 1/28/2011 0.76 1 1 1/31/2011 0.61 1 2 1/3/2011 1.37 1 2 1/4/2011 -0.02 1 2 1/5/2011 -0.52 1 2 1/6/2011 0.16 1 2 1/7/2011 0.85 1 2 1/10/2011 -0.14
