I wonder, that nobody mentioned Codechef . As others already stated, a coding competition might not be the optimal way to test your skill level, but Codechef is a slightly different case. They offer monthly programming competitions with multiple assignments. You can enter in almost any language and you have 1 week of time. So there is no rush, but even then, the competitions will rather test your logical thinking and problem solving abilities, than your knowledge of the C++ language. (Though, one can learn much from reading the source code of other entries.) However, I can only encourage everybody to enter at least once - programming is fun! =D
