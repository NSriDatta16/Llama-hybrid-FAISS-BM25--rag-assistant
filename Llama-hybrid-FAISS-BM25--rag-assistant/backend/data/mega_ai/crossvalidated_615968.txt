Uniformly Integrable Martingale

I have $(Y_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ as a seq. of positive, independent r.v.'s whose expectation is 1 $\forall n$ . I have the canonical filtration $\mathcal{F}_{n}=\sigma(Y_{k},k\leq n)$ . I have already shown that $\xi_{n}=\prod_{k=1}^{n}Y_{k}$ is an $\mathcal{F_{n}}$ -martingale, and that $(\sqrt{\xi_{n}})_{n\geq 0}$ is a $\mathcal{F_{n}}$ -supermartingale. The question proceeds to add an additional condition, $\prod_{k=1}^{\infty}\mathbb{E}(\sqrt{Y_{k}})=0$ . My question: How do I use this additional condition to look at the convergence of $(\sqrt{\xi_{n}})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ and use this to show whether or not $(\xi_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}$ is a uniformly integrable martingale? My idea: I would like to use a theorem stating that if $(X_{n},\mathcal{F_{n}})_{n\in \mathbb{N}}$ is an $L^{1}(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ -bounded martingale, then $\lim_{n\to\infty}X_{n}=Y$ a.s., where Y is some random variable in the same space. However, I'm not totally sure how to leverage the information I know to show this. I then would like to show this martingale is right-closable, and thus uniformly integrable. Any tips on showing this?
