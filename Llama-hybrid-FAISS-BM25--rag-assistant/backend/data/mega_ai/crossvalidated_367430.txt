I tried to watch the video to understand exactly what he means by "verification" and "recognition" but unfortunately the video only shows the preview (only first half of the video). So I would give my own understanding of the two systems. Given an image of a face A, a "verification" system tries to answer the question: does the image of the face A match the person A, who is known to the system? On average, a verification system with 99% accuracy (or 1% error rate) would make mistake once out of every 100 predictions. On the other hand, "recognition" system tries to answer: who among the K=100 people matches the image of the face A? ( None of them is also a possible answer). A simple program may just repeat the "verification" task on K=100 known people, and return the answer for those persons that the verification task says yes. Ideally you would have one correct answer, but due to imperfection in the system, sometimes you may end up with the wrong answer whose face is that. Sometimes it returns even two or more faces. If you repeat a not-so-good verification system above (with error rate 1%) for 100 times, on average, the error rate on the recognition system is 100x1%=1. With that understanding, I think the difficulty of recognition system boils down to the difference in number of prediction classes. Verification problem is a binary classification with two classes whereas recognition problem is a classification problem with K labels, with K as the number of the possible identities to return. K could be very large (imagine an company of 10000 employees).
