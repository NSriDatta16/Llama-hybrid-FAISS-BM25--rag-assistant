The problem with AIC is that it does not take into account the stochastics of the parameter vector ${\boldsymbol { \beta}}$ . Recall that in multiple regression, each estimate of the regression parameters $\beta_0,\ldots,\beta_p$ , follow the distribution $\;\hat{\beta_j} \; \sim T(n-p-1)$ . Here $n$ is the number of data points and $p$ the size of the parameter vector (plus one, the constant $\beta_0$ ). Specifically, define the squared inverse of the data matrix: $\bf{W} = (\bf{X}^T\bf{X})^{-1}$ , and element $w_{j,j}$ being the $j$ 'th diagonal element in $\bf{W}$ . Let further $s=SRS/(n-p-1)$ , where SRS is the sum of the squared residuals: $SRS=(\bf{y}-\bf{X}^T{\boldsymbol { \beta}})^T(\bf{y}-\bf{X}^T{\boldsymbol { \beta}})$ . The vector $\bf{y}$ contains the values you are trying to predict. Finally, $t_j=\hat{\beta}_j/(\sqrt{s}\,\sqrt{w_{j,j}})$ , which is the test statistic for parameter $\hat{\beta}_j$ . Clearly, the degrees-of-freedom normalized variance $s$ is disregarded in the AIC. That is why this model complexity criterion is unsuited for model selection. I suggest that you look further in the literature for a more advanced model complexity criterion. In the end, you want to make the optimal choice between model-bias and model-variance. Instead of the AIC, it is recommended to use a model selection criterion which accounts for the uncertainty of the model fit. Taken from [1], the $SIC_f$ is well-defined and not even complex to compute for a linear regression model. Define $SIC_f$ as \begin{equation} SIC_f = (n-p-2) \ln(s) + \ln \mid \bf{X}^T\bf{X} \mid \end{equation} where $s$ is the estimated residual variance, as defined above and $\mid \; \cdot \; \mid$ is the matrix determinant. So the proposal is to compare $SIC_f(Model_a)$ with $SIC_f(Model_b)$ and choose the preferred model $a$ or $b$ . The $Model_{z}$ that has the lowest $SIC_f$ is preferred. I recommend reading the referred article on this score. A. A. Neathy, J. E. Cavanaugh, Regression and time series model selection using variants of the Schwarz information criterion.
