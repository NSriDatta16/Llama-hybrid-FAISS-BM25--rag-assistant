There aren't any good reasons to switch to Java. C++ is better than Java for systems and/or embedded programming, and there are many better alternatives for rapid prototyping. Now, you tagged your question MFC even though it doesn't appear in the main text. I would recommend switching from MFC to one of the more modern C++ UI frameworks, because MFC is brain-dead, non-standard, fragile and very difficult to customize.
