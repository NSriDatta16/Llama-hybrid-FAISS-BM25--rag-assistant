I don't have experience with SKLearn, but a logistic regression model per se actually provides a probability of class membership. The classification comes at a later stage when you specify a probability cutoff (typically 1/2, but that can be adjusted if, for example, different misclassification errors have different costs). I would recommend looking into the SKLearn documentation for how to get the probability values from the program.
