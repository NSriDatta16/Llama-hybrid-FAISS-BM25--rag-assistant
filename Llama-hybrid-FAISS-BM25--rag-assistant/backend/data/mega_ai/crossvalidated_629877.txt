Implications of very low but statistically significant average marginal effects

I built a multivariate logistic regression model, which is largely a replication of a published paper (I just some different data). My regression table (with the coefficient reported as log odds) looks like this: ============================================= Dependent variable: --------------------------- DV.dum --------------------------------------------- IV.dum1 1.205*** (0.184) IV.dum2 1.207*** (0.185) IV.continuous1 0.001 (0.001) IV.continuous2 0.001*** (0.0002) IV.continuous3 -0.002*** (0.0003) control.dum 24.595 (285.040) control.continuous -0.003*** (0.0003) Constant -4.035*** (0.137) --------------------------------------------- Observations 66,310 Log Likelihood -1,557.481 Akaike Inf. Crit. 3,130.962 ============================================= Note: *p The results are very similar results to those of the published paper, in terms of both direction and magnitude of the estimated effects. However, the authors only reported their results as log odds and as they point in the same direction as hypothesized, they concluded that the results confirmed their hypothesis. I like to transform the estimates of logit models to average marginal effects (AMEs), because they are easier to interpret. However, I got these AMEs, which are very low, almost zero: Variable AME SE IV.dum1 4.999893e-03 8.085180e-04 IV.dum2 5.008722e-03 8.136398e-04 IV.continuous1 2.587048e-06 2.740353e-06 IV.continuous2 3.324357e-06 7.552852e-07 IV.continuous3 -8.575452e-06 1.323206e-06 control.dum 1.020670e-01 1.182942e+00 control.continuous -1.226762e-05 1.279210e-06 Now, I am wondering if I maybe overlooked something or if I am interpreting these results wrong? To my understanding, a AME of 0.005 means that a one unit increase in that variable increases the likelihood of the dependent variable by only 0.5% -- which is not very much. I am wondering if that means that the variable doesn't really explain any variations in the dependent variable, although most of them are statistically significant, also given that this AME is already one of the highest. So, does the model "suck" and the original authors just didn't honestly report it or am I not thinking straight here? For the modeling, I used R's glm function for fitting generalized linear models. I used the margins function of the margins library to calculate the AMEs (see vignette here for more info).
