The short answer is probably no. A famous researcher named Jim Gray gave a talk about storage and performance which included this great analogy . Assuming your brain as the processor, accessing a register takes 1 clock tick (numbers on left) which roughly equivalent to that information being in your brain. Accessing memory takes 100 clock ticks, so roughly equivalent to getting data somewhere in the city you live in. Accessing a standard disk takes roughly 10^6 ticks, which is the equivalent to the data being on pluto. Where does solid state fit it? Current SSD technology is somewhere between 10^4-10^5 depending on who you ask. While they can be an order of magnitude faster, there is still a tremendous gap between reading from memory and reading from disk. This is why the answer to your question is likely no, since as fast as SSDs become they will still be significantly slower than disk (at least in the foreseeable future).
