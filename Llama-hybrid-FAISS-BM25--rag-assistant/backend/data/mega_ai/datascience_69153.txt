xgboost classifier predicted negative probabilities

I'm using XGBoost for a binary classification problem. There is no negative label, only 1 and 0. I tunned the hyperparameters using Bayesian optimization then tried to train the final model with the optimized hyperparameters. Mdl_XGB = xgb.train(OptimizedParams, dtrain) scores_train = Mdl_XGB.predict(dtrain) scores_test = Mdl_XGB.predict(dtest) My problem is that the predicted scores for both train and test sets include both negative values and numbers greater than one. The scores are between -0.23 and 1.13. Shouldn't these scores present the probability of belonging to class 1 (positive class)?
