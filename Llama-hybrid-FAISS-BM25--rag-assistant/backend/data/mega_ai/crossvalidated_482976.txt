The simplest way for me to think about the Brier score is to think of it as the equivalent of mean-square error for this type of task. It is a particular proper scoring rule , with the property: If a cost is levied in proportion to a proper scoring rule, the minimal expected cost corresponds to reporting the true set of probabilities. It thus favors good calibration of the probability model, rather than properties like accuracy that are based on an assumed value of a particular probability cutoff to make assignments of categories. In practice I suspect that log-loss is more frequently used as a proper scoring rule, because that's what underlies logistic regression. The Brier score is easily applied to evaluating any type of probability model, however, and you will find it frequently recommended here as a good way to discriminate among models. Today you would find 236 posts containing "Brier score" on this site, close to the 246 containing "log-loss" .
