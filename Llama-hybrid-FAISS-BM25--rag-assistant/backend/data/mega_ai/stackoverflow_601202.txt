I've only worked with NUnit and Microsoft's version of the same. In my opinion they are more similar than they are different. However, depending on you project setup there are a number of financial consideration which may be relevant. Microsoft's testing framework is not available in their less expensive/free SKUs, but once you have paid for the entire package (which is not inexpensive, I know) you do get unit test, a test runner and code coverage in a single package, which is very convenient. If you switch to NUnit you either have to give up VS integration or get a test runner such at TestDriven.NET or Resharper. When I looked at these they both required licenses for commercial use. I.e. the cost per developer is increased. Additionally these tools do not have code coverage, so you have to get something like NCover. Again, this carried a license for commercial usage, when I checked. Admittedly it has been a while since I looked into this so the licensing may have changed, but the extra cost per developer was part of the reason we opted to go with the Microsoft solution. It may be the case that VS Express plus the other tools are less expensive than VS Team Foundation, but since we had to go with VS TF anyway that did us little good. If you're doing open source / non commercial projects I believe you may be able to get free versions.
