I agree with Peter Parker that it is easy and preferable to reorganize the projects in CVS before the converting to Subversion, if what you want to do is reorganize folders and files within individual projects. But if you want to reorganize the layout of the projects themselves (i.e., where one project lives relative to another), you can do this easily as part of the cvs2svn conversion. When you do a multiproject conversion , you can specify where cvs2svn should place the trunk, branches, and tags directories for each of the projects. Simply place them according to your desired new project organization and then you should have no problem working with the repository using any of the usual tools.
