Using indirect prior information in Bayesian inference

Hi I am trying to estimate the posteriors of four calibration parameters namely $c_1, c_2, c_3$ and $c_4$ in the following equation using Bayesian inference $$ F=c_1 \cdot (i^{c_2}) \cdot(s^{c_3}) \cdot (1-\exp(c_4 t)) $$ I have the observed data for the output $F$ and inputs $i$,$s$ and $t$. I know the range of $c_4$ from my prior knowledge, so I will use a uniform prior with this range for $c_4$. I don't have any prior knowledge about parameters $c_1, c_2, c_3$ individually. All I know is that $0
