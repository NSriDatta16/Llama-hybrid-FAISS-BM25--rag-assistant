So your model is not very robust. You provide not too much infomration in your question. So it is hard to tell what is going on. Are classes highly unbalanced? It is possible, that your NN learns very "local" things and fails to get the bigger picture. First thing I would do is to establish a proper baseline model. No idea what kind of data you work with, but you could use something like Logit. Maybe NN are not adequate in your case at all because of too few learning samples. So maybe you could also look towards other methods such as Random Forest with Boosting (xgboost, lightgbm, catboost).
