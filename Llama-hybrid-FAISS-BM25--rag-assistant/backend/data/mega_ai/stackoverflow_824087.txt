You're talking about bookkeeping. Your best bet is probably to talk to accountant who organised books for a software company before. Alternatively you could read up on bookkeeping basics. This question is not strictly software development related, although software business has some traits that make it different, i.e. absence of raw materials. Best of luck with your question, I personally find it interesting, but I don't believe it belongs on stackoverflow.
