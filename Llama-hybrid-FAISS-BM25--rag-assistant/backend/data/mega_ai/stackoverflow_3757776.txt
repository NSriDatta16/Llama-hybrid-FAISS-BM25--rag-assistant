How would you setup a small MVC structure?

In a few weeks, I will guide some of our trainees through a customer project, where they have to build a small web application in php. My idea is to setup a small MVC structure for them to learn oop and mvc and to assure code quality. How would you do this? We have no special requirements, just php and mysql. Would you use a template system like twig or just use phtml files like magento does? Would you use some ORM like propel oder just pdo? Any suggestions welcome.
