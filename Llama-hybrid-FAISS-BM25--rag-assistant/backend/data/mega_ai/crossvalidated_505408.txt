Time series difference operator

I have a question regarding the difference operator of SARIMA models. I am attempting to write out $SARIMA(2,1,2)(2,1,1)_{24}$ . This seasonal ARIMA model has therefore 2 difference operators. I have tried to follow various different posts on here ... especially this one: How To Write Seasonal ARIMA model mathematically However, I am in doubt whether this is actually done correctly. Currently I have the following: $\nabla^1_{24}\nabla^1X_t$ = $\nabla^1_{24}(X_t-X_{t-1})$ = $X_t-X_{t-1}-X_{t-24}$ Perhaps there is an equation which explains it in more detail (step-wise)? Thank you in advance.
