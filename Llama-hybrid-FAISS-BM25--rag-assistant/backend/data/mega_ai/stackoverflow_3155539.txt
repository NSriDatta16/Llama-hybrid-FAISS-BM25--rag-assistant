family of binary hash functions

I am looking for a family of hash function F1,..Fn, where each Fi maps any key in [0,1]. My first implementation was Fi(k) = F(k,i) = hash(i,hash(k,0)),. Here hash is the hashlittle function provided here ( http://burtleburtle.net/bob/c/lookup3.c ). I haven't looked under the hood of what exactly hashlittle does. As sharp readers would have noticed, this will fails. My question is how to achieve this efficiently. My objective is to minimize, on average, the largest i for which Fi(k1) == Fi(k2) for any given k1,k2 pair. Of course it should be fast too..
