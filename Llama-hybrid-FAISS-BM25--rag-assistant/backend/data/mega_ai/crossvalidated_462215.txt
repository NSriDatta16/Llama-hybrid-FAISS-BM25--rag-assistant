A statistic representative of time series data

I am working on a project that requires me to analyse a couple of indices over a period of time, around 5 years. My scenario is as follows I have a feature (% of people who has access to water) country wise. There are 5 percentages for different years (2014-2019) e.g: A - 78%, 80%, 81%, 85%, 88% - increasing trend B - 78%, 85%, 80%, 81%, 88% - increasing, decreasing, increasing trend Now I need one figure that represents these 5 numbers, something like an average. I know average will not work here, case the average of both the instances A, B would be the same. I need a number that gives something like the mean, variance of the distribution and an indicator of the trend (+/-) Please let me know what I should be looking into, or if I have missed something here TIA =)
