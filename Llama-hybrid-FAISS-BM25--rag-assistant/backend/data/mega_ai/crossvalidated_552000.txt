I would turn the class starting and ending points $t_j$ into Gaussian kernels: $$x(t)=\frac 1 {\sqrt{2\pi}d}\sum_j e^{-\frac{(t-t_j)^2}{2d^2}}$$ Now you can either look at the correlations of number of students $n_t$ with $x_t$ , time series regression $$n_t=c+\beta x_t+\varepsilon_t$$ or time series analysis such as simple regression with AR(1) errors: $$n_t=c+\beta x_t+\varepsilon_t+\phi\varepsilon_{t-1}$$ then test significance of $\beta$ You pick an appropriate bandwidth $d$ , such as 5 minutes or even tune it as a hyperparameter or do a nonlinear regression with it. Possibilities are endless.
