Modernizr, html5shiv, ie7.js, and CSS3 Pie. Which to use and when?

I'm just starting to use HTML5 and CSS3 in my documents. I understand the need for JavaScript to bring Internet Explorer up to speed with these new tags and styles, but I don't know which to use and when! My plan was to use html5shiv and IE9.js to look after the HTML5 tags as well as the transparent pngs (and whatever other pesky errors they fix) but then Modernizr and CSS3 Pie were brought to my attention. My question is, if I use Modernizr, does it look after my need for html5shiv as well as IE9.js? Or should I include these as well? What is the overlap, if any? And what does CSS3 Pie do that Modernizr or the others doesn't? Or vice versa? I appreciate your guys help. Let me know what you do!?
