foreign key problem in mysql

hay i have two tables i want to relate them with a foreign key i made it locally and works fine using innoDB but when i upload it to my server database the type of table automatically change to myISAM. when i checked the type again i found that there is no innoDB engine type instead MyISAM, MEMORY, BLACKHOLE, EXAMPLE, ARCHIVE, CSV,FEDERATED, MRG_MYISAM were there. please help which storage engine out of these can support foreign key.
