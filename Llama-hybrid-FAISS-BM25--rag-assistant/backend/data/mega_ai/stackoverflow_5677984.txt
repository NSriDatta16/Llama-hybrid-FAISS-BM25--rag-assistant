Is there a MIME type for CAN data?

I have a system that processes messages from various sources and I put a MIME type on each incoming message which is used for dispatching further down the line. One type of messages coming in is data frames from a Controller Area Network (CAN). Now, this data usually isn't transmitted via HTTP or email etc., so Wikipedia or the standardizing organizations don't give a MIME type, at least not in an obvious place. Google couldn't help me, either. For now, I'm just going with some made-up "application/vnd.*" MIME type, as I already do with some internal protocols. This is kinda OK, but it's not really correct, and if anybody knows of an existing MIME type, I would prefer to use it.
