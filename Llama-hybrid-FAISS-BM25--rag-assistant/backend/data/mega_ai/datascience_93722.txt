X Second samples taken on unevenly spaced intervals

I have dataset of following specification: 512 samples taken at unevenly spaced intervals over the year Each sample is an 8 second data from sensors with 4ms resolution Samples are not labeled For example, I have 5 samples taken on first day, then more then 10 samples take on 5th day and so on. I want to cluster data to check if I can infer the mode of operation for the machine from single 8 second sample. Also, I want to measure the performance of the component over the year for predictive maintenance. Currently I want to use self organizing maps for clustering purposes. I am new to this data science and am currently learning. The usual methods use evenly spaced samples. Also each samples in these cases is single input (Like stock value at the end of a day) instead of X second data taken at time Y. My question is: How do I input such data into any model?
