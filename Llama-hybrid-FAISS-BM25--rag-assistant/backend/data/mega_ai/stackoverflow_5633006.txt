Magento - Which type of Price to apply a new discount to?

I'm writing a Magento extension that applies a new kind of discount to products based on an hourly schedule. I'd like the discount to apply to the final price after all other discounts (tier price, special price etc.) have been applied. Which property of a Product object holds this final price? is it getFinalPrice()? getCalculatedFinalPrice()? Something else? Note: I thought of "piggybacking" Catalog Price Rules for my purposes but I realized that won't work because these work on a daily schedule and I need to schedule hourly.
