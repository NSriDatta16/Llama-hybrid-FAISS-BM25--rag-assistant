What challenges can data science help with in small businesses

Data science can solve/help with many challenges. But it usually looked upon as something for multi-million dollar corporations. I'm looking for examples of challenges data science helped with in small/medium businesses. EDIT I am looking at this from a perspective of: "If I am a restaurant owner, yoga studio owner, dentist, etc., how can it help me?"
