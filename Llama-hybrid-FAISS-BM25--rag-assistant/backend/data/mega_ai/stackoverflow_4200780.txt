I would recommend KryoNet for doing any RMI-type stuff without the overhead of RMI and the inflexibility it brings. http://code.google.com/p/kryonet/ KryoNet makes the assumptions that it will only be used for client/server architectures and that KryoNet will be used on both sides of the network. Because KryoNet solves a specific problem, the KryoNet API can do so very elegantly. The Apache MINA project is similar to KryoNet. MINA's API is lower level and a great deal more complicated. Even the simplest client/server will require a lot more code to be written. MINA also is not integrated with a robust serialization framework and doesn't intrinsically support RMI. The Priobit project is a minimal layer over NIO. It provides TCP networking similar to KryoNet, but without the higher level features. Priobit requires all network communication to occur on a single thread. The Java Game Networking project is a higher level library similar to KryoNet. JGN does not have as simple of an API.
