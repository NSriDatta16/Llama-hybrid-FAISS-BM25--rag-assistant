Are the reported odds to win Lotto Max on https://playalberta.ca/games/lotto-max incorrect?

The Alberta Lottery displays the odds to win various Lotto Max prizes on their website here . Each $5 wager contains 3 sets of 7 numbers. The winning numbers are drawn from a pool of 50, so the probability of any given set of numbers to win should be able to be modeled using a hypergeometric distribution. Therefore, the odds of winning the Jackpot can be calculated in Google sheets using the following formula: =1/(HYPGEOMDIST(7,7,7,50)*3) = 33,294,800 This lines up with what they report. However, they display the odds of matching 6 out of 7 numbers to be 113,248. Using the following formula in Google sheets: =1/(HYPGEOMDIST(6,7,7,50)*3) = 110,614 110,614 <> 113,248, so my question is what are the correct odds for this lottery game? I'm not sure if I am making a statistical mistake or if they are...
