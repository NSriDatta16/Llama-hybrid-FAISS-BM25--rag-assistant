How to add SoapExtension attribute to generated web service client proxy without modifying the generated class?

I have created a SoapExtension class to capture the soap request and response from specific web service calls. In order to put this SoapExtension into effect, I have to add an attribute to the method in the generated proxy client. For example, I've added the AuditSoapCapture attribute to this method: [System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapDocumentMethodAttribute("http://blahblah.com/webservices/AddressSearch", RequestNamespace = "http://blahblah.com/webservices/", ResponseNamespace = "http://blahblah.com/webservices/", Use = System.Web.Services.Description.SoapBindingUse.Literal, ParameterStyle = System.Web.Services.Protocols.SoapParameterStyle.Wrapped)] [blahblah.TriadLite.Core.AuditSoapCapture] public System.Data.DataSet AddressSearch(string HouseNumber, string StreetName, string ZipCode) { object[] results = this.Invoke("AddressSearch", new object[] { HouseNumber, StreetName, ZipCode}); return ((System.Data.DataSet)(results[0])); } I am looking for a way to add this attribute to specific methods without modifying the generated client proxy, as they will get lost when we regenerate. Can I do this in a another partial class or interface or some other way? Thanks!
