Hi: Generally technicals include prices, volumes and anything else that's derived from stock exchange activity. But, If you have fundamental data ( say quarterly earnings ) you could still possibly use it in a technical analysis way, For example, using the moving average of the last 4 quarter earnings to act on a buy or sell decision would be considered technical analysis. So, I don't know if anyone does the latter but that would be fundamental data being used in technical analysis. In summary, technical analysis is more about the formulas-algorithms used. Each person ( they're called technicians ) using technical analysis might have proprietary data (technical such as prices or fundamental such as earnings ) going in to those formulae. But generally speaking, technical analysis data is skewed towards stock exchange type data like prices, volumes etc. Also, note this is a better question for quant.se.
