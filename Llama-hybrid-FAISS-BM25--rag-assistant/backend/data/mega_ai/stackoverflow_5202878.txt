Pointer to members from Bruce Eckel's Thinking in C++

The following is a paragraph from Bruce Eckel's Thinking in C++ (volume 1, 2nd edition, chapter 11) under the heading "Pointers to members": â€¦a pointer needs an address, but there is no "address" inside the class; selecting the member of class means offsetting into that class. You cannot produce an actual address untill you combine that offset with the starting address of particular object. The syntax of pointer to member require you select an object at the same time you're dereferencing the pointer to member. What does this quote mean? I am trying to do something like: &(objectname.member_variable) I get an actual address, something like 0x22f14 , but this offset means how far it is from the starting address?
