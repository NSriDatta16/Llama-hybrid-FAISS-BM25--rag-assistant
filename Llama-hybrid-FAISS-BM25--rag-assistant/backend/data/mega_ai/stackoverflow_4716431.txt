Concerning 1) "What is the max length for cookies values?" There is no enforced maximum, just a recommendation in RFC 2109 : User agents created for specific purposes or for limited-capacity devices should provide at least 20 cookies of 4096 bytes, to ensure that the user can interact with a session-based origin server. Keep in mind, that cookies will be transmitted each time the endpoints communicate. As for storing larger values on the client side, dojox.storage came into my mind (although this is javascript, it shows their approach to this general problem). They abstract away the various incompatible ways to store large sets of data within the client - e.g. by using one of the available AirDBStorageProvider, AirEncryptedLocalStorageProvider, AirFileStorageProvider, FlashStorageProvider, GearsStorageProvider, WhatWGStorageProvider. If you have control over the clients, you could go the HTML5 route with localstorage , which provides a maximum of 5MB of local client space. And one final idea: Compress or encode the stored data, or maybe split it up, so that the server can take over some of the actual values, while you only store keys in the client (which in turn would add more connection overhead to the whole thing, of course).
