It may be appropriate to include a nonlinear transformation of x , but probably not simply x × x , i.e x 2 . I believe you may find this a useful reference in determining which transformation to use: G. E. P. Box and Paul W. Tidwell (1962). Transformation of the Independent Variables. Technometrics Volume 4 Number 4, pages 531-550. http://www.jstor.org/stable/1266288 Some consider the Box-Tidwell family of transformations to be more general than is often appropriate for interpretability and parsimony. Patrick Royston and Doug Altman introduced the term fractional polynomials for Box-Tidwell transformations with simple rational powers in an influential 1994 paper: P. Royston and D. G. Altman (1994). Regression using fractional polynomials of continuous covariates: parsimonious parametric modeling. Applied Statistics Volume 43: pages 429–467. http://www.jstor.org/stable/2986270 Patrick Royston in particular has continued to work and publish both papers and software on this, culminating in a book with Willi Sauerbrei: P. Royston and W. Sauerbrei (2008). Multivariable Model-building: A Pragmatic Approach to Regression Analysis Based on Fractional Polynomials for Modelling Continuous Variables . Chichester, UK: Wiley.
