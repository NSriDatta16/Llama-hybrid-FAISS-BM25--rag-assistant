How to approach clustering of time-series with a single variable

Let me preface this by saying that I'm a complete beginner to R and data science in general, so my apologies if this is a rather trivial question. I do have a rough idea of what I would like to achieve though, and how the end result should look like. I just don't know which algorithm is best suited for dealing with this kind of data and how to go about implementing it. I would like to run a clustering algorithm on a data frame with 13369 distinct units, each having just a single variable that is tracked over 15 years. So my data looks something like this: id y1 y2 y3 y4 y5 y6 y7 y8 y9 y10 y11 y12 y13 y14 y15 01 0 6 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 02 1 4 1 6 4 3 7 6 3 8 11 10 9 10 10 03 0 0 2 0 5 0 1 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 ... ... ... 13369 4 9 0 12 5 1 1 0 6 1 2 7 0 0 3 To establish some context for this task, this is the data for authors and the number of publications they have published in each year, spanning over 15 years. I would like to end up with a dendrogram that depicts various clusters that authors fall into, (I'm guessing) depending on how prolific they were in a certain time period (beginning vs. later years, for example). I hope I explained everything clearly. Thank you for taking your time and assisting a student in need.
