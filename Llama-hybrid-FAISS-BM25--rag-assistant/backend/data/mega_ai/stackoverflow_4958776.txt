Batch running of VS code coverage tools

I came up a batch file to generate code coverage file as is written in this post . cl /Zi hello.cpp -link /Profile vsinstr -coverage hello.exe start vsperfmon /coverage /output:run.coverage hello vsperfcmd /shutdown However, I got this error message when I run the batch file. I had to run vsperfcmd /shutdown manually to finish it. What might be wrong?
