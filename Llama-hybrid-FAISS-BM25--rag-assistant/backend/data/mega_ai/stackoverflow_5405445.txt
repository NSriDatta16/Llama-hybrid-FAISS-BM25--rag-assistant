Multiple Drop-Down Menus Based on Selected Value of First Drop-Down

I have been searching for similar questions but they are a little different to what I am looking for. Basically, this is what I am aiming to implement: Have a first drop-down list filled with values, e.g. : agent extension fileversion pages Then, in a second drop-down list, show options dependant on what was selected, for example, if agent is selected, the operators would be = or != since it is text. For fileversion there would be 4 operands, = , != , > and . Lastly, there would be a third drop-down with values also dependant on the initially selected option. For example, when agent is selected, the options would be pdf , word , excel , ppt etc. and others it would just be a text box to type in rather than exhaust all possible values. In the end this will be used to search a database but it is a big db and the searches are too slow so I'm thinking the values for the options will be stored in an array rather than pulled directly. As you can see, it's fairly tricky :/ any help at all is much appreciated. Thanks, Martin EDIT: Found the answer for those who happen to be looking for the same answer: tags agent extension operands dropdown.js: $(document).ready(function() { $tags = $("select[name='tags']"); $operands = $("select[name='operands']"); $tags.change(function() { if ($(this).val() == "agent") { $("select[name='operands'] option").remove(); $(" = ").appendTo($operands); $(" != ").appendTo($operands); } if ($(this).val() == "extension") { $("select[name='operands'] option").remove(); $(" .pdf ").appendTo($operands); $(" .doc ").appendTo($operands); } if ($(this).val() == "tags") { $("select[name='operands'] option").remove(); $(" operands ").appendTo($operands); } }); });
