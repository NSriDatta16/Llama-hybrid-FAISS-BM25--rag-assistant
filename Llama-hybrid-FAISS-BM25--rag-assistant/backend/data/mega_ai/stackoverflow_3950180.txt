As long as a language is Turing complete , any algorithm can be implemented in it (by definition of "algorithm"). But as others have said, functional languages can do certain things more elegantly. (Just take a look at Haskell. What a lovely language.) I'd also argue that there is a class of problems that OOP languages do better. (In my opinion, GUIs, although some may disagree.)
