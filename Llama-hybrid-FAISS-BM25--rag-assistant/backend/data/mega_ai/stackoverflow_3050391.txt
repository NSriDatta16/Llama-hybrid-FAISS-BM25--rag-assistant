An interesting note is that Objective-C began its life as a sort of preprocessor to C. From /usr/include/objc/objc.h : typedef struct objc_class *Class; typedef struct objc_object { Class isa; } *id; Each Objective-C object can be described as a struct with a pointer to its class, its ivars, and function pointers for its methods. Message sending, etc. complicate things but when it comes down to it, everything could be done in C if you were patient enough.
