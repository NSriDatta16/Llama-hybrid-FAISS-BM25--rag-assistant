This isn't an answer to your question directly (I strongly doubt there is one), but if you organised your data using a data table, making data go downwards rather than horizontally like a simple OLAP cube, you could probably add a criteria column that checks if the data points are between your two thresholds, and then organise your view in a pivot table. Combining lists and tables like this is really powerful if you don't like VBA, but VBA really is the solution for this sort of stuff unfortunately.
