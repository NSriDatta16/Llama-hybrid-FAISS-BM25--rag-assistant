I was challenged by a client to solve this problem in an automatic i.e. turnkey way. I implemented an approach that for each pair ( i.e. y and a candidate x ) , prewhiten , compute cross-correlations of the pre-whitened series, identify the PDL ( OR ADL AUTOREGRESSIVE DISTRIBUTED LAG MODEL including any DEAD TIME ) while incorporating Intervention Detection to yield robust estimates, develop a "measure" for this structure. After conducting this for ALL candidate regressors, rank them by the "measure" and then select the top K regressors based upon the "measure". This is sometimes referred to as Linear Filtering. We successfully incorporated this heuristic into our commercially available time series package. You should be able to "ROLL YOUR OWN" if you have sufficient time and statistical programming skills and/or available modules to implement some of these tasks.
