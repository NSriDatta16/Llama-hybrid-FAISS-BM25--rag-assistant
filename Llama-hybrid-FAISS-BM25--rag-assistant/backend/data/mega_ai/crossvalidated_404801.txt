Can the first difference of a time series follow a random walk?

I have a time series in levels, say $X_t$ and a variance-ratio test suggests that it does not follow a random walk. Now I differenced the time series once and the variance-ratio test suggests that the first difference follows a random walk. Can I just do that and calculate the expected value of $X_{t+1}$ as below? \begin{align} \Delta X_t \approx \Delta X_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t &\iff X_t \approx 2 X_{t-1}-X_{t-2}+\varepsilon_t \\[8pt] &\ \implies E[X_{t+1}| t] = X_t + \Delta X_{t-1} \end{align}
