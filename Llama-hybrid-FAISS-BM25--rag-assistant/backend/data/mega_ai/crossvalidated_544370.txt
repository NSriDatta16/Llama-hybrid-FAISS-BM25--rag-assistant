This is an example of a poorly worded question. If one were to interpret it strictly as written, one has a sample size of $n=500$ and a population size of $N=500$ , so yes, the population mean is certain to be \$750 (and so the probability that this mean is greater than \$755 is known to be zero). If you were to give this answer to the question, that would be correct in my view. Nevertheless, in view of the answer given, it appears that the writer of the question intended to treat the sample of $n=500$ customers as a random sample of a "large" population ( $N=\infty$ ) and the resulting calculations are consistent with that. For these types of questions, it is worth noting that the confidence interval formula for a population mean can be written in a way that allows a finite or infinite population $n \leqslant N \leqslant \infty$ . The general formula for the confidence interval for the population mean (see e.g., O'Neill 2014 , pp. 285-286) is: $$\text{CI}_N(1-\alpha) = \Bigg[ \bar{x}_n \pm \frac{t_{\alpha/2,DF_n}}{n} \cdot \sqrt{\frac{N-n}{N}} \cdot s_n \Bigg],$$ where $DF_n = n-1$ for a mesokurtic distribution (e.g., the normal distribution). You can easily confirm that this interval reduces to a single point given by the sample mean in the special case where $n=N$ and reduces to the standard form used for a "large" population when $N=\infty$ . How to re-word the question: In your bounty request you have asked how the question could be better worded to properly express the query reflected in the posted answer. To re-word the query, it would be important to be clear that $n=500$ and $N=\infty$ in this problem. (For the latter we usually just refer to the population as "large" --- see this related answer for an explanation.) It is also desirable to specify that the observed customers are a random sample of the population. Something like this would be an appropriate wording: Question: A micro-loan bank has a large number of loan customers. Analysts at the bank take a random sample of 500 of their loan customers and examine the total annual loan repayments made by each of the sampled customers --- they find a mean of \$750 and a standard deviation of \$900 from these values. Use this data to approximate the probability that the average total annual repayments made across all customers at the bank is greater than \$755.
