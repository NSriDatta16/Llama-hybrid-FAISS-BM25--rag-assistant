accessing LSTM Weights tensors in tensorflow

I'm trying the code from : https://github.com/aymericdamien/TensorFlow-Examples/blob/master/notebooks/3_NeuralNetworks/recurrent_network.ipynb and also looking at the architecture of the Basic LSTM Cell as described in: https://r2rt.com/written-memories-understanding-deriving-and-extending-the-lstm.html so I wish to access to the weights for Wi Wo Wf and Wo (as noted under section "The basic LSTM") I'm running this for v in tf.get_collection(tf.GraphKeys.TRAINABLE_VARIABLES): print(v) and I get Tensor("Variable/read:0", shape=(128, 10), dtype=float32) Tensor("Variable_1/read:0", shape=(10,), dtype=float32) Tensor("rnn/basic_lstm_cell/weights/read:0", shape=(156, 512), dtype=float32) Tensor("rnn/basic_lstm_cell/biases/read:0", shape=(512,), dtype=float32) So I seem to be doing something wrong since I can't get my hands on the Four W matrices... Any help understanding what I missed please ?
