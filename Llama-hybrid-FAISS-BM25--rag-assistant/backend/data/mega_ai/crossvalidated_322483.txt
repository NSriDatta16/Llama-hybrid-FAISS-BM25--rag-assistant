Dempster Shafer Evidence Theroy

I am trying to combine the predicted class labels of 3 different classifiers (for example SVM, Naive Bayes etc ) so that it will eliminate the weakness of each individual classifier. I am trying to use dempster Shafer evidence theory in order to fuse this predicted class labels in Matlab. Unfortunately, I could not find a single implementation of DSET in Matlab. So, can anyone please tell me how to use DSET to fuse class labels of different classifiers in Matlab?
