Can there be a situation where one regression model gives lower RMSE than the other but also lower R-squared?

Consider the following scenario where you use the same data X (the same number of predictors p , same number of observations n ) to predict a continuous outcome y , in 2 different regression models (e.g. Linear Regression and Random Forests). For both models you calculate RMSE and R-squared (assume simple correlation between y and y-hat, squared). You get: RMSE1 Could someone explain if this scenario is possible and how it occurs? A simple simulation in R could also do.
