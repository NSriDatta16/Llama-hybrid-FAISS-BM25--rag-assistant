I wanted to give Adam credit for the answer, but I also wanted to share the code I used to make this work: List OrgIds= (from oh in this.Database.OrganizationsHierarchies join o in this.Database.Organizations on oh.OrganizationsId equals o.Id where (oh.Hierarchy.Contains(@OrgId)) || (oh.OrganizationsId == Id) select o.Id).ToList(); List query = (from p in this.Database.Personnels where (OrgIds.Contains(p.OrganizationId)) select p).ToList(); Thanks all, -Matt
