Feature correlation and their effect of Logistic Regression

I was reading this nice post by Jason Brownlee. In the post there is a paragraph: This is useful to know, because some machine learning algorithms like linear and logistic regression can have poor performance if there are highly correlated input variables in your data. It is not clear to me why this is true. Assuming that we have enough instances to train on, then this should not be a learning problem. Any technical explanation is appreciated.
