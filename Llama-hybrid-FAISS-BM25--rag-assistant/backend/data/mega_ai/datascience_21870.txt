What can be done to increase the accuracy of a biological dataset?

I have a biological unbalanced dataset on which I have applied deep learning, Support Vector Machine (all the kernel functions) and Artificial Neural network for multiclass classification (size: 139 samples , 5 attributes) in python. Unfortunately the accuracy is not exceeding 55%. What can be done to increase the accuracy? If a dataset cannot ever go beyond such an average accuracy, what is the solution?
