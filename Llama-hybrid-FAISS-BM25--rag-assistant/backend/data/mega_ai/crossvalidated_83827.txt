Do you think that there is a single "true fixed parameter" for something like the contribution of milk drinking to a child's growth? Or for the decrease in a tumor's size based on the amount of chemical X you inject into a patient's body? Pick any model you're familiar with and ask yourself if you actually believe that there is one true, universal, precise and fixed value for each parameter, even in theory. Ignore measurement error, just look at your model as if all measurements were perfectly accurate and infinitely precise. Given your model, do you think that each parameter realistically has a specific point value? The fact that you have a model indicates that you are leaving some details out. Your model will have an amount of imprecision because you're averaging over the parameters/variables that you've left out in order to make a model -- a simplified representation of reality. (Just as you don't make a 1:1 map of the planet, complete with all details, but rather a 1:10000000 map, or some such simplification. The map is a model.) Given that you're averaging across the left-out variables, the parameters for the variables you include in your model will be distributions, not point values. That's only part of the Bayesian philosophy -- I'm ignoring theoretical uncertainty, measurement uncertainty, priors, etc -- but it seems to me that the idea that your parameters have distributions makes intuitive sense, in the same way that descriptive statistics have a distribution.
