Should I use static data members? (C++)

Let's consider a C++ class. At the beginning of the execution I want to read a set of values from an XML file and assign them to 7 of the data members of this class. Those values do not change during the whole execution and they have to be shared by all the objects / instances of the class in question. Are static data members the most elegant way to achieve this behavior? (Of course, I do not consider global variables)
