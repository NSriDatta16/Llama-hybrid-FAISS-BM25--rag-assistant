C penalty in SVM - larger C increases the margin or reduces the margin?

I get contradictory information on what the penalty value C does in SVM. page 346,347 of the following book says, larger C means larger misclassification is allowed and margin will be larger. http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf same says the below link (in regularization section) https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/svm-classification-scikit-learn-python However, every other source I read says C in svm class of python stands for penalty and larger C means higher penalty and thereby lower margin. (But going by the above book and the optimization equations, C is the allowance for misclassification and this seems correct - based on the formula). Can someone please explain why the above two links are contradicting other sources
