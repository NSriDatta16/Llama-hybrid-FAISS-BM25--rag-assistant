This is probably too simple but at a guess I would use fixed font for the cell like "Courier New" so that all the characters are the same width and would align up. The downside of this is that "Courier New" is not the most elegant font to use. I am sure Excel uses a much more sophisticated mechanism for aligning numeric values. Maybe you should use something that better mimics a spreadsheet than a table in a flowdocument.
