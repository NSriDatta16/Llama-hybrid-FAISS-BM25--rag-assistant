The idea of a facade is that it hides complexity behind a simplifying interface . The fact that in scenario A you're explicitly exposing PublishingManager & RetrievalManager doesn't appear to fit that definition (difficult to be definitive without knowing more about your code). To your second question. I'm assuming the two services are complementary and used to enable connection between publishers and retrievers. If that's true, then a couple of thoughts: I'd be comfortable putting both in the same service as the fundamental purpose is to create connections between publishers & retrievers Assuming I understand right, this looks like the publish/subscribe pattern. Might be worth having a look at that. Also consider using "Subscribe" instead of "Retrieve" as it should be more familiar.
