Yes it's possible to create your own language. Take a look at compiler compilers. Or the source code to some scripting languages if you dare. Some useful tools are yacc and bison and lexx. Others have mentioned the dragon book. We used a book that I think was called "compiler theory and practice" back in my university days. It's not necessary to learn assembler to write a language. For example, Javascript runs in something called an interpreter which is an application that executes javascript files. In thise case, the interpreter is usually built into the browser. The easiest starting program language might be to write a simple text based calculator. i.e. taking a text file, run through it and perform the calculations. You could write that in C++ very easily. My first language for a college project was a language defined in BNF given to us. We then had to write a parser which parsed it into a tree structure in memory and then into something called 3 address code (which is assembler like). You could quite easily turn 3 address code into either real assembler or write an interpreter for that.
