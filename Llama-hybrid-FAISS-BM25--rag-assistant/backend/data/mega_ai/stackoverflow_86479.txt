ASP.net ACTK DragPanel Extender on PopupControlExtender with UpdatePanel does not drag after partial postback

I have a panel on an aspx page which contains an UpdatePanel. This panel is wrapped with both a PopUpControl Extender as well as a DragPanel Extender. Upon initial show everything works fine, the panel pops up and closes as expected and can be dragged around as well. There is a linkbutton within the UpdatePanel which triggers a partial postback. I originally wanted to use an imagebutton but had a lot of trouble with that so ended up using the linkbutton which works. Once the partial postback is complete I can no longer drag the panel around. I would love to hear suggestions on how to fix this. Has anyone else encountered this problem? What did you do about it? Do you know of any other way to accomplish this combination of features without employing other third party libraries?
