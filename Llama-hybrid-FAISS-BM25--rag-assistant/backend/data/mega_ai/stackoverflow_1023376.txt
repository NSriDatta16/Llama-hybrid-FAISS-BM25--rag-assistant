Why can't I drag execution point in IntelliJ (I can in Visual Studio)

In Visual Studio, when debugging, one can drag the execution point (current instruction pointer, yellow dot) to another place in the current method. This is impossible in IntelliJ, and some have stated it's generally impossible in Java. Why?
