Your sound card is almost certainly AC coupled. So you shouldn't get a DC offset. interesting dissection of sound card inputs here Running a moving average to calculate software automatic gain control is probably a good idea. your zero crossings will probably be near zero. You can also blur the data at 4khz (2*2k)[aka low pass filter at 4khz] and then edge detect it to get the zero crossings. When I have signal processing issues like this, I graph the captured data in a custom application, then try things semi-interactively in code. As a suggestion, try capturing some and see how you go feeding stored data to your parsing routines. Try different things and see what works
