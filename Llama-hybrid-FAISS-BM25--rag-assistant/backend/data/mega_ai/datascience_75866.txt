The performance of the machine learning models significantly depends on the type of data that you are using. Also, it is required to use a statistical test to compare the performance of two models given the data used for training and testing. I want to say that it might be misleading to say that one machine learning model performs better than the other. In some cases, random forest model might perform well but not for all cases. That is also true about the neural networks. In case that the data is not complicated, random forest and tree-based models might outperform neural networks. However, this is not always the case especially when the data size is very large, neural networks are very useful because we can use very deep neural networks without any concerns regarding overfitting.
