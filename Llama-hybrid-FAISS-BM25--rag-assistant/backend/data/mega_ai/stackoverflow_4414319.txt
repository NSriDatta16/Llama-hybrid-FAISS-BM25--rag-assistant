Unfortunately I cannot read from the server console. If you have shell access to the remote server, the solution is simple: Change the logging configs so that your webapp logs to a file instead of / as well as the console. Login and read the file. (Indeed, if you were using Tomcat, stuff written to System.out / System.err is written to a file anyway. Maybe this is true for Glassfish also.) If you don't have shell access, you may have to modify your webapp to provide an extra page that can be used to download or view the log file from your web browser. If you have to resort to this, pay attention to the obvious security concerns.
