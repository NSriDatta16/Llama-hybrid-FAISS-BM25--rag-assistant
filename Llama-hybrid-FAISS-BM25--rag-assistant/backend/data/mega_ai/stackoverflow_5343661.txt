Add unit vectors of each angle, and convert the resulting vector back into an angle. If the result vector is of zero length, the inputs cancelled each other out and the result is indeterminate. A unit vector has a length of 1, and its x and y lengths are given by the cosine and sine of the angle. Thus you average your examples as in the following pseudo-code: x = cos(radians(1)) + cos(radians(359)) + cos(radians(2)) + cos(radians(358)); y = sin(radians(1)) + sin(radians(359)) + sin(radians(2)) + sin(radians(358)); angle = degrees(atan2(y, x));
