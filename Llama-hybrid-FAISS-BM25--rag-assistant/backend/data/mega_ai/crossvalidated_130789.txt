Is approximating used car prices with deep learning over-engineering?

I am supposed to build an application that uses deep learning to approximate prices of used cars. My concern is that deep learning is too general of a tool for the problem at hand. I am going to use data from sites that sell used cars for training the network. However, looking at the characteristics of each car (age, mileage, previous owners, original price), I fail to see any non-linearity. Here's a few examples: the older the car, the lower the price; fewer miles, higher price; fewer previous owners, higher price. It would seem to me that a polynomial is enough to model this, as all there is to train is the relative weight of each of the car's characteristics. I don't see any non-linearity that would require anything more sophisticated. Is there something that I am missing? Background information: This application is part of my thesis (as an undergraduate). I picked this topic out of a predefined list because I have an interest in machine learning, but the subject (used car prices) seems like a poor choice.
