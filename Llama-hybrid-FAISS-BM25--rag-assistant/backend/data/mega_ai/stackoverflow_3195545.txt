When you are finished Clean Code I would recommend you read Bob Martin's other book: Agile Principles Patterns and Practices In C# In this book the vast ammount of the book discusses a case study and in it, Bob applies the principles discussed in Clean Code. I read Clean Code first but in retrospect I think "Agile Patterns.." should be read first as Clean Code is more of a day to day handbook or manual of good SW principles. For example, in "Agile patterns..." the following code is used: public class OrderData { public string customerId; public int orderId; public OrderData() {} ... } The following validation of the use of Public data deals with your question: Don't be offended by the use of public data members. This is not an object in the true sense. It is simply a container for data. It has no interesting behavior that needs to be encapsulated. Making the data variables private, and providing getters and setters would be a waste of time. I could have used a struct instead of a class, but I want the OrderData to be passed by reference rather than by value. Aside: Personally, I have to say that Robert Martin has made a massive contribution to the SW developer community (along with Martin Fowler, Michael Feathers..) with these books. I think they are must read.
