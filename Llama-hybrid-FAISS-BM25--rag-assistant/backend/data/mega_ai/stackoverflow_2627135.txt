How do I sanitize LaTeX input?

I'd like to take user input (sometimes this will be large paragraphs) and generate a LaTeX document. I'm considering a couple of simple regular expressions that replaces all instances of \ with \textbackslash and all instances of { or } with \} or \{ . I doubt that this is sufficient. What else do I need to do? Note: In case there is a special library made for this, I'm using python. To clarify, I do not wish anything to be parsed treated as LaTeX syntax: $a$ should be replaced with \$a\$ .
