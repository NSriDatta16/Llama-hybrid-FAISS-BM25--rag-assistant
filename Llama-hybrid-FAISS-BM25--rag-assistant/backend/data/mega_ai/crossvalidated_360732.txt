Independent & non independent effect sizes/correlations for meta analysis

I am conducting a meta analysis of pearsons r correlations and would like to double check my understanding of independent and non- independent effect sizes/correlations. Am I correct in understanding that all effect sizes/correlations for meta analysis should be independent , as in a single effect size for each article/study , which means that any article presenting more than one effect/correlation related to the same construct being measured should ALWAYS be averaged into one effect size/correlation via converting the r correlations into fishers z scores for averaging and analysis? Thanks
