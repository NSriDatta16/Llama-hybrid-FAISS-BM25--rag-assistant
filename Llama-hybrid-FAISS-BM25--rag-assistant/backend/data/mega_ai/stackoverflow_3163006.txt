I generally follow this format for forcing files at users: It's given me the best results in all browsers (forgive the VB instead of C#): Response.Clear() Response.ClearHeaders() Response.Buffer = True Response.ContentType = "your mime type" Response.CacheControl = "public" Response.AddHeader("Pragma", "public") Response.AddHeader("Expires", "0") Response.AddHeader("Cache-Control", "must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0") Response.AddHeader("Content-Description", "Description of your content") Response.AddHeader("Content-Disposition", "attachment; filename=""somefile.pdf""") Response.BinaryWrite(buffer) Response.Flush() Response.End() Just fill in the blanks. I think you might just have a little too much going on. UPDATE: I'm sure you've probably already seen these sites, but I'll put them here for others to stumble-upon: Downloading Docx from IE - Setting MIME Types in IIS http://blogs.msdn.com/b/vsofficedeveloper/archive/2008/05/08/office-2007-open-xml-mime-types.aspx I'm not sure exactly where your method is failing. If I had more time I would try it out myself; maybe later tonight. Good luck for now!
