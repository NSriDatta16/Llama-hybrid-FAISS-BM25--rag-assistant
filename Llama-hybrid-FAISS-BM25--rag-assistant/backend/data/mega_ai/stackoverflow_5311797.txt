C++::How to put different length arrays of const strings into common class

Sorry, new to C++, converting from C, and have struggled to find a good way to do this... //Fragment follows const char *List1[]={"Choice1", "Not a good choice", "choice3"}; //rom-able const char *List2[]={"Hello", "Experts", "Can", "You", "Help?"}; class ListIF{ private: int index; char *list; public: void GetValString(char *tgt,int len);//get parameter value as string max len chars void SetIndex(int n){index = n;}; int GetIndex(void){return index;}; }; //end Fragment The problem is how to write the constructor so that I can "encapsulate" the lists inside the class, without getting heap bloat (embedded target). And then how to write the gettor so that we can see list[index] within the class. I am going daft trying to do something that seems obvious, so I am missing something?
