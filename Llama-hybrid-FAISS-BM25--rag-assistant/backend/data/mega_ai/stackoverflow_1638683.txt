Creating a new answer based on your edit... Just to avoid confusion :) If you are looking for a non-code way to solve the problem, you could try this. It's (yet again) an alternative to the strings approach defined by Puppe. Maybe you could just touch a file called version_1.2.3 and add it to the archive. Then, you could determine the version by looking for the version file using the ar command: ar t libmylib.a | grep 'version_' | sed -e 's/^version_//' I'm not sure if that will get you what you need, but there is no standard method for embedding metadata like this in an archive. Maybe you'll find other information you want to store in this "metafile" for the archive.
