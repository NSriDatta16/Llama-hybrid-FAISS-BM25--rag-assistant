WPF: Restyling a window?

does anyone know if its possible to restyle a window in wpf. Or even better any tutorials or samples? Basically i would like to change the minimize and maximize buttons - oh and the close button to be slightly bigger.... I have expression blend.... Is this possible? I saw some samples in infragistics sample apps which have some great looking forms and as far as i can tell it doesn't use any custom wpf controls... Any ideas really appreciated
