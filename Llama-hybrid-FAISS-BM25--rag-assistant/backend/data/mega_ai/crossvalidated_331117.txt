What happens if the test set is too small in machine learning?

I'm reading an article in machine learning and healthcare. This author has a total of 1500 patients, but used only 36 patients for test. He did use 5-fold cross validation for classification using KNN and SVM. I think the test set is too low. Or is it okay to have such low test set - only 2.5%?
