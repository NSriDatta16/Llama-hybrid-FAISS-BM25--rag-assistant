I used to leave a home PC on with VS and use services like GoToMyPc or LogMeIn or some similar service. Since I have started using a laptop, I just carry the thing with me with VPN connectivity on business trips along with a 3G data card. But seriously, if on vacation, I do not want to take my laptop with me. security First and foremost, encrypt the contents of the HDD - be safe. If I am on a business trip, the laptop is with me so I am not as concerned with where it is. If I am on vacation, I do not know that I want to take one with me. If is important then I would keep my laptop/pc at work ON and there will be someone that has access to turn it on/reboot it. So I would carry a light laptop that lets me connect and work if I need it. If that goes down, I can always head into a cybercafe. database If you are anticipating working, bring your dev database with you. I know it hogs space and memory (while in use), but it pulling data over the wire has taken long enough to make me lose concentration. standalone Make the laptop standalone so that it can work without a connection to VPN or internet - coverage is not the best / uniform in all areas.
