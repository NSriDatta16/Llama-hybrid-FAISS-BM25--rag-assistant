Prediction for differenced Time Series model

I am working on a Time Series model, and the series appeared to be non stationary (presence of trend & seasonality), as I was using ARIMA to predict for my time Series , I performed first order differencing. My question is now if I am predicting future values, are the predictions going to be differenced? Do I need to undo the differencing in any manner before forecasting? On a side note, can I use an ARIMA (p,d,q) (P,D,Q) model instead of differencing to account for seasonality ?
