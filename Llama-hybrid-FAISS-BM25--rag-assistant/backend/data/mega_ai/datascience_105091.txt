Regarding your first point, you can correlate your features to your target the way you have done (to my knowledge. I'm not 100% sure). This is because you are only converting the categorical classes into numerical so in the end you might get results like feature 1 has a correlation with class 1 of about 0.4 and so on. Then you can reverse your LabelEncoder encoding to get back the categorical classes i.e class 1 is species A and class 2 is species B. I think it should be correct but someone please correct me if I am wrong. Regarding point 2, what you describe is known as feature engineering, where you combine multiple features into a single feature based on domain knowledge . If you do not have domain expertise then I would suggest to stay away from combining features. The example you gave does not make sense to me as gender is a categorical feature and weight is a numerical feature. So how can you combine both of them? It will probably lead to incorrect/bad results.
