You may find the discussion of the test in D'Agostino & Stephens' Goodness of Fit Techniques of some use. It is a ratio of two different estimates of variance under normality, the denominator the usual variance estimate and the numerator one based on the square of a linear function of the order statistics. Apart from a scaling factor in the numerator and denominator, you can see that at the Wikipedia page for the test It's also closely related to a linear function of the squared correlation between the order statistics (the values sorted into order) and the expected normal order statistics (i.e. it's closely related to the Shapiro-Francia and Ryan-Joiner tests) -- e.g. see the first page here https://www1.fpl.fs.fed.us/spl1991.pdf , the paragraph starting "Filliben", but uses information in the covariance of the order statistics to get a (usually) somewhat more powerful test for small samples. There's also a large number of questions on site about the Shapiro-Wilk test (I've answered more than 50, so there'll be considerably more than that) at least some of which address the things you are after, so I'd also recommend trying a site-search.
