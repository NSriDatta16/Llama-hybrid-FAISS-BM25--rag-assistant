Your question is a bit vague, but I'm assuming you are talking about the jQuery UI Dialog box . If that is the case, you only need to set the "draggable" option (found in the options within the documentation). An example is like this: $('div#dialog-example').dialog({ modal: true, draggable: true }); Something is confusing is that, by default, draggable is set to true, so you must be unsetting it. (Assuming I understand your question...it's a bit of a confusing question.)
