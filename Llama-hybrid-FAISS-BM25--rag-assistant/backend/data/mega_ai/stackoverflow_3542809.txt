Blinking document.title and IE7 (no way ?)

i develop a website and i need let the document title blinking when the browser lost the focus to get the attention from the user. This is a common task for example in some social network. Btw my javascript code work fine in Chrome, Firefox, Opera, but not in IE7 (that i am testing before release the site) IE7 have a strange behavior because if i print the document.title in a debug text (you can see in the code), it's changed but the browser still show the previous document title I try to search a lot on internet to try to fix this problem but with no luck so i decided to post the question in this site. Here my javascript code below and thanks in advance for the suggestions. the JS method is called by this.blink(true) // other methods above and below .... this.blink = function(Action) { if (Action) { if (!this.blinking) this.oldTitle=top.document.title; else clearInterval(this.blinkTimer); // debug current title $('debugText').value = 'ORIGINAL ' + top.document.title + '\n' + $('debugHistory').value; this.blinkTimer = setInterval(function() { var msg='MSG', newTitle if (top.document.title == msg) newTitle = '----'; else newTitle = msg; // assign title top.document.title = newTitle; // debug blinking, is really changed but not shown
