Django-extjs Url Data

Newbie question here. I am trying to use the django-extjs library in my django app from (https://github.com/softmechanics/django-extjs). I need an array grid and extjs seems to offer the cleanest interface. I was able to get a basic array-grid operational based on static data. But I am having difficulty integrating the grid into my own model. I am getting a 404 error. [22/Nov/2010 22:22:09] "GET /appname/example_model?_dc=1290489729717 HTTP/1.1" 404 3519 I am confused by the url information set ("?_dc=1290489729717"). I don't understand what this data means or where the django-extjs package is adding it. Is there a way I can (or should) elegantly use this data in my django app? The documentation isn't clear why or how this data is there. 1. What is the "?_dc=1290489729717" represent? 2. Where is django-extjs package adding it to my url? 3. Are there any good example implementations beyond the package? Thanks! Joe
