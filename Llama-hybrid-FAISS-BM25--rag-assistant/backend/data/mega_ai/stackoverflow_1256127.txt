jQuery - ASP.NET MVC - .load and RenderPartial

For some specific reasons, I need to use the jQuery 'load()' method in order to feed a webpage into a div layer. Most of these webpages are plain .html files. However for some, there is some data processing going on - I would like to be able to leverage the ASP.NET MVC model (which the site is built in) - but that's not possible with plain .html pages - so I need to use .aspx/.ascx. I'm wondering if this is doable, does anyone know if I can load a layer that is retrieved from an .ascx ViewPage in ASP.NET MVC?
