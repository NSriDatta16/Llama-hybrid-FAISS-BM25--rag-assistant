There is no 100% reliable browser detection. Accessing the userAgent-string provided by the navigator-object is not reliable while it can be faked by the user. Accessing some properties that only exist in a special browser now, may be reliable right now, but not in the future, because you never know, if another browser will apply this property sometimes or the property will be removed from the browser in future versions.
