A solution would be to implement a packet filter driver, but it's quite complicated (kernel-mode code is difficult to write and to debug, and you can easily crash the whole system if you do something wrong); on the other hand you could easily use a third-party driver (e.g. WinPCap) to do the dirty job and use the data retrieved from it to do your computations/logging/... Another solution could be writing a simple proxy that the browser would use to connect to internet; your application would just be a pass-through that logs the requests and do its statistic with them. You could also use an existing proxy (e.g. Squid) and work on the data provided by its logging capabilities.
