Simple Logistic Regression Questions

Problem I want to estimate the probability of a user choosing a car or transit as a transport mode. Following is the output of the simple logistic regression: I want to estimate the probability of choosing car (auto) if INVT for auto = 3, INVT for transit = 7, OVT for auto = 1, OVT for transit = 2.5, OPC for auto =2 and transit fare = 3. What I tried For the probability of choosing car when the user owns a car and work in suburbs, I am using INVT for auto, OVT for auto, OPC for auto and transit fare along with AO as 1 and DW as 0. The probability = Pr = exp(1.45 - (0.00897*3) -(0.0308*1) - (0.0115*2) -(0.00708*3) +(0.77 * 1) - (0.561*0))/(1+exp(1.45 - (0.00897*3) -(0.0308*1) - (0.0115*2) -(0.00708*3) +(0.77 * 1) - (0.561*0))) Pr = 0.893 Question Is this the right approach to find this probability? Or should I also include the INVT, OVT and OPC for transit as well?
