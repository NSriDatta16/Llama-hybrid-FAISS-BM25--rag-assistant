I am unable to add a comment so I’ll just write my take; you have sequential data and are trying to infer the remaining sequence given a preceding part of the sequence. This problem can be modeled by a Bayesian Network; check out pomegranate if you are using python, I believe it’s one of the few packages that lets you build easy probability models. For example if you have a sequential data like [[A,B,C,D],[A,B,D,F], etc]](in your case shaped 50000 sequences of length 2000) a Bayesian Network can infer missing values like so [[A,B,None, None]]. The network will infer the missing values. I hope this is what you were looking for.
