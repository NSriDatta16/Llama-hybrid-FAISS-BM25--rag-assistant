Primary to your concern should be whether the model of $Y$ given all $X$ is correct. If it is correct, the $\beta$ of $X_2$ is the effect coefficient you are looking for. Take into account that there may be non-linear trends on any $X$ with $Y$, $Y$ may not be normal (in which case you need a large sample), and there may be interactions betwen any $X$. In particular effect hetorogeneity is an issue, which may bias your $\beta$ estimates. You should be able to model it, however, by including interaction terms of $X_2$ with the other $X$ in the model. When there are significnat interactions including them in the model will give you better (i.e., unbiased) estimates of the average effect of $X_2$ on $Y$. Moreover, if you are in the situation of a case-control or an observational study like a quasi- or natural-experiment, as I take from one of your comments above, $X_2$ is actually dichotomous indicating treatment or control. Then there is a series of other approaches for valid inference about the average treatment effect of $X_2$ on $Y$. For example, you could match treatment and control units indicated by $X_2$ conditional on the other $X$, by means of matching algorithms and propensity scores. If you are actually in the situation of a case-control study or a binary variable $X_2$ the literature on causal inference provides these and other methods. A --correct-- regression model of the type discussed above will also provide a correct treamtent estimate. However, it may be flawed when its basic assumptions (e.g. linearity, homoscedasticity, effect homogeneity, etc.) are violated. I have once discussed the use of regression models for estimating average treatment effects from observational studies here
