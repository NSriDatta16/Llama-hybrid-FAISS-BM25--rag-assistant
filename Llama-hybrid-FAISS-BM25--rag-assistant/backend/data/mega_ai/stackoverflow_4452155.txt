This was also posted on the Mercurial mailinglist and below is my reply : The location of the two (anonymous) branches in the log viewer is not important: there is no left or right side, the order only depends on the order in which you have made the the pulls and pushes. What you need is a way to label the changesets from the stable and unstable branches so that you can keep track of which is which. There are three main ways to do this: separate clones: This is the trivial way which you have already used where you keep a separate clone for the different branches. It has the advantage that you can throw away the changesets easily by just deleting the clone. It has the disadvantage that you don't really get a full overview of what is happening since the changesets are kept isolated. named branches: See my guide here if you haven't already done so: http://mercurial.aragost.com/kick-start/en/tasks/ The advantage of named branches is that they put a label into each changeset so that you can track where they come from. If you have a named branch called 'refactor-calendar-to-joda', then you can do hg update refactor-calendar-to-joda in order to update the working copy to the tip of that branch. When new commits are made on the branch, the branch tip moves along, and so you can think of 'refactor-calendar-to-joda' as a floating tag. To get back to the default branch, you execute hg update default This is where the normal development ought to take place. Named branches are good for branches that are stable over longer time or where the name also makes sense years later. For example, if you use a bug tracker, then I suggest creating a bug to track the refactoring and then calling branch 'bug XX'. That way people can lookup the right bug number in the future. bookmarks: Bookmarks give names to changesets and as with named branches, you can update to a bookmark: hg update refactor-calendar-to-joda However, unlike named branches, the bookmarks live outside of the changeset graph. Because they are not part of the changesets themselves, bookmarks can be moved, deleted, renamed etc. You can push and pull bookmarks between repositories. So use named branches for long-term persistent names, use bookmarks for short-lived branches, and use separate repositories if you like to have things separated. Finally, see this guide for more on this topic: http://stevelosh.com/blog/2009/08/a-guide-to-branching-in-mercurial/
