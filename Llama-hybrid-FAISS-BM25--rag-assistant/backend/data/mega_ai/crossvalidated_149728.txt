How to choose? the right method? There may be no single right method. If there is, it's whatever best represents similarity /dissimilarity in the domain. Does the euclidian distance actually reflect a biologically meaningful measure of how similar or different these genomes are? I'm no biologist, but perhaps you should compare how many genes are in common ... maybe how many are in common out of the total? a jaccard coefficient perhaps? If none stands out, try two or three and see if they give very different results. If they give the same results, then it's not important which one you use. If they give radically different results then you should worry about it, because it's really important, and figure it out with respect to genetics, not stats/machine learning. If you get pretty much the same results with a few differences, then you should draw conclusions primarily from the results that are consistent across different similarity/distance metrics, and be more cautious about the others.
