Oddly, this subject doesn't appear to have received much attention from the Rails community since 2007. The latest trunk of Bort didn't seem to work with Rails 2.3.x, so I forked it and got it working. I also added some things that I personally use - like yui reset/base, jquery, etc. The fork is very much still a work in progress, but I hope to provide broad, tested authentication support for restful auth, google auth, facebook connect, twitter, etc. http://github.com/lukebayes/bort
