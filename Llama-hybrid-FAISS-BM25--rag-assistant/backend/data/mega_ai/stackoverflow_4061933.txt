AS3 remove MC from dynamic path reference with removeChild

I'm not even sure if the title reflects what I want to do. Here's backstory. I have a movieclip with 5 'holder' movieclips in them. They are my containers for dynamically added movieclips. The parent containers has an instance name of pyramid, the holder instance names are labeled after the 6 food groups, i.e., 'grainholder', 'fruitholder', 'vegetableholder', etc etc... The holders are within the pyramid container, instance names as above, and the pyramid container is added to the display list. I have a addFoodToPyramid() function which adds 'foodMC' mc's to their respective holders. So an [object Apple] will be dynamically added by way of pyramid.fruitholder.addChild(Apple). The function also adds a listener. Heres the call and the function: The call (I will use grains as example) is this: addFoodToPyramid(grainArray, grainHolder, grainCounter); And the function is: function addFoodToPyramid(thisArray:Array, thisHolder:MovieClip, thisCounter:Number):void { thisCounter = 0; for (var f:Number=0; f Then I have a startDrag function: function startFoodDrag(e:MouseEvent):void { foodDrag = e.target as MovieClip; foodDrag.startDrag(); foodPoint = new Point(foodDrag.x,foodDrag.y); stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopFoodDrag, false, 0, true); } Then the drop function AND THE PROBLEM LIES HERE: foodDrag = foodDrop; stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, stopFoodDrag); if(foodDrag.dropTarget.parent==myPlate){ //HERES THE PROBLEM removeChild(foodDrag); //obviously returns error because the foodDrag reference is wrong } Ok, so obviously the reference is not a direct removeChild() but a specific path. Like: pyramid.*THE-HOLDER-OF-foodDRAG*.removeChild(foodDrag). But I just can't get my head around how to do it. I've tried: var mcParent:MovieClip=(foodDroppedMC.parent); pyramid.mcParent.removeChild(foodDroppedMC); // returns error 1118 Implicit Coercion I've tried: var mcParent:String=(foodDroppedMC.parent.name); pyramid.getChildByName(mcParent).removeChild(foodDroppedMC); // return 1061 Call to possibly undefined method removeChild with ref to static type etc etc The fact that it's such a banal problem is what makes it so frustrating... Any help would be appreciated. Thanks
