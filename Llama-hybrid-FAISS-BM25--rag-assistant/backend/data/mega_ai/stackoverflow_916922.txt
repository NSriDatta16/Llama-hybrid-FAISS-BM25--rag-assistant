To access and store files on the iPhone I recommend reading this . Erica Sadun has also written a nice shorty about accessing file within a app bundle. Note that how files are organized in Xcode does not show how they will end up in the app bundle. The best way is to select the app bundle in the Finder and CTRL-click and select Show Package Content .
