I have had this problem with VS 2008 in the past. Although I wasnt able to find the reason why it doesnt pick up types from the very same assembly you are adding the service reference to I did notice that it works if you actually take the DataContracts out. As in put them in a separate dll and then reference that dll to your project where you are adding the service reference. In most case this is a more elegant solution anyway as people tend to share the DataContracts between the service and the service consumer.
