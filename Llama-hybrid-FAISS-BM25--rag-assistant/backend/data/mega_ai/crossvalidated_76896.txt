Training a Support Vector Machine in Matlab - number iterations exceeded

I'm trying to train a support vector machine on a set of training data (which is seperate to my testing data). training_data has size MxN where M = 10175 and N = 102 Each observation has a label 1 or 0 . (118 observations have label 1, 10057 observations have label 0). Initially, I ran the Matlab Statistics Toolbox method svmtrain like so: svmtrain(training_data,labels,'Kernel_Function','rbf'); These are the default parameters recommended by Matlab. However after a while I get this message --------------------------- Error using seqminopt>seqminoptImpl (line 198) No convergence achieved within maximum number of iterations. Error in seqminopt (line 81) [alphas offset] = seqminoptImpl(data, targetLabels, ... Error in svmtrain (line 499) [alpha, bias] = seqminopt(training, groupIndex, ... What next steps should I take? I tried using the 'Kernel_Function','linear' option but the same problem happened. I'm not sure whether If I should use my own values for rbf_sigma or even for boxconstraint ? If anyone can help guide me in getting a SVM to be trained then that would be really helpful! PS. Could there be something about my data that means the svmtrain function will always exceed the maximum number of iterations, i.e. never converge? I don't want to aimlessly try different combos svmtrain method parameters, there are simply too many!
