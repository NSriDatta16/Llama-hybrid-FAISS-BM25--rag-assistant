In many ways, the use of standard deviation to summarize dispersion is jumping to a conclusion. You could say that SD implicitly assumes a symmetric distribution because of its equal treatment of distance below the mean as of distance above the mean. The SD is surprisingly difficult to interpret to non-statisticians. One could argue that Gini's mean difference has broader application and is significantly more interpretable. It does not require one to declare their choice of a measure of central tendency as the use of SD does for the mean. Gini's mean difference is the average absolute difference between any two different observations. Besides being robust and easy to interpret it happens to be 0.98 as efficient as SD if the distribution were actually Gaussian.
