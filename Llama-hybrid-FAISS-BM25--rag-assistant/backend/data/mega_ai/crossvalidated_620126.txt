Can We Use Mutual Information to Determine if a Time Series has a Difference Trend or a Time Trend?

Let's say we have a finite real-valued time series (finite subsequence of a realization of a real-valued stochastic process), $X_t$ . To address my question, we make no initial stationarity assumptions. We plot the the time series and see that there looks to be some sort of trend, but we aren't sure what kind. We then decide to try and make our time series approximately "more" stationary by detrending through use of a time trend or a difference trend. In determining which to try to model, are there any blaring statistical problems with the following?: Let $X_{t-k}$ denote a copy of $X_t$ lagged by $k$ . Also, let all mutual informations henceforth be assumed to be estimated by some form of K-Nearest-Neighbors such as this method From our time series, we first estimate the mutual information between $t$ and $X_t$ . We then estimate the mutual information between $X_{t-1}$ and $X_t$ . From our time series, we then estimate the conditional mutual information between $t$ and $X_t$ given $X_{t-1}$ . We then estimate the conditional mutual information between $X_{t-1}$ and $X_t$ given $t$ . We then compare the magnitudes of the non-conditional mutual informations to see if one is much larger than the other or if either are significant in magnitude. We then compare the magnitudes of the conditional mutual informations to see if one is zero or significantly less than the other, indicating approximate conditional dependence. We then combine these comparisons to decide if our time series is best made "more" stationary by detrending with a time trend or a difference trend. For example, say we find that the mutual information between $t$ and $X_t$ compared to $X_{t-1}$ and $X_t$ and that $X_{t-1}$ and $X_t$ appear to be conditionally independent (almost-zero/zero conditional mutual information) given $t$ . Is it correct to say that this would imply that we should choose to use a time trend over a difference trend? I know that statistical guarantees surrounding correlations holding, etc. become muddled when we loosen the stationarity assumption, but is using an estimate of "universal" dependency valid here? I know that mutual information makes assumptions about the time-invariance of the distributions of the variables it's calculated on so what I'm doing may be theoretically incorrect, but are there any foreseeable problems I would run into by doing this to make modeling decisions?
