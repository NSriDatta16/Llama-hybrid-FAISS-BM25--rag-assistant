If the Oracle database character set is AL32UTF8, why are the columns defined as NVARCHAR2? That means that you want those columns encoded using the national character set (normally AL16UTF16, but that may be different on your database). Unless you are primarily storing Asian language data (or other data that requires 3 bytes of storage in AL32UTF8), it is relatively uncommon to create NVARCHAR2 columns in an Oracle database when the database character set supports Unicode. In general, you are far better served sticking with the database character set (CHAR and VARCHAR2 columns) rather than trying to work with the national character set (NCHAR and NVARCHAR2 columns) because there are far fewer hoops that need to be jumped through on the development/ configuration side of things. Since you aren't increasing the set of characters you can encode by choosing NVARCHAR2 data types, I'll wager that you'd be happier with VARCHAR2 data types.
