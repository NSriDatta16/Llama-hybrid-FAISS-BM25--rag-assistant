If you want a pen and paper kind of exercises I'd recommend more designing than coding. Actually coding in paper sucks and it lets you learn almost nothing. Work environment does matter so typing on a computer, compiling, seeing what errors you've made, using refactor here and there, just doesn't compare to what you can do on a piece of paper and so, what you can do on a piece of paper, while being an interesting mental exercise is not practical, it will not improve your coding skills so much. On the other hand, you can design the architecture of a medium or even complex application by hand in a paper. In fact, I usually do. Engineering tools (such as Enterprise Architect) are not good enough to replace the good all by-hand diagrams. Good projects could be, How would you design a game engine? Classes, Threads, Storage, Physics, the data structures which will hold everything and so on. How would you start a search engine? How would you design an pattern recognition system? I find that kind of problems much more rewarding than any paper coding you can do.
