Google Chrome Extensions and NPAPI

I need to write some Google Chrome extension. The problem is that Chrome JavaScript APIs don't give me enough power - I need to use native code. I thought about writing a NPAPI plug-in that will provide the extension some custom JS APIs. Is it possible to package the extension, plus the custom NPAPI plugin inside a .crx, and then upload it to the Chrome Extensions Store ? Another issue with this method is that the NPAPI plugin will have many versions: Linux, Windows, OS X, x86, x86-64, etc. Is it possible to package all these in the crx and use the best version? Thanks. EDIT: After reading this , I realized that it's not possible to elegantly solve the multi-platform issue in one crx. But - is it possible to upload different crx-s for each platform to the Chrome extension store?
