I'm glad this one is tagged as subjective because it certainly is! This is an overly vague example, but I would imagine that if you have enough code that is duplicated that you could abstract those sections out and keep the different parts different. The point of not copy-pasting is so you don't end up having code that is hard to maintain and fragile.
