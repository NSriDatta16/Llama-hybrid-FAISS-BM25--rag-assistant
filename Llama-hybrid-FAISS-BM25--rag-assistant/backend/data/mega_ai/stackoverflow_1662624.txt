c++: ifstream open problem with passing a string for text file name

i'm trying to pass a string from main to another function. this string is a name of text file that needs to be oepened. as far as i can see, i am passing the string alright, but when i try to use ifstream.open(textFileName) , it doesn't quite work. but when i manually hardcode it as ifstream.open("foo.txt") , it works just fine. i would need to use this function several times so i would like to be able to pass in a string of text file name.. here's my main #ifndef DATA_H #define DATA_H #include "Data.h" #endif #ifndef DATAREADER_H #define DATAREADER_H #include "DataReader.h" #endif using namespace std; int main() { vector database = DataReader("foo.txt"); return 0; } header of DataReader #include #include #include #include #ifndef DATA_H #define DATA_H #include "Data.h" #endif using namespace std; vector DataReader(string textFile); and finally the DataReader.cpp #include "DataReader.h" using namespace std; vector DataReader(string textFile) { ifstream aStream; aStream.open(textFile); //line 11 i looked up the ifstream.open() and it takes a string and a mode as parameters. not really sure what to do with the modes, but i tried them but they gave the same error message DataReader.cpp: In function 'std::vector > DataReader(std::string)': DataReader.cpp:11: error: no matching function for call to 'std::basic_ifstream >::open(std::string&)' /usr/local/lib/gcc/sparc-sun-solaris2.9/4.0.3/../../../../include/c++/4.0.3/fstream:495: note: candidates are: void std::basic_ifstream ::open(const char*, std::_Ios_Openmode) [with _CharT = char, _Traits = std::char_traits ] thank you in advance for any input/suggestions.
