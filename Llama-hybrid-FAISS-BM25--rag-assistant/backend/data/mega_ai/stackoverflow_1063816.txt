Just to let everyone know, I've found an answer that serves my purposes for now. I ended up putting all the configuration in the .net 2.0 global web.config C:\WINDOWS\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\CONFIG I got this suggestion from this comment on connect.microsoft.com The configuration systems for both ASP.NET 1.1 and 2.0 are hierarchichal. As a result if a different framework version is a child of the root website (which is usually inetpub\wwwroot), then the configuration system in the child will attempt to merge the configuration from the root website. This behavior is by design since both the 1.1 and 2.0 configuration systems walk up the physical directory structure looking for parent web.configs. A simple workaround is to move the common 2.0 configuration information to the root web.config file for the 2.0 framework. The root web.config is located at: C:\windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v2.0.50727\CONFIG. With this approach all of your 2.0 applications will pick up the common sections while 1.1 applications won't see the sections. Thank you for submitting this issue. Hope the above information is useful for you. Posted by Microsoft on 22/02/2008 at 17:35 Seems to work for me, though it's not quite as elegant as if it had been a .net 2.0 application. Hope this helps someone else. Dan
