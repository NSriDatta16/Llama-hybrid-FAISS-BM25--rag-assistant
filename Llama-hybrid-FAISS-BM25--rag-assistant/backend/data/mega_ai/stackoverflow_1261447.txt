Similar to a file system, unless the table is optimized or defragmented, deleted data will free up a "slot" where new data will be inserted. It isn't always appended to the end of the table. So say you have 3 rows: A, B, C If you delete B, then your table will essentially look like A, [free space], C So if you insert D into your table, it will now look like: A, D, C Your best bet is to use a unique auto incrementing key. This will also speed up queries.
