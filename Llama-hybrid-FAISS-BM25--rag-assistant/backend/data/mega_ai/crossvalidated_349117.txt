You can fit this with propensity score matching to test if participation in the support program (treatment) affects students successful completion. Here https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3144483/ Peter C. Austin's article will give you an introduction to the topic and the different alternatives. Article by Abdia, Younathan, et al. "Propensity scores based methods for estimating average treatment effect and average treatment effect among treated: A comparative study." Biometrical Journal 59.5 (2017): 967-985. is also worth to read. It gives you detailed estimation startegies dpending on your interset ois whether ATE or ATT. Here https://sejdemyr.github.io/r-tutorials/statistics/tutorial8.html you will have a tutorial on how to implement it in R. TWANG also give you tutorial both in R and Stata. If you choose the doubly robust technique, you will be benifited from previous CV trends Doubly robust estimation of causal effects implementation . In any case should you have time it's worth whiel to read the original article by Rosenbaum, Paul R.; Rubin, Donald B. (1983). "The Central Role of the Propensity Score in Observational Studies for Causal Effects". Good luck.
