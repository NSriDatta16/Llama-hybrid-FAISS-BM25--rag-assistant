What is the equivalent of perplexity for a continuous distribution?

Lets say I have, though some unspecified means, created a model that gives me a continuous distribution with a p.d.f $f_X$, for some variable $X$ I am modelling. And let us say that I have a set of test observations of $X$, $\tau=\{x_1, x_2,..., x_n\}$ I wish to evaluate how good this model is by checking how likely it considers this test set $\tau$. If it says that $\tau$ is a very unlikely set of samples from the distribution, then it is a bad model. If it says that $\tau$ is a likely set of samples then it is a good model. This seems intuitively like a good measure of the models quality. If it were a discrete distribution then I would be using Perplexity . I would report the average perplexity of the testset. But I can't do that for a continuous distribution; what should I use instead? One option I was considering was to discretize it, and report a perplexity at a particular number of bins. At a small number of bins it is very easy to get a good perplexity, as the number of bins increases the result would become worse. By varying the number of bins I could create a curve of bins vs perplexity result. Which seems relate-able to a precision-recall curve. I feel there is likely a more standard way to do this though.
