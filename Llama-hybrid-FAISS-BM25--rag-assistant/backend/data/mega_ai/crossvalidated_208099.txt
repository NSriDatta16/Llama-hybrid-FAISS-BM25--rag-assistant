Your code and output are correct. The reason why the transformed points differ is in eigenvectors. Eigenvectors show directions in space, and in PCA it doesn't matter where the eigenvectors point as long as lines created by those vectors have proper directions. So if you rescale and rotate your points obtained by LPCA and kPCA you will notice that they are the same.
