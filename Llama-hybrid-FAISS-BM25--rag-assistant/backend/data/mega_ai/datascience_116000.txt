Similarity when clustering is used is usually based on same distance metric as the one used to cluster the data. Then to test similarity of a random sample to the cluster assigned one can compute the average distance of the sample with all points in that same cluster. This average distance (sometimes also normalized) is a similarity or fitness measure. PS cosine similarity requires data to satisfy certain properties (eg be normalized) to make sense.
