Let $\Phi=(\phi_1,...,\phi_p)$ and $\mathbf{y}_{t-1} = (y_{t-1},...,y_{t-p})$ So your equations become $y_t = \Phi^{T}\mathbf{y}_{t-1} + \eta(t)$ and $z_{t} = y_{t} + v(t)$ thus $$ z_t - \Phi^{T}\mathbf{y}_{t-1} = \eta(t) + v(t) $$ Where $p$ is the parameter of the Bernoulli distributed variable $\eta$; note that $$E[\eta(t) + v(t)]=p$$ and $$var[\eta(t) + v(t)]=p(1-p)+\sigma^2$$ Where $\sigma^2$ is the variance of $v(t)$. Using this we construct the likelihood function $$ \prod^{N}_{n=p+1} \mathcal{H}(z_t - \Phi^{T}\mathbf{y}_{t-1}\,|\,p\,,\,p(1-p)+\sigma^2) $$ where $\mathcal{H}$ is a pdf of unknown mean $p$ and variance $p(1-p)+\sigma^2$. Personally I would assume $\mathcal{H}$ is a normal distribution since on average $\eta(t) + v(t) \sim \mathcal{N}(\,p\,,\,p(1-p)+\sigma^2)$ but this is fuzzy logic since it violates the assumption that $(\eta(t) + v(t))$ are identically distributed...but that's my 2 cents anyway.
