Well, for one thing, you're linking prototype.js improperly. It should be ./js/prototype.js . Edit Also missing a few others: ./js/dragdrop.js ./js/controls.js ./js/slider.js Then, it looks like you're using jQuery not prototype (though, I don't have any experience with prototype). I looked it up on their site and you pass the id into the $() function, not a css-like/jQuery selector. So where you have $("#slideshow1").hide(); , you have to make it jQuery("#slideshow1").hide(); or $("slideshow1").hide(); if it's a prototype function. This goes the same for other scripts down the page. Edit 2 After you fix the missing JavaScript files, this line: $('slideshow1').hide(); should be jQuery('#slideshow1').hide(); . And these: $(function() { $('#slideshow1').cycle({ delay: 2000, speed: 1000, }); }); Should be: jQuery(function() { jQuery('#slideshow1').cycle({ delay: 2000, speed: 1000, }); });
