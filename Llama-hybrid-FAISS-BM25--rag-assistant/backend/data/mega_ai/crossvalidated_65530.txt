What you call "clustering" is also known as local regression, kernel regression or local likelihood smoothing. The overall framework is generalized additive modelling , and the definitive textbooks are Hastie & Tibshirani (1990) Generalized Additive Models , and Wood (2006) Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction With R . GAMs extend on GLMs (including logistic regression) by allowing nonlinear trends to enter the model in a data-driven way. You can include such nonlinear trends manually via transformations, eg polynomial terms or spline terms, but this usually requires examining the data beforehand. This can be tedious if you have many variables and/or they're correlated with each other. The fact that using a local fit improved your model suggests that the relationship between your IV and DV is nonlinear.
