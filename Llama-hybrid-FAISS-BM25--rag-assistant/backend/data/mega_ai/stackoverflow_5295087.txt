How to sort alphanumeric list of Django model objects

I am trying to port the answer to the question posed in How to sort alpha numeric set in python to Django. I have a list of Django model instances returned by a query and I can't work out how to use lambda to construct an elegant (or otherwise!) sort function. If my model contains a 'name' attribute - e.g. result = Take.objects.all() for i in result: print i.name How can I sort the resulting list of objects by the name attribute and apply a number of tests? i.e. my name value could be '1A','1','A1','001A' etc e.g. to give this ordering (based on name) 1A 2A 10A A1 A2 A10 A11 B2 B4
