The way in which you are creating this structure is not what is understood as a stacked autoencoder. Autoencoders with multiple hidden layers are called stacked autoencoders or deep autoencoders.* *See Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow by Aurélien Géron for a good overview of the different types of autoencoders. He actually has an example of a stacked denoising autoencoder in there.
