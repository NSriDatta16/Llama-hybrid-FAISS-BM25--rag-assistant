Actually, this is a pattern that we use all the time in our public facing API's, and demonstrates good use of dependency injection. I would pass this in a code review with no problems. Your implementation gives the user the option to flexibly create the object, and provides for testability. The only "problem" is that your tests can't easily cover the one line of code in the first constructor, but that's only a problem if you have someone who's fanatical about code coverage - which is usually a problem in itself.
