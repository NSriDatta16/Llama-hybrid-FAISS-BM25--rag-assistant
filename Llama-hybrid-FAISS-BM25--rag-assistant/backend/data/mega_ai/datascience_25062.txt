How can we scale up the number of classes for deep learning after training a model?

I have trained a deep learning model for a face recognition application. The model has been trained on the existing subjects (or call it classes) in the gallery. Now consider the real world problem, where the gallery size is dynamic as new subjects are to be enrolled, how can deep learning solve those type of problems? I have tried transfer learning, are there any other techniques?
