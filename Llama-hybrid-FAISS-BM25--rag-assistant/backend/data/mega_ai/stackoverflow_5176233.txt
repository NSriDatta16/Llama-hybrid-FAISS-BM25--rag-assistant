k-ary Trees in Java

I have a non-UI use for a so-called "k-ary" tree in my Java application and was wondering if the javax.swing.tree package was the right tool for the job, even though its packaged with Swing. I have a class of, say, Widget objects that need to be organized as a tree. Each node of this Widget tree can have 0+ children, and thus it is not necessarily symmetric. I need a generic Tree/Node structure that will allow me to use Widgets or any other object. Specifically, I need a traverse that does (at the very least) post-order traversals. If I'm not looking in the right package, can someone point me in the right direction?
