Depending on your use pattern, a std::deque may fufil your requirements. Pointers into a deque are only invalidated if you insert or delete items not at the beginning or end - in pother words push_front() and push_back() don't invalidate pointers into the deque, but other changes do. You get basically the same interface as a vector, but of course the underlying storage is not contiguous.
