You might want to do a time series regression as opposed to OLS regression. SAS has a procedure called Proc UCM (unobserved components model) which would do exactly what you are asking for . But I'm not sure if SPSS has a similar procedure. Please check this website for a"trend cycle" example using UCM. http://support.sas.com/rnd/app/examples/ets/melanoma/
