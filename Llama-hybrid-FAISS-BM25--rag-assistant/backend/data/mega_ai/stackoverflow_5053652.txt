Giving a neural network "pain"

I've programmed a non-directional neural network. So kind of like the brain, all neurons are updated at the same time, and there are no explicit layers. Now I'm wondering, how does pain work? How can I structure a neural network so that a "pain" signal will make it want to do anything to get rid of said pain.
