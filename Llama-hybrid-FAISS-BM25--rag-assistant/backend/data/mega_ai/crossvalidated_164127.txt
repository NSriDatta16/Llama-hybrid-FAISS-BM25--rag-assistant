There exists a logistic regression for binary data, but also one for grouped data. In the former case the likelihood function is a product of Bernouilli probabilities and in the latter case a product of Binomial probabilities (see, e.g., in this pdf ). As @Analist has indicated in a comment, both types are implemented in R, in the glm function. You should create a data frame with columns nbr.success , nbr.failure and the explanatory variables surface and ranking and then use the formula, cbind(nbr.success, nbr.failure) ~ surface + ranking + 1 , in the glm function.
