C# - Property Clarification

According to the definition : "As interface is not an object by itself ,I can't initialize it.If interface were allowed to declare fileds, then it needs storage location,so we can not declare fields inside interface." Incase of property say example when i declare string SayHello { get; set; } inside the interface It is internally hooked as get_SayHello( ) ,set_SayHello() in IL (when i disassemble i can see the get and set methods). My question is still property needs some storage location,then how the property declaration is allowed inside the interface. Edit : This is what i understood.As I am new to C#,i am seeking your help.
