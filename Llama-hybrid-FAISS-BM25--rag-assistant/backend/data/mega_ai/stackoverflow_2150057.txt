For C# on x86, 80-bit FP registers are used. The C# standard says that the processor must operate at the same precision as, or greater than, the type itself (i.e. 64-bit in the case of a 'double'). Promotions are allowed, except for storage. That means that locals and parameters could be at greater than 64-bit precision. In other words, assigning a member variable to a local variable could (and in fact will under certain circumstances) be enough to give an inequality.
