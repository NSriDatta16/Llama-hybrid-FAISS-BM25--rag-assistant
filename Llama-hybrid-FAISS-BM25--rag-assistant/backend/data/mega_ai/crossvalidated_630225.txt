Graph Neural Networks vary greatly on how it connects the graph structure to neural networks layers, but as I understand it usually works very much like a CNN but instead of images we have graphs and node neighborhood is accounted for on layer connections and the original structure is maintained until a certain point where some type of transformation is performed (like flatten on CNNs). Tried to draw a simple representation of it like you did with other architectures: but just draw the connections for two nodes because it would be confuse with all the connections and my lack of drawing skills.
