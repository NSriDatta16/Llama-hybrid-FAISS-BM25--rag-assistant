PHP: word definition script?

I am developing a web page on which I am accepting input words from the user, and when the user submits those words, I want to display definition of those words, or wikipedia links of those words for more definition about that word -- something like the following: Let's say user enetered 5 words: toast, egg, beans, coffee, tea Now I want to display them like: toast › slices of bread that have been toasted egg › animal reproductive body consisting of an ovum or embryotogether with nutritive and protective envelopes beans › a small skullcap read more on wikipedia coffee › a beverage consisting of an infusion of ground coffee beans tea › a beverage made by steeping tea leaves in water read more on wikipedia For those words for which there is no article on wikipedia, no wiki link would be displayed. Can someone please suggest me some open-source PHP script or package that would do this for me? Alternatively, I'd appreciate any suggestions on how to do this in PHP. I am more interested in getting data from some other website directly than I am in storing word definitions in my database. I am using PHP and MySQL.
