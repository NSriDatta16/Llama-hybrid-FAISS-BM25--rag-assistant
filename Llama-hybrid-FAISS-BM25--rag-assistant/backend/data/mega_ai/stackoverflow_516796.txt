I am not sure why it should be problem. I wrote this code to check storage and retrieval of iterator which seems to work fine. [Note: I am not using make_pair as it should not be relevant, give try without using it though!] #include #include #include enum UniqueKey {One, Two, Three}; typedef std::map UniqueKeyStringMap; int main() { UniqueKeyStringMap storage; std::string stringOne = "This is one string"; std::string::iterator it = stringOne.begin() + 8; // "o" std::cout second, mapIter->second + 3) expected output: Iterator to store: one From storage: one
