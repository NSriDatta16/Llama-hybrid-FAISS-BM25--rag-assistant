the div element will take all the width space of the container element if it isn't set a width value. So if you want to center a div you must set a width... A solution to your problem (if I have understand it) can be: [... yours content ...] where your div has became a span and a new div puts the span in the center. Hope this can help you! Bye, Alberto
