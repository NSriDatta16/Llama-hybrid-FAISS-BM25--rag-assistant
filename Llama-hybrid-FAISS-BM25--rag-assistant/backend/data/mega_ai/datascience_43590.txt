What are Machine learning model characteristics?

This question I have received in some Machine Learning related interview and Here is the question What questions would you ask to learn about machine learning model characteristics? This is what I think: I did a bit research on the internet & found this resource , but still not very clear about How ML model characteristics are equivalent to asking trade-off between different algorithms in supervised learning settings. What I understood and framed my answer is: First, for simplicity, I assumed that this model is used for some supervised learning task(classification/ regression) then, I would first try to find a learning algorithm used to create this model, because this will provide me with a clue of the created model and help me to talk about different issues within it(such as, How complex or simple your model is(feature engineering!)? What are your training & test errors(Model performance) Both will help me to talk about the bias vs variance trade-off. Furthermore, I could talk about different learning algorithm trade-offs in supervised settings. Is the model based on identifying correlations i.e output variable can be expressed in terms of the linear/non-linear combination of features? (targeting linear regression, logistic regression, SVM or Neural network algorithms, or it's decision tree-based algorithms. I am not confident enough that my answer is complete or correct (since I am not able to understand what precisely characteristics of a model are?), so I need this community's help to provide feedback! please feel free to add your suggestion to it!
