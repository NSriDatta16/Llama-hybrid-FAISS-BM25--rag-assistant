how to randomize retrieval of question from database?

.i have the following code: '; for($i=0; $i \n"; for ($j=1;$j ". $array[$i]['Answer'.$j]." \n"; } } //End the form echo " \n "; ?> .the code above displays all the questions and their corresponding choices of answers which are retrieved from the database. my question is, how do you randomize the display of questions and display only 5 at a time and upon clicking a next button the next five will be displayed. Thanks in advance!
