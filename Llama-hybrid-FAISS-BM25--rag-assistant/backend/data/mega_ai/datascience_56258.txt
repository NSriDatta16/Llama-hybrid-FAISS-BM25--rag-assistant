You are generally right, but as you have mentioned these are important features and you would need to figure the way using them as they are with such a low signal below 2%. You may try building more of these features to enrich the signal while combining different features together, for example, sum the 1-2-3 counts, sum other count features with these once if it makes sense. Another type of enrichment that you can do is modelling the feature distribution to get more samples for higher counts, for example, counting of events occurrences in some time-interval is having Poisson distribution or Powe-Low for long-tail distribution where small is common and high values are rare, you may use this property to extract more of your features. - Once you engineered your features and cant get more out of them, you may try some models that handle such property of the data. If you know that some of your zero counts are due to missing values, don't fill them with zeros instead you can use models that can handle them better. XGBoost, for example, allows missing features values and it finds the best way to handle them that minimizes the overall loss. There are also other statistical models that are developed to handle such inherent/natural skewness, like the Zero-inflated Poisson or Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial regression models that are specifically developed to handle count data with many zeros (both assume that there is another process that inflates the zeros to be too high).
