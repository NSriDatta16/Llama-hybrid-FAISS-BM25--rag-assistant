You can use XPath to pull out data from HTML: String html = //... //read the HTML into a DOM StreamSource source = new StreamSource(new StringReader(html)); DOMResult result = new DOMResult(); Transformer transformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(); transformer.transform(source, result); Node root = result.getNode(); //use XPath to get the title XPath xpath = XPathFactory.newInstance().newXPath(); String title = xpath.evaluate("/html/title", root); However, the HTML must be well formed XHTML for this to work. For example, the " " tag is valid in HTML, but is invalid in XHTML because it is not closed. It must be " " to be valid in XHTML.
