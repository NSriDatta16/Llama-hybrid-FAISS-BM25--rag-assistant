Insofar as there are more bytes to download, the first example is slower. However, I'm certain that you will never be able to differentiate between the negligible micro-optimization of the latter example and the former example. Other than organization, there's no reason to bother. That said, for the sake of organization, I would definitely bother! Keeping your code organized will speed development time. Keeping all of your JavaScript in one place will prevent you from running around searching for a snippet. I would strive to move as much code first into an external file, and anything else into the foot of your document. You will garner the most speed benefit by using an external file (due to browser caching) than anything else. You will allow your markup to be rendered by the browser before downloading or executing your JavaScript if you move the tags to the footer of the page. This will create the illusion of a faster download. Incidentally, (and just as trivially) the most optimized version of your script (aside from using an external file) would be: var x='foo', y='bar';
