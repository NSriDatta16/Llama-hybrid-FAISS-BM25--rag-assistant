Suppose you have 1000 men and 1000 women, measure everyone's height and model height as predicted by sex. In your random forest context, you can assess predictive accuracy out-of-bag. Now, if sex were irrelevant to height, then you should get (roughly) the same predictive accuracy if you randomly shuffled everyone's M/F identification. That is exactly what RF variable importance does: shuffle each observation's value on one variable, reassess predictive accuracy and compare to accuracy on the unshuffled data. If the shuffled data predict as well as unshuffled data, the variable is obviously not very important for prediction. If the shuffled data predict worse, then the variable is important. In this toy example, we only have one predictor. In a more general setting, you would do this on every predictor separately, that is, you'd shuffle one variable, leaving the others unchanged.
