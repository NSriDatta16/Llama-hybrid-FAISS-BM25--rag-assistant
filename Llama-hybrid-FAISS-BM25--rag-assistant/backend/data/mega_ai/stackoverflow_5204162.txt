Instead of a long comment: "reliability plays a role" As long as your provide reliable output for "reliable" input i think you will be OK without having to handle 'spoofed' or fake input. In case you have data stored in persistent storage you could handle cases for 'suspicious' data. That is define and apply scenarios on your data to identify cases like "the user traveled from France to Hawaii in 30 minutes", and handle such cases in an appropriate way. Or you could even reject data that are not realistic.
