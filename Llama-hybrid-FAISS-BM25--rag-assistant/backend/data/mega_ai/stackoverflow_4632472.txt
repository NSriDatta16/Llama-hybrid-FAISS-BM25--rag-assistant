Sometimes, you want to use different names for different associations. If the name you want to use for an association on the model isn't the same as the assocation on the :through model, you can use :source to specify it. I don't think the above paragraph is much clearer than the one in the docs, so here's an example. Let's assume we have three models, Pet , Dog and Dog::Breed . class Pet In this case, we've chosen to namespace the Dog::Breed , because we want to access Dog.find(123).breeds as a nice and convenient association. Now, if we now want to create a has_many :dog_breeds, :through => :dogs association on Pet , we suddenly have a problem. Rails won't be able to find a :dog_breeds association on Dog , so Rails can't possibly know which Dog association you want to use. Enter :source : class Pet :dogs, :source => :breeds end With :source , we're telling Rails to look for an association called :breeds on the Dog model (as that's the model used for :dogs ), and use that.
