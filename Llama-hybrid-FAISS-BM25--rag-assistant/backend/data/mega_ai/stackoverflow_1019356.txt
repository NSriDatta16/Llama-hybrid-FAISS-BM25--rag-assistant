Is there a better way to escape this string?

What is the quickest way in ColdFusion (or Java) for converting a string as such: Input: 79827349837493827498 Output: \79\82\73\49\83\74\93\82\74\98 I'm taking an LDAP GUID and escaping it for a query. I can do it as a series of MID reductions like this: But it seems like there would be something more elegant, like a regular expression replace.
