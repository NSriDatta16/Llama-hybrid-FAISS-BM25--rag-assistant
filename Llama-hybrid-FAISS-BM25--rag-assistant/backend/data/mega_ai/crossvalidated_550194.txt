It sounds like there are two problems: one of methodology and another of conflict resolution. My initial impression is say to just "split the baby". At the fundamental level, the collaborator is just asking for a simpler way to visualize the results of the PCA so what could be the harm in delivering a "prettier graph." At the same time, everyone needs to be well aware as you rightly point out no one should try to make any inferences using the resulting marginals. To that end, one proposed way to demonstrate the issue to the collaborator is to run a sensitivity analysis on the data to illustrate how much potential there is for estimation error in the method they have requested. You can bootstrap several samples or add varying degrees of noise and inspect how different the plots are between the full dataset and the augmented ones. Here is an article on unsupervised dimensionality reduction on gene expression data which found that PCA was relatively robust in this regard: Comparative study of unsupervised dimension reduction techniques for the visualization of microarray gene expression data . That said, in Figure 6 of their paper they found that with a very low number of principal components, the issue you described can be very impactful.
