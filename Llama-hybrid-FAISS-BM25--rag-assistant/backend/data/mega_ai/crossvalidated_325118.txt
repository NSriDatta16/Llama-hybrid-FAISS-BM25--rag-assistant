Dynamic Linear Model: MLE and Bayesian inference for estimating unknown parameters

Here's the background. I have a time series representing daily sales. And I had built some models, like, ARIMA ( arima ), STL Decomposition ( stl ), Holt-winter ( hw ), and exponential smoothing state space model (result from the ets reduced to a hw model, because the returned model showed additive error/trend/seasonality), etc. Anyway, the data is non-stationary, representing trend and weekly seasonality, which can also be proved with spectral analysis/periodogram. By using cross validation of 1-step to 15-step ahead forecast, I found stl decomposition gave me the best result in MAE. Then, I started working on a dynamic linear model to see if I can build a better one for forecasting. The model is also written in R, with dlm , which is local linear + seasonal + ARMA model, and the code as below build My first question is, in the math modeling, there should be only one observation error, indicating that, there also should be only one dV in the R model. So, I only used the dV argument in dlmModPoly , is this correct? I know that MLE is not considered the best way for estimating unknown parameters. As I read the book Dynamic Linear Model with R , it also gives methods like Bayesian Inferences with discount factor (with/without time-variant dV ) or Simulation-based Bayesian inference. Here are my questions How do I use dlmFilterDF if my model consist of three parts, which is mod ? Can I do this modFilt directly? When applying dlmGibbsDIG , can I assign vectors to a.theta and b.theta ? because the unknown parameters $\psi$ in my case is of length 10 (1 for dV, 2 for local linear dW , 6 for seasonality dW , 1 for ARMA dW ).
