What's the best way to manipulate and store huge ordered lists or hashes?

I have a a simple ordered list that could contain 1 million or more items. There are only a few actions that are done with this list: lookup in a value exist find the index for a value find value for index add a value get number of items in the list Once a value is added to the list, it never changes. I append items to the list, no insert or delete. I need to manipulate this big list, and store it persistently. Right now I am using a database Int => String to represent the list, but I think there should me a more efficient way to do that. I could use memcached, but I think 2 functions are missing: persistent storage find the index for a value
