Traditional hypothesis tests tell you whether there is statistically significant evidence for the existence of an effect, whereas what we often want to know about is the existence of evidence of a practically significant effect. It is certainly possible to form Bayesian "hypothesis tests" with a minimum effect size (IIRC there is an example of this in David MacKay's book on "Information Theory, Inference and Learning Algorithms", I'll look it up when I have a moment. Normality testing is another good example, we usually know that the data are not really normally distributed, we are just testing to see if there is evidence that this is isn't a reasonable approximation. Or testing for the bias of a coin, we know it is unlikely to be completely biased as it is assymetric.
