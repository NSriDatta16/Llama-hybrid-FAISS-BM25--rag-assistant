Viewstate Issue with Dynamically Loaded Control

I am having issues with my dynamically loaded control's events. Here is how I am loading the control: protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { LoadSubPageEditTemplate(); } protected void LoadSubPageEditTemplate() { pnlPageTemplate.Controls.Clear(); BaseOfferAdmin adminControl = (BaseOfferAdmin)this.LoadControl("~/Controls/SingleOfferAdmin.ascx"); if (adminControl != null) { adminControl.ID = "Control_ID" pnlPageTemplate.Controls.Add(adminControl); } } } The LoadSubPageEditTemplate() is also fired from a button event on the page, since I have to update it after the button event has executed. The control loads perfectly, I have tested it with a basic button and the postback fires as expected. However, I am getting weird results with CheckBoxes. The CheckedChanged event only fires when the Checkbox is checked, which I guess means there is some issue with my control viewstate. If I have multiple checkboxes on the page, and one creates a postback, the checkchanged event is fired for each checkbox that is checked. Thanks for anyone taking some time out to help me out! Ignus
