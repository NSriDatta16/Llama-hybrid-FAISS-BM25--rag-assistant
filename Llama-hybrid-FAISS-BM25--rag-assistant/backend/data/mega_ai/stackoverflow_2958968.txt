Problem in adding data to an array in Objective-C

I am grappling with adding an NSData object to a NSMutable array. The code is executing fine but it is not adding the objects in the array.The code is as follows: NSData * imageData = UIImageJPEGRepresentation(img, 1.0); int i=0; do{ if([[tempArray objectAtIndex:i] isEqual:imageData]) { [tempArray removeObjectAtIndex:i]; } else { [tempArray addObject:imageData]; //NSLog(@"ANURAG %@",[tempArray objectAtIndex:0]); } }while(i The NSLog statement shows the object added is null however the value of imageData is not null. I have defined the tempArray as a static memeber of the class in which this code is written. Is it because of the size of the data object as it is the data of an image?
