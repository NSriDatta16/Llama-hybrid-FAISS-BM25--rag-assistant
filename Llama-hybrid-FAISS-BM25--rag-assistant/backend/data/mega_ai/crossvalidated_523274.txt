Parameter simplification of ARIMA model

I am constructing an ARIMA model on a cryptocurrency price time series. Using the autocorrelation and partial autocorrelation plots I came to the parameters of (p,d,q)=(3,1,2). The resulting RMSE was 0.651 In order to see if there would be any better parameters I ran a grid search which resulted in (p,d,q)=(0,1,1) which gave an identical RMSE of 0.651. The results of the grid search didn't include (skipped over) the model I had come to of (3,1,2) despite being within the defined ranges. Is this because the two models are the same but that 0,1,1 is a simplified version of 3,1,2?
