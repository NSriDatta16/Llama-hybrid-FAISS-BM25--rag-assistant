IE6 list issue - First list on page ignores horizontal margins

I am creating a store in Magento and have a weird issue with IE6 and the ordered lists on my page. For some reason, IE6 ignores the horizontal margin on my first list. Not the first element in the list but the whole list. I have multiple list on the page. Here is a link to the offending page: http://byerofma.nexcess.net/products/pangean-furniture.html I have tried everything I can think of. Any ideas? Cheers, Chuck
