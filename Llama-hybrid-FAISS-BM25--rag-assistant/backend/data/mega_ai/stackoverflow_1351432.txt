The first thing to pay attention is that I'm not sure how IronRuby will handle namespaces that start with a lowercase letter. If I remember correctly, your namespace will simply be ignored, but i'm not sure about it. In the Ruby language, modules (which are the equivalent to C# namespaces) must start with a capital letter. After you change the namespace to start with a capital letter - HelloWorldLib, you can use require or load_assembly to load your assembly. require will load you assembly only once (even when the dll is required several times) and load_assembly will reload the assembly every time it is called. This code will run your snippet: require 'C:\Documents and Settings\myUser\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\Project1\helloWorldLib\bin\Debug\helloWorldLib.dll' greeter = HelloWorldLib::Greeter.new greeter.say_hello_world "Michael"
