cocos2d extend touch area from a button

I got some radiobuttons but the toucharea is to small. The toucharea depends on the image size. Is there an elegant way to extend the touch area with cocos2d without using a bigger image or make my own touch areas with cgrect? setContentSize do what I want. Unfortunately the image moves to the left bottom corner of the contentsize. Set the anchorpoint moves the contentsize around but the image stays in the left bottom corner. CCMenuItem* pickEasy = [CCMenuItemImage itemFromNormalImage:@"radiobutton_off.png" selectedImage:@"radiobutton_on.png" target:self selector:@selector(pickEasyTapped:)]; pickEasy.position = ccp(ss.width * 0.40, ss.height * 0.78); [pickEasy setContentSize:CGSizeMake(50, 50)]; Thanks in advance.
