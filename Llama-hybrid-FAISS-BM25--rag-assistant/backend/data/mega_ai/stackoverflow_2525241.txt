PHP HTML Embed PHP Tags within a .HTML Document Is This Possible?

Embedding HTML within .PHP files is one of the primary functionalities of PHP, but is it possible to do it the other way round? I mean, embedding PHP tags, , within a .HTML document?? Is this sort of coding possible? Any suggestions welcome.
