The interface is terrible. a. Registering with OpenID takes more time and savvy. Normal registration takes very little time or savvy. Registration happens once, but it's a large upfront investment, so the site has to be very compelling. b. Signing in involves: three pieces of data instead of two; two web pages instead of one (three at StackOverflow, actually); and an external web site. EVERY TIME. c. There are better interfaces for this kind of solution. I use KeePass, for example. Name collisions. There's no way to ensure unique names. Security is terrible. a. It encourages phish-like behavior. It's not as bad as "Verified by Visa," but it's close. b. Single point of failure: If you lose anything, you lose everything. KeePass at least allows me to physically protect the password (you must have the hard drive with the encrypted database on it). c. Cross-site tracking. Credit card companies actually have rules in place governing how much tracking their allowed to do. Cookies can be selectively disabled or prevented in modern browsers. OpenID has no rules and no governors. It isn't actually universal. Google provides OpenID... but doesn't use them. Same for Yahoo. And for AOL. There's no incentive for an OpenID provider to allow the use of OpenIDs from other providers. OpenID is useful for authentication, but not for authorization, particularly for anything sensitive (credit cards, for example). For me personally, I use one login/password per site, and I use KeePass (which I can protect physically and with two layers of passwords that must be cracked) to maintain the one-login-for-everywhere abstraction. That includes StackOverflow: I created an OpenID specially for you guys, and I won't ever use it anywhere else. I did this, and I put up with the login pain because the content is compelling. But if a real auth method were ever provided for StackOverflow, I'd jump on it in a heartbeat, just for the ease of use gains.
