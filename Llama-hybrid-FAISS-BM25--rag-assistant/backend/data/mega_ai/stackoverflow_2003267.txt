I don't think you can achieve this level of access filtering. The only methods I'm aware of are described in this msdn article Managing Access to Containers and Blobs and here a blog that describes a little part of code to implement it Using Container-Level Access Policies in Windows Azure Storage I'm not sure this would fit your need. If I understood it right I would do it this way : 1. Organize your content in container that match the roles 2. On your on premise application check if user has access and if yes generate the right URL to give him a temporary access to the resource. Of course this only works if the users have to go through a central point to get access to the content in the blob. If they bookmark the generated link it will fail once the expiration date is passed. Good luck.
