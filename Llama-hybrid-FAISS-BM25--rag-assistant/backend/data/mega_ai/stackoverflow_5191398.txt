Design consideration for Importing large Excel file data to database in SharePoint

This being a design approach question, please bear with me for long description :-) We have a SharePoint web part from where a user can be added to the system. But I am going to work on bulk user import functionality in SharePoint. My question is what all design considerations should be kept in mind while developing this solution. Following is the basic flow i have identified User downloads the import template (excel file) Fill in the downloaded import template with user details User uploads the excel sheet System will validate template and data Import data to database from the excel file, row by row For any exception/error log put entire excel record in another excel log file along with the exception details Here are some of the considerations i had in mind for this flow For template validation Export Template Generate template based on database columns Add column restriction E.g. Data type, Selection of only predefined values Template Validation Check number of columns supported Column header names validity Data Validation Check mandatory data presense Data type validation Data validation against database Import Process This being a SharePoint solution and we might have multiple WFEs, i am thinking of uploading the file to a document library for temporary storage Actual import process will be done through some timer job which will pick up from this document library ? The log file will be an identical blank template with only header columns and actual records which failed along with error message as an additional column. This should get stored in a separate document library. At the end of the process show user a link to download this log file. Should i also maintain a record of which all record were successful. Possible number of users to be imported may be in hundreds if not thousands. Please suggest if i am missing any design considerations here or anything which can be wrong here. Thanks.
