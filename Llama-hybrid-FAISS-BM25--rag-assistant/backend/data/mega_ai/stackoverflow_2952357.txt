rails - caches_action expire_action

I want to expire a cached action and wondered how to generate the correct reference. #controller caches_action :index, :layout => false #generates this fragment which works fine views/0.0.0.0:3000/article/someid/posts #sweeper ... expire_action article_posts_path(:article_id => post.article) # results in this Expired fragment: views//en/article/someid/posts (0.0ms) So this is almost ok, except the host is missing. What do I do that supplies this to the expire_action method? Thanks in advance.
