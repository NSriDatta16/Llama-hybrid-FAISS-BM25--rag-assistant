I'd second using ACL/roles for real admin stuff, and probably not using admin routing in production. I sometimes keep a scaffolded (so minimal extra code) admin routing for low-level admin stuff, accessible only to me, but that's probably not wise in a robust production app. Edit after commentary: It's not optimal, but you may be able to put together something that will appear like you want it in the URLs, and also be organized into folders. I haven't been able to test it yet, but here's the idea: Create a folder "admin" in your controllers folder and for the users admin, make a users_admin_controller.php controller file. They collapse the folder structure, so you still can't have the same names as your root dir, but you can still separate them into a folder. This will by default do an /admin_users/add type situation, but that can be tweaked with the second part, some routing: Router::connect('/admin/users/:action', array('controller'=>'admin_users')) This would have to be done for each admin section - not ideal, but I can't figure out a better way without modifying Cake code.
