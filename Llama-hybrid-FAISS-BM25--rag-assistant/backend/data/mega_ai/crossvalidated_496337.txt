The key differences in the implementation of the algorithm / in the passing of the messages are as follows: messages in BP are passed only once; in contrast, messages in loopy BP (LBP) are passed iteratively until "convergence is reached" (convergence means that the belief does not change anymore from one iteration to the other). in a Bayesian Network, messages in BP are passed from "leaves" to "roots", i.e. upwards in the Bayesian Network; in contrast, messages in LBP don't need to be passed in a particular order. Other than that, the equations to calculate the belief and the messages are completely identical.
