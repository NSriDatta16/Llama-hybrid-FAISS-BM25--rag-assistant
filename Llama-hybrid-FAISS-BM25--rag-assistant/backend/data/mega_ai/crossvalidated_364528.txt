Random effects models have an intrinsically Bayesian flavor, especially when you're talking about the "estimates" of the random effects. In particular, you assume that $site_{i} \sim N(0, \sigma^2)$ apriori, but the estimates you obtain for the random effects come from the posterior distribution $[site_i \mid biomass_{ij}, \theta]$, i.e., given the observed data. The estimated random effects are typically the mean or mode of this posterior distribution. Hence, they will not be iid $N(0, \sigma^2)$. In the case of the normal model, they still have a normal distribution, but with different mean and variance. When you work under maximum likelihood, you replace $\theta$ with $\hat \theta$ the maximum likelihood estimates, and then the estimates of the random effects are called empirical Bayes estimates. Now, the way to interpret them is along the lines you suggested, i.e., they can give you a ranking of the sites. Note, that the random effects are centered around the corresponding fixed effects, in your case around the intercept. Hence, a site with a positive random effect has average biomass greater than the average biomass overall the sites (= the intercept), and a site with a negative random effect has average biomass lower than the average overall the sites.
