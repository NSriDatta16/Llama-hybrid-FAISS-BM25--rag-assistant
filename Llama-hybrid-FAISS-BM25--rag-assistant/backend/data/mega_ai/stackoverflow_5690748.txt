Get distinct result

I was asked this trick question: Table: Student ID NAME 1 JOHN 2 MARY 3 ROBERT 4 DENNIS Table: Grade ID GRADE 1 A 1 A 1 F 2 B 3 A How do you write SQL query to return DISTINCT name of all students who has never received grade 'F' OR who has never taken a course (meaning, their ID not present in Grade table)? Trick part is, you're not allowed to use OUTER JOIN, UNION or DISTINCT. Also, why this is a big deal? Expected result is MARY, ROBERT, DENNIS (3 rows).
