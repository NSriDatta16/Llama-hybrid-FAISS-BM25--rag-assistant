Is it possible to analyse the components of a composite score with a specific formula in a multivariate linear mixed model analysis?

My goal is to analyze sex differences over time in a composite score that consists of 4 components (C1-C4) using a linear mixed model analysis. The secondary analysis includes sex differences over time in the different components. The regression coefficients of interest are gender, gender:time, and gender:component. The data is organized such that each patient's ID is recorded 20 times (4 times for each component at 5 different time points). Assume that the relationship between the composite score and the overall score is as follows: composite score = ((C1+C2)+(C3+C4)/2)/3 I aim to develop a model that explores the variations in the 4 components over time and the main effect of gender and gender:time on the composite score, which is derived from the 4 components. Example data #Packages library(lme4) library(lmerTest) library(tidyr) # Set the seed for reproducibility set.seed(123) # Create a data frame with 11,000 observations df $C1[df$ Gender=='Female'] $C1[df$ Gender=='Female'] + 5 df $C2[df$ Gender=='Female'] $C2[df$ Gender=='Female'] + 5 df $C3[df$ Gender=='Female'] $C3[df$ Gender=='Female'] + 5 df $C4[df$ Gender=='Female'] $C4[df$ Gender=='Female'] + 5 # Reshape the data frame from wide to long format df_long $ID, df_long$ Time, df_long $Component), ] row.names(df_long) Gender $Gender) df_long$ ID $ID) df_long$ Component Structure of the data #Data-structure head(df_long, n = 20) str(df_long) ID Gender Time Component Response 1 1 Male 0 C1 95 2 1 Male 0 C2 96 3 1 Male 0 C3 81 4 1 Male 0 C4 27 5 1 Male 1 C1 17 6 1 Male 1 C2 61 7 1 Male 1 C3 29 8 1 Male 1 C4 75 9 1 Male 2 C1 44 10 1 Male 2 C2 99 11 1 Male 2 C3 91 12 1 Male 2 C4 94 13 1 Male 3 C1 5 14 1 Male 3 C2 18 15 1 Male 3 C3 36 16 1 Male 3 C4 57 17 1 Male 4 C1 71 18 1 Male 4 C2 89 19 1 Male 4 C3 64 20 1 Male 4 C4 34 Analysis lmer_model = lmer(Response ~ 1 + Gender + Time + Component + Gender*Time + Gender*Component + (1 | ID), data = df_long, REML = F) Linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood . t-tests use Satterthwaite's method ['lmerModLmerTest'] Formula: Response ~ 1 + Gender + Time + Component + Gender * Time + Gender * Component + (1 | ID) Data: df_long AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 229768.5 229865.5 -114872.3 229744.5 23988 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7736 -0.8630 0.0105 0.8630 1.7492 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev.

However, in this model, the main effect of sex reflects the mean of the 4 components and not the overall composite score. Would it be possible to analyze the effect of the 4 components on the model, whilst also having the main effect of sex reflect the overall composite score as opposed to the mean of the 4 components?
