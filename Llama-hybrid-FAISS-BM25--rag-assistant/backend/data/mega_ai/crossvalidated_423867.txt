Survey data : calibrate result according to number of response

I ll do my best to explain the situation. I'm trying to rank X supermarkets according to their performance. I've done a survey with a set of Y clients and obtained an average grade for each supermarket. The problem being is that for some supermarkets I got more answers than other supermarkets eg. supermarket 1 has 289 answers and supermarket 2 has 34 answers. Therefore the ranking is biased : supermarket 2 had less answers but has a better grade than supermarket 1, and supermarket 2 is ranked before supermarket 1 . My question is do you know how to calibrate the data in order to get a grade which shows a better representation of the supermarket performance compared to the others ? Thank you.
