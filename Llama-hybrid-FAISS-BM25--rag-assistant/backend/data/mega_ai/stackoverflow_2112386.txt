This is a file-system access and permissions issue, not an ASP.Net issue. ASP.Net is dependent on the facilities on the local server, so there's nothing in ASP.Net to provide you access to external storage if the location is unreachable from your server. Once you can reliably access the location through the file system, you can set about accessing the location through ASP.Net.
