There is not going to be a one-size-fits-all solution for doing this. You can check the Thread.IsBackground property to see if it is a background thread (that is according to the definition of background that the property is using that is). You can take advantage of the Thread.Name name property to identify it later. You can use thread local storage to stuff information "into" a thread which you can extract later to identify it. You can use the Thread.IsThreadPoolThread to see if it is a thread managed by the thread pool. Each of these has their own advantages and disadvantages. I think you are going to find it difficult to identify a thread without having attached some kind of information to it ahead of time.
