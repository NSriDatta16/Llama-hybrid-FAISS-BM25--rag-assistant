Delayed gestures, by definition, are sent after a little delay. This (UIScrollViewDelayedTouchesBeganGestureRecognizer) is used to ensure the pinch and pan gestures get a higher priority. A gesture recognizer will not retain its state to avoid a retain cycle. Hence, when this recognizer fires, it will send to a deallocated view. You could delay the -release of the view (e.g. with -performSelector:withObject:afterDelay: ). Or instead of removes the view, you could just set it hidden .
