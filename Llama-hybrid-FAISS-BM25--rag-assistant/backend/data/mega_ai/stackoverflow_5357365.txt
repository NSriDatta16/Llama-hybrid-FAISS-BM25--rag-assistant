Just wanted to post which code has worked for me.. I've changed out the call to the nusoap class, and replaced it with PHP SoapClass $wsdl="..Srvc.asmx?WSDL"; $client = new SoapClient($wsdl); $param = array('OTA_VehAvailRateRQ' => array('VehAvailRQCore' => array('VehRentalCore' => array('PickUpDateTime'=>$PickUpDateTime, 'ReturnDateTime'=>$ReturnDateTime, 'PickUpLocation' => array('LocationCode' =>$location), 'ReturnLocation' => array('LocationCode' =>$location) ) )//VehRentalCore )//VehAvailRQCore ); //OTA_VehAvailRateRQ $res = $client->__soapCall('GetVehAvailRate', $param); The return is now an Object, which wont display those horrid exclamation marks, to access each value, i used the non literal way, foreach($res->subkey->subsubkey->subsubsubkey->subsubsubsubkey as $result) { echo " "; foreach($result as $value){ $string = $value->subkey->subsubkey->subsubsubkey; echo " "; print_r($value); echo " "; } echo " "; } Hope someone else can get use from it.. Thanks for your help :)
