There are no problem with negative inputs values, as long as it's mean something. As Ankit Saith said in the comment, temperatures can be negative, money too (positive is money I earn, negative the money I lose) and so on. Of course, inputs like distances should not be negative ! Furthermore, generally in deep learning, you normalize your dataset to have inputs with 0 mean and a std of 1. Then you have "small" value around 0 which can be positive or negative !
