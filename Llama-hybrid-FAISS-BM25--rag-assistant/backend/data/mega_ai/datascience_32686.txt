I think what you are looking for is PCA (Principal Component Analysis). In your case, you have to take the first principal component. PCA allows to automate the process of deciding which is the linear combinations of the variables that explains the most of the data. In the picture you've showed, the first component will be roughly the vertical axis of your plot. If you don't know what PCA is, see this magnificient answer on cross-validated.
