There is almost never a good reason to do this! As Kjetil said above, see here. You should be able to get the probability outputs from ‘predict_proba’, then you can just write decisions = (model.predict_proba() >= mythreshold).astype(int) Note as stated that logistic regression itself does not have a threshold. However sklearn does have a “decision function” that implements the threshold directly in the “predict” function, unfortunately. Hence they consider logistic regression a classifier, unfortunately.
