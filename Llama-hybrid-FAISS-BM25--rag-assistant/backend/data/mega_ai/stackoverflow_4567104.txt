Best C# syntax for ignoring an exception

There are some cases we don't care about the Exception and just need to resume. I know it's side-effects and ... Here my question is about the best C# syntax for ignoring an exception , for example: try { // exceptional code } catch { } but this seems a little ugly specially that empty brackets after catch . Is there a more elegant syntax ?
