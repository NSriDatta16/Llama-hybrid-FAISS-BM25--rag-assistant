Modeling and testing for trends in hospital-surveillance (count, event) data

Intro Hi all, I'm working with hospital-based surveillance data. My peers and I are trained (loosely speaking) as frequentists. I'm mindful of the aphorism: Statistics: A subject which most statisticians find difficult but which many physicians are experts on. ... and want to improve through practice. Example Here's a good example. hospitalizations Trend or No Trend? In this particular case, I've been advised to rely on stats::prop.trend.test() , which exploits the sequencing of the observations, in preference to prop.test() . Less power: prop.test() > with(hospitalizations, prop.test(count, pop)) 4-sample test for equality of proportions without continuity correction data: count out of pop X-squared = 7.2, df = 3, p-value = 0.07 alternative hypothesis: two.sided sample estimates: prop 1 prop 2 prop 3 prop 4 0.014716 0.015134 0.011664 0.009649 More power: prop.trend.test() help(prop.trend.test) says: Performs chi-squared test for trend in proportions, i.e., a test asymptotically optimal for local alternatives where the log odds vary in proportion with score . By default, score is chosen as the group numbers. > with(hospitalizations, prop.trend.test(count, pop)) Chi-squared Test for Trend in Proportions data: count out of pop , using scores: 1 2 3 4 X-squared = 6.2, df = 1, p-value = 0.01 Doing it Differently How should I start learning about ways to tackle this question, and related ones, using a different, complementary approach? I'm particularly interested in using this as a jumping-off point into simple Bayesian / MLE techniques. For example, suppose I'm willing to start with a prior based on the first two observations, and then update my belief/model according to the next two. How would I implement that in R? Any recommendations for libraries, whitepapers, chapters, books, articles, posts, etc.? (Stan sounds fun.) Or, suppose I want to generate a maximum-likelihood estimate of a slope and intercept. I don't know where to start. (I'm an R user, and like to learn from code-based examples.) I recognize that this is a wide-open question, and you have other jobs to do. Please allow me to thank you in advance for your time and attention. Comments on this specific example ( prop.trend.test() vs prop.test() ) are also very welcome.
