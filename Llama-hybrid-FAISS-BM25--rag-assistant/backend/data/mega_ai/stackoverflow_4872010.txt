is quirks mode legit?

I was on vacation without access to my good friend Internet Explorer, and I threw together a pretty complete web app. When I got home, I was surprised and encouraged to see that my site was working in IE... until I threw in any sort of valid doctype. I know it isn't best practice to throw browsers into quirks mode, or it wouldn't be called quirks mode, but I guess my question is... what are the practical ramifications of having a 'quirks mode' site? Is it necessary or even worth it to painstakingly slave away to correct the issues of which I am yet unaware, or can I leave it as is, functioning cross browser? Thanks.
