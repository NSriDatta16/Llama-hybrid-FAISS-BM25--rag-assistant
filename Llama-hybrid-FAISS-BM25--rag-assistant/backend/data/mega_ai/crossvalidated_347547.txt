principal component analysis or factor analysis to be used with qualitative data

I want to make a model in which the dependent variable is nutritional levels of children, for this, I calculated $z$ scores like weight for age and height for age . For the independent variables, I need to calculate a female empowerment index which includes questions like: Do you have any take on deciding what to be cooked today? yes or no Are you beaten by your husband? yes or no and so on... I want to ask is it possible to use PCA in this and combine $10$ or more questions in a single index and then regress on $z$ scores already calculated?
