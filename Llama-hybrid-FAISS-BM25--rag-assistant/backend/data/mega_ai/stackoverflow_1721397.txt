If you're using Python, you can use a module specifically built for timing things. It's called Timeit. Here are a couple of references I found (just Googled it): Dive Into Python: Using the Timeit Module Python Documentation: Timeit Module And here's some example code to get you started quickly: import timeit t = timeit.Timer("for i in range(100): pass", "") # Timeit will run the statement 1,000,000 times by default, and return the time it took for all the runs together (it doesn't try to average them out or anything). t.timeit() 2.9035916423318398 # This is the result. Don't forget (like I did in an earlier edit) that this is the result of running the code 1,000,000 times!
