DateTimePicker-like Input Control

I'm not very experienced with .NET development, so forgive me if I've missed something obvious. My scenario is quite simple: my program is going to deal with both the Imperial and Metric systems of measurement. I need an input control that will be able to elegantly house {feet, inches} and {meters, centimeters} (only one set at a time). From what I've seen in VC#'s Control Toolbox (Winforms .NETF 3.5), I'm looking for a mix of MaskedTextBox , NumericUpDown , and DateTimePicker . Namely: MaskedTextBox 's ability of filtering user input NumericUpDown 's ability of [in/de]crementing the user-selected [sub-]unit of measurement DateTimePicker 's ability of "breaking apart" information in a single control. I'm specifically interested in breaking apart say feet and inches while still displaying them on the same control I should also point out that I'm most interested in replicating DateTimePicker 's ability to keep separate pieces of input in a single control. I would greatly appreciate your thoughts as to what base control I should sub-class in order to achieve this functionality. Cheers!
