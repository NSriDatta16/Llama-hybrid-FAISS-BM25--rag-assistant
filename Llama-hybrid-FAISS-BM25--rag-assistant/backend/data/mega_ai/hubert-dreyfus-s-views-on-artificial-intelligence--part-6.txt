al intelligence, a gap that has since been filled by cognitive science, psychology and artificial neural networks. Another problem was that Dreyfus claimed (or seemed to claim) that AI would never be able to capture the human ability to understand context, situation or purpose in the form of rules. But (as Peter Norvig and Stuart Russell would later explain), an argument of this form cannot be won: just because one cannot imagine formal rules that govern human intelligence and expertise, this does not mean that no such rules exist. They quote Alan Turing's answer to all arguments similar to Dreyfus's:"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'" In 1965, Dreyfus did not imagine that such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did not imagine that such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete. Both were wrong. A more serious issue was the impression that Dreyfus' critique was incorrigibly hostile. McCorduck wrote, "His derisiveness has been so provoking that he has estranged anyone he might have enlightened. And that's a pity." Daniel Crevier stated that "time has proven the accuracy and perceptiveness of some of Dreyfus's comments. Had he formulated them less aggressively, constructive actions they suggested might have been taken much earlier." Decades later, Dreyfus wrote that the responses to his critique has most often been based on a very partial and shallow understanding of it. However, progress has been made towards addressing his criticisms and Dreyfus has accepted that. Dreyfus's final critique of Heideggerian AI In 2007, Dreyfus published a paper titled "Why Heideggerian AI Failed and How Fixing it Would Require Making It More Heideggerian", in which he reassesses the contemporary status of AI. While acknowledging efforts at reorienting artificial intelligence research beyond "Good Old Fashioned AI" (GOFAI) towards "Heideggerian AI", he offers new criticisms on the shortcomings of existing programs. In particular, Dreyfus considers Brooks's "behavior-based robots" and Phil Agre and David Chapman's "Pengi" as recent examples of Heideggerian AI. He rejects both programs as having neglected the dimension of learning new relevance in a worldly context. A more trivial version of this problem has also been referred to as the "frame problem". On the one hand, Dreyfus criticizes Rodney Brooks's robots for "respond[ing] only to *fixed features* of the environment", and therefore merely "converting stimulus input into reflex responses". It contrasts with the ability to comprehend and effectively learn the world as a context of practical significance, or "what-for", to human intelligence, as opposed to merely a totality of things. This echoes Heidegger's comparison between the "world-poor" quality of animals versus human Dasein's capacity of "world-making" in The Principle of Reason. On the other, Pengi also fails to meet Dreyfus's criterion of a genuinely Heideggerian AI. While Dreyfus praises Agre's understanding of "readiness-to-hand" as functions rather than entities, the program nevertheless involves "no skill [...] and no learning", but instead deterministically triggers responses that are evaluated based on set benchmark. The remark coincides with Dreyfus's commentary on Deep Blue's victory against Garry Kasparov, which noted that the machine is only responding to the "isolated domain" of chess, as opposed to the full range of possibilities of the "rest of the human life". While some may argue that recent developments in artificial general intelligence (AGI) may have invalidated Dreyfus's objection, Fjelland (2020) argued that a disembodied AI could never handle "causal questions" that depend on a model of reality.
