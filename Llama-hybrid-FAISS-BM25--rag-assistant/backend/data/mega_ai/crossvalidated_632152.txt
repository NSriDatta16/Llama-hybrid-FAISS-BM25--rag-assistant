This is a problematic way to start. This is not a setting for forced-choice classification but rather for estimating tendencies , i.e., probabilities (risk). And the accuracy measures you mentioned are problematic . Use a direct probability model, which may be built upon relative log odds (logistic model) or relative risk (other models, usually fit less well). Quantities such as odds ratios are building blocks to allow one to estimate overall absolute risk. Though logistic regression is often the best solution (especially if you use modern versions of it that donâ€™t make linearity assumptions) but there are machine learning algorithms for estimating probabilities (but not through odds/risk ratios).
