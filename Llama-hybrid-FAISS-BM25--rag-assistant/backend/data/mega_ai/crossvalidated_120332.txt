You could make a directed graph with arrows indicating what's significantly better than what. That shows every relationship without forcing an ordering. However, you could still say, whoever gets most outgoing arrows is probably the best. Also, it you get a "rock-paper-scissors" situation as discussed in the blog post you link to, then I would say your criterion for ranking is not very useful for interpreting the results. In the example of the dice where each die is likely to beat the next in a circular rock-paper-scissors way, you need to figure out what's important: it is important to maximize the probability of getting the highest of all dice? is it important to minimize the probability of having the lowest? to optimize the overall average ranking? these criteria should produce non-equivocal rankings. Of course, it doesn't mean it's easy to figure out where there is statistical significance once you change the criterion...
