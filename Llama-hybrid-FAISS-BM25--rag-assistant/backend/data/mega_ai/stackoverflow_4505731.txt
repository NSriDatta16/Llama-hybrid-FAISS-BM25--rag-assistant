I've decided to convert one of the more complex stateful plugins to use the jQuery widget factory. There was a bit of a learning curve, I believe the benefits justified the work. While I'm not leveraging theme roller support, here are some of the other benefits I found useful: state management implied this.each() clean callback mechanism simple API for setting and overriding options visually clear distinction between public and private methods Obviously, you can achieve all of these with the traditional plugin pattern. But the code appears much cleaner to my eye and will be much easier to maintain in the longer term. Many thanks to Eric Hynds and his MuliSelect Widget for providing source code for me to study and learn how to use the Widget Factory.
