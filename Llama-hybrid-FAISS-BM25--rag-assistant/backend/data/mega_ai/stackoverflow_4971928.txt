Embedding Python into C++ application

Context: An ongoing problem we have been facing is unit testing our market data applications. These applications sit and observe data being retrieved from feeds and does something. Some critical events which are hard to trigger rarely occur and it is are difficult for the Testers to verify our applications perform correctly under all situations, hence we have to rely on unit tests. These systems generally work by issuing callbacks (into our application) when an event has occurred, then our task to deal with this. Solution I envision: Is it possible to embed Python, or extend (not 100% clear on this), so that a tester could fire up a Python REPL and issue function calls that are akin to callbacks which are then handled by our C++ classes. Some form of dynamic manipulation of our objects at runtime.
