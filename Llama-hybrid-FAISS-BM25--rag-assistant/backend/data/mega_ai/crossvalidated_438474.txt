should I re-initialize my optimizer and my scheduler before I try to fine tune my neural network on the different dataset?

I am doing NLP, and I have this block of Transformer body that was already trained on dataset A. Now I am interested in fine tuning this same Transformer on a new dataset B. In my Python code, should I re-initialize my optimizer and my scheduler before I try to fine tune my neural network on the different dataset? Thank you,
