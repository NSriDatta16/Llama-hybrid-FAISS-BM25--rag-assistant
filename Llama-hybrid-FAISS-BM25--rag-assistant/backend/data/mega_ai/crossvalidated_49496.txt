Marginal posterior and prior are similar (and flat!)

I designed a Bayesian model and sampled the posterior using a MCMC algorithm. My problem is that the posterior marginal distribution of a given latent intermediate variable appears to be uniform just as the prior I assigned to it. In practice this variable is supposed to have a substential importance on the model. Moreover, the posteriors over the other variables sound in accordance with intuition and essentially monomodal. I am a bit confused with that situation. How to interpret this result? Have I to change my model? Considering that the problematic variable is an auxiliary variable that is not interpreted after inference, can I satisfied myself from these results, or can it be interpret as a failure of the modelisation ?
