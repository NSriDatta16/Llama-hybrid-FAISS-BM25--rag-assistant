Game Design and Architecture Advice for Text Adventures

I am trying to create an old-school Text Adventure Game. I'm a bit stuck on creating the World Map and rooms. Should the room descriptions be part of the source code or should it be separated out? I was thinking of placing all such descriptions and room properties in a MySQL database and then have code to organize the logic of each room; putting each room description in with the actual source code seems a bit untidy. Is this the preferred method of organising Descriptions in an adventure game? I was also thinking that this might be preferable since I could then query the database to find common properties about the data. Any comments would be appreciated.
