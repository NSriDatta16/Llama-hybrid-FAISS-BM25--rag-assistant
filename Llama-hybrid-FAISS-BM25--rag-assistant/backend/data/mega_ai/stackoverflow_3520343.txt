A binary search would certainly be the "standard" approach - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm . Speed is O(log(N)) as opposed to linear. In certain specialised cases you can do better than O(log(N)). But unless you are dealing with truly gigantic array sizes and satisfy these special cases then your binary search is really the fastest approach.
