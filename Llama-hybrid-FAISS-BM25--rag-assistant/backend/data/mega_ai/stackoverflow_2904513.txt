At least if I understand your question correctly, you have a little bit of a problem. You basically need to structure your headers so the inclusions form a directed acyclic graph (emphasis on acyclic ). What you may have to do is break your "renderengine.h" into two pieces, one of which just contains forward declarations, and the other of which contains the rest of your current contents. You'll then include that "forward declarations" header into "rmodel.h", and include "rmodel.h" into "renderengine.h". While there are times that this is unavoidable, such a circular dependency often points to a problem with how you've organized your modules. It's entirely possible that what you currently have as renderengine.h and rmodule.h should be a single header, or perhaps multiple headers but broken along different lines.
