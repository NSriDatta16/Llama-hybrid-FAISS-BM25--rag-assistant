Adjusting Binary Logistic Formula in SPSS

I am running a binary logistic regression in SPSS, to test the effect of e.g. TV advertisements on the probability of a consumer to buy a product. My problem is that with the formula of binary logistic regression: P=1/(1+e^(-(a+b*Adv)) ) the maximum probability will be equal to 100%. However,even if I increase the number of advertisements by 1000, it is not sensible to assume that the probability to purchase will be 100%. So if I draw the graph of the logistic regression with the coefficients from the Binary Logistic Regression, at some point the probability reaches 100%, which is never the case in a real life setting. How can I control for that? Is there a way to change the SPSS binary logistic regression to have a maximum probability of e.g. 20%?
