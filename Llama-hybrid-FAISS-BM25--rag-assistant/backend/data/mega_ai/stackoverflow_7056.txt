Mark's answer is the simpler, more elegant solution. Why build a complex program with inter-thread communication if it's not necessary? Spawn 4 threads. Each thread calculates size-of-file/4 to determine it's start point (and stop point). Each thread can then work entirely independently. The only reason to add a special thread to handle reading is if you expect some lines to take a very long time to process and you expect that these lines are clustered in a single part of the file. Adding inter-thread communication when you don't need it is a very bad idea . You greatly increase the chance of introducing an unexpected bottleneck and/or synchronization bugs.
