The File instance names a file, and is distinct from the actual file storage itself. If you serialize this to the server, the server may be able to create the file locally, although this has no relation to the fact that it was serialized from the client, and will behave exactly as if you called new File('D://resume.doc') on the server. Either way, it will be a local copy of the file on the server that you open, not the copy on the client. To open a client's file on the server, you will either need to use a networked file system (e.g. Windows Shares/Samba) or you have the client send the contents of the file to the server. Commons FileUpload , which provides robust file upload functionality for web applications, could be useful here.
