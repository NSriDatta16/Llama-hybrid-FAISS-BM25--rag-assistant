Strictly speaking, the question "to decide which of those models is the 'correct' one" makes no sense in a Bayesian analysis. In the Bayesian framework, what you do is to compare the models with respect to each other . Bayesian inference always gives you a relative comparison of competing models. There is a lot of information on chapter 7 of O'Hagan and Forster nice book . And yes, this kind of analysis will rely on the full posteriors.
