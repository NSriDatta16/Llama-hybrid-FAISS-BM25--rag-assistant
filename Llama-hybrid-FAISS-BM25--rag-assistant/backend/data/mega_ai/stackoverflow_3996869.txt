First of all, there is a bug on Facebook event timezone management. If you check an Event on the API and on Facebook, you can see different dates. The right date on the API and the wrong date on Facebook, because you add the event by the API. If you created the Event on Facebook, the API will show the wrong date. If you try any API event call you can see the format used: "end_time": "2010-03-15T00:30:00+0000" As you can notice, the date/time format is ISO 8601 and you should use this but, probably, epoch timestamp should work. By looking at the timezone (UTC, +0000) you can guest that you should convert your local date to UTC (+0000) but this is the problem. The date must be converted to PST/PDT timezone, but keeping the UTC timezone designator (+0000) as Mike Lambert found http://bugs.developers.facebook.net/show_bug.cgi?id=12558 I guess at this point the API is wrong, but predictably wrong, and fixing it would just break other developers. So you could argue it's a documentation bug: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/api/event It should really say these ISO-formatted UTC times should all be converted to PST/PDT to retrieve the time of the event as entered by the user. (Which is not the UTC/GMT time the event will actually occur.)
