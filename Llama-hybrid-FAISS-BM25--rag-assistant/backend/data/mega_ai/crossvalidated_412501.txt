How to infer state space parameters from an LSTM model?

I'm attempting to create a state-space model by training my time series data with an LSTM. I'm hoping the LSTM will capture non-linear phenomenon as opposed to a linear state-space model. The only problem is that while a state-space model has interpretative parameters like the state and observation matrix, an LSTM doesn't have that. Does anyone know how to get these types of matrices from an LSTM, whether through Monte Carlo sampling or other means?
