jQuery select descendants, including the parent

Consider the following HTML: I should be changed red I should not be changed red. I should be changed red. Given a DOM element obj and an expression, how do I go about selecting any children and possibly obj ? I'm looking for something similar to "select descendants" but also including the parent, if it matches the expression. var obj = $("#obj")[0]; //wrong, may include siblings of 'obj' $(".foo", $(obj).parent()).css("color", "red"); //wrong -- excludes 'obj' $(".foo", obj).css("color", "red"); //correct way, but it's annoying var matches = $(".foo", obj); if ($(obj).is(".foo")) matches = matches.add(obj); matches.css("color", "red"); Is there a more elegant solution to this?
