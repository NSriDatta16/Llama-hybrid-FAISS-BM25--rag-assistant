While I don't have enough expertise to advise you on selection of the best similarity measure , I've seen a number of them in various papers. The following collection of research papers hopefully will be useful to you in determining the optimal measure for your research. Please note that I intentionally included papers, using both frequentist and Bayesian approaches to hierarchical classification, including class information, for the sake of more comprehensive coverage. Frequentist approach: Semantic similarity based on corpus statistics and lexical taxonomy Canâ€™t see the forest for the leaves: Similarity and distance measures for hierarchical taxonomies with a patent classification example (also see additional results and data ) Learning hierarchical similarity metrics A new similarity measure for taxonomy based on edge counting Hierarchical classification of real life documents Hierarchical document classification using automatically generated hierarchy Split-Order distance for clustering and classification hierarchies A hierarchical k-NN classifier for textual data Bayesian approach: Improving classification when a class hierarchy is available using a hierarchy-based prior Bayesian aggregation for hierarchical genre classification Hierarchical classification for multiple, distributed web databases
