record the user interaction: log4j?

I need your suggestions. I have a Java application and i would like to record the way that the users use my application. I wonder what the most frequently used buttons are. Calculate the average length of introduction of a new patient in the application. Etc. In your opinion what is the best and simpler way to do that? Is it using Log4j? Thank you for your collaboration. Best regards. Daniel
