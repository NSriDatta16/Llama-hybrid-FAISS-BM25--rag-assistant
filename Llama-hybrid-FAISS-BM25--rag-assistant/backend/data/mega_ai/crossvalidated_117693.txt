How to validate a lognormal random walk for time series data

I am currently working on a project where I need to simulate the prices of a set of $D$ substitutable commodities over time. I was hoping to do this using the following $D$-dimensional lognormal random walk model: $$\ln(p_{t}) = \ln(p_{t-1}) + \varepsilon_t, $$ where $p_{t}$ is a $D\times 1$ vector containing the prices of all commodities at time $t$, and $\varepsilon_t$ is a $D$-dimensional Gaussian random variable with mean $\mu \in \mathbb{R}^D$ and covariance $\Sigma \in \mathbb{R}^{D \times D}$. Given $T$ data points on the prices, $(p_{t})_{t=1}^T$, I can fit this model by constructing MLE estimates for the parameters, $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\Sigma}$. My question is: what is the right way to validate" my model in such a case? Is there an interpretable metric" to assess the predictive capacity of the random walk?
