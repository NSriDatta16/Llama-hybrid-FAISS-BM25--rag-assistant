Mixed model for repeated measures with different timepoints and intervals

is there a way to design a mixed model for uneven number of measurements per subject and (more importantly) with uneven time intervals between measurements which are taken at different time points (the dataset contains observations during several years)? I have data about pig reproductive traits. The goal is to determine if a particular mutation (snp) affects the traits. Sample data: pig_id measurement(order) breed year snp age(days) y 1 1 A 2020 AA 250 330 1 2 A 2020 AA 290 290 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... 1 80 A 2021 AA 600 320 2 1 B 2016 BB 330 400 2 2 B 2016 BB 350 385 2 3 B 2017 BB 365 360 The biggest problem I see is that measurement 1 for pig 1 is a completely different time point (date) than measurement 1 for pig 2. Using SAS, I wanted to try something like this: proc mixed data=have; class pig_id breed year snp measurement; model y = age interval breed year snp measurement; repeated measurement / subject=pig_id(snp) type=SP(POW); run; where interval would mean number of days from the last measurement. But I am not sure if it can fix the problem above. I also considered giving every unique date of observation its "serial number" (so instead of measurement_order I would use a time point from 1 to n), but then I end up having thousands of levels for fixed effect of time... So is there a solution within these mixed models, or is my only chance to dig into unevenly spaced time series?
