Your program does draw an ellipse when you drag the mouse down and to the right. It's dragging up and/or left that does not work, because Graphics.drawOval does not work with a negative width or height. Try adding a method like this: private Shape createEllipse() { Ellipse2D e = new Ellipse2D.Double(); e.setFrameFromDiagonal(start, end); return e; } Then call it from draw and paintComponent like this: if(selected=="elipse") { g2.draw(createEllipse()); } Also you probably do not need the call to draw() at the end of actionPerformed . If you switch between line and ellipse mode it will draw an ellipse with the same coordinates as the most recent line or vice-versa. And one coding style issue: Using string literals for selected is confusing (although it does work.) I would define an enum instead.
