What would keep a spammer from simply giving an entirely correct user agent string? I think this is fairly pointless. You would have to at least compare IP ranges (or their name servers) as well in order to get reliable results. This is possible for Google: Google Webmaster Central: How to verify Googlebot but even if you test for Google and Bing this way, a spambot can enter your site simply by giving a browser user-agent. Therefore, it is ultimately impossible to detect a spam-bot. They are a reality, and there is no good way to keep them out from a web site.
