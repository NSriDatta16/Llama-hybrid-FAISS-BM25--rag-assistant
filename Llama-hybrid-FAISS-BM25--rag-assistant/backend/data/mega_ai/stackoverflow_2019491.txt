Get SOAP XML before __soapCall?

Is it possible to get the XML generated by SOAP Client before sending it to webservice? I need this because response from webservice if one of parameters is really wrong I get errors like Server was unable to read request. ---> There is an error in XML document (2, 408). ---> Input string was not in a correct format. This typically includes firing up tcpmon or some other tcp watcher utility, capturing the webservice call, copy and paste xml to text editor and go to column 408 to see what's the problem. I'd really like to simplify this process by getting the XML before sending it.
