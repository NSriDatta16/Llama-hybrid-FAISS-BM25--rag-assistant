Expectation subscripts before and after the brackets

In Bishop's "Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning", Eq.(10.107) contains a term which reads $E_\alpha[\ln q(\mathbf w)]_\mathbf w$ . Why does he use different positions for $\alpha$ and $\mathbf w$ ? I'm familiar with the subscripts before the brackets, like $E_\alpha[\ln p(\alpha)]$ , which means "taking the expectation using $p(\alpha)$ ", but I haven't seen a subscript after the brackets.
