I think jspcal had the best answer so far. The only modification I made to his code was to use a do-while loop instead, so it would not skip the element where first loop breaks. $arr = array(1,2,3,4); // Prints 1 2 foreach($arr as $v) { if ($v == 3) { break; } echo "$v "; } // Prints 3 4 do { echo "$v "; } while( list($k, $v) = each($arr) );
