Preprocessing and dropout in Autoencoders?

I am working with autoencoders and have few confusions, I am trying different autoencoders like : fully_connected autoencoder convolutional autoencoder denoising autoencoder I have two dataset , One is numerical dataset which have float and int values , Second is text dataset which have text and date values : Numerical dataset looks like: date , id , check_in , check_out , coke_per , permanent_values , temp 13/9/2017 142453390001 134.2 43.1 13 87 21 14/9/2017 142453390005 132.2 46.1 19 32 41 15/9/2017 142453390002 120.2 42.1 33 99 54 16/9/2017 142453390004 100.2 41.1 17 39 89 Any my text dataset looks like : data text 13/9/2017 i totally understand this conversation about farmer market and the organic products, a nice conversation ’cause prices are cheaper than traditional 14/9/2017 The conversation was really great. But I think I need much more practice. I need to improve my listening a lot. Now I’m very worried because I thought that I’d understand more. Although, I understood but I had to repeat and repeat. See you!!! So my questions are: Should i normalize my numerical data values before feeding to any type of autoencoder? if they are int and float values still i have to normalize? Which activation function should i use in autoencoder? Some article and research paper says , "sigmoid" and some says "relu" ? Should i use dropout in each layer ? like if my artichare for autoencoder looks like encoder (1000 --> 500 -- > 256 ----> 128 ) --> decoder (128 --> 256 --> 500--> 784) something like this? encoder(dropout(1000,500) --> dropout( 500,256) --> dropout (256,128) )----> decoder(dropout(128,256),dropout(256,500),dropout(500,784)) For text dataset , If i am using word2vec or any embedding to convert text into vector then i would have float values for each word , should i normalize that data too ? text ( Hello How are you ) -- > word2vec(text) ----> ([1854.92002 , 54112.89774 ,5432.9923 ,5323.98393]) should i normalize this values or directly use in autoencoder ?
