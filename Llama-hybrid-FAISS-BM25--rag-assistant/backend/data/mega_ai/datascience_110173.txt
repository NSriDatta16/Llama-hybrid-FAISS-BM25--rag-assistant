How do I evaluate if my data represent the target variable before training a machine learning algorithm?

I have a dataset of points cloud where each point in the point cloud has a variable. I am trying to relate the local geometry features to that point variable by using FPFH , This means I am generating my own features from the dataset by first using an area of n-points to compute normal-vector estimations and from x normal vector estimations to compute the FPFH. However, the numbers x and n are arbitrary and other combinations might describe the target variable better. So I wanted to know if there was a method to evaluate how good a given x and n value are at describing the target variable. I considered the correlation between the features (n,x) and the target variable but I read that this assumes linear combination redundancy . I am using scikit-learn. So basically I have features X(x,n) and a target variable Y. Which x and n, in the feature space X(x,n), describes the target variable, Y, best. I want to do it before the training because when I try to train it with my random forest regressor it takes 3-4 hours and I want to test for more combinations.
