Canvas works on Opera, Chrome, Safari, Firefox, IE6-8 (with excanvas.js, as @philfreo mentioned). Processing.js , in particular, does work on IE, as is stated on the Processing.js homepage: Processing.js runs in FireFox, Safari, Opera, Chrome and will also work with Internet Explorer, using Explorer Canvas. There are a few tricks with IE: You need to pay special attention when you create a Canvas dynamically, you can't attach events to it (directly--you can attach to a container div), you can't get pixel info from the canvas, and radial gradients aren't supported. Oh, and it's a lot slower on IE, of course. I don't think any of those caveats will apply to you when you're working in processing.js, except of course for the slowness of excanvas.js emulating the canvas.
