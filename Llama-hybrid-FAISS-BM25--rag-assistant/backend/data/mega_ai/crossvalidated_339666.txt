You have two main options here: As you said, create some numeric features out of the text description and merge it with the rest of the numeric data. The features created out of the text description can be either the document-term matrix (with tf-idf or not), can be SVD components or even averaged word-vectors (look for word2vec etc). You can build two separate classifiers (one using text data only and one using numeric only) and then combine their output using some meta-modelling.
