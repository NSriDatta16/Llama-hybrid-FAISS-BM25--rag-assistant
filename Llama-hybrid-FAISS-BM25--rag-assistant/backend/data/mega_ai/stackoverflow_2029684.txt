Not all browsers / softwares that can see web pages will send a Referer to your server. Some sites will make a browser "fingerprint", usually hashed, which might be Referer, User-Agent and a couple of other headers strung together to make a uniquie identifier for that user and thus restrict access as you describe. Of course, I may have completely missed the point of your post!
