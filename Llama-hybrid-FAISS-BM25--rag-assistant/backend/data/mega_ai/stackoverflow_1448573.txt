Large data hierarchy - How to realize?

I am still trying to develop a small medicine iPhone app. :-] In the last few days I've structured all the data that should be displayed in a table. After reading books and watching a lot of tutorials I've built a couple of simple Table View applications. These apps always had a predefined depth of data. I am not sure if you understand what I mean by that, so please open the following links to compare my graphics: You can find the graphics here! File hierarchie1.png shows the normal data hierarchy I already used in my apps. My data is structered like in the file hierarchie2.png . Unfortunately I am not very experienced with iPhone development. My idea is to create for every section of the tree an own view controller. EintragA ViewController manages 1 - 2 - 3 Eintrag1 ViewController manages 1.1 Eintrag11 ViewController manages 1.1.1 - 1.1.2 and so on... I hope you can get what I mean. What I would like to know is if my idea is the right approach to realize that kind of data? Or is there another and better way to do it?
