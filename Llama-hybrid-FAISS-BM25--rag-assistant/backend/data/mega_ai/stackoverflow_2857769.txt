The solution is very simple (and you don't even need to compile your IronRuby code to an assembly). IronRuby interpreter (ir.exe) supports a command line switch -X:PrivateBinding (this is case sensitive, pay attention). When the interpreter is running in the private binding mode, you can call internal and even private members of .NET classes. Therefore, to test your .NET class internal members, run your test code as follows (assuming the test code is in a file named "test_my_code.rb"): ir -X:PrivateBinding test_my_code.rb
