ASP.NET with NoSQL

Had gone through some NoSQL concepts and MongoDB & CouchDB articles. It seems they will give more scope to build scalable web applications. But need some clarity whether they will support the following features as SQL Server does? Whether it supports database mirroring? Is there any size limitation of NoSQL database? Is it better to ignore and go with NoSQL for social networking sites? What are alternatives to run jobs on NoSQL like Sql Agent Jobs?
