HTTP Post sent from Java

Worldpay (The payment processor from RBS) sends a HTTP Post to my website once a payment is accepted. Problem is - the Post isnt getting through and my server responds with one of the following 3 HTTP error's: HTTP 408 (Timeout) HTTP 405 (Not allowed) Invalid status line >NULL Now when i Post something to the url from my test php script this works fine which leads me to believe the issue could be with the fact that the Post from them is created by Java: POST /worldpay_success.html HTTP/1.0 Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded; charset=UTF-8 Host: www.mysite.com Content-Length: 116 User-Agent: WJHRO/1.0 (WorldPay Java HTTP Request Object) authAmountString=%26%23163%3B1.99&_SP.charEnc=UTF-8&desc=Test.....etc Does anyone have any experience with this? After speaking to Worldpay they say my server is responding with a 408 Timeout after 0.1 seconds so it doesnt seem to be properly timeing out... Any help apreciated Paul
