Not sure what you are trying to do exactly? You need to map the class as an Entity in order to be able to select instances of it. Either, do not include the class, the native SQL query will an Object[] of the data, which you can map in your own code to your class. Or map it as an Entity excepting the data that you are returning. The @Table will not be relevant as you are mapping the object to the query results. This should not cause any errors though, unless you are auto creating table or using integrity checker. Or map the objects to the table correctly. Then use a fetch join, or batch fetch to optimize your retrieval if required.
