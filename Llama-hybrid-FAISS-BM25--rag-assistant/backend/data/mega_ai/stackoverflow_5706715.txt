Ekit problem with pasting richtext copied from Ekit to other richtext

Currently I am trying to find cause of the behavior that richtext from Ekit (JTextPane derivativie) cannot be pasted into other richtext editor like one in Thunderbird, Gmail, MS Word. Tested, it doesn't work on Windows XP, Windows 7, Ubuntu. Copying from Ekit to plain text editors works. Reference: Ekit site I have dump of clipboard from Ekit: Version:0.9 StartHTML:-1 EndHTML:-1 StartFragment:0000000111 EndFragment:0000000197 o ne line s econd line and from Thunderbird for comparison: Version:0.9 StartHTML:00000120 EndHTML:00000218 StartFragment:00000154 EndFragment:00000182 SourceURL:about:blank sad nak dbnask Any tips where I should make changes or why it is not working? Is position of StartFragment tag a problem or StartHTML and EndHTML values are? Maybe both?
