Generalized Linear Mixed Effects

When to use multivariate logistic regression versus generalized linear mixed-effects models? What is the difference between the two? Edit (in response to comments): I was hoping to see multivariate as more than one covariate. My problemset is analysis for a longitudinal prospective cohort study where im measuring vitamin K intake in relation to incidence of calcification. vitamin K intake is primarily bein assessed by food questionnaires but im also looking at plasma vitamin K levels. the exposure variable and the outcome variable are ordinal/categorical. on the other hand, outcome also has more than two categories. i will be using a multivariate mixed model. considering i know my covariates, it should be suffice to use a mixed regression model? Thank you .
