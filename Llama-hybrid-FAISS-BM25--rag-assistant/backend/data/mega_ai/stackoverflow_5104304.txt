Naive Bayes Implementation and infering data from the class labels

Does anybody have any pointers to Naive Bayes Classifier Implementation preferably in C. I have 5 dimensional binary dataset. The class labels are also binary. I used Naive Bayes Classifier in Matlab with good results. However, is there any machine learning algorithm and its implementation which allows me to infer data from the class labels? Here in this case I want five dimensional binary data inferred from a binary class label. A sample of data is [1 1 0 1 0] and class is 0.
