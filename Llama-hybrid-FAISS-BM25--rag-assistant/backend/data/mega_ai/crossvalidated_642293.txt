Reinforcement learning totally depends on four parameters (agent, environment, reward, and actions). Suppose we get the data with states as inputs and actions as labels. and we apply deep learning classifier to classify each action Sometimes, there might be a situation where agents work on states that cannot be classified using a deep learning-based approach. RL involves exploration to discover optimal policies. A classifier may not have the ability to explore new strategies beyond what is present in the training dataset. So whatever you said is possible, but there are several important considerations and potential challenges.
