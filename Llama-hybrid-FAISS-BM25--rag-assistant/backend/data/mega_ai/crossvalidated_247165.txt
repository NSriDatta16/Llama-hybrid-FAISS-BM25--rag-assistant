What are traditional models used in statistics for prediction?

I'm a beginning undergraduate researcher in data science. My background is in computer science and my mathematical background is weak. Currently, I'm doing research on predictive models in criminal forecasting using modern machine learning techniques like boosting, naive bayes, SVM, logistic regression and cluster analysis. While these algorithms are very cool and interesting, I'm curious to know what the majority of people in other fields use. What are some "traditional" techniques that are used that may not perform as well as the aforementioned techniques above?
