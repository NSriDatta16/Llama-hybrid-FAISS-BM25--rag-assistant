Use the STL adapter std::stack . Why? Because the code you don't have to write is the fastest way to completion of your task. stack is well-tested, and likely to not need any attention from you. Why not? Because there are some special-purpose requirements needed by your code, undocumented here. By default stack uses a deque double-ended queue, but it merely requires the underlying container to support "Back Insertion Sequence", also known as .push_back . typedef std::stack > myStackOfTypes;
