Can MDS coordinates be used as variables in further analyses?

I have calculated an NMDS from vegetation community data taken from two habitat types using the metaMDS() function in vegan . My goal is to see if habitat type helps explain community composition and it was suggested to me that I could use the site scores of the NMDS axes as response variables in a linear model with habitat type as an explanatory variable. I have also been told to NEVER do this. It is a bit unclear to me why it is not appropriate however. I know that it is relatively common to include PCA scores/projection as variables in linear models, but I am told that the “arbitrary” nature of NMDS axes maxes this inappropriate and meaningless. An analogy was made to coordinate systems in that it would not make sense to use Northing data without Easting data, but I find this confusing considering that 1 dimensional distances are commonly used as explanatory variables. I would appreciate any help in distinguishing why it is okay to use principal components as variables, but not NMDS axes.
