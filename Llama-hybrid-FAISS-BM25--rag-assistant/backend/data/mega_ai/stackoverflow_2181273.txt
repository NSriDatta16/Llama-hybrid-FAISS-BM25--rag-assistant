MySQL query involving cross join, uniqueness, etc

Thankfully, I haven't had to work with particularly complex SQL queries before. Here's my goal. I have the table hams , which I would like to cross-join with the table eggs - that is, get all ham-egg combinations... to an extent. The eggs table also has an attribute how_cooked , which is defined as ENUM('over-easy','scrambled','poached') . I would like a resultset listing every possible combination of ham and egg-cooking method, along with a sample egg cooked that way. (I don't care which egg in particular.) So if 3 hams with id of 1, 2, and 3, and 3 eggs of each cooking method, my resultset should look something like this: +---------+-----------------+---------+ | hams.id | eggs.how_cooked | eggs.id | +---------+-----------------+---------+ | 1 | over-easy | 1 | | 1 | scrambled | 4 | | 1 | poached | 7 | | 2 | over-easy | 1 | | 2 | scrambled | 4 | | 2 | poached | 7 | | 3 | over-easy | 1 | | 3 | scrambled | 4 | | 3 | poached | 7 | +---------+-----------------+---------+ I'm sure I could hack together some solution with loads of subqueries here and there, but is there any elegant way to do this is MySQL?
