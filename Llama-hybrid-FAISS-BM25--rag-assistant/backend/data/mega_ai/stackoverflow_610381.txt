It's all possible (we had the same situation some years ago). How hard or easy it'll be depends on your IDE (refactoring, merging, organizing new project) and you build tool (deploying). We used IDEA as IDE and Ant as build tool and it wasn't too hard. One sunday (nobody working+committing), 2 people on one computer. I'm not sure what you mean by "deploy only some of the packages in a jar" I think you will need all of them at runtime, won't you? As I understood they depend on each other.
