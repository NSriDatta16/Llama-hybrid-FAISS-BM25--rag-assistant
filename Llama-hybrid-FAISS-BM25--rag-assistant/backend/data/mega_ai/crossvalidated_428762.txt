Determining Link for GLM

I am having a great deal of difficulty understanding how to use the Generalized linear model for my data set. The response variable of interest is hatch success of sea turtles, which is a %. The explanatory variables are environmental variables pertaining to the nest environment (above ground vegetative cover, average daily temperature of nest, organic content of the nest soil, and distance to the mean high tide line at excavation). I was attempting to use a mixed effects linear model, but gave up the pursuit because the distribution of my response variable was non-normal, hence why I am attempting to use a generalized linear model. My questions are: should I attempt to use a mixed effects Generalized linear model? or Generalized linear model? which link function should I use? I know this depends on my distribution, which looks exponential (increasing). what is the difference between variables with fixed effects and variables with random effects?
