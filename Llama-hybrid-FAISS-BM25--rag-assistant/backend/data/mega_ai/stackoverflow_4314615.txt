Magento - Not able to display tier pricing in product view

I have a different price set for products based on customer group. I want to show both price's to the customer in case both of them apply in product list, view, related and upsell products. I turned on template path hints to verify that prices for all views are being rendered from the same template file, which is as follows: /app/design/frontend/default/my_theme/template/catalog/product I can see tier pricing correctly in product list, related and upsell products, but NOT for product view. After debugging for a while I have narrowed down the problematic part of catalog/product/price.phtml file as follows: helper('core'); $_weeeHelper = $this->helper('weee'); $_taxHelper = $this->helper('tax'); $_product = $this->getProduct(); $_id = $_product->getId(); echo 'Product Id: ' . $_id; $_weeeSeparator = ''; $_simplePricesTax = ($_taxHelper->displayPriceIncludingTax() || $_taxHelper->displayBothPrices()); echo 'Simple Price Tax: ' . $_simplePricesTax; $_minimalPriceValue = $_product->getMinimalPrice(); echo 'Minimal Price Value: ' . $_minimalPriceValue; //$_minimalPriceValue = 41; $_minimalPrice = $_taxHelper->getPrice($_product, $_minimalPriceValue, $_simplePricesTax); echo 'Minimal Price: ' . $_minimalPrice; //$_minimalPrice = 41; ?> I have echoed all prices fetched from models above, and only in case of product view page the $_product->getMinimalPrice() above does not return anything, while it appears correctly on list, related and upsell products. I cannot think of any reason for this. There are a few lines different in catalog.xml but I don't think they have anything to do with this. Besides, there are a couple of commented lines in the above code, where I have hard-coded the minimalPrice and minimalPriceValue variables. After doing that the price starts appearing in product view also. The Product id for all views including product view is also appearing correctly, so the product IS loaded at that time. We are using a custom template, and I see that in default we are not having this problem. I am using Magento 1.4.1.1
