Just use the convenience method openContactPhotoInputStream() of the ContactsContract.Contacts class which will return an InputStream containing the contacts photo if one is set. If no photo is set it will return null in which case you should try to set android.R.drawable.ic_contact_picture as your default image. Right. After trying it myself it looks like you can't access the private Drawable s which is even discouraged. Silly me. However you can just navigate to your android-sdk/platforms/android-4/data/res/drawable directory and copy the ic_contact_picture to your projects drawable directory. Then if the method above returns null just set that drawable as your photo.
