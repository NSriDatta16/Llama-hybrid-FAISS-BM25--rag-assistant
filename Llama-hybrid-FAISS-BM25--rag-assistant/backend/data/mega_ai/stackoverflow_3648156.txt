Difficulty with Adding a Reference in Visual Studio (Windows Azure StorageClient)

I've been following alone with this tutorial . Everything is going great, until I get to this part: Set a reference to the StorageClient library. You can either add the sample project to the solution and add a project reference or you can add a reference to the compiled dll. I am going to add the StorageClient project to the solution and add a project reference. I am not able to find the StorageClient project. I have SDK v1.2, and it has samples-cs.zip. StorageClient is not there. The SDK does have ref/Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient.dll . I tried adding a reference to it in my ASP project, but it's not working. VS does not recognize the type TableStorageEntity , nor the namespace Microsoft.Samples.ServiceHosting.StorageClient . What am I doing wrong? Can I just find the StorageClient somewhere and use that? If it was taken out of the SDK, does it mean that it's not supported any more? If so, why have the DLL?
