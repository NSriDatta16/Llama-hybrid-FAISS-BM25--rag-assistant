Yes, the theorem of total probability can be expressed as $$P(B) = \sum_n P(B\cap A_n)\tag{1}$$ (which form you seem to prefer) instead of the more usual $$P(B) = \sum_n P(A_n)P(B\mid A_n)\tag{2}$$ but the whole point of expressing $P(B)$ in the form $(2)$ is to remind the reader that $P(B)$ , the unconditional probability of $B$ , is just a weighted sum of the conditional probabilities $P(B\mid A_n)$ . The weights are, of course, just the $P(A_n)$ which sum to $1$ . Put another way, the unconditional probability $P(B)$ is the average value (or expected value) of the (conditional) probability of $B$ given that various (mutually exclusive) conditions (the events $A_n$ ) have occurred. From this we can deduce that the unconditional probability $P(B)$ is necessarily bounded above by $\max P(B\mid A_n)$ and bounded below by $\min P(B\mid A_n)$ . So, $(2)$ does have its uses. In my opinion, it provides more insight into the issues than $(1)$ .
