Sales forecast in presence of stockout

Can anyone provide some idea about how to model sales with stockout ? (it could be a general answer or specific to any modeling methods) If I want to model this with LSTM with multiple time steps, how should I tweak the feature engineering and modeling process? Do I need to add new features, like "number of days with no sales in the last 7 days" or "the first/last day with sales in the last 7 days" ? I tried modeling this like normal sales data, treated stockout as 0 sales of that day, but no matter how I tuned the parameters (like, batch size, optimizer, lr, etc), it still could not give me a satisfied result.
