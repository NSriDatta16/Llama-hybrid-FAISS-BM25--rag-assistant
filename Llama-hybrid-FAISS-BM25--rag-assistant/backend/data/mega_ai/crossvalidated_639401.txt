If you seriously want a "guesstimate" of the coefficients for a logistic regression, here is one way. There seems to be a very hard boundary around 39. So I'm just going to guess that if age is greater than 39 then 1 else 0. Here are my results when I do so yhat y 0 1 0 45 0 1 0 55 I get 100% accuracy using this rule. This is equivalent to setting the intercept in a logistic regression to 0 and using age - 39 as a predictor. Why does this work? A simple decision rule for logistic regression is to predict 1 when the probability is greater than 0.5 and 0 else (its not a good rule generally speaking, but its one you typically see in these intro courses). The probability is modelled as a sigmoid curve $$ P(x) = \dfrac{1}{1 + \exp(-\beta_0 - \beta_1x)} $$ There is no need to actually calculate this. $P(x)$ will be less than 0.5 whenever $\beta_0 + \beta_1 x . Given that we can just predict "age > 39 then 1 else 0", how do we convert this to coefficients? If we set $\beta_0 = 0$ and $\beta_1 = 1$ and let $x = age - 39$ then we basically get our decision rule. $P(age - 39)$ will be less than 0 then age is less than 39, hence we will predict 0. When age is greater than 39 then $P(age - 39)$ be greater than 0.5 and we will predict 1. This answer relies on shifting age (i.e. doing age - 39). If $\beta_0 = -39$ and $\beta_1=1$ then we get the same behaviour without rescaling.
