simple .. see first of all go to the xaml of your form.. find the datagridview that you dragged .. in there you have to find autogeneratecolumns property , then set it to true after that come back to your c# code and do it like this... yourdataset x = new yourdataset(); yourtableadapter y = new yourtableadapter(); y.Fill(x.yourtable); datagridview1.itemsource = x.yourtable.defaultview ; Please keep in mind .. this is not accurate code ... it was just for the sake of illustration.. Your dataset and tablenames might be different.. so use appropriate names.. Any problems let me know ..
