How to organize Java properties entries for internationalization?

In our app we have a messages.properties file which contains all of the strings that will be shown to the UI. We have a small app with a few screens and it's already getting unwieldy with duplicate string values throughout. Right now we have it organized with page specific strings separated out with whitespace and comments, with a section for each jsp with the property name having a prefix of the page name. We also have sections for entities, for instance, anywhere we show the user's email address, we would reference the property user.email for the label for that input or output field. We have another section for error and status messages, and finally one last section with global messages like "Submit" and "Cancel" There's got to be a better way, and I'm wondering if you know what it is.
