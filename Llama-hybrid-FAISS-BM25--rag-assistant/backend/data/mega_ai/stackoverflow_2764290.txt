It is indeed a security measure. If a user could be tricked into bookmarking and running a javascript: URL, that's pretty much global cross-site-scripting. About all you can do is present the user with a javascript: link, and ask them to bookmark it via right-click-bookmark or drag-to-bookmarks. You should also write the link out so it can be copy-and-pasted and manually bookmarked, because some browsers won't present right-click-bookmark for a JavaScript link, and others may not have a bookmarks bar visible.
