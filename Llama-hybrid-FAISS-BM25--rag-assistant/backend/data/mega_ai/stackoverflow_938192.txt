If you haven't already, you need to import sys sys.path.append("/home/user/whatever") That took care of my problems a couple of years ago when embedding boost::python (Python v2.5). Edit: Poked around in old code. Perhaps this does the trick: Py_SetProgramName(argv[0]); Py_InitializeEx(0); Sounds unsure that you should really need the Py_SetProgramName() , but I faintly remember some fishy business there.
