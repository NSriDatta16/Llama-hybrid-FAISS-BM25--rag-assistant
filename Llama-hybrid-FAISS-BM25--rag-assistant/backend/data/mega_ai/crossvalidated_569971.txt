CART coverall accuracy vs. RF & SVM

I am performing a supervised classification with RF, SVM, and CART algorithms. I have over 2000 training points in an area of 9,995 kmÂ². For CART, I have obtained a 'Validation overall accuracy = 1' when I set minLeafPopulation as default value 1. (If I set minLeafPopulation = 2, it decreases the accuracy to 0.94) I read that such a high accuracy is not possible and it might be due to errors in training data, so I checked the 'Training overall accuracy'' as well and it is 0.9994. For the same dataset, the 'validation overall accuracy 'of RF and SVM are 0.81 and 0.88, respectively. At first, I was sure that this result is wrong but since the other two algorithms do not result in such high accuracy, I am not sure if the CART accuracy is wrong. Is it really possible??
