ExtJS - EditorGridPanel rows not draggable?

I had a working grid-to-grid drag and drop configuration, but once I changed one of the grids to an EditorGridPanel, I could no longer drag from it - only to it. Once I click on the row I want to drag I get the following error: sm.isSelected is not a function if(!sm.isSelected(rowIndex) || e.hasModifier()){ ext-all-debug.js (line 45439) Is there any way to set it up so I can drag rows from an EditorGridPanel?
