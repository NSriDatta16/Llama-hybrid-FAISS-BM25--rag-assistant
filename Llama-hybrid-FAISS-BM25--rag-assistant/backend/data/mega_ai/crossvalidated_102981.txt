You have to train your model, get the topics distribution for both the corpus you want to compare and then you need to choose a metric to compare them. For example, the topic distributions are vectors, and you can use the euclidian distance between them as an indicator of the difference between the documents. EDIT - (example) With gensim, you'll have to do something like that: #Train your LDA model lda = LdaModel(national_corpus, num_topics=10) # Get the mean of all topic distributions in one corpus national_topic_vectors = [] for newspaper in national_corpus: national_topic_vectors.append(lda[newspaper]) national_average = numpy.average(numpy.array(national_topic_vectors), axis=0) # Get the mean of all topic distributions in another corpus regional_topic_vectors = [] for newspaper in regional_corpus: regional_topic_vectors.append(lda[newspaper]) regional_average = numpy.average(numpy.array(regional_topic_vectors), axis=0) # Calculate the distance between the distribution of topics in both corpora difference_of_distributions = numpy.linalg.norm(national_average - regional_average)
