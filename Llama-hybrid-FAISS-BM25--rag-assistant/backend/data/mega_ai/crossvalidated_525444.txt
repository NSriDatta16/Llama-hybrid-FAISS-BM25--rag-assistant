Training accuracy improves but validation and test accuracy don't

I am training an LSTM classifier on a binary data set in order to predict if a body-headline set is related or unrelated. The headline and body were combined as a string and then the features were extracted using a BERT transformer. The training dataset is biased with related being around 10722 and unrelated about 29255 . I'm passing in the embedding and label into the model. I tried to undersample the training dataset according to this suggestion , and it increased my training accuracy, but my validation and test accuracy remain stagnant at about 72%, maybe jumping up to 75% while my training accuracy reaches mid 80's or even 90's. My LSTM model arch looks a little like this: dropout layer LSTM layer dropout layer linear layer
