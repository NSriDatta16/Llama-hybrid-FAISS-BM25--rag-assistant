How to interpret the results from cross validation using cv.lm function in r?

I've generated a linear model and I now want to use it to generate predictions. However, I want to first somehow test the predictive accuracy of my model. So far I've generated the model and have run a 5-fold cross validation with the following code and sample output: reg F) logAverageBL 1 10.42 10.42 808 There seem to be many questions here about cross validation but I don't understand what information from this output is important. If the Overall ms is similar to the ms of each k-fold, does that suggest that the predictive accuracy is good? I understand that the overall ms or the cvms is the error of my predictions but I don't know what would indicate an acceptable amount of error.
