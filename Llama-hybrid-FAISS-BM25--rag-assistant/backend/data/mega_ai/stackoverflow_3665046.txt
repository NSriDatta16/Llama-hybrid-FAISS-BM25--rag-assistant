This is by design. Normally, Windows selects a preferred base address for an ASLR DLL when the DLL is first loaded, and then it keeps using that address until the system is rebooted. That way the DLL will be mapped at the same address in every process that loads it, allowing code pages to be shared. However, if a DLL has been unloaded from every process, the system may sometimes select a different base address the next time the DLL is loaded. It does this to reduce virtual address space fragmentation, not for security reasons. This is what seems to be happening in your case.
