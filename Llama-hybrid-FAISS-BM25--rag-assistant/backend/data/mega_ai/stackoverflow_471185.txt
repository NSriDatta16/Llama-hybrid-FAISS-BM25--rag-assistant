Is this the entire code for the relevant methods? If so, you're never grabbing the mouse's position when you're dragging. curPos[] is uninitialized and may be returning the same values for each time you get a mouseDragged: message. This may make your object always rotate to the same position, making it appear like it's not moving. Try inserting an NSLog in your mouseDragged: method to make sure that it's being called for your mouse drags (it probably is, but it's good to check). There's a slight possibility that you're not giving the main run loop a chance to refresh the display, but I think that's unlikely. I've done something similar in my code and had it work just fine with everything on the main thread. Rather than rolling your own trackball implementation, I suggest looking at Bill Dudney's trackball example code . While it is for the iPhone and deals with Core Animation, the trackball object he uses should be applicable to your case.
