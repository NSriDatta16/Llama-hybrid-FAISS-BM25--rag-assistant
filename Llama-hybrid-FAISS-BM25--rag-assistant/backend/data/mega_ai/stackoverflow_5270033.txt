Fuzzy match portions of an image

I need to determine the existance of a smaller image inside a larger image. The match must be fuzzy and preferrably I should know how well it matched (%), but I can calculate the accuracy my self after the match is done if required. My goal is to match a FFT (Fast Fourier Transfrom) spectrogram (visualization of frequencies in music) with the original music track. The small image I'm matching with is only a subset (both in time and frequency range) of the original track (like a cutout of the image below). Where should I start? Are the same algorithms used for object recognition suitable for this task? I am primarily looking for C#/.Net libraries/samples, but also information on implementations and problems/pitfalls. I am considering using artificual neural networks for training the recognition. Any thoughts? Example of what the images I want to match may look like:
