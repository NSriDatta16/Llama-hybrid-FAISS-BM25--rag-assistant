Without knowing the specifics of your problem, it may simply be that OLS models the conditional average of the dependent variable, while logistic regression models the probability of being 1. Especially with a large number of data points, the two may simply coincide. For instance, you may have 1000 matches with 40 moves, 550 won by White and 450 by black. (No draws?) Then logistic regression will model a probability of 0.55, whereas OLS will model a mean of 0.55. Same number, slightly different interpretation.
