I have used a couple of Search Engines on my site during it's time, but in the next rebuild I'm planning to move to Google Site Search. There are several reasons for this: Users are very familiar with the Google style of search result listings which improves usability and hence click-through rates The Google engine is very good at guessing when to use the page description and when to use a fragment of the page (it also very good at getting relevant fragments compared to some other engines) It's used by thousands of very popular websites Google is the most popular search engine around so you know their technology is both reliable and accurate Google Site Search begins at $100 per annum for 1000 pages or less (and a limit on queries) or you can use the free Google Custom Search Engine (but this has much less customizability)
