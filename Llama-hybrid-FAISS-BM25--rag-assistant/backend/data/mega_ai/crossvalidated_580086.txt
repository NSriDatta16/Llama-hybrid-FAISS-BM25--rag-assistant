Why donâ€™t we calculate the average of an entire given population instead of computing confidence interval to estimate the population mean?

We compute confidence intervals to estimate the true population mean of either a sample (when population standard deviation is unknown) or an entire population (when population standard deviation is known). But I wonder why, if we are given an entire population, why don't we calculate the average of that population instead of computing confidence interval to estimate the population mean since we already have the entire population? I'm not a Math or Stat major so I apologize if my question does not sound "smart".
