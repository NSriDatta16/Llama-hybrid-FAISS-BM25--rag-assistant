jQuery Accordion navigationFilter open header with current page

just a quick one here but only for jQuery experts. What would be the best way to have the jQuery accordion always open the header which holds the link to page the user currently is on? Current code: $(function () { $('ul.drawers').accordion({ header: 'H2.drawer-handle', selectedClass: 'open', collapsible: true, active: false, event: 'mouseover', navigation: true, }); }); $('ul.drawers').accordion('option', 'navigationFilter', function(){ //Your code for the NavigationFilter }); All the best, Robert here is the html: Outward Opening Windows Aluminium Clad Wooden Windows Double Glazed Window Energy Efficient Triple Glazed Window Secured By Design Inward Opening Windows Inward Opening Wooden Windows Timber Thermal Window Additional Selection Viking Fireguard Window Traditional Sliding Sash Exterior Doors Viking Double Glazed Alu-Clad Door Energy Efficient Triple Glazed Wooden Doors Sliding/Folding Doors The Sliding Door
