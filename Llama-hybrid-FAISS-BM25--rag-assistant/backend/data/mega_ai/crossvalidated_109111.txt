Even if that relationship is not linear, a regression model provides an estimate of the "first order trend" or averaged linear response. So we can still extract useful information from a linear model set to curvilinear data. This is a common approach in inference and inferring associations. As another point, I am actually very surprised exactly how effectively linear trends usually model data. For the purposes of prediction, modeling the trend as closely as possible is important. When doing model selection and we are concerned about curvilinear trends, we may fit higher order effects and structurally test models for parsimony. Higher order effects include quadratic terms. This usually can provide a reasonable approximation for slightly exponential or logarithmic trends. Cubic terms can be better at capturing S shaped trends. A more general form of doing this is fitting splines with cross validation. Lastly, a cautionary note, bivariate scatter plots of regressors against the outcome of interest are not suited to demonstrate whether multivariate linearity holds. Thinking in 3 or 4 dimensions, you can visualize linear planes in which data are distributed in such a way that their projection appears nonlinear. A conditioning plot is a very nice way to take care of that and display multidimensional data using bivariate scatter plots.
