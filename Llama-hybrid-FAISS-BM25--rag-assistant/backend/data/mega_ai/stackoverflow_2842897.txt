l+l++ is undefined. There is no sequence point in your expression to separate the access to l and the post-increment. It can do anything, including having the same effects as l+l . EDIT: the question and answers at Why is `i = ++i + 1` unspecified behavior? explain what a sequence point is, quote the relevant parts of the standard and provide links. Let me quote again: Except where noted, the order of evaluation of operands of individual operators and subexpressions of individual expressions, and the order in which side effects take place, is unspecified. 53) Between the previous and next sequence point a scalar object shall have its stored value modified at most once by the evaluation of an expression. Furthermore, the prior value shall be accessed only to determine the value to be stored. Emphasis mine. SECOND EDIT: By popular request, the next sentence in the paragraph: The requirements of this paragraph shall be met for each allowable ordering of the subexpressions of a full expression; otherwise the behavior is undefined.
