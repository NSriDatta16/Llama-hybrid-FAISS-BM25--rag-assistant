This does not sound like clustering to me . (In particular, clustering usually works with multiple multi-dimensional instances; and commonly has no awareness of time, but you have a single 1-dimensional time series AFAICT) More as if you just want to remove parts of the series that are outside the some-sigma range of the trend. In Spike Sorting (Scholarpedia) , clustering is the step you do after you have extracted the interesting spikes. You seem to be stuck at the first two steps: filtering and spike extraction .
