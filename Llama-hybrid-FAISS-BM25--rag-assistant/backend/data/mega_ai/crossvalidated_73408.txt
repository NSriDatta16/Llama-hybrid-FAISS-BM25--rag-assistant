@ttnphns Thank you for your answer. You're right, in common case, without mean-centering PCA would lose a lot of sense. But I think, if I use it to regularize regression, it could work. Here I wrote a bit of algebra for myself. I hope it's correct, but I would appreciate some comments, cause I'm not completely sure. Initial problem (doesn't work because A'A is nearly collinear and numerically uninvertible) $$ y = Ax $$ Decompose covariance matrix of data (standardized data). To get correct (from the PCA perspective) eigen-everything. $$ cov(A) = VDV' $$ Transform raw-data (without mean centering) into an orthogonal basis $$ AV $$ (just a linear transformation). Coefficients $x^*$ for transformed problem are founded because matrix $AV$ is well-conditioned. $$ y = AVx^* $$ As (1) and (4) are approximately equal $$ Ax = AVx^* $$ so... $$ x = (A'A)^{-1}A'AVx^* $$ A'A seems to have a full rank, so theoretically is invertible analiticaly $$ x = Vx^* $$
