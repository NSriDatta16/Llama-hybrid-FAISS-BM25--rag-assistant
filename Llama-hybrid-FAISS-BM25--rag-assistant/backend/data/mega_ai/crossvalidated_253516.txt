I'll try to answer to your questions. What does the initialWindow mean in layman's terms? To better understand this I suggest to have a look at https://rpubs.com/crossxwill/time-series-cv . Put in simple terms, the initialWindow is the size (number of samples or row's dataset) of the training dataset used by the MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron neural network) for its training stage used for each resample. What does the fixedWindow mean in layman's terms? This means that for each resample, the size of the training dataset does not change but remain the same; it's simple shifted onwards by an amount specified by horizon (in your case set to 1, i.e. a one step-ahead forecast) How is the output of the model interpreted? More specifically, what does the "size" mean? Size is the number of neurons in the hidden layer of the MLP. You specified size but it has been neglected in the way you set it in your code. Why could be causing NaNs in the Rsquared column? Try to use preProc = c("scale","center") in train. How do I obtain the outputs/predictions so I can create unscaled forecasts? Use: mynn$Prediction I also suggest to consider the following topic ( Whether preprocessing is needed before prediction using FinalModel of RandomForest with caret package? ) I hope it was useful.
