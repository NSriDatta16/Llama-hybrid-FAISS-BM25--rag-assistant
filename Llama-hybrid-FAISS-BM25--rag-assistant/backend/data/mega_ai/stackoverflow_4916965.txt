Blobstore Stored Data represents what you think it does: the amount of data stored in the blobstore. There are two types of quota in App Engine, though: billing quotas and limits. "Total Stored Data" is a billing quota; "Blobstore Stored Data" is a limit. Limits tend to be set very high, mostly to prevent runaway apps and abuse; if you run out of one of them, we'll generally extend them for you. Storage in blobstore is counted towards both quotas. It's likely that you're seeing 0% on "Blobstore Stored Data" because the limit is set high enough that you're not even using 1% of it. What is the actual value of that limit, as opposed to the percentage value?
