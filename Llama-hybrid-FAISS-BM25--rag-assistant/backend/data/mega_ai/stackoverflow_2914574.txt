I happen to have a 64 bit RHEL 5.4 box which has Perl 5.8.8 on it. I took your code and got the exact same result. I tried using Data::Dumper to dump the data, but that didn't change anything. I then went to the command line and did this: wget -O jsonfile http://api.stackoverflow.com/0.8/questions/tagged/php --2010-05-26 11:42:41-- http://api.stackoverflow.com/0.8/questions/tagged/php Resolving api.stackoverflow.com... 69.59.196.211 Connecting to api.stackoverflow.com|69.59.196.211|:80... connected. HTTP request sent, awaiting response... 200 OK Length: 5430 (5.3K) [application/json] Saving to: `jsonfile' 2010-05-26 11:42:42 (56.9 KB/s) - `jsonfile' saved [5430/5430] When I did this: file jsonfile I got: jsonfile: gzip compressed data, from FAT filesystem (MS-DOS, OS/2, NT), max speed So, the JSON data was gzipped by the web server. I tried this: gzip -dc jsonfile and lo and behold the results are the JSON data as you would expect. What you can do now is to either use another module to ungzip the data, or you can check out this other thread which shows how to accept gzip using LWP::UserAgent and handle the request that way
