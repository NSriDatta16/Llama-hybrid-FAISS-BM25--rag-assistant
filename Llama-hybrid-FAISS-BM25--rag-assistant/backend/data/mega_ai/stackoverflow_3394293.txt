Mono: HttpWebRequest SSL Errors on non-SSL URI

I have a console application that I wrote for .NET/Windows that I suddenly had the need for on my unix system. Mono has, for the most part, been hugely successful at providing this for me. There is however a small issue: The application issues many HttpWebRequests as it runs, and for a small portion of these, Mono is returning an error: Error getting response stream (Write: The authentication or decryption has failed.): SendFailure This error message seems to indicate an SSL error. However, this application does not issue any request to SSL-secured URIs (i.e. all URIs are http://). The main code in question is as follows: HttpWebRequest req = WebRequest.Create(url) as HttpWebRequest; req.UserAgent = UserAgent; req.AuthenticationLevel = AuthenticationLevel.None; req.AllowAutoRedirect = true; req.KeepAlive = true; req.CachePolicy = new RequestCachePolicy(RequestCacheLevel.NoCacheNoStore); req.Timeout = timeout; if (useCompression) { req.Headers.Add(HttpRequestHeader.AcceptEncoding, "gzip,deflate"); } Edit: For the purposes of running this code, you can define dummy variables as follows: string url = "http://example.com"; string UserAgent = "WhateverBot"; int timeout = 5000; bool useCompression = true; It should be noted that the code works without any problem on Windows/.NET.
