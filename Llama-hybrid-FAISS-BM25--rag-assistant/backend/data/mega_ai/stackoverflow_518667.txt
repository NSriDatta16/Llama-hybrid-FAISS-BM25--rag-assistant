I agree you probably shouldn't do this.... but in going against the grain since we are all adults here... It is possible to modify the web.config if your website is running in full trust mode. If you're hosted on GoDaddy for example then you are probably out of luck. That being said you could leverage an admin page I wrote for BlogEngine which will allow you to edit any file you have granted the AppPool service permission to edit. You would probably want to remake this into a user control and then add it to a protected url address and/or folder.
