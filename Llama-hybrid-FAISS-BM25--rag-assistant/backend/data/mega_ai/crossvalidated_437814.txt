Biased bootstrap: how to construct confidence intervals?

For a project I am trying to evaluate a set of predictors using logistic regression. So I have defined a model selection procedure that I applied on the data, and estimate an AUC to assess model performance. To validate the model selection procedure, I perform a leave-one-out cross-validation, stacking individual predictions and estimating a "validated" AUC on these predictions. The challenge now comes when I try to find a confidence interval for this validated AUC. My approach was to perform a bootstrap with 1000 iterations, doing the LOOCV on all resampled data sets. However, there is a large difference between the observed validated AUC and the bootstrapped AUCs (the latter being substantially larger). Only 6 out of 1000 bootstrapped AUCs were as small as the observed one or smaller. This results in a percentile based CI (I used the basic bootstrap CI ) that does not cover the observed AUC. What can I do in this situation? What does it mean when there is such a large difference between observed AUC and bootstrap mean? See the boxplots below for the bootstrap results of 3 different quantities (AUC's based on different sets of variables). For the third AUC (clinical+imaging), the value I found on the observed data is 0.525, which is even below the .025 quantile.
