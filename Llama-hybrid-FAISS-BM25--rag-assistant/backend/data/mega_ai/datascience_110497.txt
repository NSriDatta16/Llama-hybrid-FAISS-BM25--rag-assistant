Both algorithms can be useful. Cluster Analysis is good for marketing to groups, and Decision Trees can give you specific rules as to what the best sub-segments are to market to (and the worst). But, no machine learning algorithm will give you an exact answer. It is OK to use both clustering and decision trees. You can compare their outputs and see if there is consensus between the two. If they reach opposite conclusions, in an overall sense, you need to go back to the drawing board and try to reconcile the differences.
