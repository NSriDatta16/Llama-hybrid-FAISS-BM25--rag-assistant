Elegant way to match an int to an enum where each enum type corresponds to a range

I am trying to think of an elegant way to solve this problem in Java: Given an int of 0-100 what is an elegant way to turn it into an enum where each of the enum's possible values correspond to a range of ints. For example enum grades{ A -> 90-95% B -> 85-90%, C -> 75-85% ... etc } Can anybody think of a concise way to write a method that given an int returns an enum of grades or throws a IllegalArgumentException?
