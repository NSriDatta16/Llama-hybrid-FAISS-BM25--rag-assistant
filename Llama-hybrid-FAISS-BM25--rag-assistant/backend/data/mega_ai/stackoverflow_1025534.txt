When i get you right you want to scale the sprite WHILE the finger remains on the same spot without moving is that correct? I would recommend using a Layer with the following methods: - (BOOL)ccTouchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (BOOL)ccTouchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (BOOL)ccTouchesEnded:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event You could schedule an interval based action/method in ccTouchesBegan to increase the scale of your sprite (e.g increase 0.1 per second) and in ccTouchesEnded you cancel that action and set the scale back to the original value (e.g 1.0). For scheduling have a look at that method (found in any Class extending CocosNode ): -(void) schedule: (SEL) s;
