adding some HTML in admin panel form magento

In app/code/local/namspace/module/Block/Adminhtml/module/Edit/Tab/Form.php we basically add all the fields. Is there anyway to add any HTML to this form e.g. some form instructions for filling the form. I have this layout under app/code/local/namspace/module/Block/ Block | |____Adminhtml | |____ Module | |__Edit | |__Form.php | |__Tabs.php | | | |__Tab | |___Form.php | |__Edit.php Thanks
