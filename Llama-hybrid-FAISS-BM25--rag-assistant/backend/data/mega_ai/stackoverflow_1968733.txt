Well, if you're on a Linux distribution, then this question on SO would have the answer. I can think of a round-about (not elegant) solution for your problem, but at the very least it would WORK. Every time you insert your flash drive into a USB port, the Windows OS assigns a drive letter to it. For the purposes of this discussion, let's call that letter 'F'. This code looks to see if we can cd into f:\ . If it is possible to cd into f:\ , then we can conclude that 'F' has been allocated as a drive letter, and under the assumption that your flash drive always gets assigned to 'F', we can conclude that your flash drive has been plugged in. import os def isPluggedIn(driveLetter): if os.system("cd " +driveLetter +":") == 0: return True else: return False
