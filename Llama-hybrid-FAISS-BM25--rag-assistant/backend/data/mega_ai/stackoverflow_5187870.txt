iPhone SDK: How to account for UI layout differences, iPhone vs iPad?

If I have a universal app (runs on both iPhone & iPad), how do I account for UI layout differences in code if the UI differs between the devices? If I am using a XIB, I can simply load a different XIB depending on the device and use the same code. Correct? If I am creating my UI programmatically, though, how should this be handled? Is there a better way than if/elsing my way through the code and looking at the device type? I understand it's doable this way, it just doesn't seem very elegant. if (isiPhone) { UIView *myCommonView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 150.0, 50.0)]; myCommonView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:iPhoneSpecificImage]; // bunch of other conditional code } else { UIView *myCommonView = [[UIView alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(0.0, 0.0, 250.0, 150.0)]; myCommonView.backgroundColor = [UIColor colorWithPatternImage:iPadSpecificImage]; // bunch of other conditional code }
