Where can I learn more about pthreads?

I am asked to work on a piece of code which relies heavily on pthreads. So many calls are made to this library that I know nothing of. I have learnt the basics of pthread and have tried out a few examples like creating joining etc. but dont know the depths of it. I have learnt much of it using http://www.yolinux.com/TUTORIALS/LinuxTutorialPosixThreads.html The above tutorial doesn't inlcude an indepth coverage of the pthread library that a beginner should need. Could u guys recommend a website or an eBook for me to have a look and learn most of the advanced stuff like signal handling, mutexes, concurrency etc. TIA, the_Saint
