Embedding html5 in a mobilesafari webapp. is it possible to load an image in place of the quicktime logo in the modal player?

I haven't be able to find a resource explaining if this is possible at all. The Apple documentation found here https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/AudioandVideoTagBasics/AudioandVideoTagBasics.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009523-CH2-SW1 ...doesn't mention such features. I also tried embedding audio with the tag which pulls up the same modal quicktime player. Is there a way to do this or alternatively â€“ is there a way to play audio files in an iphone webapp without opening a modal external player?
