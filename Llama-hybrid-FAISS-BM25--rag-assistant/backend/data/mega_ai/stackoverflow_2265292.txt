Linq to XML query creating empty items from XML

Can somebody explain why is this xml when using query Dim c = From items In st.Descendants _ Where items.@id IsNot Nothing _ Select New myStorage With {.id = items.@id, .cityID = items.@cityID, .cityDatum = items.@cityDatum} storage = c.ToList resulting in list(of myStorage) with two items - one with all empty (nothing) properties, second with values seen in xml above? I've resolved the issue by adding Where items.@id IsNot Nothing _ before Seletct New myStorage, but I have a feeling that I shouldn't be doing that. I've recreated this in C#, storage.xml is exactly the same as specified above. private void Form1_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { XDocument st; st = XDocument.Load("C:\\storage.xml"); Object c = from items in st.Descendants() select new {id = items.Attribute("id"), cityID = items.Attribute("cityID"), cityDatum = items.Attribute("cityDatum")}; } If you, as some can't replicate these results, here's a screenshot: screenshot http://www.incito.hr/15.2.2010.png
