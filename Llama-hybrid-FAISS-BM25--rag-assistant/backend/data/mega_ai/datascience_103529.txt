What is the appropriate machine learning algorithm for this problem?

I have a dataset in which each sample contains a user id, a date, and the status associated with that particular user (active, expired & deactivated). The dataset contains records for a full year, but there are several days missing, and the goal of the project is to predict the status of a user on these missing days. Below is an example of one record: { "date": "20190101", "user": "301727881", "status": "active" }, Because the value of the variable I want to predict is categorical and there are 3 possible values, my research led me to Multinomial Logistic Regression. I would like to solve this problem using Python, and I want to know whether I'm on the right track or not. Also any links to helpful material would be highly appreciated.
