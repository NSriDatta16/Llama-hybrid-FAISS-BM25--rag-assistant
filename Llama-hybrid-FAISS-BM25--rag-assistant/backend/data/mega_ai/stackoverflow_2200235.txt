Building on the idea of minHash... My idea is to make 100 look-up tables using all the images currently in the database. The look-up tables are mapping from the brightness of a particular pixel to a list of images that have that same brightness in that same pixel. To search for an image just input it into the hash tables, get 100 lists, and score a point for each image when it shows up in a list. Each image will have a score from 0 to 100. The image with the most points wins. There are many issues with how to do this within reasonable memory constraints and how to do it quickly. Proper data structures are needed for storage on disk. Tweaking of the hashing value, number of tables, etc, is possible, too. If more information is needed, I can expand on this. My results have been very good. I'm able to index one million images in about 24 hours on one computer and I can lookup 20 images per second. Accuracy is astounding as far as I can tell.
