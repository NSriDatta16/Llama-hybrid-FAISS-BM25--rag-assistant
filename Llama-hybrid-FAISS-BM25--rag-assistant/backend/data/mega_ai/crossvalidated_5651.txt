This isn't a clustering, it's (supervised) classification. There are a lot of methods to do classification, such as na√Øve bayes for binary features and linear discriminants for continuous, or neural networks for some opaque combination of both. For the example you mention, the feasibility of what you suggest depends a lot on the metadata - for example, if it's been tagged (=classified) properly, you could expect to be able to find some tags they like/dislike. However, the problem you stated is more general. Discovering the exact algorithm is unlikely, and in the example one doesn't even exist.
