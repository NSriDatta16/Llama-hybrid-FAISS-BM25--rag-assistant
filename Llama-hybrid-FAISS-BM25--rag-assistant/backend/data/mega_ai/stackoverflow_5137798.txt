C# Best Practice - Event subscription

Very basic question, so I'm just looking for a best practice to follow. My class has a few events which should be subscribed to. (e.g. DiscoveryCompleted). Within the method I do check if the event is null or not, however I'm not sure if I should raise an exception, if so what type. NotImpletementedException? If the exception is unhandled it doesnt look very elegant. Your thoughts?
