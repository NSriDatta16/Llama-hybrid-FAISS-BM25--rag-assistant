I'm going to recommend something that I haven't yet tried, but plan to, so you have to judge for yourself this one. There's this language, called IO , which is particular in that its prototype-based, like JavaScript, but also borrows concepts from many other languages. Its job market it's probably nonexistent, but I thought I mention this language. Otherwise, a language from the Lisp family may be pretty different from what you already know. In that regard I'd recommend Scheme , which is, in my opinion, more elegant than Common Lisp. The new concept that you might found interesting in Scheme is continuations . If you take the Scheme path, make some time to watch these videos from 1986. They're amazing.
