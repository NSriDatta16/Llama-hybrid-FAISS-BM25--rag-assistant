I don't use vb.net, so my reasoning may be incorrect, but based on the names of your parameters MidpointRounding.ToEven, I would expect 34.425 to be rounded to 34.42; but I would also expect 34.225 to be rounded to 34.22 and 34.465 to 34.46. The rounding of numbers that end in 5 as in your examples is a matter of convention. The most usual convention is round to an even number, which I deduce your .ToEven parameter would be adopting. In addition, I suspect you are encountering the binary/decimal rounding problem. Checking the binary representation of 34.425 comes out as 10010.011011....... When you take the computer storage and representation of a decimal number (byte, word, double word, quad word and negative/positive complement) into account this can result in you not rounding the number you thought you were. To get the results you want, you should probably add 0.00001 to any digit ending in 5 before rounding.
