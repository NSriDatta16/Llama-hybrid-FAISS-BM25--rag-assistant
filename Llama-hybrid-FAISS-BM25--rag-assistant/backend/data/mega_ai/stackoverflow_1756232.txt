CDC finger-friendly

I've been working in a Java mobile project using j9 as a virtual machine. So far the project has been developed for an stylus interaction using AWT components. We want to create a new version of the application more finger-friendly the internal logic is working OK so we wanna keep it, it is just the interface that we want to update. From what IÂ´ve read the alternative is the LWUIT library, however it is just for CLDC configuration or for JavaTV, and the implementation on Java TV apparently doesn't work on J9. So, any suggestion? anyone have done something finger-friendly using j9? I'm thinking in develop buttons as images and give the fight against the layouts to make it look good, In other words, create the finger-friendly library from AWT, but I still having doubts about this approach, because there are some things that i don't know if possible, like the finger drag&drop to move between pages. Anyway, any Ideas of how should I approach this challenge will be very appreciated! Thanks, Gustavo.
