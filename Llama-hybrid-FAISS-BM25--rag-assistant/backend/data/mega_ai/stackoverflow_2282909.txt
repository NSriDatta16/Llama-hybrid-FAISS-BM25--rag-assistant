I have the same problem/concern/vexation. The best way I've found the only way to follow DRY is to use a database modeling tool (e.g. CA Erwin, Sybase PowerDesigner) where all the modeling work is done to build / maintain reference schema. Then you can leverage the change management capabilities of the tool to generate both the diff script which gets executed to go from release A to release B and generate the reference implementation yourself. You may, of course, find there are places where you didn't repeat yourself, but the comparison tools will show all differences, so you can suck "Oh, I had to change that on the fly" changes back into the reference implementation as well. Obviously, all of it -- diff script, reference implementation, and model itself -- then get protected through source code management.
