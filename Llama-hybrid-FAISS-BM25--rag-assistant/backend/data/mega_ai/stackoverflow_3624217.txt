I'm not sure if this is the best way, but it works: I'm assuming you want to do this multiple times i.e. Keep animating while it is dropped correctly and if it is dragged out again and not dropped then cut the animation. I would start by adding a parameter to the item being dragged which would indicate whether it is inside the target or not. e.g. var over_target = false; When activate is called start the animation. If the over event occurs the set over_target = true; if out event occurs then set over_target = false; When deactivate is called you only need to check if over_target == false then stop the animation.
