How to include 'Survey Weights' in a Proportional-Odds (Cumulative Logit) model

I am looking to design a Bayesian multilevel Proportional Odds model, which incorporates the use of survey weights in JAGS. The inclusion of weights for linear and Poisson models appears straightforward, however I suspect the process is a more complicated procedure for a Proportional Odds model. Linear: y[i] ~ dnorm(mu[i], tau / weight[i]) Poisson: y[i] ~ dpois(lambda[i] * weight[i]) I would like to know how survey weights are included in a Proportional-Odds (also known as the Cumulative Logit) model. I understand that weights may be incorporated when designing frequentist models with the clmm function in the [R] package 'ordinal' 1 . This is a question specific to data modelling. For completeness, I have included JAGS sample code for the unweighted model beneath, to demonstrate the design of these models. polr_model
