Here is an account of the probabilities relevant to the problem at hand. Denote by $z_n$ the event 'no pregnancy after $n$ years' for a woman using some type of contraception. Then $$ P(z_N) = P(z_N | z_{N-1}) P(z_{N-1} | z_{N-2})\cdots P(z_2 | z_1)P(z_1). $$ The problem is that the NYT asumes $P(z_i | z_{i-1}) = P(z_1) = p$, for all $i$, while knowing $z_{i-1}$ may provide evidence that the woman makes good use of the contraception method and may be experienced with it. We should therefore expect that $$ P(z_N | z_{N-1}) > P(z_{N-1} | z_{N-2}) > \cdots > P(z_1). $$ This implies $$ P(\text{'at least 1 pregnancy after $N$ years'}) Addendum. (Alternative presentation of user385948's answer) Every woman $w$ using a particular type of contraceptive, among $M$ other woman, has her own fixed probability $q_w$ of not getting an unwanted pregnancy in a year. The average success rate of the contraceptive over one year is $ p =\tfrac{1}{M}\sum_w q_w$. The average success rate after $N$ years, assuming year-to-year independence, is $\tfrac{1}{M}\sum_w q_w^N$. However, $$ \tfrac{1}{M}\sum_w q_w^N \geq \left(\tfrac{1}{M}\sum_w q_w\right)^N = p^N, $$ by Jensen's inequality, with equality if and only if $q_w$ is constant over $w$. Therefore, in average, generally stricly less than $(1-p^{10})\times 100$ woman in a hundred will have an unwanted pregnancy over a period of 10 years.
