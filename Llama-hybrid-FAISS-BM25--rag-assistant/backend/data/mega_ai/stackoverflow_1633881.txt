I personally, in my augmented reality library, use a rolling average for the updates: float kFilteringFactor = (float)0.05; rollingZ = (float) ((rawZValue * kFilteringFactor) + (rollingZ * (1.0 - kFilteringFactor))); This tends to smooth out the data pretty well, and you can tweak the filtering factor to get the responsiveness you want. rawZValue is the raw value coming in from the accelerometer.
