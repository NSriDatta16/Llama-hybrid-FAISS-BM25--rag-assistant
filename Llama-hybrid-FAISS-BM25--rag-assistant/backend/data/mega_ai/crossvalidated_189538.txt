Time series analysis incorporating both ARIMA structure and empirically identifiable deterministic structure (level shifts/local time trends.seasonal pulses and pulses) might be of some use to you http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf . Good analytics/software should/could identify 2 level shifts ( 3 regimes) which would be important starting point for your analysis providing "the region of interest". If you wish you can post your data and I will try and demonstrate that to you and the list.
