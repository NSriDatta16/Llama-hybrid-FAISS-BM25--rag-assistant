Validation and Learning Curves with Pipeline or Model Only?

I have a pretty complex Sklearn pipeline including Standardization, PCA, and more. I created a couple of models and would like to evaluate them with learning and validation curves. I find myself wondering whether if I should use the entire pipeline object or just the final model for drawing the curves. I presume the former.
