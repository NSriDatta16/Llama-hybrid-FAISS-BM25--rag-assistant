First, in this context a channel is a path for sensitive data (what you're trying to protect or keep secret) to escape through. Fundamentally it is about who knows about it (whether the leakage is intentional or accidental) A covert channel is a channel that is hidden. This means that its existence is intentional, and additionally there is an intention to conceal or hide its existence from a person who is trying to protect the system by filtering or limiting data flow. As an example, steganography. A side-channel is a channel that exists incidentally to the otherwise secure flow of data, and is described by Andrew Cooper.
