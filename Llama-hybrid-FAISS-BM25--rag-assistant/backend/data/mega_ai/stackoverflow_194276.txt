Perhaps you could try attaching the object on the user's machine. There is a tutorial online that seems like it could help: http://corlan.org/2008/09/02/storing-data-locally-in-air/ Example from the site: //write an Object to a file private function writeObject():void { var object:Object = new Object();//create an object to store object.value = asObject.text; //set the text field value to the value property //create a file under the application storage folder var file:File = File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath("myobject.file"); if (file.exists) file.deleteFile(); var fileStream:FileStream = new FileStream(); //create a file stream fileStream.open(file, FileMode.WRITE);// and open the file for write fileStream.writeObject(object);//write the object to the file fileStream.close(); }
