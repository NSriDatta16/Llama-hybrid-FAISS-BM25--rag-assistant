Likelihood function for binomial distribution with label 1 and -1

I am quite curious how we should write the likelihood function for -1, 1 in binomial case? The reason I am asking is because this , one of famous papers on gradient boosting. Just on the first page, he says the loss function for negative log-likelihood can be written as $\log(1 + \exp(-2yF))$ . As far as I remember if you follow the derivation of loss of the logistic regression with label 1 and -1, you end up with $\log(1 + \exp(-yF))$ . How can I get a coefficient 2? I google a lot and never see this kind of form. Does anyone have any ideas?
