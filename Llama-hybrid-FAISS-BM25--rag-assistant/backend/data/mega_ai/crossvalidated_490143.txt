Count variables are often modeled as generalized linear models using Poisson or negative binomial distributions with log links, which can be done in the GENLIN or GENLINMIXED procedures. GENLIN offers generalized estimating equations (GEE) methods to fit marginal or population-averaged models for repeated measures, while GENLINMIXED offers similar marginal models using a repeated specification, or subject-specific models using random effects. In the menus, Analyze>Generalized Linear Models>Generalized Estimating Equations is the gateway into GENLIN for fitting GEE models, and Analyze>Mixed Models>Generalized Linear is the gateway into GENLINMIXED. Before trying this though, I suggest doing some reading in the area. Applied Longitudinal Analysis by Garrett Fitzmaurice, Nan Larird, and James Ware, has very good coverage of these kinds of models.
