Microsoft's C# Programming Guide specifically says not to do what you are asking about: It is possible to assign any arbitrary integer value to meetingDay. For example, this line of code does not produce an error: meetingDay = (Days) 42. However, you should not do this because the implicit expectation is that an enum variable will only hold one of the values defined by the enum. To assign an arbitrary value to a variable of an enumeration type is to introduce a high risk for errors. int is really only the storage type. In fact, it's possible to specify other integer storage types , like byte: enum Days : byte {Sat=1, Sun, Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri}; The storage type determines how much memory an enum uses.
