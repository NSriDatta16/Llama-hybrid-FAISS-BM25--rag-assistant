... just mixing too many languages to learn atm Can I suggest that you need to stop and take the time to learn Java properly. Your code looks like you are trying to write "perlish" ... associative arrays and arrays instead of proper types. The end result is Java code that is slow and fragile compared with code that is designed and written using the Java mindset. It might seem like you are being productive, but what you are producing is likely to be problematic going forward.
