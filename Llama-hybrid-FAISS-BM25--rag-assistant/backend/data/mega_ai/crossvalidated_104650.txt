In R, it doesn't matter if they are factors or numeric variables. But be sure to indicate that you're doing a logistic regression by indicating family=binomial in, for example, a general linear model or mixed effects model. Without indicating this, the assumed variance of the distribution will differ. In a binomial family, the variance (dispersion parameter) is taken to be 1, unlike in gaussian family.
