How can I get cut-off point in multivariated ROC analysis

If I have 1 independent variable (continues) and 1 dependent variable (binary), I can conduct logistic regression and ROC analysis, and I can get a cut-off point of independent variable using ROC analysis. But, If I have 2 independent variable, how can I get two cut-off point in multivariate ROC analysis. In STATA, I can get just maximal AUC score but I can't get the cut-off points each independent variables.
