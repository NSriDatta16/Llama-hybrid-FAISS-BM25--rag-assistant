Getting Older PHP Extensions

It happens that I need the GD, SQLite and a few more extensions for php 5.1. But I can't find out where to get them. I am using WinBinder to develop some desktop applications for Windows with php. The minimal php 5.1 pack has the winbinder extension only. I need other extensions for enhanced features like image editing or data storage. Can anybody help? I really need this very much. PS: I want to get pre-compiled DLLs if posible. Thanks and Regards, Masnun
