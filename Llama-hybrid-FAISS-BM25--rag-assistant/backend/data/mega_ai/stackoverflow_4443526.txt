jquery ui drag easing/inertia

How do you enable easing or inertia when dragging an element using jquery ui draggable (http://jqueryui.com/demos/draggable/)? I'd like to recreate the easing similar to maps.google.com that as you throw/drag the map it eases into place. Ideally, I'd like to move the element move based on the force you throw/drag the element. How do you accomplish this functionality? Maybe jquery ui draggable isn't necessary, but I'm looking to emulate the dragging and easing found on Google Maps. Thanks!
