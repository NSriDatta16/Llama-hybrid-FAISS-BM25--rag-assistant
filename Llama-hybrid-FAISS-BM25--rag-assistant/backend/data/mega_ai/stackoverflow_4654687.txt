This can be accomplished with touchesBegan and touchesMoved events. - (void) touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // This gets you starting position of UITouch *touch = [ [ event allTouches ] anyObject ] ; float touchXBeginPoint = [ touch locationInView:touch.view ].x ; float touchYBeginPoint = [ touch locationInView:touch.view ].y ; // Calculate the offset between the current image center and the touched points. // Moving image only along X - direction and try thinking as how to move in // any direction using this as a reference. It isn't that hard. touchOffset = image.center.x - touchXBeginPoint ; // touchOffset should be a member variable of class or a variable with global scope } - (void) touchesMoved:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { // Calculate the difference from previous position and the current position // Add this difference to the previous point and move the image center to that point. // How ever, you should have an UIImageView outlet connected on to the image placed // on the interface builder. // And regarding image movement restriction, since you always have co-ordinates with // you, you can set the boundaries. UITouch *touch = [ [ event allTouches ] anyObject ] ; float distanceMoved =( [ touch locationInView:touch.view ].x + touchOffset ) - image.center.x ; float newX = image.center.x + distanceMoved ; if( newX > 30 && newX Hope this should be helpful.
