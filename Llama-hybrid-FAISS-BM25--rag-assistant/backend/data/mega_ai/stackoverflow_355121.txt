Two approaches: You can mount files as volumes in linux. Provided your binary blob isn't too corrupted, you'll probably be able to break down the filesystem to find out where you files are located. Is (was) it a FAT partition or NTFS? If that doesn't work, I'd look for this string of bytes : D0 CF 11 E0 A1 B1 1A E1 These are the "magic bytes" of office document file signatures. They might occur randomly in other data, but it's a start. You're going to run into MAJOR issues if the files are fragmented. Also, try to recreate pieces of the document(s) in Word as is, save it to a file and extract chunks to search for in the blob (using grep binary or whatever). Provided you have info from all parts of the file you should be able to decode WHERE in the blob they are. Piecing it back into a working DOC binary seems far fetched, but recovering the rest of the text shouldn't be impossible.
