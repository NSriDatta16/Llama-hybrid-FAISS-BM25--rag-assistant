The Suit enum is inside the Card class, and you have to access it that way: new Card(Card.Suit.SPADES, 1); Or, you can import the Suit class from within Card, and access it directly: import my.package.Card.Suit; new Card(Suit.SPADES, 1); The other option is to put Suit in its own class, as suggested by Bert.
