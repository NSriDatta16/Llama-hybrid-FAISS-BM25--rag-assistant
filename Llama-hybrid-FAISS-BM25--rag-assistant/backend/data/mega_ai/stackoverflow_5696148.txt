The basic problem here is that while there's a read-file-name-function which ido can attach itself to, there's no read-directory-name-function , ido-mode has no explicit support for this feature of dired , and there's nothing about the read-file-name invocation I could figure out that ido-mode could hook onto. All I can suggest is to just turn off ido by using C-f . The invocation of read-file-name by dired is so many levels deep that it wouldn't even be particularly elegant to patch: * read-file-name("Copy to: " " /" " / ") apply(read-file-name ("Copy to: " " /" " / ")) dired-mark-pop-up(nil copy (" ") read-file-name "Copy to: " " /" " / ") dired-mark-read-file-name("Copy %s to: " " /" copy nil (" ") " / ") dired-do-create-files(copy dired-copy-file "Copy" nil 67 nil nil) dired-do-copy(nil)
