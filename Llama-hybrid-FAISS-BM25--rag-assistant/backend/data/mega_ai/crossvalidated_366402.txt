If it must be an autoencoder, I would recommend trying a adversarial autoencoder as suggested here: https://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.05644.pdf Such autoencoders decompose the images into useful features and create a smooth representation space. When considering the architecture of the encoder, decoder and discriminator, it would probably be best to use convolutional neural networks. They contain less parameters than fully connected networks and thus this should be computationally feasible for 40x40 images. There are of course many types of convolutional networks, make sure that you have some type of regularization mechanism (such as batchnorm/dropout). You can find many example of suitable convolutional networks for images, eg implemented already on github.
