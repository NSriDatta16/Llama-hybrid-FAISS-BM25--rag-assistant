JavaScript: Dragging Mouse on Links

I'm trying to make a calendar page where you can click and drag to select multiple calendar days at once. Everything works fine in Google Chrome, but in Firefox, when I try to start dragging, it fails. The reason for this is that each calendar day is contained in a link ( ). When you try to drag links in Firefox, it does its own action. Is there any way I can prevent this or work around it?
