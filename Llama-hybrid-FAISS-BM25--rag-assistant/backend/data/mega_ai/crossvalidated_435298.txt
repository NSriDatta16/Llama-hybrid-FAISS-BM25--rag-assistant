What are the assumptions in bayesian statistics?

So, for OLS there are 3 assumptions regarding the DGP, which are (from Stock & Watson): Independence of error terms (+ Homoskedasticity?) IID of variables Large outliers are unlikely, meaning non-zero finite 4th moments I'm currently working with Bayesian Hierarchical Linear Models, and I always thought that the "philosophical" part in Bayesianism is justifying the prior. Are the set of assumptions needed for frequentist linear regression as strict as in bayesian linear regression and/or are there even different sets of assumptions?
