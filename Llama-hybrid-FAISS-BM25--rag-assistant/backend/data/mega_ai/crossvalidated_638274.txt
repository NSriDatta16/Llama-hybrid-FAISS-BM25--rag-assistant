Sampling quantities with a fixed sum ("string cutting"), but those quantities have to be discrete

I would like to sample 6 quantities that are guaranteed to add up to 600, each with a mean of 100. I want to be control the amount of variance around 100 (same variance for all 6 quantities, but need ability to crank up/down), so the multinomial distribution won't do (can only specify probability). I can kind of do so with the Dirichlet distribution (R code below): library(MCMCprecision) sims However, there is an issue. I want those quantities to be discrete (rounded to the nearest number), not continuous. If I round them, sometimes the sum adds up to something other than 600 (e.g., 599 or 601). Is there a way to achieve something similar, but only sample discrete numbers, rather than the whole line? I was thinking of something like how the geometric distribution is a discrete counterpart to the exponential, but not sure if there is any equivalent thing here. One thing I thought of was to just filter and only keep the samples that sum to 600: sims But not sure if that somehow biases things. Visually it looks similar to the unfiltered distribution.
