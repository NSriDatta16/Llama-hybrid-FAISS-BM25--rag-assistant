is your iphone jailbroken? which programme are you referring to? The programmes are usually deleted together with their internal Documents folder, aparet from application executable and dependencies. Custom user programs are not allowed to access any other system or application's space. Hence the reason why there exists so many web related iPhone apps. Why don't you upload it and sync it with some online web service/storage instead to persist this date data you've got?
