I would like to use Solr with MySQL. Does Solr work with MySQL? Yes. Solr is not specific to any storage mechanism. You have to tell it what to index. Can it be used to search across all the tables/repositories at once? Yes. It's entirely up to you how your data is indexed and searched on. Can it link back to the main record when a user searches on particular search result? Yes. You just need to store references in the index that can associate back to your data, like a unique id.
