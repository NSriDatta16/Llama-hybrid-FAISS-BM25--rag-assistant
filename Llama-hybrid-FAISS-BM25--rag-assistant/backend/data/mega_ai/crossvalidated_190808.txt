You can only compare coefficients once you've standardize columns with variance, otherwise comparison is meaningless. So what you can do is one-hot-encode your categorical data and standardize your full matrix data (containing both categorical & numeric data) per column - divide each column by its variance, you can also shift by the mean but this is not compulsory. This scales every column, and then when you run your logistic regression, all the weights will acount for the same so you'll be able to compare them. Hope it helps, Vince
