Works like a charm for me: In TcpCatcher Settings: Choose the default Monitor SSL mode : "runtime certificates" (certificates are then generated on the fly) In your Firefox connection settings : choose Manual proxy settings ; http proxy : localhost and port :8201 (must match TcpCatcher's main port). Check "Use this proxy server for all protocols". (I use TcpCatcher Firefox plugin , that actually what is does for you) In Firefox import TcpCatcher Root Certificate in order to get rid of warnings telling you that certificates are not trusted: Encryption | View Certificates | Authorities |Import The TcpCatcher option you checked ("static certificate") is actually meant to use TcpCatcher like a transparent proxy , which means you are not supposed to set any proxy at Firefox level but a dns trick. More explanations in this tutorial .
