When loading shopping cart in Magento with a new Payment module, I get an error I haven't been able to trace

I am trying to add a new payment module into Magento. However, even after commenting out the vast majority of the code, I still get the following error: Fatal error: Call to a member function isAvailable() on a non-object in /var/www/html/app/code/core/Mage/Payment/Helper/Data.php on line 71 I am using Magento 1.4.0.1, and have disabled the cache. I even emptied the cache several times just in case. The only code currently not commented out is based on the tutorials here and here . The error occurs when the cart is loaded either from the administration area or the front end. Is there anyone out there that has run into a similar issue? I would post code, but I am not sure what needs to be posted. Thanks for the assistance. Edit app/etc/modules/CPAP_All.xml true local app/code/local/CPAP/AuthorizeCim/etc/config.xml 0.1.0 CPAP_AuthorizeCim_Model CPAP_AuthorizeCim core_setup core_write core_read 0 authorizecim/paymentmethod pending AE,VI,MC,DI authorize 0 app/code/local/CPAP/AuthorizeCim/Model/Paymentmethod.php class CPAP_AuthorizeCim_Model_Authorizenet { } If I comment out authorizecim/paymentmethod from the config.xml, then the error goes away, but my payment option will not display as an option in the cart.
