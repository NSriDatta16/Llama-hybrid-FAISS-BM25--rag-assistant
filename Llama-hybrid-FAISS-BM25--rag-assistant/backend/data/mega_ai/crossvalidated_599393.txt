Confidence regions from a Gamma distribution

Let a random variable with posterior distribution be given by $X \sim \textrm{Gamma}(10,12)$ . This is the result of Jeffreys prior $\pi_J(\lambda)$ multiplied by the Likelihood of i.i.d. $X_1,...,X_n \sim \textrm{Exp}(\lambda)$ . Also, $n=10$ and $\sum_{i=1}^{10} X_i = 12$ . I'm trying to compute a one-sided Bayesian confidence region with level $0.05$ that takes the form $[\alpha,\infty)$ , i.e. finding $\alpha$ such that $P(X≥a)=0.95$ . This is what I have so far, $$P(X≥a)=Q(10,\alpha/12) \Rightarrow 12Q^{-1}(10,19/12) \approx 65.1049$$ Where $Q$ is the regularized incomplete gamma function. The value seems very high to me! Is this actually correct? This is actually no the part I'm struggling with. I can't manage to compute a one-sided Bayesian confidence region with level $0.05$ that takes the form $(0,b)$ , i.e. finding $\alpha$ such that $P(0 . I don't know how to express this as a regularized incomplete gamma function nor inverse cumulative distribution function. If I run some python code, the program eventually fails since it's dealing with both $b$ and $\exp(b)$ which are conflicting and cannot be solved for simultaneously. Can someone please help me compute $b$ ?
