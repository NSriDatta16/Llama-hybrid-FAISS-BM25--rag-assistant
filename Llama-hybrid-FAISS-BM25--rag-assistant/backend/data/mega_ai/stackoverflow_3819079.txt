Find if cookie has a value for variable

In a previous answer I found on stackoverflow (can't find now) someone suggested using NSRange rangeOfString to see if a particular variable had data in it from a cookie: NSRange range = [[[NSHTTPCookie requestHeaderFieldsWithCookies:[[NSHTTPCookieStorage sharedHTTPCookieStorage] cookiesForURL:[NSURL URLWithString:cookie]]] objectForKey:@"Cookie"] rangeOfString:@"variable"]; if (range.length != NSNotFound) { //it has data } else { //it doesn't } From what resources I can find this should work, but it doesn't, even when the cookie is null. What am I doing wrong?
