There was actually a new version released very recently (last 2 weeks) so definitely check that out to see if it helps. I don't know your system (obviously) but I doubt that your absolute path there is correct, I would verify that, or set it back to the default. (It would probably start '/var/www/...' or similar) I've leveraged amfphp on quite a few high traffic sites, and have never seen this error as a result of that, so definitely don't ignore other possibilities. Look carefully at the data your are sending/receiving for any possible errors there. Can it be encoded properly? Are their special characters, perhaps accent characters? Try to narrow down the source of the error, is there one call that is always causing it? Perhaps try logging the results. Goodluck!
