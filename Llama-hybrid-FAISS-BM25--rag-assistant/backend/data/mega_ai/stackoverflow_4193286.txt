EAGAIN is technically not an error, but an indication that the operation terminated without completing, and you should...er...try it again. You will probably want to write logic to retry, but not infinitely. If that was safe, they would have done it themselves in the API. If you are thinking that returing a silly non-error error code like that is kinda bad client interface design, you aren't the first. It turns out EAGAIN as an error code has a long interesting history in Unix. Among other things, it spawned the widely circulated essay on software design The Rise of Worse-is-Better . There's a couple of paragraphs in the middle that explain why Unix needs to return this sometimes. Yes, it does indeed have something to do with receiving interrupts during an I/O. They call it PC loser-ing. Many credit this essay as one of the inspirations for Agile programming.
