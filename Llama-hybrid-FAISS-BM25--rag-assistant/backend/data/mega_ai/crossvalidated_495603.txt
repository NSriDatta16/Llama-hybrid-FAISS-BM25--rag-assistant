Leave One Out Cross Validation - Average weights or error?

Basically, I have a dataset of 25 points and I ran a split to get 25 unique splits. From the training data I fit a linear regression model. So my question is do I do this for all splits and compute an average of all weights and then compute an error or do I compute the error between every split and average this error? Im inclined to think it is the latter as the first option presents an issue when computing the error as by computing an average weight, there is no longer a unique test point to compare to.
