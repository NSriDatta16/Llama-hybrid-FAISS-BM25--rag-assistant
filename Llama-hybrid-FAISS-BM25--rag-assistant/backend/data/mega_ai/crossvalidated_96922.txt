One class classifier Cross validation

I am working on a problem which requires one-class classifier. I am using LIBSVM. I know there are tons of material out there but still I could not find the answer to my query. How do I estimate the optimum parameters for the RBF kernel? Using svm-train -s 2 -t 2 -v 5 train.scale , I am getting 49% accuracy and my training set has no outlier data. So, does this actually mean 98% accuracy in real world scenario?
