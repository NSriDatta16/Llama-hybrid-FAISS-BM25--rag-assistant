How do I limit tree nodes from being dragged from their current node in flex 3?

So I have a flex tree component with a xmllistcollection as it's data provider. I would like to be able to rearrange the leaves and branches in the tree by drag and drop. I want to limit the drop area to the current level of the item being dragged. Like branch branch 0 leaf 1 leaf 2 branch x leaf a leaf b So, branch x can't be moved under branch 0 and leaf a could not be moved under branch 0.
