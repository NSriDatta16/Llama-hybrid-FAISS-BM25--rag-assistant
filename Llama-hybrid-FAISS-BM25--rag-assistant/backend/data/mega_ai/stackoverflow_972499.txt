AJAX is really fancy term for giving the browser the ability to refresh parts of its content with the need to reload an entire page. Like many have said, it doesn't require XML, or even Javascript in order to implement it. In fact in its early days it was done with with VBScript and Jscript and just called DHTML. Jesse James Garrett may have invented the AJAX term , but it was really Microsoft that invented the concept behind it. This source says Microsoft started it in 1999 , but I would date the birth of this technology even further. This Wired article is probably more accurate on the date of this technology being in the late 90's, much of it coming from the old days of the MSDN DHTML Dude columns written by Michael Wallent at Microsoft which started back in 1997. Much of the story is also told in this great video here by Michael himself: http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Charles/Michael-Wallent-Advent-and-Evolution-of-WPF/ Megan still works at Microsoft by the way working on the Silverlight team nowadays, Microsoft's replacement for ActiveX . Back to the AJAX thingy...when Jesse James Garrett back in 2005 he was mostly talking about the use of XMLHTTPRequest within Javascript code, and a dash of salt. That later began a hip word that many people started using even though they had no idea what it was, and thought that is really something brand new and hip, when really it was just a remix of something old.....sort of like many hip-hop songs you hear nowadays. It's not new, just a newer version of something old!
