Open Xcode 3.2. Show the Organizer window (Window->Organizer). Click the '+' button in the lower left corner of the Organizer window. Choose "New From Template"->"Java Templates"->"Java Application" Xcode relies on Ant to build Java projects, so you can edit your code in the organizer window or use whatever IDE or editor you wish.
