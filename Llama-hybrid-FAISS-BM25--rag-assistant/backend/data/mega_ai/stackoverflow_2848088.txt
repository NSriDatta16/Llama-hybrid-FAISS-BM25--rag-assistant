It's possible to autowire as many bean as you like. But when you're using autowiring by type, it can be only one of bean of each interface. Your error message says you have none bean available in the Spring container of given interface. A solution: Your missing DAO implementations: @Repository public class NotificationContainerImpl implements NotificationContainer {} @Repository public class UserContainerImpl implements UserContainer {} Your service class: @Service public class HelloWorld { @Autowired private NotificationContainer notificationContainer; @Autowired private UserContainer userContainer; // Implementation omitted... } I replaced the @Configurable annotation with @Service . @Configurable is used together with AspectJ and is not what you want here. You must use @Component or a specialization of it like @Service . Also remember to have all your Spring components inside your com.organization.sample package to enable the Spring container to find them. I hope this helps!
