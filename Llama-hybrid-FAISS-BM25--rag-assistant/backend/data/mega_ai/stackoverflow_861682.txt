Yes, you can use a generic Message type for WCF projects, which can be anything, really. However, this imposes a lot of work on you, both on the client side creating the message object (you basically have to manually create the XML that makes up the generic message), as well as the server side, since you can't rely on the nice XML serialization/deserialization anymore. You're dealing with basic, raw angle-bracket soup (straight XML). It works and it could be a solution - but maybe there are others, more elegant and useful solutions? Is that inheritance really needed at all? Think about your systems design. Marc
