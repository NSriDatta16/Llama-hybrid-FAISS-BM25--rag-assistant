What's a good range of weights to evaluate for $L_2$ regularized logistic regression?

I want to find a weight that minimizes an averaged cross validated misclassification score from an $L_2$ logistic regression classifier. Obviously, the search space for the weights should be bounded below by zero, but are there any other rules of thumb for selecting weights to test? Should I search in the log space?
