You can convert categorical data into vectors using embedding layer before the neural network input layer. You can check this about how to use mixed data for Neural Networks. Check how LSTM , RNN networks consume text input as time-series of word vectors. Word-vectors are computed for each word at the embedding layer whose dimensionality you can control by defining the embedding layer .
