You will have to pack your structure. The way to do that changes depending on the compiler you are using. For visual c++: #pragma pack(push) #pragma pack(1) struct PackedStruct { /* members */ }; #pragma pack(pop) This will tell the compiler to not pad members in the structure and restore the pack parameter to its initial value. Be aware that this will affect performance. If this struicture is used in critical code, you might want to copy the unpacked structure into a packed structure. Also, resist temptations to use the command line parameter that totally disable padding, this will greatly affect performance.
