Can I use Welch's t-test on proportion data?

I have conducted a Welch t-test to see if the group means in a school's average progress 8 scores (a measure of education attainment) are different for rural and urban schools. I also have data on the % students in each school who passed their maths GCSE, but I don't have data on the number of students in each school. Can I use a welch t-test on this % data or should I do something different to test there is a difference in group means for rural and urban schools?
