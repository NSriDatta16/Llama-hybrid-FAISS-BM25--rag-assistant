Clone the SharpPcap source and look at the examples I can't reference the exact example at the moment because I'm away from my development computer but I'm absolutely positive that there's an example of how to add additional LivePcapDevice instances. It's not impossible but the solution isn't intuitive. I think the example that uses is is called something along the lines of "CaptureMultipleFilters". Good luck and I'll update this answer with better data as soon as I can.
