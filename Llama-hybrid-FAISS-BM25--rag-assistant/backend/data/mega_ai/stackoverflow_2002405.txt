Have a look at: the jQuery gzoom plugin shiftzoom (example here ) the jQuery MapBox plugin (works with scroll whell and I'm sure you can stick + / - buttons) the MooZom plugin (works with scroll whell and I'm sure you can stick + / - buttons) Anything Zoomer is also nice Then, there is Zoomorama which is an alternative to Microsoft's Seadragon if you don't mind using flash.
