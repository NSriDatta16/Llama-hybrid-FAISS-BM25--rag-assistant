PHP - CMS - Framework

I am currently working on PHP sites (80% work is on heavy database queries) and also working with Zend Framework. In my 2 yr development experience I never worked on any CMS like Wordpress, Magento but I have idea how they work. Shall I continue with what I am doing or shall I switch myself towards CMS. Guide me which one is beneficial CMS vs. PHP and Zend Framework ?
