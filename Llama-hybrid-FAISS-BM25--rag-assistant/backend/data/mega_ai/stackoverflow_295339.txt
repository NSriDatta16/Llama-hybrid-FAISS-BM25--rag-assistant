Repcached for Win32 - has anyone built it?

I have finally got the green light to use Memcached in our project (after months of lobbying against a database-based caching solution - just don't ask...), however we will need to use Repcached as well to have backup copies of our data. Has anyone built this for Win32? We may end up using Linux in production, but development will very likely be taking place on Windows. Any hints or pointers are gratefully received - there appear to be lots of .T files, which I presume is TCL? That could be fun...
