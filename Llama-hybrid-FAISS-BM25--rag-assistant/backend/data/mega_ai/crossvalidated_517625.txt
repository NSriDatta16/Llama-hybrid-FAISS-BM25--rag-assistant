Modelling a multivariate changepoint analysis

I'm trying to model a multivariate multiple change point analysis. The data I have is as follows: Multiple sensors, positive count data, multiple change points and a time series. For example, imagine I have a bucket of oranges with n unreliable camera sensors. Each day I want to measure how many oranges I have based on the readings from my cameras (I don't know anything about the accuracy of the cameras - some may be good, some bad). . Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 Cam 1 0 1 2 2 Cam 2 0 1 2 2 Cam 3 0 1 3 2 I would want to identify Day 2 and Day 3 (with some uncertainty give Cam 3 disagrees). Optional extra: There is the additional and perhaps somewhat confusing rule that if multiple oranges are added they can only be removed one at a time. If the oranges were added one at a time, they can all be removed at once. For example, the following is not permitted: . Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Day 4 $y$ 0 2 0 0 Please help me describe the model in the usual notation, e.g.: $\tau \sim DiscreteUniform(0, 5)$ $\lambda_1 \sim Exp()$ $\lambda_2 \sim Exp()$ $y = Poisson(\tau > \lambda_1)$
