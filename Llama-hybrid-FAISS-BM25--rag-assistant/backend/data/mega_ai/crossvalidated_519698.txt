Validation for final model after cross validation

The classical way in machine learning is to split the dataset into three parts: train, validation and test. The train dataset is used to update the weights, the validation dataset is used during to evaluate the model during training and e.g. perform early stopping and the test set is used once at the very end to get a final score. When I use cross validation, I still have a separate test set, but I split the remaining samples into k-folds and train/validate with them k times. According to this answer, I use the whole dataset (that is not reserved for test) after cross validation to train my final model. Does that mean I don't validate here while training the final model? To clarify: I'm talking about how to train the final model after I did cross validation to select an algorithm and tune the parameters.
