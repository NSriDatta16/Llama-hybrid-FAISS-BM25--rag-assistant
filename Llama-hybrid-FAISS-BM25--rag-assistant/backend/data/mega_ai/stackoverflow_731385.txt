You could always have only one row per user and just concatenate messages together into one long record. If you're keeping messages for a long period of time, that isn't the best way to go, but it reduces your problem to a single find and concatenate at storage time and a single find at retrieve time. It's hard to say without more detail - part of what makes DB design hard is meeting all the goals of the system in a well-compromised way. Without all the details, its hard to give advice on the best compromise. EDIT: I thought I was fairly clear on this, but evidently not: You would not do this unless you were blanking a reader's queue when he reads it. This is why I prompted for clarification.
