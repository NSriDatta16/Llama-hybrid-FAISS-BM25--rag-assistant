SQL is a declarative language (i.e. focuses on the 'whats' and not the 'hows'). Hence its definition (ansi) does not contain procedurals and blocks. Most vendor implementations fill this void by embedding their own procedural language - TSQL in case of Microsoft, PL/SQL in case of Oracle etc. (Not sure of Mysql and SQLlite etc) - and even they dont do an exact feature match with Java (No anonymous codeblocks). Each SQL operation works on a set, and returns a set. Thus "mytable" is a set, "select from mytable" is a set , and "select from (select from mytable) " is a set. So its kind of not possible to drill down into a lower level of granularity, perhaps "columns" or pseudo columns are the 'variables' Oracle defines a "select from dual" operation to guarantee a 'loop' of 1 (i.e. a select statement that returns exactly 1 row)
