Yes, you can find code coverage information from within Visual Studio, provided that you have a version of Visual Studio that provides that functionality, such as the Team System. When setting up the unit tests in VS.NET, a localtestrun.testrunconfig file will be created and added as part of the solution. Double-click this file and find the option Code Coverage option on the left of the dialog. Select the assemblies for which you want to collect code coverage information and then re-run the unit tests. Code coverage information will be collected and is available. To get the code coverage information open the test results window and click on the code coverage results button, which will open an alternative window with the results.
