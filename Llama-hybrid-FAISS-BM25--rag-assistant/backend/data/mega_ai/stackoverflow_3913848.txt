How to create Date object from the string date in Javascript for the first years of A.D?

I have next date string: "Thu Nov 14 0002 01:01:00 GMT+0200 (GTB Standard Time)" and I'm trying to convert it to the Date object: date = new Date("Thu Nov 14 0002 01:01:00 GMT+0200 (GTB Standard Time)") => Invalid Date {} and it doesn't work. And date = new Date("Thu Nov 14 2 01:01:00 GMT+0200 (GTB Standard Time)") => Invalid Date {} doesn't work too but date = new Date("Thu Nov 14 2002 01:01:00 GMT+0200 (GTB Standard Time)") works Does anyone know an elegant way to parse it ?
