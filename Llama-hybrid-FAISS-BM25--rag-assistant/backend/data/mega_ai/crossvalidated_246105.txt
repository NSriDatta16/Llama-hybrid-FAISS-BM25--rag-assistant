Feature engineering, broadly speaking, does at least 2 things. First, you might clean, restructure, or transform your features in such a way that the useful information is enhanced and redundant or noise information is minimized. Perhaps you know that one category of people/products/widgets is totally irrelevant and remove them. Second, you might create new features based on domain knowledge in your particular field. In this case, you actually add new information that was not there previously. In my own work, it's been these engineered features that provide the most utility. This is probably difficult to teach, yet it's unfortunate your program overlooked this very important step.
