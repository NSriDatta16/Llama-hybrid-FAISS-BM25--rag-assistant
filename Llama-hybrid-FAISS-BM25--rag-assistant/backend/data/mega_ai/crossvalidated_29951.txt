Why don't you want to use grid search? It seems to me the only stable technique for SVM parameter estimation. Of course you can use adaptive search, but it can save you not so much time, but lead you to some strange results. And the implementation for CV procedure is pretty standart: Divide your dataset into two parts: $X_{train}$ and $X_{test}$. Run cycle through the parameter $d$ { Run cycle through $C$ { Train SVM with $X_{train}$, $d$ and $C$; Test on $X_{test}$; Remember the parameters, leading to the best result; } }
