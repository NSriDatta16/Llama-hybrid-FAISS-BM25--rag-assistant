Okay so this is tricky and from what I understand, I see two scenario's If you have multiple mortality rates and wish to calculate confidence interval on the average of these rates(which i am not sure about). $$CI = \bar X \pm Z_{\alpha/2} \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}$$ for large samples, replace $Z_\alpha$ with $t_\alpha$ for smaller models. Again $\bar X$ and $\hat \sigma$ can be calculated if you have multiple data points. $\bar X$ = Sum of the proportions / $n$ = count total $\sigma$ = standard deviation Again this is if you have multiple mortality rates and you want to do an infernec on its average. If you either have one point, or you want to infer on proportion of multiple points $$CI = p \pm Z_{\alpha/2}\frac{\sqrt{{\hat p\hat q/n}+{z^2_{\alpha/2}/4n^2}}}{1+{z^2_{\alpha/2}/n}}$$ Here $\hat p$ = proportion = 1 per 100,000 or 0.00001 and $\hat q$ = 1 - $\hat p$ for large data sets you can use the formula $$p \pm z_{\alpha/2} \sqrt {\hat p\hat q/n}$$
