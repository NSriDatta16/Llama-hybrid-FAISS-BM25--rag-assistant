Convolution Neural Network with 1 input channel

I am trying to make a sudoku solver using a convolution neural network with pytorch. I am failing to implement the architecture with one channel. There are many great tutorials which deal with images in CNN but I couldn't find any tutorial for CNN with 1 channel input matrix. Any suggestions or help is appreciated.
