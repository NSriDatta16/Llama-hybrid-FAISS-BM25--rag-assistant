Implement the following algorithms: Perceptron, margin perceptron: you can try to detect images of faces (classify images of faces and non-faces) using any face database. Try for example the MIT CBCL face database . You can also try the MNIST data and write a poor man's OCR system. LVQ, Kohonen map: you can try to compress images. You can download large images from any wallpaper site. Naive bayes classifier: you can classify spam and not spam. There are also more scientific datasets, such as Reuters and Newsgroups, etc. which you have to determine the topic, given the article. Backpropagation, multi layer perceptron: you can try this with the faces, or with the spam, or with the text/histogram data . Primal SVM linear learning using SGD: you can try this with MNIST digits, for example. There are a bunch of projects, some of them take a couple hours, some a couple of days, but you will definitely learn a lot.
