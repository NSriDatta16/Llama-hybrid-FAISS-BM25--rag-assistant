I've just released HgSccPackage v1.3.3 which have an option to add or remove Scc bindings from projects and solution. Use menu File->Change Scc Bindings, then select projects to remove Scc bindings in the list and press unbind button. You can download it here: http://bitbucket.org/zzsergant/hgsccpackage/downloads/
