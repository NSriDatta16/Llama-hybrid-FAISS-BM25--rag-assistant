How to override YUI Panel CLOSE button event?

I have a YAHOO Panel object defined like this: profilesDialog = new YAHOO.widget.Panel("profiles_dialog", { width: "705px", height: "609px", fixedcenter: "contained", close: true, draggable: true, zindex: 2, autofillheight: "body", visible: false, constraintoviewport: true, modal: true, zIndex: 1000 }); The "close: true" section of the config causes the little close button to be rendered in the panel. When you click on this little button the panel is hidden. Now I know that I can subscribe to the "beforeHideEvent" and that is desirable but what I want to know is if some conditions are met inside this "beforeHideEvent" how do I stop the panel from firing its own close method.
