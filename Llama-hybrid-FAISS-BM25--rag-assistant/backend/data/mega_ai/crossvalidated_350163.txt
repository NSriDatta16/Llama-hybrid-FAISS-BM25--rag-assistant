Here I show you the difference of the logarithm of the ratio of death per 1000 inhabitants, with regards to the previous year (therefore 1927 is not shown). Germany is shown in red while the average of other countries is shown in the thick black line. Germany had increases in the ratio in 5 out of 10 years. After 1932 it sayed above the average of other countries (and mostly positive), until 1937. Though why the logarithm? The reason is simple: the change from 2 to 1 is more drastic than the change from 1000 to 999 :) Code: x = read.table("clipboard", header = TRUE, dec = ".") xl = log(x[-1]) xd = apply(xl, 2L, diff) png("CVquestion.png") plot(0,0, xlim = range(x[-1,1]), ylim = range(xd), type = "n", ylab = "", main = "Difference of the log(death rate per 1000 inhab.)", xlab = "year") grid() for (i in rev(seq(ncol(xl)))) lines(x[-1,1], xd[,i], type = "o", col = adjustcolor(ifelse(i == 1, 2, 1), 0.7), lwd = ifelse(i == 1, 2, 1), lty = ifelse(i == 1, 1, 2), pch = ifelse(i == 1,16,NA)) lines(x[-1,1], rowMeans(xd[,-1]), type = "o", col = adjustcolor(1, 0.7), lwd = 2, lty = 1, pch = 16) text(x = 1937, y = rev(xd[10,]), label = rev(colnames(xd)), col = rev(c(2, rep(1,8)))) dev.off()
