Technologies, techniques , research what other scaled sites have used and done and what the problems they had were less than he successes, there are podcasts on iTunes, talks and interviews on Youtube look at industry best practices and follow them to a degree don't take peoples word for it, make sure you see the problem or the success as opposed to the pr glitz about it avoid obvious things that do not scale vertically or horizontally, database connectivity, sessions - cookies and the like look at nosql storage as an sql alternative less overhead but less functionality take care when looking at the language/framework. frameworks come with lots of baggage you do not need, they speed you up initially and slow you down eventually, i.e. you spend more time hacking the framework than building the site, same with languages does it do what you want rather than be trendy, cool to programme in etc.
