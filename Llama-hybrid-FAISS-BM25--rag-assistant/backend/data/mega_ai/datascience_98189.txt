determining size of batch, time of sending and memory in to send from scala to ML section

I have a time series (sampling time: 66.66 micro second, number of samples/sampling time=151), I would like to determine some anomalies in them, the inputs are made by scala customer message bus. would like to know how I can determine size of batch, time of sending and memory in Scala customer or ML/AL?
