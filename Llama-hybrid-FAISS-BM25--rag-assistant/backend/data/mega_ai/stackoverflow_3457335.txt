jgraph like component on vaadin framework

Currently I am working on a process manager kind application, which needs jgraph( http://www.jgraph.com ) kind of component. The process manager is a kind of process flow chart. I am currently using vaadin framework. Is there any such built in components available in vaadin or can i have any plugin to create a drag & drop graph for my app. Please let me know if any one has already done this.
