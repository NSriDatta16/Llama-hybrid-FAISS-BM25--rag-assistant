I'd never heard of interrupted time series analysis before this question, and I can't really speak to how it's different from regular time series analysis that involves sophisticated-enough techniques to handle "outliers" and seasonality. So I'd suggest looking more widely at time series literature in regards to seasonality effects -- which are sometimes confounding effects that researchers want to factor out, or are sometimes the focus of research -- and also "outliers". Your problem sounds a lot like marketing time series problems, where marketers want to know if ad campaigns are having an impact on consumer behavior. In that case, ad campaigns are often aperiodic -- i.e. when HQ thinks sales need a boost -- but may be periodic and repeating like "Our Big Summer Sale!". And, of course, there are always seasonal effects like Christmas, summer vacations, etc, that affects marketing/sales. You may run into issues where finance/marketing-related techniques are focused on monthly or quarterly time series and don't work very well on other timescales. State Space models are sophisticated but sometimes hard to use. ARIMA-based models might be useful. In the "outlier" literature you may see labels like AO (Additive Outlier, a one-time kind of thing), TC (Temporary Change, which sounds like your interventions), or LC (Level Change, a permanent shock). What is your goal, actually? Do you want to evaluate the impact of interventions? Do you want to look at the time series, "factoring out" interventions? Right now it feels like your question is a bit theoretical and perhaps caught in a particular genre of time series analysis that may be too restrictive for what you want to do.
