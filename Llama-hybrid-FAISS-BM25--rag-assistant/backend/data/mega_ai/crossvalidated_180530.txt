Neural Networks for Content Based Recommendation system

I'm working on the TED Dataset which has the transcript of each TED Talk. I have around 1000 such TED talk transcripts and I need to recommend 3 TED Talks based on the Transcript of these talks. As of now, I am converting the transcript to a bag of words model and then running TFIDF, LDA, LSI and such algorithms for dimensionality reduction based on semantic modeling, topic modeling etc. I'm curious to know if this problem could be modeled to a neural network solution. Is there anyway I could have a neural network on a Bag of words model which ultimately presents 3 TED talk recommendations?
