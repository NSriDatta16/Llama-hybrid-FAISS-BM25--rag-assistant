How is research based on the U.S. Census organized?

As I understand, most of the research is centralized through the U.S. Census Bureau. However, I couldn't find any overview of fields of research on their website. Is there any other institution or website that summarizes the research that has been done? I'd especially like to know which data is of most interest to researchers but everything seems to be so restricted and it is hard to find a collection of publications regarding research outcomes based on the census. I appreciate any advise or direction.
