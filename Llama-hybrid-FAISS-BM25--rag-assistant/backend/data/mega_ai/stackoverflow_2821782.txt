XML in SQL Server 2005? Better than JSON in Varchar?

What are the benefits of storing XML in SQL Server over storing JSON in a varchar field? Any tutorial available for how to use the XML data type effectively? Do I need to provide the dtd / xml schema somehow? I've heard it is optional, right? Thank you. UPDATE : here's the answer to the last part of the Q. XML schema information is used in storage and query optimizations. Typed XML instances contain typed values in the internal, binary representation as well as in XML indexes. This provides efficient processing of typed XML data. quoted from: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms345117(SQL.90).aspx
