Calculating formulae in Excel with Python

I would like to insert a calculation in Excel using Python. Generally it can be done by inserting a formula string into the relevant cell. However, if i need to calculate a formula multiple times for the whole column the formula must be updated for each individual cell. For example, if i need to calculate the sum of two cells, then for cell C(k) the computation would be A(k)+B(k). In excel it is possible to calculate C1=A1+B1 and then automatically expand the calculation by dragging the mouse from C1 downwards. My question is: Is it possible to the same thing with Python, i.e. to define a formula in only one cell and then to use Excel capabilities to extend the calculation for the whole column/row? Thank you in advance, Sasha
