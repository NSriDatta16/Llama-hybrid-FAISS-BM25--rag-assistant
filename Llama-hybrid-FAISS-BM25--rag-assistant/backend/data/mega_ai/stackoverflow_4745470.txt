If you're interested in performance, then there may be tree models that perform much faster than DOM (for example, if you're in the Java world, XOM) and that also offer much better usability. XPath is a high-level language, DOM APIs are much lower level. The main difference is therefore programmer productivity, ease of maintenance, etc. As to performance, a high-level language will usually be slower than a top-class programmer writing super-optimized code with a lower-level interface, but faster than an average programmer writing average code against a deadline.
