Support vector machines and Granger causality

I was wondering if Granger causality would be an efficient tool for searching for relevant input data for an SVM system. For example if I want to forecast SP 500 returns, I could put in my input data the libor rate, the USD/EUR exchange rate, the FTSE index, the Eurostoxx 50 index... Would it be relevant and meaningful to investigate, before adding those data to the SVM input features, if there is Granger causality beetween the SP index returns and the USD/EUR exchange rate and so on? Is Granger causality a adapted tool for SVM input data preselection?
