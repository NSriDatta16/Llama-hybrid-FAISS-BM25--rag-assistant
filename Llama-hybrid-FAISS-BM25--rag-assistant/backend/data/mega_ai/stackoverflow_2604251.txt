You're misunderstanding the documentation. Think of the application's data as a text document. A user can open the text document and type or delete things in it and it appears changed on screen but the file containing the text hasn't been saved yet. This is what's happening with your original table view: it's a visual presentation of the state of the data at that specific moment. Just as a user may type into a text document without the the changes being written to file, the same thing is happening with your application's data. Every time you click on the plus button, a new model is created and the application is correctly representing it visually. However, the disk storage hasn't written a single thing. The default Core Data application template from Xcode will save (write the data content to storage) when the user quits the app, making any data changes permanent. Until then, any changes are only affect what's in memory.
