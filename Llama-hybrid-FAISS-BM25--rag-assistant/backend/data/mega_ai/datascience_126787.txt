Before I start answering, please note that while posting queries on platforms like StackOverflow, it is essential to paste the code with the question and not to put a screenshot. If you need a working answer, you need to make the task easier for people by giving them access to your code so they can run it. Now, talking about the error, from what I can observe, you have been using the wrong syntax FeatureUnion(transformer_list= [('num_pipe', num_pipeline), ('cat_pipe', cat_pipeline)]) Above is the correct syntax. You need to pass a list of tuples, where the tuple's zeroth element is a name and the second element is the actual transformer or the pipeline. Moreover, FeatureUnion runs two or more transformers in parallel and concat the results side-by-side. So, you also need to make sure that the resulting matrices are of the same dimensions "row-wise".
