Why only accuracy is used in meta and few-shot learning as evaluation parameters?

I was going through many state-of-the-art papers in Meta-learning and few-shot learning, and I found that almost all use "accuracy" as evaluation criterion. Unlike other domains like object detection, NLP and other machine learning domain which use precision, recall, MAP, ROC etc. apart from accuracy. Why meta-learning uses only accuracy and no other parameter?
