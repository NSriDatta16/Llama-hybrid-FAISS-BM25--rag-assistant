Any table that will later be queried should use indexes. Look at INSERT DELAYED which returns quickly and is designed for logging:- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/insert-delayed.html This is probably the best option for log tables, although you could also look at the Archive storage engine, but that is more concerned with space than lookups:- http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/archive-storage-engine.html
