Matching the first that does not start with an image in regexp

In PHP, I'm trying to match the first paragraph tag that is not immediately followed by an tag, and add a class to that paragraph tag. For example, it would add a class to: Text and Strong text but not: Here's what I have so far which successfully adds a class to the first paragraph tag, but it doesn't skip until it finds a paragraph tag that doesn't immediately contain an image: preg_replace('/ /',' ', $text, 1); Thoughts? Apologies if that doesn't make sense.
