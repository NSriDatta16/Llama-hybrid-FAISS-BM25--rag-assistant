Probably this doesn't help anymore. But you should keep this in mind when creating the database. In mysql (depending on the table storage type, for instance in InnoDB) you can specify relations (They are called foreign key constraints ). These relations mean that if you delete an entry from one row (for instance products) you can automatically update or delete entries in other tables that have that row as foreign key (such as product_storage). These relations guard that you have a 100% consistent state. However these relations might be hard to add on hindsight. If you plan to do this more often, it is definitely worth researching if you can add these to your database, they will save you a lot of work (all kinds of queries become simpler) Without these relations you can't be 100% sure. So you'd have to go over all the tables, not which columns you want to check on and write a bunch of sql queries to make sure there are no entries left.
