Construct dynamically the XPath expression and then evaluate it: /table[@id='mytable']/tbody/tr[position() = {yourRandom}] where {yourRandom} must be substituted in the "skeleton" of the XPath expression with a random number obtained in the PL hosting XPath. For example in C# one would use the string.Format() method to construct the XPath expression. If you are using XSLT , the code that invokes the transformation may provide as an external parameter a sequence of random numbers encoded in an XML fragment. Then the XSLT code would use each consecutive random number for each XPath expression.
