Machine learning for multi-level response

I have a dataset with ~90000 observations and less than 10 features (all continuous). The problem is that the response variable has ~300 categories. Currently I would try to fit a multinomial linear model or a random forest. I have to predict probabilities for the 300 categories. I need some inspiration and would like to know which model others would use?
