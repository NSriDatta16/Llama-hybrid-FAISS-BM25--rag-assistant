Asymptotically unbiasedness of estimator

I am reffering to the formula given at 2:18 in following video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i7mqDJICzQ Can someone explain how he arrived from this: $\bar{X}=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^Nx_{i}$ to: $E(\bar{X})=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{i=1}^NE(x_{i})$ The first formula is the average of values of $x_i$. The second formula should be the "average of averages", right? If $N$ is the sample size, how can second formula be true?
