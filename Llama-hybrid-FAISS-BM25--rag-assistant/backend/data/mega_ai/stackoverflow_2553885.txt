One IBOutlet for two UILabels

I have two views within one .xib (one view for landscape, another for portrait). How can I use the same IBOutlet I've defined in @interface section for both labels if they have the same functionality. (ctrl+dragging to both of them does'n help-each time I drag to second, the first one loses its outlet).
