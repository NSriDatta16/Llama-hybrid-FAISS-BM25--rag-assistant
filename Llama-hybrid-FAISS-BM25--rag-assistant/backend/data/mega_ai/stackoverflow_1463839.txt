There are some undocumented but well know system procedures to read the errorlog from SQL itself: exec xp_enumerrorlogs 1 will list SQL Engine errorlog file numbers exec xp_readerrorlog , 1 will return the content of the requested Engine errorlog file. exec xp_enumerrorlogs 2 will list the Agent error log file numbers exec xp_readerrorlog , 2 will return the content of the requested Agent error log file. These are the procedures invoked by Management Studio to show the Engine and Agent logs.
