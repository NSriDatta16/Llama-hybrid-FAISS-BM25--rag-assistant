in the Bayesian framework there are no such things as true values. Although this is sort of true because basically everything is a random variable in the bayesian paradigm, I think it's incorrect to disallow the notion of a "true distribution " (i.e. true sampling function) in the bayesian paradigm. If this is the case, error could be understood as the distance between the prediction and the MAP estimate of the value under its true (unknown) distribution, which the Bayesian is attempting to converge upon in the posterior. If we're making point estimates (otherwise I'm not sure the notion of "residuals" has meaning, either) then this definition seems suitable and analogous to the frequentist use of the term. EDIT: Not necessarily "MAP" estimate, I guess. Really what I mean is whatever estimation procedure is being applied to the posterior, use that estimation procedure on the "true distribution" and let the difference between these estimates be your error.
