How to design image for splash screen?

I would like to show a splash screen image. I've read Screen compatibility overview about the different directories (ldpi, mdpi, ...) to create under res/ but I've not understood if, other than creating the same image of 240x320, 320x480 and 480x800 I need to do other things to achieve a good result. Can anyone suggest me which is the best thing to do?
