You can go lambda all the way by chaining Select (map) and Where (filter) instead of multiple FOR loops and IF statements // get results from the list of functions var results = CheckValues.Select(x => x()); // filter out only the relevant ones. var returnValues = results.Where(x => x != WhatHappened.Nothing); Basically, you should think more declaratively instead of imperatively when work ing with lambdas. It'll help you write more elegant code.
