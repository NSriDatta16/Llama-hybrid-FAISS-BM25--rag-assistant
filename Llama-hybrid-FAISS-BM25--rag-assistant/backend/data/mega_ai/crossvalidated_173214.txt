Durbin-Watson: test exogeneity

I have a time series for which I have built a linear regression, say $Y(t)=\beta X(t)$. A regression implies that $Y$ is actually a function of $X$ (that is, $Y(X)$), but not the other way around ($X(Y)$), right? (since $X$ is assumed to be exogenous to the model, and $Y$ is the endogenous variable.) Is the Durbin-Watson a good test to see if $X$ truly is exogenous? I am not sure I understood that test... All the explanations of the test about correlated errors are rather abstract; if someone knows of a time series graphical examples showing when the Durbin-Watson statistic says 0 or 2, it would be great to make intuitive sense of it.
