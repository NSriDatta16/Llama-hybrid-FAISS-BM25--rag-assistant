Eclipse - Galileo IDE force save of changed files before build?

When I used previous versions of Eclipse (e.g. Ganymede/Europa) if I had edited a file and then attempted a build Eclipse would prompt me to save first. Since I updated to Galileo (Build id: 20090920-1017 & just checked for updates) when I build I'm not prompted to save first. Perhaps the dialog had a checkbox for "don't tell me again" which I mistakenly checked on??? I figure it is just a preference setting some where but I can't seem to find it, search in Preferences for 'save' and for 'build' but did not find it. I tried "Save automatically before build" but that actually did not work for me, and isn't really what I was looking for anyways. Any ideas? thanks. Edit: I'm actually using an Ant script to 'build' (right click on script and Run As...Ant Build). So perhaps my original wording was a bit off base since I did not state how I was building.
