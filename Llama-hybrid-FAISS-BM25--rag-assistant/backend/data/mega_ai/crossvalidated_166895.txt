What is the difference between data normalization and feature extraction in deep learning?

I am learning about the multi-modal deep learning models and the papers I am reading are very confusing on one point in the process: "feature extraction" and "data normalization" seem to be used interchangeably. I always thought that feature extraction was the way to select certain attributes of the data instead of normalizing / scaling it. Am I wrong?
