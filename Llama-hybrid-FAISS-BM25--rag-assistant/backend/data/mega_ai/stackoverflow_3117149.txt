403 Forbidden is a HTTP status code returned by a web server when a user agent requests a resource that the server does not allow them to (wikipedia) The server is up and running, accepted you request but can't respond because you're not allowed to access some resource. So the problem is inside the First application, maybe this aplication trys to access some file system resources and the server does not have sufficient privileges.
