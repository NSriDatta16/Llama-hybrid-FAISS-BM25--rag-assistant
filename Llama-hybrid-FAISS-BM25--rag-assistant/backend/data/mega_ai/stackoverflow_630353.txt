C# is using reflection to look for a property called UserData.Sex , it is not smart enough to search for UserData and then Sex . So the answer to your question is 'No'. There are several ways to get around this, but the more elegant ways are either to add a property UserSex, or to flatten the object into a data table. At the moment, I can't think of a good way that doesn't break OO.
