Feedforwardnet for XOR

I'm using Matlab Neural Network Toolbox. I want learn feed forward net for my classification problem. But network doesn't learn anything useful, so I start checking network setting. I choose xor problem. I find that network doesn't learn xor if the output transfer function is set to logsig (log-sigmoid function)! Sample code: x = [0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1; 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1]; y =[0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0]; net = feedforwardnet([2 2]); net = configure(net,x,y); net.layers{3}.transferFcn = 'logsig'; %problem is here [net,tr] = train(net,x,y); net(x) The output is: 0.5000 0.5000 0.9985 0.5000 0.5000 0.5000 0.9985 0.5000 0.5000 0.5000 0.9985 0.5000 0.5000 0.5000 0.9985 0.5000 I try few times and I never got any value smaller then 0.5. If I comment 6th line which set transfer function to logsig the net learn perfect. Does anyone know why network with logsig doesn't work? P.S My matlab version MATLAB 7.12.0 (R2011a).
