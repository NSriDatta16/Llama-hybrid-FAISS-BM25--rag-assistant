Can Kruskal-Wallis be applied in this case?

In my experiment, I follow up 3 different groups of embryos for 12 timepoints. Each group has about a 100 embryos and I calculate the frequency (continuous variable) for each and tabulate the data for each timepoint, each group as average and SD. I want to compare for significant differences in the frequencies among these 3 groups for all 12 time points. I feel that the best thing to do here is a Kruskal Wallis test 12 times - once for each hour (timepoint). The distributions aren't normal There are significant number of outliers (since a major chunk of embryos in each group and time have zero frequency) The distributions aren't comparable (histograms don't look similar) amongst the three groups in each timepoint The overall data looks like this - plotted mean frequency of each group for each timepoint (individual distribution of frequencies not shown) Is there some other test I could use? Moreover this site mentions that if the distributions aren't similar, the KW test can be used only to compare mean ranks. What would this mean for a continuous variable like frequency? I need to compare observations within the red box, not across time. But I need to do it for every timepoint. I'm not interested to check for difference across time - it is known that there is a time-dependent pattern to the observations.
