Need help with this Bayesian Network problem?

From the problem above, is P(X|Y) not possible to determined since we are not given P(Y)? I've been stuck with this for days. Please give me some hints. Btw, from the given information, we have P(Y|X) = 0.6/0.4 = 1.5 --> is it not wrong to have a probability greater than 1.0 ?
