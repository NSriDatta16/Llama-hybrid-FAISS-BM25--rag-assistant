LOBs (including CLOBs) can be stored inline or out-of-line. Inline storage is more normal for smaller CLOBs (eg where typical values may be a few hundred bytes, but with occasional entries of several thousand). More details here Out-of-line storage corresponds to what you are saying about moving these CLOBs to a new table. So, don't bother doing that and, if it will help, simply use the "DISABLE STORAGE IN ROW" option. Which is better ? It depends. If it didn't, then Oracle would go with the best and not give you the option of the other. Storing inline means that each row takes up more space so you can have fewer rows in your memory cache, which means you need to hit the disk more often, which is slower. Storing them separately means that, when you want those columns, you need to get additional data blocks, probably from the disk rather than cache and this will be slower. If you use the CLOBs often, and they are smallish, then you are probably better off in-row. But why store XML as CLOB rather than XMLType ?
