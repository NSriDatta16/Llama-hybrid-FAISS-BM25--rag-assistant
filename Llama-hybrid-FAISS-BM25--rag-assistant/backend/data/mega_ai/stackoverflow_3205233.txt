Adding arbitrary Ruby code in order to please your editor doesn't seem reasonable to me at all. I think you should try to get a decent text editor, one that would be able to configure to use some keyword you put in your comments to enable code folding there, for example: # region start AAA some(:code, :here) # region end AAA And if you allow me to be sarcastic: you should know that Ruby is lot more expressive, elegant and pretty than C#, and chances are that there isn't any Ruby code ought to be hidden in the first place! ;)
