jQuery - click-event is called twice on iPad

I have a problem with my web application which is designed for iPad. I use jQuery and jQuery UI for dragging elements on the screen. Because on iPad, the element can not be dragged by default, I added this library: http://code.google.com/p/jquery-ui-for-ipad-and-iphone/ Including it, I can drag and drop elements on iPad, but also a problem occurs. I have on the draggable element also a div are with an image, which should be clickable. So I integrate these lines: $(document).ready(function() { $(".note").draggable(); $('.closebutton').click(function() { alert("test"); }); }); â€‹ The problem is, including the drag-library, the alert message test pops up twice or the screen is frozen. I created a full working demo here: http://jsbin.com/oliwo/2/ On normal desktop browsers, like Firefox 4 Beta and Safari, it works, only one test message appears by clicking with the mouse on the x - delete image. On iPad, I get the message twice or the screen froze. Does anyone can help me? Thank you a lot in advance & Best Regards.
