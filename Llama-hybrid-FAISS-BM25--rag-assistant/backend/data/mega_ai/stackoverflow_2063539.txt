After you create the pipe and have pipe handles, you read and write using the ReadFile and WriteFile APIs: see Named Pipe Client in MSDN for a code example. However, I'm at loss exactly how to use them. The "Named Pipe Client" section which I quoted above gives an example of how to use them. For example, what are the types of all the arguments The types of all the arguments are defined in MSDN: see ReadFile and WriteFile how do I convert from a buffer of bytes which I presumably receive from the ReadFile method into a string and vice/versa? You're sending the string using ASCIIEncoding , so you'll receive a string of non-Unicode characters. You can convert that to a string, using the overload of the std::string constructor which takes a pointer to a character buffer plus a sencond parameter which specifies how many characters are in the buffer: //chBuf and cbRead are as defined in the //MSDN "Named Pipe Client" example code fragment std::string received((const char*)chBuf, cbRead);
