How to evaluate time-series model on a longer validation period than the forecast horizon

I'm training ARIMA and Random forest models to forecast on a horizon of 3 days, but need to evaluate models using one full year. What's the proper way to handle the following problems: I've noticed most librairies don't have options to set a validation larger than the forecast horizon, is there a reason? 365 days is not a multiple of my forecast horizon (3 days). Is it a problem? The librairies I'm using compute the RMSE for one horizon. If a do the RMSE average of on all horizons, I don't get the RMSE of the full year since RMSE is not a linear metric. Should I stop using the RMSE computed by the libraries? When evaluating my models, should I consider every day as a forecast day, or only forecasting every forecast horizon (i.e. every 3 days here)
