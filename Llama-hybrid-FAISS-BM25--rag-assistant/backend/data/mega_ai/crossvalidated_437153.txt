It simply means their general value. For M=0 you get something that is less than one, as M increase the general (absolute) value of the coefficients increase... For M = 9 most coefficients are over 1000, but there are some exception ( $w_0$ = 0.35). The use of 'magnitude' here convey that idea that the general value increase with M without specifying an exact metric (average value, difference between min and max... etc.). The important word in the paragraph you cite is 'typically' meaning that this is a rule of thumbs, not an exact rule over an exact metric.
