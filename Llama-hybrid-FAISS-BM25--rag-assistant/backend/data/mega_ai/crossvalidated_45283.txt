You can calculate it from your IMA model. If your time series with moving average parameter $\theta$ is given by $Y_t = Y_{t-1} +\epsilon - \theta\epsilon_{t-1}$ (where $\epsilon_t$ is the innovation at $t$, & the innovations are Normally i.i.d.) then the one-step ahead forecast is $\hat{Y}_t(1) = (1-\theta)Y_t+(1-\theta)\theta Y_{t-1}+(1-\theta)\theta^2 Y_{t-2}+\ldots$ from which you get the updating equation $\hat{Y}_t(1) = (1-\theta)Y_t+\theta\hat{Y}_{t-1}(1)$ So $\alpha=1-\theta$ Higher values of $\alpha$ pull the forecast more strongly towards recent observed values.
