When talking about how "beautiful" a design is, you're never going to agree on anything. Better to reduce the discussion to facts and figures: Defect rates, average defect time-to-solve, and other various statistics to detect code quality Metrics to measure features delivered (e.g. lines of code), and comparisons to commonly accepted industry models like COCOMO Metrics to measure project time to market, again with comparisons to common models. If the facts say you're doing your job well, your boss has no argument. If your boss insists on arguing, you need a better boss (he's probably just trying to prevent you from getting a pay raise or something like that).
