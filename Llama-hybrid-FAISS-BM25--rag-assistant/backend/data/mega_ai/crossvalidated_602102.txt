If you are doing time series forecasting in the presence of such time-shifting predictors, then De Livera et al. (2011) would probably be of interest. Their proposed methodology (BATS/TBATS) aims at modeling and forecasting complex seasonality, and one of their applications actually is to Turkish electricity demand, which is heavily influenced by Eid al-Fitr and Eid al-Adha. An ungated version of the paper is available at Rob Hyndman's site , and their method is implemented in the forecast package for R.
