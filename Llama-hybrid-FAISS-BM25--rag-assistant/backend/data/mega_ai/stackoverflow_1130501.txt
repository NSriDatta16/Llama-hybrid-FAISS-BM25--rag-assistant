Distributed Key-Value Data Store with Offline Access (Static Partitioning)

Need to be able to set server(s) that replicate all information, as a master data store that has all the data. Also need servers that specifically store/replicate certain data, available in local LANs, so that when the internet connection goes down, they can still access their local data. Under normal circumstances, the clients will access most of their data from the local LAN, and may use others when the local LAN server goes down. This is wanted alongside the benefits of a distributed data store, such as failure resistance and speed. Which Distributed Key-Value Data Store or other data storage method would be most suited for this?
