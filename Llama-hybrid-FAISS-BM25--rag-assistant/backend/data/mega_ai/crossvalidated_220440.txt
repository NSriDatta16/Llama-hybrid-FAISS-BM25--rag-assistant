Difference between Granger Causality and AR1

Here are my questions: is there a difference between "VAR(1)" and "AR(1)"? Granger Causality inspects the direction of causality. In return, we receive a p-value on how much a time series is likely to contribute to a better prediction of the other. Choi and Varian (2009) apply an "AR" model to look whether adding Google Search to the regression improves the prediction. Here, we can measure the magnitude of the effect. Is it okay to apply Choi & Varian's AR method even though data is not mixed, but same frequency? Why seems to be there no paper that applies both Granger and Choi/Varian's method? From my naive understanding, Granger can measure the direction of the effect while Choi & Varian's model can help to measure the magnitude of the effect. As such, both analysis might make sense in a paper?
