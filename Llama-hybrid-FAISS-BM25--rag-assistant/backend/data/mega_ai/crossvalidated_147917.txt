False Coverage Rate for confidence intervals of positive likelihood ratios of multiple dependent tests

I want to calculate confidence intervals of positive likelihood ratios of multiple dependent tests. To adjust the confidence level for the 'problem of multiple comparisons', I believe I should control the False Coverage Rate for the confidence intervals, using the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure (or something equivalent) to take into account the positive dependence of the tests. However, it is not entirely clear to me how to do this for confidence intervals of positive (or negative) likelihood ratios, since the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure requires p-values. Is there a way to convert positive likelihood ratios to p-values or should I do something else?
