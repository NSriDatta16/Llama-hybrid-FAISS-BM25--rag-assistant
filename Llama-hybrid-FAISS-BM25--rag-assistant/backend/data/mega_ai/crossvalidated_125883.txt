RF is very robust and powerful, but it can succumb to over-fitting by having small trees for each case it is exposed to and fail miserably on unseen data. Which method works better really depends on your data. A couple things look at: Make sure you are evaluating performance on data that the model has never seen. Check the feature importances you get out of RF. You might find some features are useless and may be causing issues with SGD. SGDClassifier has many different options, so a parameter sweep might reveal a better configuration. SGD is a linear model really, so perhaps you could try one of the Naive Bayes models or a Neural Network model.
