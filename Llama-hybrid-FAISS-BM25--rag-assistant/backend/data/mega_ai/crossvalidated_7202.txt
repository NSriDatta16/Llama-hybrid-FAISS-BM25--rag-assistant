Regression with Pooled data in SPSS

Context: I have "pooled data" with time and cross section dimensions. It is unbalanced data without a full range of time observations for each cross section of observations. It is kind of like unbalanced panel data? I wish to proceed with the limited number of observations without losing any data. Questions: How can I get regression results (generalized least squares?) in SPSS with this kind of data? What should I pay attention to when evaluating the results?
