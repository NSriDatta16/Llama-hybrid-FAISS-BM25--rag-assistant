Mock up a prototype and use a profiler on it before you even begin to think about micro-optimization perf. Remember: if it is a constant (or even a small change to a co-efficient), Big-O treats it the same.

Also, implicit casts make bugs much more likely when using unsigned types. For example: #include void SomeFunction(uint32_t value) { if(value -294967296
