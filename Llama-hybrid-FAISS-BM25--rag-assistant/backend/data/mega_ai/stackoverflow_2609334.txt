What is order notation f(n)=O(g(n))?

Question 1: Under what circumstances would O(f(n)) = O(k f(n)) be the most appropriate form of time-complexity analysis? Question 2: Working from mathematical definition of O notation, how to show that O(f(n)) = O(k f(n)) , for positive constant k ? For the first Question I think it is average case and worst case form of time-complexity. Am I right? And what else should I write in that? For the second Question, I think we need to define the function mathematically. So is the answer something like because the multiplication by a constant just corresponds to a readjustment of value of the arbitrary constant k in definition of O ?
