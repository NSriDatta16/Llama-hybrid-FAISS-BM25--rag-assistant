Adding a custom item to a Silverlight ComboBox bound to ObservableCollection

I have a search screen within my application that has a ComboBox which is bound to an ObservableCollection in a ViewModel (the collection contains Organisation entities returned via WCF from an Entity Framework model). I wish to add an item to the combo representing "All Organisations" - so the user does not have to specify an organisation when searching. Is there a way of adding custom items to a ComboBox or do I have to add a dummy Organisation to the collection and carry out the necessary logic when this is selected.
