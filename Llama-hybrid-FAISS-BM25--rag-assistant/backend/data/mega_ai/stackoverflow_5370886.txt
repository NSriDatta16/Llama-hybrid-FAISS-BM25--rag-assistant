In my experience, the NSURL creation routines usually throw an exception instead of returning nil. However, the real question in this case is what constitutes a malformed URL? Are you checking whether a resource exists, or checking whether the structure of the string conforms to the relevant RFCs? With regards to the first issue I mentioned, when creating URLs that I don't manually enter myself I usually do this: @try { NSURL * url = [NSURL URLWithString: theString]; // use the URL } @catch (NSException * e) { NSLog( @"URL creation error? %@ - %@", [e name], [e reason] ); @throw; // throw the exception again, to hopefully get your attention }
