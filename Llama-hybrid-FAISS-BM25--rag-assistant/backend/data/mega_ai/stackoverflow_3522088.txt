Embedding XSL code inside an tag

I have some XML data which includes URIs. I want to list the URIs on an ASP page, but also to make them clickable using tags. However XSLT does not allow you to embed an XSL command within a tag, eg: More information " alt="More information" target=_blank> How can I include the URL in the tag after the code?
