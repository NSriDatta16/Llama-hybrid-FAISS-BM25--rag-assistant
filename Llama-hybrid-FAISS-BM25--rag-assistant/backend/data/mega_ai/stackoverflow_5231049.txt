In my opinion the choice between tree ways which you describes should depend on two additional aspects: 1) your know-how in all the technologies and 2) the time and comfort factors. Do you need more quick and dirty solution or you want to defign your backend in general? The more the time factor important for your the more you should make your choice mostly based on your current know-how. I could suggest you one more way which I personally prefer. I like to have clear separation of data and business interface from the visualization of the data on the web site. So I design RESTful WFC service having the user authenthication and authorization and which implement the whole business logic of the site. I publish the WCF service as the part of my web site (see here for details). If needed one can write Unit Tests to test the WCF service as the core of the site. After you have WCF service you can choose the presentation part of your site. I personally know and like jqGrid. It has many features which allows you create very comfortable GUI on the web site. The grids for admin components can have both toolbar searching and advanced searching. Sorting by the column, resizing of the grid columns, reordering with drag&grop, hiding unneeded columns and so on can be implemented very easy. The filtering of data for advanced searching or/and toolbar searching will take more your time for programming on the server, but you will can use this feature in all your grids. It's important, that to be able to use server side paging and filtering you should extend the interface of the web service with the methods having information about paging, sorting and filtering. If you decide to use jqGrid your MVC Views can contain mostly empty tables and one JavaScript per the grid. The JavaScript will use jqGrid which call WCF service to fill the grid. The in ASP.NET MVC you can mostly construct menu and workflow, which can be user dependend (depend on the user rights on the site). So I think that you should make your choice yourself based on requiremetns which you have, your know-how in all the technology, the time factor and the comfort requirement to the site. In all situations you will need to decide how you should design the site to show and make possible to modify all categories, subcategories and other hierarchical and dependend objects.
