Which STL container to use if I want it to ignore duplicated elements?

I am looking for some STL (but not boost) container, which after the following operations will contain 2 elements: "abc" and "xyz": std::XContainer string_XContainer; string_XContainer.push_back("abc"); string_XContainer.push_back("abc"); string_XContainer.push_back("xyz"); By the way, I need it just in order to call string_XContainer.size() in the end, to get the total number of unique strings. So maybe I don't even need a container, and there is a more elegant way of doing it?
