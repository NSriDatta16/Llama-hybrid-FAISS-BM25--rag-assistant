How does TF-IDF classify a document based on "Score" alloted to each word

I understand how TF-IDF "score" is calculated for each word in a document, but I do not get how can it be used to classify a test document. For example, if the word "Mobile" occurs in two texts, in the training data, one about Business (like the selling of Mobiles) and the other about Tech, then how does the "score" for word "Mobile", in both training and test document over the given dataset, help the algorithm to classify whether the text (a new test document) belongs to "Business" category or "Tech" category? I'm new to NLP, thanks in advance!
