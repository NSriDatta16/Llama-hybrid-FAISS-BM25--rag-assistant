EDIT: I've updated based upon the code supplied. Basically we've got something to the effect of this: Untitled Document #main { min-width: 980px; margin: 0 auto; font-size: 0.75em; padding:101px 0 37px 0; } header { height:101px; background:url(../images/footer_tail.jpg) left top repeat #0d0d0d; position:fixed; top:0; left:0; width:100%; z-index:100; } footer { overflow: hidden; position:absolute; bottom:0; left:0; width:100%/*; height:37px*/; background:url(../images/footer_tail.jpg) left top repeat #0d0d0d; color:#9d9d9d; text-transform:uppercase } ... ... with anchor a couple paragraphs down the page ... As written the anchors links are buried under the top navigation. It seems the only solid fix is to use 'CSS frames' to get the content to display correctly, which requires the following CSS tweaks: #main { padding:0 0 37px 0; } section#content { position:fixed; top:101px; width:100%; bottom:37px; overflow:auto; } footer { position:fixed; height:37px; } So I've removed the top padding from #main. Then I made the content and footer fixed position. Because of this the content has to be moved down 101px, hence the top. I then had to give the footer a height, and then put that same amount as a bottom on the content. Overflow auto gives us scrollbars, and width of 100% puts those bars in a reasonable place. Tested on IE 9, Chrome 10, Firefox 4, and Opera 11. Edit 2: And unfortunately I can't find much online about this particular method. Eric Meyer talks about it in Smashing CSS. It doesn't look like any of the existing resources online test for how anchor links will work with the content, which is pretty unfortunate.
