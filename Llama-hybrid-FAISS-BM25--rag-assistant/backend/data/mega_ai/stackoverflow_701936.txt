Are iterators also generator expressions? Lazy evaluation? An iterator is just an object with a next method. What the documentation means most of the time when saying that a function returns an iterator is that its result is lazily loaded. Thus, with this the memory footprint of python is going to reduce drastically. Isn't it? It depends. I'd guess that the average program wouldn't notice a huge difference though. The performance advantages of iterators over lists is really only significant if you have a large dataset. You may want to see this question .
