Application of the law of large numbers

In the book by Christian Robert and George Casella on Monte Carlo Statistical Methods , they use an argument of LLN on pages 551 and 552. I'm attaching the argument in this screen shot $t$ is representing time. $i$ is representing the Monte Carlo sample so that \begin{equation} z_t^{(i)} \sim g \quad\quad \text{is the $i$th sample of z at time $t$}. \end{equation} I understand how the first expression is obtained, so take is as given. What i don't follow is the argument after this first expression. the text reads "using the LLN for the sum within the exponential", but with respect to what index? isn't (i) fixed? It seems that the expectation just popped up inside the exponential (with respect to $g$). What I expect from this part is an argument explaining the degeneracy of the weight $w_t^{(i)}$ that have tendency to go to zero for most of the $i$'s as $t$ increases (which I think happens for small values of $i$, since this method is consistent, and letting $i\to \infty$ we get convergence) EDIT: It is clear for me now that when we assume that the pdfs are time independent and we have $z_t$ as i.i.d. over $t$, we will be able to apply the LLN inside the exponential by writing \begin{equation} \exp\left\{-t \sum_{\ell = 1}^t \frac{1}{t} \log\left( g(z_\ell^{(i)})/f(z_\ell^{(i)} \right) \right\} \end{equation} But what happens when we try to take the limit ? We have to do this inside the exponential and only to a part of the argument, namely $\sum_{\ell = 1}^t \frac{1}{t} \log\left( g(z_\ell^{(i)})/f(z_\ell^{(i)} \right)$. So what happens to that $-t$ outside the limit? and what can you imply now on $w_t^{(i)}$ on the left hand side of the proportionality relation?
