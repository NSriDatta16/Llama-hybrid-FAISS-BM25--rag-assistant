The idea of how one can use single arm trials is that you assume that outcomes vary across trials, but that they are somewhat similar (assumption of exchangeability). If you have multiple single-arm trials with the same treatment, then you can estimate how much outcomes vary for the same treatment. You might for example assume that this is the same across all treatments. If so, you can then compare the outcomes in different trials - if you do that, the variability in the comparison is not just the within trial sampling variability, but also in addition the between trial variability. This may be best done in the parameterization given by Piepho et al. (Piepho, H.-P., Williams, E. R., and Madden, L. V. (2012). The use of two-way linear mixed models in multitreatment meta-analysis. Biometrics, 68(4):1269-1277.). In principle, this works fine (i.e. you can give numbers to a software and results come out), but you must assume that there is no systematic difference between single arm trials for different drugs, as well as between each set of single arm trials and other multi-arm trials. This will definitely be something to caveat a lot in the discussion of your results. You can try - to some extent - to estimate from the data whether there are such differences, but this may be difficult depending on how much data you have. In a Bayesian analysis with (weakly-)informative priors the relevant parameters can usually be estimated, if often not too well, in which case you cannot get much out of across-trial comparisons (which is perhaps quite reasonable). The most basic vanilla version of this (that is the least robust) can be implemented with any software that can fit random effects GLM with given standard errors (while I don't know STATA, I assume it can do that, but perhaps not in the package you mention). It may be best to get some support for implementing your analyses from a statistician experienced in network meta-analyses.
