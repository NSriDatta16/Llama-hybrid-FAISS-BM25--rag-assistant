Algorithmic entities refer to autonomous algorithms that operate without human control or interference. Recently, attention is being given to the idea of algorithmic entities being granted (partial or full) legal personhood. Professor Shawn Bayern and Professor Lynn M. LoPucki popularized through their papers the idea of having algorithmic entities that obtain legal personhood and the accompanying rights and obligations. Legal algorithmic entities Academics and politicians have been discussing over the last few years whether it is possible to have a legal algorithmic entity, meaning that an algorithm or AI is granted legal personhood. In most countries, the law only recognizes natural or real persons and legal persons. The main argument is that behind every legal person (or layers of legal persons), there is eventually a natural person. In some countries there have been made some exceptions to this in the form of the granting of an environmental personhood to rivers, waterfalls, forests and mountains. In the past, some form of personhood also existed for certain religious constructions such as churches and temples. Certain countries – albeit for publicity purposes – have shown willingness to grant (some form of) legal personhood to robots. On the 27th of October 2017, Saudi Arabia became to first country in the world to grant citizenship to a robot when it gave “Sophia” a passport. In the same year, official residency status was granted to a chatbot named “Shibuya Mirai” in Tokyo, Japan. The general consensus is that AI in any case cannot be regarded as a natural or real person and that granting AI (legal) personhood at this stage is unwanted from a societal point of view. However, the academic and public discussions continue as AI software becomes more sophisticated and companies are increasingly implementing artificial intelligence to assist in all aspects of business and society. This leads to some scholars to wonder whether AI should be granted legal personhood as it is not unthinkable to one day have a sophisticated algorithm capable of managing a firm completely independent of human interventions. Brown argues that the question of whether legal personhood for AI may be granted is tied directly to the issue of whether AI can or should even be allowed to legally own property. Brown “concludes that that legal personhood is the best approach for AI to own personal property.” This is an especially important inquiry since many scholars already recognize AI as having possession and control of some digital assets or even data. AI can also create written text, photo, art, and even algorithms, though ownership of these works is not currently granted to AI in any country because it is not recognized as a legal person. United States Bayern (2016) argues that this is already possible currently under US law. He states, that, in the United States, creating an AI controlled firm without human interference or ownership is already possible under current legislation by creating a “zero member LLC”: (1) an individual member creates a member-managed LLC, filing the appropriate paperwork with the state; (2) the individual (along, possibly, with the LLC, which is controlled by the sole member) enters into an operating agreement governing the conduct of the LLC; (3) the operating agreement specifies that the LLC will take actions as determined by an autonomous system, specifying terms or conditions as appropriate to achieve the autonomous system’s legal goals; (4) the sole member withdraws from the LLC, leaving the LLC without any members. The result is potentially a perpetual LLC—a new legal person—that requires no ongoing intervention from any preexisting legal person in order to maintain its status. Sherer (2018) argues – after conducting an analysis on New York's (and other states’) LLC law(s), the Revised Uniform Limited Liability Company Act (RULLCA) and US case law on fundamentals of legal personhood – that this option is not viable, but
