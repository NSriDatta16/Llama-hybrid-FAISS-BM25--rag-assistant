While OMG Ponies answer is entirely correct I'd rather put it like this: You're confusing SELECT f() with SELECT literal . SELECT f() executes a function and returns its result. And, a table returning function can also be written as SELECT * FROM f() -- which is even more elegant. Because Pg doesn't yet have stored procedures -- less scheduling they can be done through functions -- we use SELECT as Microsoft SQL uses EXECUTE SELECT LITERAL is a method of returning a literal (something that can fit in a row/column).
