emmeans post-hoc comparison of model with interaction and control variables

I am using this mixed model including fixed effects and random intercepts and slopes: model=lmer(volt ~ (congruency + condition + channel)^2 - congruency:channel + sessorder + (1 + congruency_code* (condition_code + condition_codelevel3) + sessorder_code + sessorder_codelevel3 + channel_code + channel_codelevel3|pp), REML=T, data=data, control=contr1) with all the fixed effects being categorical variables ( congruency ,2levels; condition ,3levels; channel ,3levels) and sessorder being used as a control variable (3levels). In a post-hoc test using emmeans I would like to investigate the significant relationship between "condition*channel". For this I am using this code: emms The results in R indicate that: Results are averaged over the levels of: congruency, sessorder Degrees-of-freedom method: kenward-roger P value adjustment: bonferroni method for 9 tests My question is, is it a problem that this is averaged over my significant control variable "sessorder"? Do I have to take this variable into account somehow for the post-hoc test?
