How to find relationships between different types of events (defined by their 2D location)?

I have a dataset of events that happened during the same period of time. Each event has a type (there are few different types, less then ten) and a location, represented as a 2D point. I would like to check if there is any correlation between types of events, or between the type and the location. For example, maybe events of type A usually don't occur where events of type B do. Or maybe in some area, there are mostly events of type C. What kind of tools could I use to perform this ? Being a novice in statistical analysis, my first idea was to use some kind of PCA (Principal Component Analysis) on this dataset to see if each type of event had its own component, or maybe some shared the same (ie were correlated) ? I have to mention that my dataset is of the order of 500'000 points $(x, y, type)$, thus making things a bit harder to deal with. EDIT: As noted in the answers below and the comments, the way to go is to model this as a marked point process, and then use R to do all the heavy-lifting, as explained in details in this workshop report : http://www.csiro.edu.au/resources/Spatial-Point-Patterns-in-R.html
