Can The linearly non-separable data be learned using polynomial features with logistic regression?

I know that Polynomial Logistic Regression can easily learn a typical data like the following image: I was wondering whether the following two data also can be learned using Polynomial Logistic Regression or not. I guess I have to add more explanation. Assume the first shape. If we add extra polynomial features for this 2-D input (like x1^2 ...) we can make a decision boundary which can separate the data. Suppose I choose X1^2 + X2^2 = b. This can separate the data. If I add extra features I will get a wavy shape (maybe a wavy circle or wavy ellipsis) but it still can not separate the data of the second graph, can it?
