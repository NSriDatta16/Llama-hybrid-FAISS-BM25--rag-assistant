Time to follow up! Here's the solution I was given: We will construct a confidence interval of the form $[0,T(X))$, where $T(\cdot)$ is some statistic. By definition this will be a confidence interval with confidence level at least 99% if $$(\forall \mu \in \mathbb R )(\forall \sigma > 0)\; \mathbb P_{\mu,\sigma_2}(\sigma^2 > T(X)) The confidence interval (which is very wide) is slightly conservative in simulation, with no empirical coverage (in 100,000 simulations) lower than 99.15% as I varied the CV over many orders of magnitude. For comparison, I also simulated cardinal's confidence interval. I should note that cardinal's interval is quite a bit narrower--in the 99% case, his ends up being up to about $6300X^2$, as opposed to the $10000X^2$ in the provided solution. Empirical coverage is right at the nominal level, again over many orders of magnitude for the CV. So his interval definitely wins. I haven't had time to look carefully at the paper Max posted, but I do plan to look at that and may add some comments regarding it later (i.e., no sooner than a week). That paper claims a 99% confidence interval of $(0,4900X^2)$, which has empirical coverage slightly lower (about 98.85%) than the nominal coverage for large CVs in my brief simulations.
