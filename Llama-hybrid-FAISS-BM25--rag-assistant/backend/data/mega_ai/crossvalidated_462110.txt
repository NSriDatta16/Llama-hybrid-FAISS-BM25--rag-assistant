As this study was at different points in time in a changing world, the assumption that even re-sampling the same people would produce statistically consistent answers is, perhaps, questionable. However, as you do have some repeat respondents in the survey data, and I would suggest an examination of the consistency of repeat individuals scoring as a metric to evaluate reputed differences between years. Some related work, for example, 'Repeated Measures, Interventions, and Time Series Analysis , to quote from the abstract: Classical repeated measures designs assume treatments are given in a randomized order. When randomization is not performed and an experiment involves a sequence of observations on each subject collected over time, serial correlations may become important. An example of these types of data is an intervention experiment wherein subjects are observed before and after a treatment or other manipulation. This situation falls within the realm of time series analysis. The correlations between observations often depend on the time intervals between the observations; observations that are closely spaced in time usually are more highly correlated than those with a larger time separation. This report demonstrates a test for such serial correlation and discusses a method of adjusting for it in repeated measures experiments. So, as you mentioned that a school was subject to an intervention, and as the above cites possible serial correlation issue occurring with time series data, a more advanced modeling perspective may be appropriate.
