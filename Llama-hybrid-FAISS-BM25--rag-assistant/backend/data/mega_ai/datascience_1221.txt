Python is easy to use and manage in Linux. The Python package manager PIP and the Python environment manager Virtualenv are both fully supported in Linux. See: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/install/linux/ The PyCharm IDE from JetBrains is also available for free in Linux (community edition), and it runs well. This is a great tool for a Python developer. In addition, if you need to integrate other tools, they will most likely be best supported in Linux. Need a MapReduce in your app? Hadoop will run in Linux. Need to store data in MySQL? Linux. Most data science tools are open source, and most open source technologies are supported best in Linux. There is also no cost for running Linux. If you need to keep Windows for your primary work computer (like your laptop), then you can install Linux on a server and use Putty to SSH into the Linux machine. You would then perform your work on the Linux machine, though you would still be running Windows locally.
