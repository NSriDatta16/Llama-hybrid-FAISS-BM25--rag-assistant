I can see that they are very close to 0 starting from lag 3, what gives me the idea of it being white noise White noise should have close to zero autocorrelations for all (nonzero) lags, not only from the third lag on. Perhaps your time series is better approximated by an MA(2) process of the form $$ x_t=\mu_t+\varepsilon_t+\theta_1\varepsilon_{t-1}+\theta_2\varepsilon_{t-2} $$ with $\varepsilon_t$ being white noise. For such a process, you would see nonzero autocorrelation at lags 1 and 2 and zero autocorrelation beyond that. MA(2) is of course not white noise, and the Ljung-Box test is likely picking that up.
