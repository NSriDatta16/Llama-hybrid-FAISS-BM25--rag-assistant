You can model survey data with logistic regression. A survey at best can provide evidence for correlation, never causation. The validity of the correlation is a result of the survey methodology and subsequent analysis. There is a decision to be made on how to handle inference on the parameters. In other words, how far do the conclusions extend? The most conservative approach would be to treat the results as summary statistics of the empirical sample. A step further would assume that the results are representative of other "individuals who came into a homeless shelter". An additional extension would be to apply the results to other homeless individuals that did not seek shelter. Ultimately, it is a subjective decision.
