For non-linear SVMs you can't extract a simple relation of features that provides the classification rule. That's the whole point around the kernel trick and the representation of the problem in the dual. In other words, your classification rule is not based on some relation of the features, but on the similarity of the unlabelled sample to some of the labelled examples of the training set - not all of them only the Support Vectors. The similarity is defined using the kernel function.
