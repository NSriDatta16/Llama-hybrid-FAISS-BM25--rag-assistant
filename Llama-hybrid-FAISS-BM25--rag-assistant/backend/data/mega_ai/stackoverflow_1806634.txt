Grouping records by day in PHP/MySQL

This is a common issue that I can't find an elegant way to handle. Database contains 5000 records. I need to show these records on a page, but they need to be sorted and grouped by day. 10/11/2009 record3456 record456 record456 10/12/2009 record345234 record3456 10/13/2009 10/14/2009 record81 record8324 record983 record834 10/15/2009 record918 ... etc. How can this be done in MySQL/PHP? What about Ruby? I can grab all records and then sort them and manipulate them manually with PHP but that's SLOW.
