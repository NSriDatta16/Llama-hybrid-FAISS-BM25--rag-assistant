Well it depends if the .lib files are static libraries or import libraries for the DLL. If they're import libraries, you have no choice, you're program will have to be dynamically linked with the DLLs. If they're static libraries, than just add them to your project. You can add them under project settings->configuration properties->linker->input->additional dependencies , drag and drop them into your project, or use the preprocessor directive #pragma comment(lib, )
