How to emphasize some specifc features in feature engineering?

If by some prior, it is known that some features are more important than the others, how can this be reflected using feature engineering? For example, to encode an article into a vector, it is known that the title of article contains more important information than its body, how would one reflect it when using tf-idf or some other word embedding techniques?
