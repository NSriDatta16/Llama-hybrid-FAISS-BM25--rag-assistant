Git escapes the filename so that it doesn't contain any hard to interpret characters like terminal sequences, common separators like newline, etc. So does (gnu) ls by the way, but here ls is more tolerant. You can use the -z flag to get the original names in a zero-terminated, machine-parsable format. Magit should use it (parsing escapes is more fragile), patch it if you can.
