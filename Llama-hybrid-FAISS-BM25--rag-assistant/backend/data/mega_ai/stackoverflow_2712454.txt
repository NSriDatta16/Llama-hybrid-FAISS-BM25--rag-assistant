"Ghost" values in PHP/Smarty

I've been working on a site for a while changing the layout and skin of a webshop checkout process. I've noticed that if you go all the way through the process until the last page, then click the link to go back to the view products page, the delivery method price displays underneath the navigation buttons, until you refresh and it goes away again. I've downloaded both sources from the browser (Chrome, but this bug applies to all browsers) and used a file difference tool to display the differences, the result being only: normal.html 34c34 --- > Which is just the way it zips up the CSS stylesheets. (afaik) Has anyone ever encountered such a problem, or anything similar? Normal: Error: I can't even hazard a guess as to what is causing this, at all. I've searched over Google for anything and come up with nothing. There isn't even any markup in this sourcecode to display the leveringsmåte (Delivery method) div. What could be causing this? The site in question is Euroworker.no . HTML @ Pastebin . Smarty snippet: {if !$CANONICAL} {canonical}{self}{/canonical} {/if} {includeCss file="frontend/Frontend.css"} {includeCss file="backend/stat.css"} {if {isRTL}} {includeCss file="frontend/FrontendRTL.css"} {/if} {compiledCss glue=true nameMethod=hash} {if $ieCss} {/if} Thanks. UPDATE : Just used DOM Inspector and found this: 138.- Which is in the last page of the process.. Why would this be carrying over? UPDATE 2 Got this from NET tab in Firebug, GET order Response Headersview source Date Mon, 26 Apr 2010 11:20:06 GMT Server Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10 with Suhosin-Patch mod_ssl/2.2.8 OpenSSL/0.9.8g X-Powered-By PHP/5.2.4-2ubuntu5.10 Expires Thu, 19 Nov 1981 08:52:00 GMT Cache-Control no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0 Pragma no-cache Content-Encoding gzip Content-Length 5244 Keep-Alive timeout=15, max=96 Connection Keep-Alive Content-Type text/html;charset=utf-8 Request Headersview source Host www.euroworker.no User-Agent Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; nb-NO; rv:1.9.1.9) Gecko/20100315 Firefox/3.5.9 (.NET CLR 3.5.30729) Accept text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8 Accept-Language nb,no;q=0.8,nn;q=0.6,en-us;q=0.4,en;q=0.2 Accept-Encoding gzip,deflate Accept-Charset ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7 Keep-Alive 300 Connection keep-alive Referer http://www.euroworker.no/checkout/pay Cookie PHPSESSID=f5bd84668603decd779c5945d2de045c; __utma=259297566.1176642152.1271066660.1272267705.1272280025.34; __utmz=259297566.1271066660.1.1.utmcsr=(direct)|utmccn=(direct)|utmcmd=(none); __utmb=259297566.7.10.1272280025; __utmc=259297566 When I click on HTML for the GET order tab, it appears to be getting the Leveringsmåte TD from the previous page and just adding it in there.
