I would prefer /photos/{id}/delete . My reasoning is that if you take one component off the end of an URL, it should still make sense. It's pretty easy to assume what /photos/{id} should do: view the set of photos for that {id} . But what should /photos/delete do? That's really unclear. I know that there's kind of a default convention of /controller/action/id , but that organization is for the sake of mapping to the class/method architecture of controllers. I don't think it's a good idea to organize the UI to accommodate the code (the URL is in a way part of the UI). Re comments: Yes, /photos/{id} maybe makes more sense to view a given photo by its id. /users/{id}/photos perhaps to view a collection. It's up to you. The point is that you should think of the UI in terms of users, not in terms of code organization.
