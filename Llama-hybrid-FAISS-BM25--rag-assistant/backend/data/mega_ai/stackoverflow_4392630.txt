It's no substitute for proper serialization. Consider the case of any complex type that contains pointers - if you save the pointers to a file, when you load them up later, they're not going to point to anything meaningful. Additionally, it's likely to break if the code changes, or even if it's recompiled with different compiler options. So it's really only useful for short-term storage of simple types - and in doing so, it takes up way more space than necessary for that task.
