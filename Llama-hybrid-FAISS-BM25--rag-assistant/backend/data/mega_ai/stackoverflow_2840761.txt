Client wants "uncopyable images" on website

I need a method to make the product images on a website "uncopyable" - not be able drag and drop them onto desktop or right click and save. They also need to be links and are in a scrolling javascript viewer ( http://www.dynamicdrive.com/dynamicindex4/stepcarousel.htm ) Any ideas? Thanks, Steph
