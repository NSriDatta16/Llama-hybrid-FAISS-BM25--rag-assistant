Data leakage and predictive models: should we use past predictions as a feature?

I want to develop a Random Forest Classifier model to predict whether or not a customer will convert 7 days from today. The model is re-trained once a week and makes predictions for the following week. The features I use were created using 2 years worth customer behavior data. Since I'm running this model and generating predictions once a week, I have been storing the conversion predictions for every customer on a weekly basis. Furthermore, I will know if my previous predictions were correct or not. So let's say I'm training the model again today for the coming week and I want to include following features: last_wk_predictions = Probability of Purchase predicted last week for each customer (between 0 and 1) did_convert_last_wk = did they convert last week? (0 or 1) Is there a specific name for this approach? Is it considered data leakage to include past predictions?
