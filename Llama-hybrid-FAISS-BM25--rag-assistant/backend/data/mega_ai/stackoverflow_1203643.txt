XML has other object semantics than ECMAscript ... so this is always a little unpleasant ... you should consider using JSON instead of XML ... it's also standardized, it is smaller, treats numeric and boolean values as such and has a few other advantages ... but most importantly, semantics are the same ... a problem with XML is, that { foo: "bar" } could be or bar ... plus it is unclear, where the name of node should come from ... etc. ... it is very often unclear, what a sensible and unique XML-representation of an object is, or how an XML should be translated into an object tree ... for simple and elegant XML manipulation in AS3, have a look at E4X but really, i'd use JSON (use as3corelib for en-/decoding) ... hope that helps ... :) greetz back2dos
