There are several errors in your code: There should be no scale and shape parameters in your parm statement simply because you are fitting an exponential distribution of which scale parameter $\sigma=1$ and no shape parameter. The output of proc lifereg have Weibull scale and shape shown because they are calculated as: weibull scale: $\eta= \exp(\mu)$ and weibull shape:$\beta=1/\sigma$. The specification of $w$ in your code is not correct: Even though for exponential distribution when $\sigma=1$ it is the same $\log(T_\epsilon)$. The correct understanding is that $w$ is the log transformed event time: $w=\log(T_\epsilon)$ and NOT logarithm of scaled event time. The following code after correcting for the two points mentioned above will give the same results as proc lifereg (with rounding of the numbers): proc nlp data=data tech=tr Pcov phes; max LL; Parms mu; w=log(year); f = exp(w-mu)*exp(-exp(w-mu)); S = exp(-exp(w-mu)); likelihood = (f**(failure-1)) * (S**(2-failure)); LL = log(likelihood); run; Parameter Estimates N Parameter Estimate Approx Std Err t Value Approx Pr>|t| Gradient Obj Func 1 mu 3.999116 0.474880 8.421311 7.818057E-10 0.000007476 Value of Objective Function = -12.51585779
