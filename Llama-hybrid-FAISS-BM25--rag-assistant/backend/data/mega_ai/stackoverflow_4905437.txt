How can I know if the mouse is over the header row in a WPF ListView?

I'm implementing simple drag-and-drop functionality in my app, and I would like to know if the user has dropped the item above the first item in the list (in the header row) so i can just insert it as the first item. I'm using VisualTreeHelper.HitTest to get the item at the drop position, but this only works if there actually is an item there. HitTestResult hitTestResults = VisualTreeHelper.HitTest(myListView, location); When the mouse is on the headers i get one of many several items in hitTestResults.VisualHit . In just a few tests, I've gotten ListBoxChrome , TextBlock , and Border How can i know if any of these are part of the header row? I can't just test for them specifically since there could be other UI elements returned. Can i get the coordinates of the header row of the listview to see if my point is inside it? Or is there a way that i can know if my Point is inside that header row?
