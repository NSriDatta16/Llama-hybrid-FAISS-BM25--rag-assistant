The R Structural Topic Model (STM) package by Molly Roberts, Brandon Stewart and Dustin Tingley is also a great choice. Built on top of the tm package it's a general framework for topic modeling with document-level covariate information. http://structuraltopicmodel.com/ The STM package includes a series of methods (grid search) and measures (semantic coherence, residuals and exclusivity) to determine the number of topics. Setting the number of topics to 0 will also let the model determine an optimum number of topics. The stmBrowser package is a great data visualization complement to visualize the influence of external variables on topics. See this example related to the 2016 presidential debates: http://alexperrier.github.io/stm-visualization/index.html .
