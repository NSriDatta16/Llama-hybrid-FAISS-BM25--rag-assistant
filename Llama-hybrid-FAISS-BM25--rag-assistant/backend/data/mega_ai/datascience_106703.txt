Can a Transformers be used for a classification problem?

I want to perform binary classification on a sequential data. I want to leverage the PyTorch nn.TransformerEncoder module, is there a way I can do this? If not, are Transformers only used NLP? If yes, how can I format the inputs and what tutorial can help me do this as quick as possible
