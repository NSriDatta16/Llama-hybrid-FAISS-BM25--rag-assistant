This is not going to be straightforward in Excel. Environments like R, Python, and others have routines to make this part of your workflow, so I'll suggest you consider migrating. That said, there are several things you can (and should) do. In no particular order: 1) You can use PCA to extract linear combinations of variables. Those that are highly correlated are likely to group together, but you lose some interpretability on what those features represent. If your main goal is prediction accuracy, that's probably ok. 2) You can identify variables with very high correlations and remove all but one of them. In the R package 'caret', the function 'findCorrelation' helps identify these and select the best of the set. It is slightly more complicated than 'choose the one with the highest correlation'. 3) Once multicollinearity has been dealt with, you can use regularization to accomplish feature selection and get your feature set down to a manageable size. Popular approaches include ridge regression, lasso, and (my favorite) the elastic net.
