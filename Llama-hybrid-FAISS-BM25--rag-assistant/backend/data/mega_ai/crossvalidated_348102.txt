If you model the time it takes for a unit to sell as $T_i$, it is true that we could assume this follows some distribution, $F$ (with density $f$), and define a likelihood: $$L(T) = \prod_{isNotCensored(i)} f(T_i) \prod_{isCensored(i)} (1-F(T_i)).$$ I disagree that competing risks is applicable here, since the decision to remove inventory is not random. For those interested, there are lifetime models where there is a positive probability of infinite life -- search for "limited failure population model." I think this is a wrong approach, however, because the average lifetime will be proportional to the amount of inventory. I agree with the comment that treating sales as a Poisson process is a better model. With that you can predict sales based on the estimated rate, which can be modeled as varying with time, etc.
