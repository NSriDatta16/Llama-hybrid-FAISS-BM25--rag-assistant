There may be a more authoritative answer for your specific case, but derived/transformed variables are used routinely in regressions. Given that, I can see three issues in your case: How do you express your count? For example, it may be better to express strikes as a percentage of the days in the month that had strikes, rather than a count. How do you count strikes and how can they occur? Can people be on strike for an hour rather than a whole day? Do you count days from the beginning of a strike to the end, or only days they'd otherwise work? (E.g. if people don't normally work on weekends, do they count as strike days?) (If you wish to do something that would require forecasting strike probabilities, this could also determine whether you need to account for a zero-inflation effect.) If strikes can occur for multiple days, is a seven-day strike the same as seven one-day strikes or might it have greater or less effect? EDIT: Gelman mentions on page 69 of Gelman & Hill (2007) that, "... sometimes several inputs can be averaged or summed to create a 'total score' that can be used as a single predictor in the model." I don't immediately have other references or any particularly for aggregate variables.
