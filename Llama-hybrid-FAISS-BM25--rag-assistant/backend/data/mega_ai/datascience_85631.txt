Which term is correct Datafication or Datification?

I have recently started reading Introduction to Data Science: A python approach to Concepts, Techniques, and Applications and taking notes on Data Science. Chapter 1 repeatedly uses the term Datification(the process of rendering into data aspects of the world that have never been quantified before). I could not find the word in the dictionary and the web shows some results but with different spellings Datafication(a technological trend turning many aspects of our life into data). I am wondering which one is correct?
