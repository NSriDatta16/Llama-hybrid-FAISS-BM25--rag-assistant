The original question presupposes that you are using a binary search on a collection of data. That is not always the case. Many times you are just trying to compute a number in some interval. Suppose you are trying to calculate the optimal speed setting for a fan. For some reason you can't find a closed form expression, so you simulate the air flow at different speed settings. Assuming that the fan can run at any speed from 0RPM to 5000RPM, you don't actually have to generate a list of possible speeds. You just find the average of the previous minimum and maximum at each step of the binary search.
