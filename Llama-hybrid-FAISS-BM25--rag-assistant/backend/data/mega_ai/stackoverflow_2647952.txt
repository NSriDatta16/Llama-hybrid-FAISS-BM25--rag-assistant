Using EntryAttributeValue allows you to store any schema data in a set amount of tables, however the performance implications and maintenance issues this creates may very well not be worth it. Alternately you could store your data in XML and generate an XML schema to validate against. All "generic" solutions will have issues with foreign keys or other constraints, uless you do all of that validation in memory before storage.
