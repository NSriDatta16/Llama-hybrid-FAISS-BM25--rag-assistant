For starters - an ANCOVA model is inappropriate for those data. The Piper Fatigue scale is a discrete bounded set, meaning that it can only take values between 1 and 10, and only integers (whole numbers). The assumptions underlying ANCOVA is that the errors are normally distributed meaning that they are unbounded (range between infinity and negative infinity). Moreover, it assumes that a value of 2 is twice that of a value of 1, or that 10 is twice that of the feeling at 5. I personally wouldn't put much faith in any of those results. It also looks like they would have needed a repeated measures design if they want to look and pre- and post-treatments - I skimmed the paper but it doesn't mention it if they did. Lastly, the made no corrections for all of their post-hoc tests. They were almost guaranteed to find a significant result by chance alone. Regarding your question about the CI: 95% CI = mean ± SEM × ~1.96 where SEM = Standard error of the mean. The 95% interval indicates that there was a drop in fatigue score, on average, after treatment by somewhere between 0.48 and 1.3 after intervention and then a similar drop by between 0.29 and 1.19 in the follow-up treatment. There is a lot of ambiguity in that though - this paper shouldn't have been published, as is, in my opinion. If you have the time, and you want to better understand where those researchers went wrong I would recommend reading this paper .
