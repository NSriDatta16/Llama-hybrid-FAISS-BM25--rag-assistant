How to deal with a biased feature in Machine Learning (date)

I have a model that predicts the lifespan of a horse. The dataset has samples from 1980 to 2019 and among the features there is one called birth_date , labeled with the lifespan in years for each horse. The problem is knowing that a horse usually lives between 20 and 30 years, if we look from 1980 to 1990 we have the full list of horses and their lifespans, but from 2000 to 2019 we see only samples of horses that were born and died within this time span but not the ones that are currently living, therefore the birth_date is a biased feature. Is there a way to use the birth_date feature without having to worry about the biased data, or some technique to minimize his effects on the final predictions?
