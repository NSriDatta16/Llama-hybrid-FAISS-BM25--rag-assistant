Given your sample size and number of markers, it makes most sense to put all of them in one model, but without interactions. I.e. coxph(formula = Surv(OSmonths, OScensor) ~ allele1 + allele2 + allele3 You are right about the problems with stepwise regression, and that LASSO avoids most of those (by correctly specifying degrees of freedom). With small number of predictors, you can actually run a best-subset search which is guaranteed to find the best model for each $k$ variables. However, given realistic effect sizes, LD, allele frequencies and $n=100$, I wouldn't expect any regularization method to be stable. (I suspect the alleles are not common, if you're coding them as 0/1 instead of 0/1/2?) If the LD isn't very big, sacrificing the interactions should give you enough precision to estimate the effects of each allele. You could explore the interactions with a second model. In genetics they are usually tested using random forests, and these are also available for survival outcomes (e.g. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3495190/ ). Then again, keep in mind that the actual frequencies of each haplotype might limit your options severely. Might be useful to know that such analyses are called "fine mapping of causal loci", in case you'd want to google for more specific tools (CAVIAR, FINEMAP).
