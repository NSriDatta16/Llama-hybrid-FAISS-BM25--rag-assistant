Well, in C, there are no "vector" and "list" data types available to you directly like in C++ std library. But in terms of "abstract data type", a vector is usually considered to represent contiguous storage, and a linked list is considered to be represented by individual cells linked together. Vectors provide fast constant time random-access read and write operations, but inserting and deleting vector elements take linear time. Lists have linear lookup performance to find an element to read and write, but given an element location, have constant time insertion and deletion. You can also add items to the start and to the end of a list in constant time (if the ADT implementation caches the location of the last element in the list).
