Estimating P value of average estimate

I have five estimates indicating accuracy improvement applying a specific algorithm. Suppose the accuracy gains are 3.48, 5.82, 5.41, -2.272, -10.08. The negative values indicate the algorithm resulted in accuracy loss. The average accuracy gain for five scenarios would be 0.47. Is there any way to say if the accuracy gain is significant? Meaning can I do a test to get a p value?
