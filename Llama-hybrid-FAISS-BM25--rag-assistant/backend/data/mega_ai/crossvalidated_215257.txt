I agree with Kodiologist. The Red vs. Blue areas have enough of an area that does not perfectly overlap to hopefully be differentiable from one another. Given the binomial nature of the data, I would use quantitative methods better catered to such data shape such as Logit Regression or Probit Regression. I think those methods are much superior to PCA given the data structure. I am not even sure PCA is appropriate at all for such data structure.
