Facebook status.get API throws 500 HTTP status code

I have an APP that calls Facebook status.get method via the REST server - restserver.php using session key method. This app works fine for most of the users, but for one user I consistently receive HTTP 500 status code. Since this doesn't have any specific Facebook error message, it is almost impossible for me to debug this. Anyone faced a similar problem? What could be wrong with this user account? I checked the privacy options that I could think of and they look fine. Also, for the same user, I can use friends.get method without any problem. EDIT: I tried in Facebook forums as well, but it was of no use. Any pointers in the direction towards debugging/troubleshooting this problem are also appreciated. EDIT: The full HTTP trace of my request is as follows. Just to be clear the same code works for other users.
