For a longitudinal observational study, what is the best method of comparing cost before and after intervention?

I have a sample of 200 patients, with data for 2 years. During year 1 they are on treatment A and accumulate overall healthcare costs of X. During year 2 they are on treatment B and accumulate overall healthcare costs of Y. What is the best method for comparing the overall healthcare costs for treatment A and treatment B? I have been suggested conditional logistic regression, but that doesn't make sense to me (outcome of treatment A or treatment B with continuous variable of cost). The method that makes most sense to me is a paired Wilcoxon test (since the overall healthcare costs are skewed towards most patients being lower costs, and only a few being higher costs).
