No, not even with compile-time options. The only way, so far, is to use pragma foreign_keys=on at run time. The particular danger is that every application that touches the database has to do that. If a specific application doesn't run that pragma statement, it can insert data that will violate foreign key constraints, and other applications won't know it. That is, turning on foreign keys doesn't warn you of existing data that violates the constraint.
