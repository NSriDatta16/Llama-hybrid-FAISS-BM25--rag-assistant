Test and Training dataset correlation while Splitting the dataset

I want to split my main dataset in two part, training dataset and test dataset. In the past i read somewhere (which unfortunately i could not find exactly where was that), that when splitting my main dataset in train and test i should pay attention that two observation of same origin (correlated data) should not placed in train and test group. For my question i want to ask, why i should not place 2 observation of same origin in both test and train group (imagine i used k-fold for splitting my main dataset)? what problem it would cause? it cause error in classification or some overfitting/underfitting problem?
