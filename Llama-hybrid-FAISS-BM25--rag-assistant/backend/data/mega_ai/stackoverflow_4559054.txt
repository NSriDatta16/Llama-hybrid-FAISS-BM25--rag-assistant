It seems you're looking for elegance and quite possibly magic when it sounds like a simple for loop should suffice. You've described the problem as having two equally sized lists, one of a particular class, another of strings. You want to set a string property on each class to the corresponding string in the opposite list (so presumably these are sorted and at matching indexes). All you need is a loop. for (int index = 0; index = MyClassList.Count; index++) { MyClassList[index].TheString = StringList[index]; }
