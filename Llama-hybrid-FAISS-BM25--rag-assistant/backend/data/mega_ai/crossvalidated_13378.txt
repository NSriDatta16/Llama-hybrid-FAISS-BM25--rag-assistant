The simplest thing to do is to use the predict function on the lm object, then it take care of many of the details like converting a factor to the right values to add together. If you are trying to understand the pieces that go into the prediction then set type='terms' and it will show the individual pieces that add together make your prediction. Note also that how a factor is converted to variables depends on some options, the default will choose a baseline group to compare the other groups to, but you can also set it to an average and differences from that average (or other comparisons of interest).
