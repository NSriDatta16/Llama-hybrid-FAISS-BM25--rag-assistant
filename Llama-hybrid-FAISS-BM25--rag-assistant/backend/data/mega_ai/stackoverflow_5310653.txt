Nothing as of now will scale beyond a limit. libsvm has a tool for subset selection, to select a set of data points for training. forget about ANN, it will not generalize and there is no theory that helps to choose the number of hidden nodes, etc.. It has to be manually optimized a lot and can get trapped in local minima.. Go with SVM only
