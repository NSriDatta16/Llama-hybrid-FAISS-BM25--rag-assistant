Exploring search options for PHP

I have innoDB table using numerous foreign keys, but we just want to look up some basic info out of it. I've done some research but still lost. How can I tell if my host has Sphinx installed already? I don't see it as an option for table storage method (i.e. innodb, myisam). Zend_Search_Lucene, responsive enough for AJAX functionality of millions of records? Mirror my innoDB with a myisam? Make every innodb transaction end with a write to the myisam, then use 1:1 lookups? How would I do this automagically? This should make MyISAM ACID-compliant and free(er) from corruption no? PostgreSQL fulltext queries don't even look like SQL to me wtf, I don't have time to learn a new SQL syntax I need noob options ???????????????????? This is high volume site on a decently-equipped VPS Thanks very much for any ideas.
