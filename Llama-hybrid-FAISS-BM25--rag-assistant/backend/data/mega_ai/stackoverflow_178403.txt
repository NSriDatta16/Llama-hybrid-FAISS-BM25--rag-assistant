I don't think Access is the right tool for the job. You will not get around using an Outlook.Application object or a MAPI wrapper like CDO. CDO will be the more elegant and performant way, but it must explicitly be installed on the client via Office Setup. If you want to avoid the script security dialog (and some of the CDO incapabilities in general), you should give Outlook Redemption a try. Redemption is a drop-in replacement for CDO and you will be instantly familiar to it when you did any CDO/Outlook VBA coding before.
