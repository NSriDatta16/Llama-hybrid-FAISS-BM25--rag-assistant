goodness of fit test to check for normality

I have task about hearing ability and here is frequency table bad ability average good ability total 19 64 17 100 It is said that average ability is everything +/- 1sd. This is all data I have. I need to make hypotisses about normal distrubution and do normality distribution test. I am not sure what test? I tried chi squared: Ho: distribution is normal Ha: distribution is not normal I know that normal distribution has this characteristic left tail μ ± 1σ right tail 15.85% 68.3% 15.85% So I have decided to do chi square test because I can compare observed and expected frequency. bad ability average good ability total observed 19 64 17 100 expected 15.85 68.3 15.85 (obs-exp)^2/exp 0.626 0.271 0.0834 0.98 So I got 𝛘 2 = 0.98 2 crit, .025 = 7.38 and I don't reject Ho. But, I am nut sure in df. I have used 3-1 = 2 df and 𝛘 2 distibution table. Looking great Real Statistics in Excel I have seen that maybe I should calculate df = 3-1-2 = 0, but that obviously isn't good result. And I am not sure if should use 𝛘 2 crit, .05 = 5.99. Maybe this critical value is for one-sided test. So I am suspicious about my test. And IComments and answers are welcome. Thanks
