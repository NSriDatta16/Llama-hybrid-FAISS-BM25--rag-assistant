If your main concern is cost, the buy a Developer Edition for each developer. At $49 (fourty-nine) you get a full fledged enterprise Edition functionality, with tools and SQL Agent and Fulltext Search and SSIS and BI and all the works. Is only restricted for development use by license. And it actually may be cheaper than buying an MSDN subscription or Technet subscription. Developing against Express Edition can is not feasible if you develop a product that requires in the deployment Standard or Enterprise edition functionality. Your developers will not be able to use some features (SQL Agent jobs, SSIS, BI (OLAP, DM), Report Builder, full Replication, Mirroring and so on), will not be able to test against large loads of data, will not have the management tools (SSMS) at their disposal.
