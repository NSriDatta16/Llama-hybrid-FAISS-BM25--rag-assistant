Why is the logistic regression hypothesis seen as a probability function?

Why is the logistic regression hypothesis seen as a probability function? I understand that we use it to predict 0 or 1, but still, why a function (the hypothesis) that outputs numbers between 0 and 1 may be considered a probability function? Is this a heuristic?
