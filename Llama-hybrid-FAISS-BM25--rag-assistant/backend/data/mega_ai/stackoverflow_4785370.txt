This one is pretty elegant (and fail proof if you use TryParse ): var sorted2 = from ip in ips let addressBytes = IPAddress.Parse(ip).GetAddressBytes() orderby addressBytes[0], addressBytes[1], addressBytes[2], addressBytes[3] select ip; The addressBytes array will have length 4 as long as it is only IP4 addresses. Otherwise you should account for the length...
