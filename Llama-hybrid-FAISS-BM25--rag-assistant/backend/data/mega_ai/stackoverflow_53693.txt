Amazon SimpleDB

Has anyone considered using something along the lines of the Amazon SimpleDB data store as their backend database? SQL Server hosting (at least in the UK) is expensive so could something like this along with cloud file storage (S3) be used for building apps that could grow with your application. Great in theory but would anyone consider using it. In fact is anyone actually using it now for real production software as I would love to read your comments.
