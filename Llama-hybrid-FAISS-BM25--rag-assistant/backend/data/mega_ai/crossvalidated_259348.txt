What supervised machine learning algorithm to classify words in Python?

I am working with a problem where I receive a free-text field where a user describes the attributes of the car it is selling. I want to make this into structured pre-defined attributes. An example is that in the field for tires the customer could write: studded tyres spike tires spiked tires These should result in my pre-defined attribute: studded tires Hence, I would feed my training model with: ╔═════════════════╦═══════════════╗ ║ Free text input ║ Answer ║ ╠═════════════════╬═══════════════╣ ║ studded tyres ║ studded tires ║ ║ spike tires ║ studded tires ║ ║ spiked tires ║ studded tires ║ ╚═════════════════╩═══════════════╝ Since I have to make the classifications for the training data by myself I wont have that many observations. What machine learning algorithm in Python would you recommend in my case? Edit - The language the application is runnig on is not English. Hence, I cant use any methods that relies on English dictionary.
