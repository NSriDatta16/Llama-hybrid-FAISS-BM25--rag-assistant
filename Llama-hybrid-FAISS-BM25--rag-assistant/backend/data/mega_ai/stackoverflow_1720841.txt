In your code about touch2 is a set of UITouch objects You can get at each object like so: UITouch *touch = [[touch2 allObjects] objectAtIndex:0]; EDIT: to add information about touchesMoved touchesBegan is called when one or more fingers is placed on the screen. At this point you will need to determine which ball corresponds to each touch (by using the coordinates of each touch). You will need to store this mapping. touchesMoved will be called continually as the fingers are moved across the screen. Using the mapping you calculated earlier, you can determine which ball corresponds to which UITouch and apply some movement to it as you see fit. Perhaps you should read handling a complex multi-touch sequence in the apple docs.
