Moderation analysis with longitudinal data?

My data is a from a family-based weight loss intervention. One of the intervention goals is to reduce intake of energy-dense, low-nutrient foods (we call these RED foods). One major behavioral strategy we encourage is for families to improve their home food environment (i.e., reduce unhealthy foods and increase healthy foods available at home). My hypothesis is that intake of RED foods (x) will predict weight (y), and that the home food environment (i.e., availability of RED foods at home) will moderate this relationship. I know that I could look at cross-sectional relationships at post-treatment, but I feel like I lose valuable temporal information. Can anyone advise me on what type of analysis might be appropriate to answer this research question?
