Can I use AIC or BIC to compare models fitted to the same data, but different weighting?

E.g. I have a time series data from day 1 up to day T. I want to compare models with Yt~Xt, with equal weight of all data set put more weight (like exponential decay) for the day more close to T Can I use AIC or BIC to compare these models?
