I think what you decide to put in each EAR is governed by organizational and technical issues. I think most important technical role of an EAR is a classloader root in a runtime environment. This normally means you can deploy different versions of libraries and your own classes in different EAR's. This means you should keep your container root classpath fairly empty (or as supplied by the container vendor), because it may allow one phsyical container to service multiple applications using possibly conflicting libraries. This is great news if you're developing a number of different applications using a common code-base. You can have a number of projects deploying to the same farm of servers without messing up for eachother. You will normally never deploy a smaller unit of software than the EAR. Each EAR can be more or less fully self-contained. I would normally let the content of these refelect what the owning organization thinks of as applications or subsystems. You can usually package the same components in multiple EAR's.
