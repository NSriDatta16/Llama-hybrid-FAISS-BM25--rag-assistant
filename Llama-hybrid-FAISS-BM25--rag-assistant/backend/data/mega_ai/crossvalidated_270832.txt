No- no consistent variable importance value is possible in this case. The variable importance changes because the underlying model itself changes each time you change the seed value. Different models will have different values for variable importance. One thing that you could do would be run many (say, 10) Random Forest models with different seed values and average the variable importance scores across the models- this would get you a better approximation of what you could expect variable importance to be on average from each individual Random Forest model you train on the dataset.
