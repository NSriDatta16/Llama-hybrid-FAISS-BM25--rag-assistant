As a pretty good soltution, you could store your Key/IV pair in a table: ID Key IV skjsh-38798-1298-hjj FHDJK398720== HFkjdf87923== When you save an encrypted value, save the ID and a random Salt value along with it. Then, when you need to decrypt the value, lookup the key/iv pair using the id and the salt stored with the data. You'd want to make sure you have a good security model around the key storage. If you went with SQL server, don't grant SELECT rights to the user that accesses the database from the application. You wouldn't want to give someone access to the whole table.
