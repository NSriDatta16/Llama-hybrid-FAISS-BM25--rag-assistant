SVN Project(s) organization: per-module or per-project

I have a subversion repository that contains a number so subfolders, corresponding to the various applications, configuration files, DLLs, etc (I'll call them 'modules') that make up my project. Now we are starting to "branch" into several related projects. That is, each high-level project will use a number of the modules, possibly slightly modified from project to project. The number of projects is smaller (~5) than the number of modules (~20) Now I'm trying to figure out how to organize the repo. Does it make sense to keep the top level subfolders on a module-by-module basis, with sub-subfolders for each project? Or should the top level be for each project, with each project having its own module subfolders: repo: module 1 Project 1 Project 2 ... Project 5 module 2 Project 1 .... Project 5 .... module 20 Project 1 ... Project 5 -or- repo: Project 1 module 1 module 2 ... module 20 Project 2 module 1 module 2 ... module 20 ... Project 5 module 1 module 2 ... module 20
