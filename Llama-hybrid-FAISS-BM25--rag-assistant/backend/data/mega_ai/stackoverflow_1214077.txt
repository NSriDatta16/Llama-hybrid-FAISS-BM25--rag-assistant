Areas strikes me as a way to organize a large project into sectioned-off areas, whereas RenderAction has a specific purpose...providing a way to inject a "widget" into your page without having to push data into the view of every page that requires the widget, like you have to with a partial view. It's a perfect way to fill specific parts of a web page, such as a menu or sidebar...One line of code in the view calls a specific method on a specific controller and returns only the data you need for that particular part of the page. This should alleviate your concerns about RenderAction being supported.

Yes - that is on the current plan for V2. Thanks, Scott
