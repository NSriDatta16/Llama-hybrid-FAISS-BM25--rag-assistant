I think you are using the wrong type of dataset and chart here. It appears you are trying to create a scatter plot, so you should be using the scatter plot instead of a category plot. In the category plot, because each row/column pair only gets a single value. So, in the first call, you're saying the event1/category1 pair has a value of june10.getMiddleMillisecond then you're changing its value to june20.getMiddleMillisecond. You might also want to look at the time series plots as well.
