This problem is pretty mean in general. There are plenty of conventions for project organization plus tools to help ( autoconf and similar), but if the author hasn't taken advantage of those things you're going to have to hunt everything down and install the -I s yourself. You could use gcc -M or makedepends or one of the many similar tools to get a list of the directories that are needed. Presumably you could even script the extraction.
