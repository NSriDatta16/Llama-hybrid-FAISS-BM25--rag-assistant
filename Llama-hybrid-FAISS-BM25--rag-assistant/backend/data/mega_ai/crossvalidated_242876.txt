Would an organization interested in manipulating public opinion choose a telephone poll, over online polls, or interviewing in the street, if they were after a specific bias? All polling methods can be biased, including some others not mentioned in the question. To over-represent elder viewpoints, choose a telephone poll and 'forget' to normalise the age quota groups, knowing that younger respondents were poorly represented. Street polling without any quota setting and normalisation would probably be the easiest way to get a bias. As per Sycorax, just choose your street. Polling in working hours or out of them would also transform the results. I was once a street interviewer. We worked to strict set quotas combining age range, gender and social class, but within this I was conscious of my own tendency to approach people within quota that I liked the look of (people who were a bit like me, if you like) rather than people within quota that had less immediate visual appeal. And I don't think they had quotas for interviewer types! British tabloid newspapers regularly conduct self-selecting yes/no 'surveys' of their own readers, typically on an emotive leading question, reporting the results as if they were a genuine survey representative of the population, and often with greater prominence than proper, ethically conducted surveys. As Andy Jones has commented, there are much easier ways to bias a poll. Choice of dates and times, wording adjustments (especially in Before and After surveys), leading questions, directive mood-setting prior or filtering questions, reductionist assumptions, restricted response choices and so on. In London, various council traffic management, parking management and public consultation sections seem to make such underhand techniques their speciality. Typically, if they are bringing in traffic restrictions, they will consult only residents within a narrow nearby area, and drivers not at all. The residents will get a tick-box card through their door, or maybe two cards in a big old property that is divided into five or seven separate flats. A truly unbeatable form of poll bias, though not part of the polling process itself, is to conduct it in whatever way (eg perfectly) and then simply suppress the results if they don't suit. A residents' association for an area I once lived in, controlled with an iron hand by a very manipulative trade union official, did precisely that. Finally, in 2004, coming back from a holiday at Stansted airport I found myself confronted by a "doorway" consisting of a double perspex wall and a motion detector. Passengers were invited to walk through this optional doorway if they wanted to make the Olympics happen in London. A sizeable minority of public opinion at that time was unenthusiastic about getting a massive bill for a vanity event, recalling the Greek fiscal burden and the corruption in Utah, and the London Back the Bid team were trying to drum up support. You could walk through the doorway as many times as you wanted in order to register a 'vote' (it was called that) each time for the Olympics, to the delight of families with young kids. Alas, they forgot to provide a second doorway for people who didn't want a big bill for 30 years, or for people like me who thought that Paris was worthy of the event. Oddly enough, the Soviet-style outcome was that 100% of Britons wanted the Olympics. I'm going to be still paying for them long into my retirement. Handy things, polls.
