How to deal with one output for multiple inputs?

Hei! I want to train a model, that predicts the sentiment of news headlines. I've got multiple unordered news headlines per day, but one sentiment score. What is a convenient solution to overcome the not 1:1 issue? I could: Concatenate all headlines to one string, but that feels a bit wrong, as an LSTM or CNN will use cross-sentence word relations, that don't exist. Predict one score per headline (1:1), and take the average in the application. But that might miss some cross-news dependencies. I want that only one value/category is predicted for multiple headline the order of the news doesn't matter (ideally without shuffling) the number of headlines per day is variable (would also be open to just pick random 10 headlines) What's the usual handling for this?
