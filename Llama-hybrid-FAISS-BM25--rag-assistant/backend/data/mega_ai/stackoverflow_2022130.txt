I use MinGW to compile Windows programs every day, with zero problems. There must be something wrong with your installation - try the version at Twilight Dragon Media . Edit: Just re-read your post - you do not need to specify the include directory as you are doing, and probably should not do so. Also, you may (or may not) need the slightly mysterious -mwindows flag. I just compiled your program using MinGW (TDM build) g++ 4.4.1, with the command line: g++ main.cpp with absolutely no problems. More Info: Just so you know what the -mwindows flag does, the GCC docs say: This option is available for Cygwin and MinGW targets.It specifes that a GUI application is to be generated by instructing the linker to set the PE header subsystem type appropriately. Personally, I've never found it necessary, but then my Windows apps are all command line tools or servers.
