Analyzing data with multiple treatment layers

I apologize if this is a silly question, but I'm having some trouble figuring out the best way to approach analyzing my data. I have a study where we investigated the effects of different dietary components on shelf life parameters over time. However, I'm facing some challenges with analyzing the data using a RM Anova. I would greatly appreciate any guidance or suggestions on how to proceed. In our study, we have two snacks containing one of two ingredients, which I'll refer to as "Ingredient A" and "Ingredient B." From there, we split these two main snack groups further and coated them with one of 5 additional treatments. We then further took these now 10 groups and split them into two, putting them in one of two different storage conditions (20 different treatments altogether). In my model, I want to investigate the main effects of ingredient, coating, and storage condition, as well as their interactions over time. However, I keep getting an error "Mixed model has saturated mean and profiled variance. Fit does not proceed" when I model it with proc glimmix in SAS. proc glimmix data=work.shelf; class ID snack coat storage time; model pv = snack|coat|storage|time / DDFM=KR; random residual / subject=ID type=cs; Where ID is each snack x coating x storage (as each would be tested over time). I've never had a data set with more than one "layer" of treatment, and am wondering if I'm approaching this correctly, due to the hierarchal nature of the treatments. My understanding is that I don't need to nest the effects within my model, as the 5 treatments and 2 storage conditions are the same for the two ingredient types. Thank you in advance for your assistance!
