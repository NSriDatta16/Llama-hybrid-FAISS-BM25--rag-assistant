What does training correlation coefficient means in ANN prediction

I'm a beginner in statistics with limited knowledge. I'm reading up on neural networks to predict outputs using inputs. I understand that a neural network has to be trained to produce the Least mean squared error from the desired output. What does it mean by training correlation coefficient?
