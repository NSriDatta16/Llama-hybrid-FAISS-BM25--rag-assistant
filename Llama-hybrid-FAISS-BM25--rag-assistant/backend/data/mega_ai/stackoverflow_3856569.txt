As far as I'm aware your only options for running the swf are in the browser or in the standalone player. Running in the player should not be a problem for your continuous integration environment as long as you can get at the test results and exit the application. To print test results to stdout you need to add a Text listener to your testunit core instance. core.addListener( TextListener.getDefaultTextListener( LogEventLevel.DEBUG ) ); To exit the application after the tests have run... System.exit(0); For example, your top level mxml file might look like this... Then all you need to do is parse the output. It's not as elegant as we might like but it should work.
