ustice League: Mortal. In January 2008, Roven said that work on the script for The Flash had already begun with Dobkin's take and would resume following the strike, but later said there was no script or writer. Justice League: Mortal was also paused by the strike and later canceled. The Flash was listed as a project in production among other films intended to release in 2008, and it was in active development by that August. In late 2008, Johns was quietly hired to consult on the film as part of a strategic shift by Warner Bros. Pictures Group president Jeff Robinov to centralize control of Warner Bros.' DC Comics adaptations within the studio rather than optioning them to individual producers, such as Roven on The Flash. By July 2009, Johns wrote a film treatment that used elements of Brancato's draft, which Dan Mazeau adapted into a screenplay. Johns was producing the film alongside Roven, but no director was attached at that point. In September, Robinov restructured DC Comics under DC Entertainment, a newly formed division of Warner Bros. led by Diane Nelson, as part of his strategy to reclaim oversight and ownership of their adaptations. As such, Roven was pulled from The Flash, although there was potential for him and other producers to return to DC projects with adjusted deals. In October, Roven confirmed he was no longer involved in the film and said the studio was not confident enough in their take to greenlight the film, although Mazeau disputed this and said the film was moving forward as planned. In June 2010, Greg Berlanti, Michael Green, and Marc Guggenheim—the writers of the film Green Lantern (2011) starring Reynolds—were hired to write a new treatment for The Flash based on a recent comics run by Johns that featured Barry Allen. The pair had started work by August and completed a draft by mid-February 2011, before Green Lantern was a critical and commercial failure upon its release in mid-2011. DC Extended Universe Warner Bros. was planning a new shared universe of films based on DC characters by July 2013 and had tentative plans to release a Flash film in 2016. Berlanti was still involved in developing the film while also co-developing a television series for the CW about the character, The Flash (2014–2023), which is set in its DC-based shared universe the Arrowverse. These adaptations were not expected to conflict with each other. In October 2014, Warner Bros. and DC Entertainment announced a slate of planned projects as part of their new franchise, the DC Extended Universe (DCEU). The Flash was set for release on March 23, 2018, with Ezra Miller attached to star in the film as Barry Allen / The Flash; Miller first made cameo appearances in Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice (2016) and Suicide Squad (2016), and starred in the team-up film Justice League (2017). Warner Bros. offered James Wan the choice of directing a film about either Aquaman or the Flash, and he ultimately chose to make Aquaman (2018). By April 2015, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller were writing a story treatment for the Flash film with the possibility of directing it. After they decided to direct Solo: A Star Wars Story (2018) instead, Seth Grahame-Smith entered negotiations to write and direct the film based on Lord and Christopher Miller's treatment in October 2015. Grahame-Smith was set to make his directorial debut with the film, with Roven once again producing and Deborah and Zack Snyder executive producing. Jay Oliva, a storyboard artist on several DCEU films and the CW's series as well as the director of the animated film Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox (2013), worked with Grahame-Smith on a storyboard and test which prompted the studio to greenlight the film. In February 2016, the film's release date was moved forward to March 16, 2018. Grahame-Smith left the project that April, citing creative differences. Warner Bros. chose to retain his script, and he was still expected to be involved in the project moving forward, while L
