How to display the properties of the current selected component in a JPanel using the Netbeans Platform API

I am currently building a small visual designer using the Netbeans Platform. All my components that can be placed on the JPanel show correctly in the Palette Window. What I am struggling to do at the moment, is to let the property window show the properties of the component that was either just dragged and dropped or showing the currently selected component in the JPanel in the Properties window. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
