Bandwidth from headphone/microphone jack

I got interested in this after I saw Square use the headphone jack on the iPhone to send credit card data. What's the average bandwidth of the headphone jack on the iPhone, average notebook, and average mobile device? Can it be doubled by sending different data streams on the different channels (left/right)?
