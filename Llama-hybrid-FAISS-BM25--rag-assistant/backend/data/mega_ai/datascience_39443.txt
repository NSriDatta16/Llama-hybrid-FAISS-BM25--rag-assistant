Any time you use some input from the test set to make your model, you have a data leakage. Examples: You calculate the average income according to some category of your users and add it as a feature, with the income for each user being an additional feature. This is a data leakage, as you are calculating these averages using data points on which you'll later make predictions. (In this case, you should calculate these averages using only the training data and/or other additional data that excludes our test set) You calculate the average income for each user according to some category. Income is not part of your input variables and you took these averages from, say, census information. This is not a data leakage as you are not making predictions on the same data that you used to construct these averages.
