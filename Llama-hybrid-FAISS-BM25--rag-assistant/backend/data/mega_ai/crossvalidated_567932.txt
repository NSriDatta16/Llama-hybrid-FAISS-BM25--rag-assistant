What assumptions need to be met for a hormesis model in R?

I conducted a toxicology study where I exposed fish to 6 concentrations of an effluent treatment for 10 days. At the end of the experiment, I measured 10 endpoints with the fish plasma to determine effects of treatment. After collecting the data, I ran a Principal Component Analysis on all endpoints. PC1 here is a principal component that is heavily driven by 4 metabolic endpoints that impact growth, fat metabolism, and protein production. When compared to treatment, PC1 appears to show hormesis, a biphasic dose-response to an environmental agent or toxic substance characterized by a low dose stimulation or beneficial effect and a high dose inhibitory or toxic effect. All 4 of the metabolic endpoints I measured follow the same trend as PC1. To evaluate hormesis, I am using a 5-parameter Brain-Cousens hormesis model* with the drc package in R. It fits the response $R$ as a function of concentration $x$ to the following nonlinear form: $$R(x) = c + \frac{d-c+fx}{1+\exp[b(\log(x)-\log(e))]} .$$ Most of the parameters represent the concentration-response curve without hormesis: $c$ is the lower asymptote of response, $d$ is the upper asymptote, $b$ represents the steepness of the concentration-response curve, and $e$ is the concentration at the midpoint of the curve. $f$ is the size of the hormesis effect; if $f=0$ then there is no hormesis and there is a standard log-logistic concentration-response curve. Positive values of $f$ represent hormesis. My model seems to be driven by one value in the highest treatment concentration** but I think the value is likely real, especially since this is likely below the EC50 (based on the way the model works). I hypothesize that the PC1 and 4 endpoint concentrations would continue to decrease (increase in the plot below) if a higher treatment concentration was applied. The question: How should one handle outliers in this type of modified log-logistic model? Analysis so far The Brain-Cousens model in R would not work with my data unless I inverted the values to follow this shape. The "PC1" values are actually inverted here. In reality, PC1 and the 4 endpoints begin to decrease at the 20% treatment. So what I actually see in the raw data is improved (increased concentrations of) metabolic endpoints at the 0.4-5.3% treatments. I will not be using this as a predictive model, just to describe how our exposure may be affecting the fish. I pasted a figure of the data from the model described. The points are the inverted PC1 values and the line is from the Brain-Cousens model. My code for the model with the below data is: hm.m2 Without 20-3 data point, the $f$ parameter $p$ -value in the summary(hm.m2) line is 0.77 Data: ID# Treatment PC1 0.1-1 0.1 0.576 0.1-2 0.1 0.705 0.1-3 0.1 0.518 0.1-4 0.1 1.939 0.4-1 0.4 0.588 0.4-2 0.4 -0.926 0.4-3 0.4 -0.639 0.4-4 0.4 -3.321 0-1 0 -1.312 0-2 0 0.949 0-3 0 0.569 0-4 0 0.615 1.4-1 1.4 -1.679 1.4-2 1.4 -1.557 1.4-3 1.4 -1.273 1.4-4 1.4 -0.994 20-1 20 0.626 20-2 20 0.142 20-3 20 7.039 20-4 20 1.598 5.3-1 5.3 -2.498 5.3-2 5.3 0.704 5.3-3 5.3 -1.480 5.3-4 5.3 -0.889 *If you're interested in looking into the Brain Cousens and other Hormesis models, this website provides the very basic info about how to run the model in R . There is not too much info about Brain Cousens models online but there is a good deal of info in the scientific literature. This is the original article describing the model ; Ritz, et al. 2015 describe some dose response models in R; Knezevic, et al 2007. Weed Technology (21): 841 - 848 is another helpful resource for dose response models and is downloadable on google scholar. Lastly, this paper about hormetic responses seems to be freely downloadable **To test for outliers, I used a rosnerTest() from the EnvStats package on the principal component values. The outlier is ID# 20-3 in the data. I tried to look at Cook's distance but it does not work with my hormesis model output.
