I've never used it myself ( CTRL + S / F5 works for me), but you should check out Skybound Stylizer . Here's a quote: Stylizer's real-time CSS development extends to 9 different integrated web browsers. On Windows, Google Chrome, Internet Explorer 6, 7 & 8, and Firefox 2.0, 3.0, 3.5, 3.6 are supported. On Mac, Safari is supported. .. The Stylizer workflow couldn't be easier. Just open up the URL or the HTML page you want to edit, the style sheets are automatically extracted from the page, and you're ready to start making changes. Other than that: Firefox - Firebug Internet Explorer 8/9 - Developer Tools (hit F12 ) (you can download it for IE7/IE6) Chrome/Safari - Developer Tools Opera - Dragonfly For Chrome/Safari/Opera, I just right click anywhere on the page and click "Inspect Element".
