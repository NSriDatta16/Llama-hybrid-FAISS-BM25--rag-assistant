This is quite an old question, however it seems important to answer if someone else encounters this error. Adam0 alluded to what is going on here, but to be more specific, your response variable seems to be coded in a way that it always ends up with the same response. I have simulated some data below as an example, which fits a logistic GLMM with a response variable that is only coded as "1". #### Simulate Binomial GLMM Data #### y The error term is immediately present: Error: Response is constant If you fit this same data to a regular logistic regression without random effects: #### Fit to Standard GLM #### fit You get fairly nonsensical output: Call: glm(formula = y ~ x, family = binomial) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max 2.409e-06 2.409e-06 2.409e-06 2.409e-06 2.409e-06 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 2.657e+01 4.197e+04 0.001 0.999 x 1.945e-08 4.035e+02 0.000 1.000 (Dispersion parameter for binomial family taken to be 1) Null deviance: 0.0000e+00 on 99 degrees of freedom Residual deviance: 5.8016e-10 on 98 degrees of freedom AIC: 4 Number of Fisher Scoring iterations: 25 As he mentioned, you probably have some misspecification going on, but without more information it is hard to tell exactly why, as your tabled values seem to be binary, though they appear very close to being an exact split in responses (49.8% vs 50.2%).
