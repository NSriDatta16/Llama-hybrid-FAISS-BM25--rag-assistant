INT Advantage : Numeric values (and specifically integers) are better for performance when used in joins, indexes and conditions. Numeric values are easier to understand for application users if they are displayed. Disadvantage : If your table is large, it is quite possible it will run out of it and after some numeric value there will be no additional identity to use. GUID Advantage : Unique across the server. Disadvantage : String values are not as optimal as integer values for performance when used in joins, indexes and conditions. More storage space is required than INT. credit goes to : http://blog.sqlauthority.com/2010/04/28/sql-server-guid-vs-int-your-opinion/
