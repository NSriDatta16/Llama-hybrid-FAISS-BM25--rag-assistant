Most implementations will begin with a distance matrix (and not a data matrix) as input, as the algorithms are O(nÂ²) anyway. For the second question, I don't understand how that is defined. If your linkage is not a Lance Williams update, you may need to reimplement hierarchical clustering completely, to make sure you have all the information you need. Lance Williams are much more elegant to compute.
