Powerbuilder: what to code in the pfc_retrieve() event when using FILTER style linkage

I have two master-detail datawindow which are linked through pfc's linkage service. Now I have read in the documentation that when using FILTER style retrieval code must be placed inside the detail window's pfc_retrieve event. What code/function call should I place there so that when the master windows's retrieval has been finished, the detail window's data are also retrieved?
