Questions re Time Series Forecasting in R

I am attempting to build a time series model that can predict order volumes for a single firm in the trucking industry. I have time series data on the firm's order volumes. I expect also to have access to time series data on say 5 macroeconomic variables that I believe are in some way correlated with the order volumes I am seeking to predict. I would prefer to work in R. My questions are: Am I correct to say that I should be building a VAR (Vector Autoregression) model of some kind? Or should I be looking at a multi-variable ARIMA model? Would I be on the right track to use the MTS package in R? Alternatively, would the MARSS or marima packages be a better solution?
