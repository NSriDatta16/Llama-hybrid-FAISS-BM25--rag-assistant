Most random forest algorithms I have come across don't require that categorical variables are converted as you describe above, generally because of how the tree does its splitting: Categorical variable with split point x: splitting rule is data point = x / data point != x. Numeric variable with split point x: splitting rule is data point = x. That being said, some algorithms have constraints on the cardinality of categorical variables - e.g. randomForest in R only accepts categorical variables with less than 53 levels.
