A small help in understanding basic SVM

I am on the course of learning SVM. So, I am having a doubt. Suppose in the case of 2D, a point needs to be classified. So, let say I am having a point x(2,3). So according to the equation wx+b >= 1 for being positive class. So, When I am taking w.x(2,3) + b , what is really happening here. How this dot product between w and point , say x(2,3) here make changes geometrically. How this change modifies, when b is added to the dot product. My question may be dump, but I think geometric understanding will be too good to visualize. I need to know, how the dot product helps the hyperplane to distinguish positive and negative classes, geometrically when wx+b is greater than and less than one respectively. Thanks .
