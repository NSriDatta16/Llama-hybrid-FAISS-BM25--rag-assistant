JQuery would be a good way to go. And with the Jquery UI plugins (such as draggable ), it's a breeze.. (there's a demo here). Not using a framework, to keep it 'pure', seems just a waste of time to me. There's good stuff, that will save you tremendous amounts of time, time better spent in making your application even better. But you can always check out the source to get some 'inspiration', and adapt it without the overhead of the stuff you won't use. It's well done and easy to read, and you often discover some cross-browser hacks you didn't even think about.. edit: oh, if you REALLY don't wan't no framework EVER, just check out their source then.. sure you can use some of it for your application.
