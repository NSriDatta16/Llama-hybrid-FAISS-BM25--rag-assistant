RS232 is an easy option to program for, however modern PCs don't tend to have RS232 ports. You may need to get USB-RS232 adapters or install a PCI card. The other problem with RS232 is that you have an additional wire to worry about which can be a nusiance. Also RS232 cables can be limited in length (5-15m) unless you invest in some clunky RS232 repeaters or bluetooth connectors, etc. On top of all that you're also adding one more item to your project that can go wrong and cost you time in deploying and debugging. IMO, an elegant engineering solution would be to utilise the hardware that you have and use TCP/IP sockets to communicate. The web is awash with examples on passing messages between servers and clients: If you're using Linux: http://www.linuxhowtos.org/C_C++/socket.htm Using Windows: http://www.adp-gmbh.ch/win/misc/sockets.html
