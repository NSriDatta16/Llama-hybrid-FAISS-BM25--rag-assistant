It is "possible" but it depends on the implementation. Quote from the JVM Specification : The Java virtual machine starts up by creating an initial class, which is specified in an implementation-dependent manner, using the bootstrap class loader (ยง5.3.1). The Java virtual machine then links the initial class, initializes it, and invokes its public class method void main(String[]) . The invocation of this method drives all further execution. Execution of the Java virtual machine instructions constituting the main method may cause linking (and consequently creation) of additional classes and interfaces, as well as invocation of additional methods. In some implementations of the Java virtual machine the initial class could be provided as a command line argument, as in JDK releases 1.0 and 1.1. Alternatively, the initial class could be provided by the implementation . In this case the initial class might set up a class loader that would in turn load an application, as in the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, v1.2. Other choices of the initial class are possible so long as they are consistent with the specification given in the previous paragraph. Java 1.6 VM for windows doesn't provide this functionality.
