SQL2008: MSOLAP & SSRS Class not registered error with certain dimension

Our product leverages Analysis Services combined with Reporting Services, we recently made some changed to add compatability for SQL2008. Everything works great except with certain dimensions, drillthroughs or measures added to a report we suddenly get this following error: Server: The operation has been cancelled. Errors in the high-level relational engine. A connection could not be made to the data source with the DataSourceID of 'Adventure Works DW', Name of 'Adventure Works DW'. OLE DB error: OLE DB or ODBC error: Class not registered. Any ideas?
