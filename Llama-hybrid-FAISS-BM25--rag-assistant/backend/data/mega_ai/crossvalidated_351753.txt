Second-order differencing is the discrete analogy to the second-derivative. For a discrete time-series, the second-order difference represents the curvature of the series at a given point in time. If the second-order difference is positive then the time-series is curving upward at that time, and if it is negative then the time series is curving downward at that time. The second-order difference of a discrete time series $\{ X_t | t \in \mathbb{Z} \}$ at time $t$ is: $$\begin{equation} \begin{aligned} \Delta^2 X_t = \Delta (\Delta X_t) &= \Delta (X_t-X_{t-1}) \\[6pt] &= \Delta X_t - \Delta X_{t-1} \\[6pt] &= (X_t-X_{t-1})-(X_{t-1}-X_{t-2}) \\[6pt] &= X_t - 2X_{t-1} + X_{t-2}. \\[6pt] \end{aligned} \end{equation}$$ This is positive if $\Delta X_t > \Delta X_{t-1}$ and negative if $\Delta X_t
