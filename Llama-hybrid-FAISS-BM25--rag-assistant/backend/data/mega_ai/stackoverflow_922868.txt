With temporary tables, you explitly instruct Sql Server which intermediate storage to use. But if you stash everything in a big query, Sql Server will decide for itself. The difference is not really that big; at the end of the day, temporary storage is used, whether you specify it as a temp table or not. In your case, temporary tables work faster, so why not stick to them?
