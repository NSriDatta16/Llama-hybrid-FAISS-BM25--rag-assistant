Yes. And this is important: Don't accept changes to stories after a sprint starts. This will take much effort on behalf of scrum masters to tell the product owners that this is not permitted. The important thing to emphasise to them is that as developers you undertake to estimate and deliver the stories as specified, and any changes negates that effort. In some cases the requirements legitimately change after a sprint starts. Here, consider aborting the sprint altogether. (That should get their attention.) If your product owner finds that this is too inflexible, consider reducing the spring length. I've worked in a shop that used a sprint of one week, which I reckon to be the minimum, as the stories ended up being very small.
