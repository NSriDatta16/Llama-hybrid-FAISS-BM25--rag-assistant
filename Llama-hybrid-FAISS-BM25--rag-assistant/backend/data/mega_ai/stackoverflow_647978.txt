Replicating 9-slice functionality in WPF

I really love the 9-slice feature in Flash/Flex. It is a great quick way to make liquid vector layouts. Take a look at: I am using the selected object in AI file to setup a 9-slice grid (I am not using 9s to scale corners!). I only want that right part to stay static and the rest to scale. Now, also be aware that it must scale, so it must be vector. I cannot tile the part I want to repeat as a rasterized graphic. So Flex this is easy, WPF not so much. My question to the WPF community is how can you replicate the 9-slice in WPF? I've toyed with exporting these with the AI->XAML Exporter. Embedding the path object into a grid row behaves way too odd and inconsistent. This is taking an exported path and trying to drop it into a Grid. I should note this Grid is not being used to mimic a 9-slice. I am just using it to layout objects. I simply want the path below to fit into the right-most top corner. It does not even do that....
