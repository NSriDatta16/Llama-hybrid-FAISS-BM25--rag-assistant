Where can I find datasets usefull for testing my own Machine Learning implementations?

I am currently trying to implement some Machine Learning algorithms on my own. Many of them have the nasty property of being hard to debug, some bugs don't cause the program to crash, but rather work not as intended and seem as the algorithms just gives weaker results. I would like to have some way of increasing my confidence in the implementation, for example if I had some small datasets, with additional information "Algorithms X worked for Y iterations and had results Z on this dataset", that would be really helpful. Has anyone heard of such datasets?
