Windows CE doesn't inherently support transparent controls, which tends to be a huge pain. You have to use something like ColorKey transparency, so in your OnPaint, you need to fill the background with a color (magenta is a popular one) and use SetColorKey to make that color transparent. There are several tutorials online for colorkey transparency. Here is one that I just found with a search engine that looks reasonable but feel free to search for others as well. The place this falls down is when you have controls in a container control, which is then on the Form. To get that to work right you have to cascade calls to clipping regions from the Form all the way down. I don't have a ready sample of this that isn't inside a shipping project, so I can't easily post it. If you run into this, though, update the question and I'll see if I can extract something.
