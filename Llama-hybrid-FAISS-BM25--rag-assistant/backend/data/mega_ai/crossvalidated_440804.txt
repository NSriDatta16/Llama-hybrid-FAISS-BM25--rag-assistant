There is no normal assumption in logistic regression, so why would you want to check normality of residuals? There is more information here: Interpreting residual diagnostic plots for glm models? See also What to do with GLM (Gamma) when residuals are not normally distributed? for understanding the residuals in glm's (generalized linear models) such as logistic regression better.
