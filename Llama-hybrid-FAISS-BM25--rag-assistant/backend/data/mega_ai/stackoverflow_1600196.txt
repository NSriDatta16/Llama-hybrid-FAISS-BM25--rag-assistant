Embed javascript to existing pdf

Hi I am embedding pdf file to my asp.net page like this The problem is that I have created my own toolbar for pdf, and want to zoom in, out document from my toolbar image buttons. I know that I can embed JavaScript to pdf document, when creating document from scratch, but how can I embed javascript to pdf in html having only the path of that document?
