What is the difference between Exploratory Factor Analysis and Principal Components Analysis (PCA)?

I know what you're thinking, this is a duplicate of " What are the differences between Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis ", but it isn't really. That other question deals with Confirmatory Factor Analysis. Either way, I would like to know what the difference is :) Thanks!
