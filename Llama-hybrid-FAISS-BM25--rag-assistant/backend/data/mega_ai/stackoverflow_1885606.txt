How are the ratings calculated? How do you decide which film is on the first place in the ranking? You have to consider how often an items wins and how good are the beaten items. What you want is a weighted rating, also called a Bayesian estimate. I think IMDB's Top 250 movies is a better starting point to make a ranking website. Some movies have 300,000+ votes while others others have fewer than 50,000. IMDB uses a Bayesian estimate to rank movies against one another without unfairly weighting popular movies. The algorithm is given at the bottom of the page: weighted rating (WR) = (v ÷ (v+m)) × R + (m ÷ (v+m)) × C where: R = average for the movie (mean) = (Rating) v = number of votes for the movie = (votes) m = minimum votes required to be listed in the Top 250 (currently 3000) C = the mean vote across the whole report (currently 6.9) for the Top 250, only votes from regular voters are considered. I don't know how IMDB chose 3000 as their minimum vote. They could have chosen 1000 or 10000, and the list would have been more or less the same. Maybe they're using "average number of votes after 6 weeks in the box office" or maybe they're using trial and error. In any case, it doesn't really matter. The formula above is pretty much the standard for normalizing votes on ranking websites, and I'm almost certain Flickrchart uses something similar in the background. The formula works so well because it "pulls" ratings toward the mean, so ratings above the mean are slightly decreased, ratings below the mean are slightly increased. However , the strength of the pull is inversely proportional to the number of votes a movie has. So movies with few votes are pulled more aggressively toward the mean than movies with lots of votes. Here are two data points to demonstrate the property: Rank Movie Votes Avg Rating Weighted Rating ---- ----- ----- ---------- --------------- 219 La Strada 15,000+ 8.2 8.0 221 Pirates of the 210,000+ 8.0 8.0 Caribbean 2 Both movies' ratings are pulled down, but the pull on La Strada is more dramatic since it has fewer votes and therefore is not as representative as ratings for PotC. For your specific case, you have two items in a "fight". You should probably design your table as follows: Items ----- ItemID (pk) FightsWon (int) FightsEngaged (int) The average rating is FightsWon / FightsEngaged. The weighted rating is calculated using the formula above. When a user chooses a winner in a fight, increase the winning item's FightsWon field by 1, increase both items FightsEngaged field by 1.
