 28 bytes (plus address / overhead to 32 bytes), and each message begins with a fixed “0x0D” byte as part of the TO (address) field. The “unique 4 bytes” that many enthusiasts believed to be a full serial identifier of the tag are not entirely unique. You can only reconstruct part of the actual serial from them. The sensor itself does some internal classification: e.g. distinguishing walking vs running internally, storing some “lifetime” counters, etc. Interestingly, the system has a built-in guard: if a sensor reports “on time” >1000 hours (cumulative), Apple’s higher-level code treats the battery as “dead,” even if it physically isn’t.
