The char array returned by string.c_str() is null terminated. If tinyXML's function takes a not null terminated char* buffer, then your probably gonna get some unexpected behaviour. const char* c_str ( ) const; Get C string equivalent Generates a null-terminated sequence of characters (c-string) with the same content as the string object and returns it as a pointer to an array of characters. A terminating null character is automatically appended. No, it does not need to be released. String's destructor does that for you. The returned array points to an internal location with the required storage space for this sequence of characters plus its terminating null-character, but the values in this array should not be modified in the program and are only granted to remain unchanged until the next call to a non-constant member function of the string object.
