I'm not sure what you mean by "similarities" in it? You mean you want to perform a wavelet analysis or calculate the coherency with another timeseries? To start off with a simple wavelet analysis you can use the WaveletComp package: my.require("WaveletComp") # read your data e.g. from netcdf file into "d1" here... # make dataframe and wavelet my.data = data.frame(x = d1) my.w = analyze.wavelet(my.data, "x",method = "white.noise", loess.span = 0,n.sim=10) wt.image(my.w,color.key="interval",n.levels=200) The package also allows you calculate coherency between 2 time series.
