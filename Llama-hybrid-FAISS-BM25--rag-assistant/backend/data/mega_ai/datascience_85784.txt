Twitter Data-Analyse: What can I do with the data?

I retrieve data to a specific topic from Twitter and did my sentiment analysis on it. I never did anything in NLP, etc. So what else can I do with that? "Main goal" would be to find out if the Twitter community is against this "topic" or not. I am also struggling with cleaning the data and I mean by that, that I am unsure how much should I clean on that Tweet. I would be also glad to get any advise on books, articles, communities, videos...
