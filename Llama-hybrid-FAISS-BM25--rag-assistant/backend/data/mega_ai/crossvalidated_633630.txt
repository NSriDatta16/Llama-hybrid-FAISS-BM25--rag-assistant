Regarding multiplying PCA values by -1 in R during Principal Component Analysis

I have started learning Principal Component Analysis using R and applied it on UsArrests dataset. I have read in an article that eigenvectors in R point in the negative direction by default, so weâ€™ll have to multiply PCA values such as $pca\$rotation $ and $pca\$x$ by -1 to reverse the signs. I am observing that, after changing the signs in the principal components (say, pc1), the interpretation of the pc1 column is getting changed (if I consider the + sign as increasing pattern and - as decreasing) for the variables. My question is that is it necessary to multiply PCA values by -1 or will I use the original value the software is providing?
