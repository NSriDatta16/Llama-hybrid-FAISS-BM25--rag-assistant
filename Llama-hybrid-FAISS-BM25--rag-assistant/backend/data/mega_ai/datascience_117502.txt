This is an interesting question about a generic taxonomy for machine learning problems framing. Although in practice it is sometimes difficult to know in advance which algorithm is best to select, there are some generic rules to follow as a first approximation, like the following from Scikit-learn which covers some of your points: About questions like imbalanced datasets, I would pay more attention on which metrics to use (e.g. Precision-Recall AUC instead of ROC AUC)...
