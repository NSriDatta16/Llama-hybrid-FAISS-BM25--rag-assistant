Why don't you cluster similar embeddings and store then use hashing to search faster. Then you can store them anywhere, maybe in bigdata hdfs distributed system for faster retrieval or simply hashed clusters in databases if you are in research or POC environment. I have also seen some other techniques for information retrieval, in which you apply TF IDF or simpler search techniques for first filtering out the text of interest and then work on 768 dim embeddings. This way is faster if search is your primary target.
