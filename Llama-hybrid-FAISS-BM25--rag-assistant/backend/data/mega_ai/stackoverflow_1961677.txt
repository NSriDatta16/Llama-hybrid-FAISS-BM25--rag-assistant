An option for the future - eventually DropBox will have an API. If you had users sign up for a free DropBox account then they'd get 2G free storage. If they need more space then they can signup for a premium account. The nice thing with this model is you offload your storage costs to the individual users. The users, in turn, get all the benefits of DropBox.
