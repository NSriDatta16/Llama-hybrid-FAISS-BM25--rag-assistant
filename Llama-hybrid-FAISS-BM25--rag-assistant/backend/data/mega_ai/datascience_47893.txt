How do I create a data set that has a set of features for multiple options, with one option being the expected outcome?

Most datasets I see are: feature 1, feature 2, feature 3, outcome Where outcome is binary e.g. if they are cancer positive outcome will be 1 and 0 if they don't have cancer. How do I create a dataset where there are multiple outcomes and each possible outcome has a set of features for it? e.g. I have a question with 3 possible answers: "What organ pumps blood around the human body?" A. Heart B. Liver C. Church Organ And each answer has a set of features with one answer being correct. How would I display this in a csv file? I want to read it into an xgboost algorithm for training. question, option1 and features, option2 and features, option3 and features, correct option Many thanks for your help!
