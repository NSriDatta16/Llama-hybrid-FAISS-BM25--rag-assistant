What is the point of PCA

The only reason I can think of to use PCA is to use it basically the same way you use exploratory factor analysis. It can validate for us that questions in a survey load onto principal components the way you would expect. I can't think of a way to use it other than that. My understanding is that PCA is basically worthless if you are trying to predict something. I can't use PCA for feature selection, meaning that I can't use PCA to tell me which of my original columns to use in a model. I also can't use the newly-created principal component scores in a predictive model. Given that, even if I can use PCA to choose a small number of principal components that capture a lot of variance, what's the point? Would love a specific example or two, beyond using it as a substitute for CFA and EFA in academia.
