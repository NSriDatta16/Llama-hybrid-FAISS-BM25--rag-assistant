Are non-stationary ARMA models used to model time series?

An ARMA model is not necessarily stationary. It is when certain conditions on the model are satisfied. In time series, an ARMA model is used to model a stationary process. On the other hand, is a nonstationary ARMA model used to model a (not necessarily stationary) time series? Or (almost) always, only stationary ARMA is used for modelling a time series? The point of my question is whether nonstationary ARMA is useful or useless.
