JQuery - Most elegant way for storing data to be used by javascript

I was just curious what's the best way to store data for use by JQuery - I'm setting up a basic mp3 player, and the title, artist, track and file name all need be held somewhere to be retrieved by JQuery upon clicking in the radio interface. I was thinking of storying them as simple attributes within an tag, like this: but I'm guessing that might be considered bad form. I know I could bring them in via XML, but I'd rather not have to retrieve from some external document. Anybody have a good solution?
