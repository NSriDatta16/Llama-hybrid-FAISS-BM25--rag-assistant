Using "prior intervals" instead of "prior distributions:" how should I update my beliefs?

The further I read Bayesian books, the clearer it becomes that traditional Bayesian inference has focused on very narrow problems: it requires users to completely specify a prior distribution over parameters. Most of the time, however, users have only a coarse knowledge of reality. For instance, $\theta \in [a, b]$ . If my prior information is simply that $\theta \in [a, b]$ , and I have observed some data $X\sim P(X|\theta)$ , what is the rational way to update my beliefs about $\theta$ ?
