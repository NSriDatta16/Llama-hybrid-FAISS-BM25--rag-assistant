Just use XmlConvert.ToDateTime (note that XmlConvert.ToDateTime(string) is considered obsolete now and you should use XmlConvert.ToDateTime(string, XmlDateTimeSerializationMode) . However, if you insist on using DateTime.ParseExact (and there are good reasons to do so but then you should use DateTime.TryParseExact to avoid exception throwing in cases of fail) you can use the following format string: string format = "yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffzzz"; The parentheticals in the above paragraphs might be cumbersome to parse (I have a habit of doing that; sorry).
