hmm, I hash, more than once based on whatever math springs to mind at the time of writing the storing and validation of passwords From here on I'll probably go with OpenID as much as possible wherever I have an actual choice tho, so i don't have to do any password storage at all. That way I can leave passwords up to the experts, and the users already trusted party.
