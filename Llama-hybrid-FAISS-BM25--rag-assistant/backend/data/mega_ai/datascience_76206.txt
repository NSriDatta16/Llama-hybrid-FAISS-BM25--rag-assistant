Classification Algorithm for Segmented Regression Time Series

I have Segmented Linear Regression dataset in JSON format like this: var series = [ {x:0,w:10,m:0.5,b:50}, {x:10,w:5,m:0.6,b:40}, {x:15,w:20,m:1,b:100}, // So on.... ]; the Dataset formatted for typical line equation: y=mx+b Here is a JSFiddle link that describes the situation with canvas element: https://jsfiddle.net/digerkam/7krb50z8/ My problem is that classifying/grouping the similar segments like the yellow one: I tried many things, I researched eveywhere I found, I thought so many times but no luck to find the alghorithm, or any equation for detect continuity/similarity... Espacially detecting changes between A and B is so confusing my mind, because it has very similar characteristic like noizes in C part. So how can classify this dataset as expected? Which alghorithm can solve this mystery? Thank you!
