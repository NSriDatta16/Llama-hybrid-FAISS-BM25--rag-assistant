In SQL Server you can do this. Don't know if it works in Oracle. I'm sure I'll find out soon if it doesn't! WITH cte As ( SELECT tableA.ID, SUM(tableB.NUM) AS MY_SUM, AVG(SUM(tableB.NUM)) over() As Average FROM tableA, tableB WHERE tableA.ID = tableB.ID GROUP BY tableA.ID ) SELECT ID FROM cte WHERE MY_SUM > Average
