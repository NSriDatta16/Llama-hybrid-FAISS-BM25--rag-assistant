Smart-Gwt ScrolledHandler usage

I would like to do something when a scroll event has occurred on a smartgwt window. I'm assuming that an event will be fired when at least one of the following has happened: scroll within window with mouse scroll wheel, scroll by dragging scroll bar, or scroll using scroll arrows. I've added a handler to a smartgwt window and also to the smartgwt canvas which is the only child of the window. Both have been set up to write to GWT.log. However, I can't seem to get a ScrollEvent to fire. Any ideas?
