action won't run on a CCSprite from within ccTouchBegan in cocos2d for iphone

I'm trying to basically scale up a button as soon as a touch is detected. Here's my Scene: @implementation HomeScene -(id) init { if((self = [super init])) { ... // sp_btn_story is retained... sp_btn_story = [[CCSprite spriteWithFile:@"main_menu_btn.png"] retain]; sp_btn_story.position = ccp(size.width - 146, 110); [self addChild: sp_btn_story]; ... } return self; } -(void) onEnter { [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] addTargetedDelegate:self priority:0 swallowsTouches:YES]; } -(void) onExit { [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] removeDelegate:self]; } - (BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event { NSLog(@"tapped!"); sp_btn_story.scaleX = 2; [sp_btn_story stopAllActions]; [sp_btn_story runAction: [CCScaleTo actionWithDuration:0.5f scale:1.2f]]; return YES; } ... @end It scales the X just fine, as expected. (I threw that in there to test.) But the action is not running for some reason. :( Anyone have any ideas? Edit: using cocos2d 0.99 btw.
