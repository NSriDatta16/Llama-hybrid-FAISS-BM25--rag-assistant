ML recommendation techniques where all users are not in training set

I have a list of orders, which contains a list of items. I need to use machine learning to suggest other items to customers based purely on their basket at the time of checkout, considering the history of orders placed. Ideally it must be done with ML.NET. I have tried a few variations of matrix factorisation but to predict more items for a customer, the starting basket must be in the training set. I can't retrain every time a order is placed, that would take a long time. Am I going about this the wrong way? Are there different techniques that would work better or have I missed something from matrix factorisation? Many thanks
