Normality tests for latent variable in probit regression

I am performing a probit regression where the latent variable y* is conceptually important. I already have the model defined with regressors: categorical variables, quadratic terms, continuous variables and other integer variables. Now, I am in the post evaluation stage of the model, the average prediction performance is good 83%, apart from other tests that are satisfactory, but I also need to test the normality of the latent variable (error term), and its variance, that is: the heteroscedaticity, asymmetry and kurtosis. I have already reviewed substantive works such as Chesher1987 "Residual Analysis in the Grouped and Censored Normal Linear Model" and Bera1984 "Testing the Normality Assumption in Limited Dependent Variable Models", both of which develop LM tests using residual moments. That's very good. So I wanted to perform the tests but I couldn't find any package in R that includes those tests. ps.: I'm not very good with programming. Thanks.
