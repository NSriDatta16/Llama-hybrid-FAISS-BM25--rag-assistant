If the model were true, you would find that $$ r_{t}^{2} = \epsilon_{t}^{2} = z_{t}^{2}\sigma_{t}^{2}=z_{t}^{2}(\omega + \alpha_{1}\epsilon_{t-1}^{2} + \beta_{1}\sigma_{t-1}^{2} + \alpha_{2}\epsilon_{t-2}^{2} + \beta_{2}\sigma_{t-2}^{2}). $$ This provides a way to generate a time series $\{r_t\}_{t=1}^T$ given the starting values and the parameters. Suppose that God or nature did that, and now you have observed $\{r_t\}_{t=1}^T$ . If you wish to find out what parameters and starting values were used to generate this time series, you can use the data $\{r_t\}_{t=1}^T$ to estimate them using, say, maximum likelihood. There is no contradiction between how the data were generated and that you might want to find the parameters that you cannot observe directly. P.S. Note that $z_t\sim \text{i.i.d.}\ N(0,1)$ , not only $z_t\sim N(0,1)$ .
