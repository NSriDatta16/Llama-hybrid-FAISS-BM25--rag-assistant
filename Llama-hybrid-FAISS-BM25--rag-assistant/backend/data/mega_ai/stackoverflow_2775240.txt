Jquery sortable stange mouse offset

I'm working with the jQuery sortable plugin( 2 connected lists) and have a strange bug. When you drag the picture the mouse is above the dragged item screenshot: http://img408.imageshack.us/i/mouseb.png/ Html for one of the lists sortable configuration: horizontal: { helper: "clone", // Instead of dragging the real image a copy will be dragged connectWith: ["#flickr_sidebar ul"], // To be able to drag and drop an image to another image gallery they need to be connected cursor: 'pointer', //change the cursor when dragging appendTo: 'body', //When dropped the images need to be appended to the image gallery where they are dropped containment: rootel, //Make sure the user can't drag the images outside the widget revert: true, // if the user releases the image ouside the dropbox it'll return to it's original position zIndex: 9999 }, Anyone know how to get the mouse in the middle or something ? (cursorAt doesn't work)
