How to test if variable is ordinal or from an interval?

Suppose I have a variable $X$ with samples $x_i$ for $i=1,\ldots,N$ where $N=10,000$ (just something big). Posit that a sample subset looks like so: $x_{1:10} = [4,2,3,4,6,3,8,9,1,3]$. How can I tell, or what tests can I do, to determine if these $N$ samples are ordinal? I.e. what tests are available, or techniques for differentiating between this ordinal variable and say just random integers in the range 1 to 9? Or say I have another variable say $Y$ which has a subset sample that looks like so $y_{1:6} = [\text{'fat', 'thin', 'average', 'fat', 'fat', 'thin'}]$ - this is clearly a discrete ordinal variable, but is there a way to statistically establish this? Similarly for interval variables, what testa can one make, or models run, to determine the nature of said variable?
