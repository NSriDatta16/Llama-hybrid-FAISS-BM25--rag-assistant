Imagine you have a matrix, where each row represents a month, and each column represents a stock return. So, you first run a regression on each row of data. That's your cross sectional regression. You obtain coefficients. These coefficients correspond to a month of the row. For instance, you have a column of intercepts: each intercept belongs to a certain month (row). You can now run time series regression of the intercepts. Intuitively, I see it as a reduction of a matrix into a scalar: you reduce rows into scalars first, which will leave you with one column, then you reduce this column into a scalar. The procedure which you described sounds like a pooled regression . Since your data set spans 20 years, you probably do not have each stock's return in each time period because new firms get listed, some are delisted, corporate actions like mergers happen etc. Hence, the population of stocks (columns) in each month (row) is different.
