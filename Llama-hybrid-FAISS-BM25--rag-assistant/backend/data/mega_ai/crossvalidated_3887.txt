VisTrails: A Python-Based Scientific Workflow and Provenance System . This talk given at PyCon 2010 has some good ideas. Worth listening to even if you are not interested in using VisTrails or python. In the end I think if you would be able to require that there be a clear document way to reproduce the data. And require some validation that they can. Quoting: "In this talk, we will give an overview of VisTrails ( http://www.vistrails.org ), a python-based open-source scientific workflow that transparently captures provenance (i.e., lineage) of both data products and the processes used to derive these products. We will show how VisTrails can be used to streamline data exploration and visualization. Using real examples, we will demonstrate key features of the system, including the ability to visually create information processing pipelines that combine multiple tools and Iibraries such as VTK, pylab, and matplotlib. We will also show how VisTrails leverages provenance information not only to support result reproducibility, but also to simplify the creation and refinement of pipelines."
