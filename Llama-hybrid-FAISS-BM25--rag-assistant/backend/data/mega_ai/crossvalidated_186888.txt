"1000 training samples" to me sounds like: You have a dataset with 1000 data pairs. Pairs means for example: collocated measurements from Satellite a and Satellite b. You use them for the training of an SVM: This would basically establish a relation between Satellite a and b. You will then be able to predict Satellite a from any value of Satellite b. If you use a part of those data pairs for validation, this validation will tell you how well the SVM performs to predict Satellite a! If this is what you want: you are fine without ground data! If you want to know how well the SVM describes "reality", you will have to consider also the error of Satellite a! This can theoretically, as you guessed, be achieved by using ground-based measurements. However: do not forget that comparisons between Satellite-measurements and ground-based data are not that easy to handle and you have to consider many other error sources!
