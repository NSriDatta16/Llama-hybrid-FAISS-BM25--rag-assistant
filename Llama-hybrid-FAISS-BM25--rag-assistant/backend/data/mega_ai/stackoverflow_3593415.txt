SQL is for data retrieval, and is useful for retrieving data based on objective criteria, where there is a right or wrong answer. There is no objective measure of what makes a post a "related post", so it's not something that you can effectively do with SQL alone. Document clustering , which means grouping related documents, is a large and active research area, so that's a good place to start, but implementing something yourself will be very difficult. Depending on the language you're using, you might look at clustering libraries. For example, if you're using Java (or anything that runs on the JVM, or you can set up a web service to do the clustering), you could look at using Weka .
