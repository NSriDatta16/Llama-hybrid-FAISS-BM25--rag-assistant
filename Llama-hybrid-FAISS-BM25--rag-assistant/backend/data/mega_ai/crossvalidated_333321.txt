The definition of "best" is ambiguous and researchers in statistics spent a good deal of effort to work out "best" estimators under different criteria. For example, uniformly minimum variance unbiased estimators (UMVUE) are "best" in the sense of minimum variance among the class of unbiased estimators. Similarly, there are Bayesian estimators that will be biased, but perform better under mean squared error loss. However, to answer the OP's question, you can estimate $\hat{\lambda} = 1/\bar{x}$, where $\bar{x}$ denotes the sample mean, as a reasonable estimate for a first pass. Generally speaking your estimates will not differ by much with a reasonably large sized set of data.
