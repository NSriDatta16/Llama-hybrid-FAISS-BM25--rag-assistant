C++/CLI -- 0xc000007b (INVALID_IMAGE_FORMAT) with /clr option on

I'm trying to build a C++/CLI executable to which I statically link ffmpeg (libavcodec, libavformat, libavutil & swscale). It works fine if I build it normally (without /clr, so no CLR support), it works. However, when I add CLR support, it won't start up with a 0xc000007b. A "Hello World" C++/CLI app runs fine, though. Supposedly the same thing happens with Boost::Threads, but since ffmpeg is pure C, I doubt it's using Boost. My config: Visual Studio 2008 Professional SP1 Windows XP Pro SP3 (x86) .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 Thanks, Robert
