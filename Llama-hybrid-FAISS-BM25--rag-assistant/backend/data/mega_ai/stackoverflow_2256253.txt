WPF: Browser-like tear-outs

I have an application that consists of a set of tabs. Each tab has an indpenedent user-control. Currently the users can press a "New Window" button. This button creates a new form and moves the user control from it's current tab into the new form. Instead of the button, users would like to simply drag the tab out of the current window like we do with web browsers. How would I go about doing that?
