I would: Use SSL for the connection Put a time and session based token in the request Validate the inputs against expected ranges on the server SSL prevents man-in-the-middle Tokenized requests verify that the request is coming from an active and authenticated session, within a reasonable amount of time from the last activity within the session. This prevents stale requests being re-submitted and verifies that it came from the source of the session (store the IP address, user-agent, etc on the server for session management). Validating that the inputs are within expected ranges verifies that the request has not been doctored by the party that you are talking to.
