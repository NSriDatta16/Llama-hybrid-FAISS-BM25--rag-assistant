If you accept spectroscopy as frequency-domain: PCA is used a lot there. E.g. a pubmed search on principal component analysis and spectroscopy yields more than 2500 results. On the other hand, spectroscopists rarely look at the time domain (Fourier-transform spectroscopy does use a spatial domain as "intermediate" but for data analysis the frequency/wavelength/wavenumber domain is generally used and interpreted). If you do a PCA in the frequency domain, the first PCs will tell you which frequencies contribute most to the variance in the data set and moreover which frequencies vary together (with pos. or neg. correlation): they end up in the same PC or independent of each other (end up in different PCs). Whether this coincides with most contributing frequencies depends on whether/where your data is centered (by its nature or by centering). I'd say whether PCA should be done in time or frequency domain depends on the interpretation of these domains. If you want to find things that happen at the same time or times where the same things happen, then the time domain should be appropriate. IF you want to find things that happen with the same frequency or frequencies where the same things happen, then use frequency domain.
