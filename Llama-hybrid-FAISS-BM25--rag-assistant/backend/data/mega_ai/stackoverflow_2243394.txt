Do not use the clipboard unless directly instructed to do so by the logged-on user. It's not for general application storage - it's for the user to use for what they want to clip. If you want to get text from an arbitrary textbox, locate the window (in the Win32) sense and send an EM_GETTEXT Win32 message.
