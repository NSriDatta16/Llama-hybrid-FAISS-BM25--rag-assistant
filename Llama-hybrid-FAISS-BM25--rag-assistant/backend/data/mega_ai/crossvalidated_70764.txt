How to interpret augmented Dickey-Fuller unit root test in R

I am looking at a time series which has no obvious trend, but seems to have an intercept a little above zero. The results I get for ur.df function in R is the following: logprice_df |t|) (Intercept) 1.841e-02 8.268e-03 2.226 0.02626 * z.lag.1 -1.573e-02 5.635e-03 -2.791 0.00537 ** tt 9.234e-06 1.080e-05 0.855 0.39272 z.diff.lag 1.411e-01 3.364e-02 4.195 3.01e-05 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Residual standard error: 0.07512 on 865 degrees of freedom Multiple R-squared: 0.02651, Adjusted R-squared: 0.02314 F-statistic: 7.852 on 3 and 865 DF, p-value: 3.572e-05 Value of test-statistic is: -2.791 2.6012 3.8997 Critical values for test statistics: 1pct 5pct 10pct tau3 -3.96 -3.41 -3.12 phi2 6.09 4.68 4.03 phi3 8.27 6.25 5.34 The problem is that I do not understand how one shall interpret these values. What is F-statistic ? And what is the probabilities below Pr(>|t|) in the first table, and also Value of test-statistic ? I really appreciate any help.
