Flash: Adjust this code to keep the duplicated movie clip

OK, so here is my code ham_mc.onPress=function(){ startDrag(this); } ham_mc.onRelease=ham_mc.onReleaseOutside=function(){ stopDrag(); _root.ham_mc.duplicateMovieClip("ham_mc" + "x",2); x++; } The user can at first drag the movie clip. When released, the duplicateMovieClip command runs, leaving a new ham movie clip in the position the first is dragged to. PROBLEM: When I click and drag the first ham movie click again, the duplicateMovieClip runs again but REPLACES the previous generated movie clip. I added x and x++ in an attempt to give the movie clip duplication a different name every time, but this doesn't solve it. How do I change this code so that a NEW ham_mc is created every time, rather than overwriting the old one. I'm tired, sorry for the poor explaination!
