Generating interesting/useful features from existing useless features

I am new to ML and trying to work on a binary classification problem. I came to know that one of the main factors for success of ML is feature engineering. I am here to seek some inspiration/help from experienced folks here on how to generate creative/interesting features based on existing features. My dataset is given below In my dataset, I have already created some new features based on existing date columns (existing date columns are not shown in screenshot. Only derived date columns are shown here). Refer below date_diff_1 - indicates the time taken by company to respond to customer in days. date_diff_2 - indicates the time taken by customer to book his 1st PO after the deal is made. date_diff_3 - indicates the time taken by customer to hit 1000$ revenue Additionally, Division and category-Division variables are correlated. So, I plan to remove the highly cardinal column category-Division . How does one approach feature engineering in scenarios like this? what are some of the usual/typical practice that data scientists follow to create interesting features to uncover hidden info (from the data)?
