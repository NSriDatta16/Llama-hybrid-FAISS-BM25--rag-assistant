How can one number paragraphs in LaTeX?

Given a bunch of paragraphs: Para. A ... Para. B ... Para. C ... How can one have LaTeX automatically number them, i.e. 1. Para. A. ... 2. Para. B. ... 3. Para. C. ... I've seen the following suggested: \newcounter{parnum} \newcommand{\N}{% \noindent\refstepcounter{parnum}% \makebox[\parindent][l]{\textbf{\arabic{parnum}.}}} % Use a generous paragraph indent so numbers can be fit inside the % indentation space. \setlength{\parindent}{2em} From here: comp.text.tex: Re: How do I number paragraphs in LaTeX? Then use \N in front of every paragraph-to-be-numbered, i.e. \N Para. A. ... \N Para. B. ... \N Para. C. ... I've also seen references to Sarovar and numberpar , but both are referred to as "unstable" or "unpredictable", and things like "randomly breaks", which makes me wary. I'd like some input on what may be the best course of action, here, and I think it's a topic worth some discussion. Thank you for your interest and attention to this. EDIT : I've tried the following \begin{enumerate} \item Para No. 1 \item Para No. 2 ... \end{enumerate} However it results in typesetting problems, notably because I am interspersing section headings ala. \begin{enumerate} \item Para No. 1 \item Para No. 2 \section{Part II} \item Para No. 5 \item Para No. 6 ... \end{enumerate} and the section heading "Part II" will sometimes end up at the very bottom of the page (i.e. it doesn't keep with the following text).
