Below, I presume that the results of the different strategies are independent of each other, i.e. the yield of one strategy is not containing any indication about the yield of any other strategy. You might be referring to something that is known as the multi-armed bandit problem . For this, many different strategies have been devised, see the above link. The problem is always to find the "right" balance between exploration , i.e. finding the strategy with the highest average yield, and exploitation , i.e. getting as high a yield as possible. Multi-armed bandit strategies usually have parameters that can be configured to tune this trade-off according to your special needs. As far as estimating the confidence of the estimated yield of each strategy is concerned, this clearly depends on the number of trials: if you want higher confidence for the estimation of the yield of one strategy, you need more trials for that strategy. You might want to have a look at binomial proportion confidence intervals .
