Good question, but depends on how much code you want to write. What if I mirror/flip an image, cut&paste with-in images. When you solve this problem, you've cracked most CAPTCHA too? If you have alot of horsepower and programming man-hours you might want to look at Forier Transformations and Historgams to find matches. This would identify flip/mirror copy/paste. Then create lots of fragments of tests, like unit tests(?) for things like "can this bit of image be found in the source" "can this bit when hue-rotated be found" etc etc. Very open ended problem
