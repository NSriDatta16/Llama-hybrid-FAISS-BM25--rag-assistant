What test is appropriate for comparing demographic data across time?

I am analyzing survey data for a membership organization. We have survey data from 2000, 2005, and 2010, and each year has between 400-600 respondents (the survey was sent to all members). In all years, the ratio of men to women is highly male, and there are many more people in the upper age categories. However, it seems that both of these demographic measures are moving toward a more equal balance, but the change is small. What statistical test can I use to see if the change across the years is actually significant?
