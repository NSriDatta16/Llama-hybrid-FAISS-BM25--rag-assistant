I can not test this right now, but as I see it, you're making the draggable, yet you're observing clicks on the element, so the problem is probably that the click event bubbles up to the link, which executes its default action. Prototype has a stop() method for events that besides preventing the default action, also cancels event bubbling - you could try that in the onEnd function instead of preventDefault() .
