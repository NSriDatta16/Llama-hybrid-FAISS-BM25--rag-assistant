Use of cloud computing in web development

Could anyone please tell me what the web developers can do with cloud computing, sorry for the very basic question i got confused so much by googling. Please tell me how to use or where to use this technology in PHP web development field. I used AMAZON'S ec2 but there i just followed their manual and it was very simple file storage. But in what way it could help me to make great projects?
