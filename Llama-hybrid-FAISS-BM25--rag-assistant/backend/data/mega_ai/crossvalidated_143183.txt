Simple question on odds ratios interpretation

I am trying to interpret the Odds Ratios (ORs) from a multiple logistic regression model that compares the performance of various clinics in terms of preterm birth rate (measured as "Yes/No preterm birth"). Here are some simplified results for purpose of discussion: Clinic 1 is used as a reference clinic OR for Clinic 2 = 0.5 OR for Clinic 3 = 2.0 One conclusion is: "the odds to have preterm birth in Clinic 3 are 4 times higher than in Clinic 2 (2.0 / 0.5)." Can I make a similar statement in terms of the probability of having preterm birth in Clinic 3 compared to Clinic 2? Something like: "the probability of having preterm birth in Clinic 3 is X times that in Clinic 2" Would appreciate any input here.
