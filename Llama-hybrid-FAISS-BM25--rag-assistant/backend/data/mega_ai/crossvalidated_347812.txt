I assume that you are referring to the standard OLS regression. This model has several assumptions which are well described here: https://www.albert.io/blog/key-assumptions-of-ols-econometrics-review/ If all assumptions are satisfied, the model is right in the sense that: The form of the model corresponds to the true data generating process Your estimates of the coefficients are unbiased Your estimates of the variance of the coefficients are unbiased Violation of the different assumptions have different implications. For example, if the Assumption of Homoscedasticity is violated, the estimates of the variance of the coefficients are biased, but not the estimates of the coefficients themselves. All the details are provided in the above link.
