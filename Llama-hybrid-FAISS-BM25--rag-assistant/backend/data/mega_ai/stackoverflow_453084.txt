I would keep the schema as simple as possible, so querying will be as simple as possible. This usually also has the lowest storage requirements. Of course, set indices to support this query. Next step: measure the performance! "To measure is to know." What is the response time? What is the load on the server? As long as the performance is acceptable, keep the schema and query simple. Do not sacrifice maintainability if it is not absolutely necessary: your successors will thank you for it later. If performance really is a problem, look at the caching functionality of the framework you are using for your application. NOT performing a query is always faster than performing an optimized one.
