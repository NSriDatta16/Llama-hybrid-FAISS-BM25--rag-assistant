what could be the best method to find best scenario based on revenue(statistical analysis) in python?

I have a data set on which I want to do some statistical analysis. The sample data set is in a csv file and of following nature: Restaurant Type City, Capacity Property category Average Occupancy Revenue Siting, San Fransisco 120 to 150 Stand Alone 70 311612 Self Service San Fransisco 120 to 150 Mall 78 190000 Siting San Jose 80 to 100 Mall 50 230000 Siting San Fransisco 120 to 150 Stand Alone 85 280000 Self Service San Jose 120 to 150 Mall 70 310000 One of the analyses I want to do is to find which type of Restaurant (Sitting or Self Service) is better based on revenues? Another is what type of property category is beneficial based on revenues? Yet another analysis could be what kind of Restaurant is better based on capacity, average occupancy and revenue? I am new to statistical analysis, so I am having trouble to find a suitable algorithm to do such analyses? What could be some of the good algorithms to do the analyses? NOTE: I know this question is subjective and open to debate but since I am new to this so I am having trouble. Apologies in advance!
