Inserting email headers into mysql field quotes and slashes issue

I am trying to insert email headers read from impap in to a mysql text field. Problem is the headers are full of slashes, commas, quotes, line feeds. mysql_escape doesnt come near it. The different mail server responses can lead to quite different headers. Do i have to do some weird voodoo before storage?
