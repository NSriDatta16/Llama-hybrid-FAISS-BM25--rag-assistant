Stationary time series input to ARMA-GARCH

I’m thoroughly confused as I have been using ARMA-GARCH to model a conditional mean and conditional variance so I can effectively remove them by taking the residuals and be left with an i.i.d process. I have read however that the input to an ARMA model must be stationary. My question therefore is how can a stationary process contain both conditional mean and conditional variance? Although I’m starting to also think I’m misunderstanding ARMA completely as the outputs of ARMA look stationary. If I take the residuals of an ARMA model what have I potentially removed from the model?
