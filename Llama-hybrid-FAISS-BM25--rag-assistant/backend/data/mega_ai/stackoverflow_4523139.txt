It sounds like you're not using the best event for what you're trying to do. Your code should mostly work for the keypress event ( example ), but won't work well at all for keyup or keydown . But just listening for keypress won't let you build up a string of what keys were pressed. For instance, using the example above, if I type "abcd" then right-arrow twice then "xx", the built-up string will be "abcdxx" where what's showing in the text box is "abxxcd". So more sophistication will be required. Here there be dragons. For a good idea of the madness around JavaScript keyboard events, this site has great information.
