Function point analysis is good. But I generally go by this approach. Identify the roles in the system. Identify the Use Cases of the applications and common and discrete use cases by each role. Bifurcate the Use Cases into High Medium Low complexity. depending on your skill/mandays matrix your organization has, you should be able to estimate the efforts (number of manadys) Depending on the efforts and number of people on the project, you can estimate the calendar days. Don't forget the documentation, Integration testing, system testing, Peer reviews, User Acceptance testing timings :)
