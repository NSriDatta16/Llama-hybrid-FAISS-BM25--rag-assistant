Estimating workers within Industry Sector using commuter data (combining probabilities?)

I have some detailed data about the commuting patterns of workers. If I know the following 3 things... The total number of workers commuting from one block to another. The total # and % of manufacturing-sector workers in the origin block. The total # and % of manufacturing-sector workers in the destination block. ... Is it possible to estimate the number of manufacturing-sector workers who commute from the origin block to the destination block ? Data structure is below. I think it's a probability combination, but I'm too rusty to come up with an elegant solution. Thanks a bunch for taking a look. If successful, this analysis will be used to characterize the regional commuting patterns of specific industry clusters.
