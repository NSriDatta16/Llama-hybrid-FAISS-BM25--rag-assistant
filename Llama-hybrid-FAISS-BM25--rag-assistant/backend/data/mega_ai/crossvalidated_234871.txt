In machine learning "programming" = coding up an algorithm, in operations research "programming" = optimization? More serious answer, I think the differences are more historical lineage and application area than techniques per se. One perspective on the cultures of (academic) statistics vs. machine learning I found interesting is "The Stats Handicap" . Statistics is the oldest, and originated out of mathematics and probability, perhaps emerging as a distinct discipline in the late 19th century (though much of theory is older). Of the three, statistics is perhaps the most associated with "academic science", and is certainly the most concerned with rigorous approaches to experimental design and data collection . Operations research seems to originate closer to WWII , and is generally associated with large organizations (e.g. military, logistics/supply-chain, industrial engineering ), focusing on managing and optimizing their "operations", as it were. (In terms of "data science" traditions with a long history, another big one would be econometrics. Wikipedia says it's economics, while CV says it's statistics, for what that's worth!) Machine learning is the most recent, but to me is more ambiguous, and at least in the popular-media it is essentially a re-branding of "AI". This broader sense includes many strands, including computer vision and probabilistic robotics. Computer science is an integral part of all of these, however. Finally, I would say that buzzwords like "Data Science" and "Analytics" are largely marketing terms. They are less likely to be used between members of these communities, vs. when communicating with outsiders (or when outsiders are talking between themselves).
