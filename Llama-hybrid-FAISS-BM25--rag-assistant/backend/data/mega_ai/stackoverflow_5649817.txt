By using attr() , you're actually setting the id attribute of any elements matched by your find() call. You should use find on the ID you're matching against. $(".container").droppable({ drop: function (event, ui) { var a = $(this).find("#" + $(ui.draggable).attr('id')); if (a.length === 0) { $.ajax({ ... }); } } }); Also, as @Diodeus mentions, IDs should not start with a number. They should also be unique document-wide, so if you need duplicate/expect IDs, I'd recommend using a different attribute, such as an HTML5 data attribute: http://ejohn.org/blog/html-5-data-attributes/
