We have experienced a similiar problem with one of our clients about one year ago. It turns out the client was using an FTP-client that saved it's passwords in plain-text and the system was infected with a virus that specifically scanned the system for these passwords files to overwrite the source code of the hosts saved within the file. For more information, also take a look at http://blog.unmaskparasites.com/2009/12/23/from-hidden-iframes-to-obfuscated-scripts/ . You will find it very similiar to the problem you were experiencing. The solution for us was to encourage our clients not to save passwords, or use FTP-clients that strongly encrypt passwords.
