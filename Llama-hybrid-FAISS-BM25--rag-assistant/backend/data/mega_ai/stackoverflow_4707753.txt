I don't think there is a very elegant way. You should probably make that dynamic member a pointer, then read all other members first, allocate memory for the last one, and then read the remainder of the data. Since you're in C++, you can nicely encapsulate this in a class so that you don't have to worry about this detail in your code anymore. Also, as other have said, a std::vector would be a more C++-like approach than a simple pointer and manually allocated memory. It would also be more resistant to memory leaks.
