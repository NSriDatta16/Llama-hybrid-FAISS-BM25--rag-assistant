How do spectral neural networks for learning on graphs work?

I've been reading this paper "Spectral Networks and Locally Connected Networks on Graphs" but for the full understanding of this paper it requires the reader to be knowledgeable about harmonic analysis which I'm not. So how would you explain the convolution-like operation that is supposed to generalize conventional convolution to ones on graph structures?
