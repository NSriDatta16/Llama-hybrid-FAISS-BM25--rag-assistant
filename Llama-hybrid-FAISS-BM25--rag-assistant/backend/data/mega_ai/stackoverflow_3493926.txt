As Remou said, use the Query Designer. Once you are in there you can drag and drop as you like to. If you really want to type in the SQL directly, you can. You can switch from Design view to SQL view and manually type it in. The SQL is pretty standard on MS Access. There are some things on other DBs that you would think are part of the standard, but aren't and having been implemented on MS Access' side. On MS Access the wild card character might be different than you expect. The default is "*" (ANSI-89) for .mdb's and .accdb's, but that could also be "%" is your are working with ANSI-92 SQL (used by .adp's - Access Data Projects). As a rule, you use the ANSI-89 wildcards when you run queries and find-and-replace operations against Access databases — .mdb and .accdb files. You use the ANSI-92 wildcards when you run queries against Access projects — Access files connected to Microsoft SQL Server databases. You might also be used to nesting queries in MySQL. Some of them you can't do the same way in MS Access - you have do some funny workarounds to get the same effect. Other wise it's pretty close. This may also have something to do with the differences between ANSI-89 SQL and ANSI-92 SQL (and beyond).
