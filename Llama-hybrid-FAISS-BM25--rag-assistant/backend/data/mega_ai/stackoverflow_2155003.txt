This directly depends on the library used for XML parsing. This is tricky however, because you can't embed the MD5 in the XML file itself, for after embedding the checksum inside, unless you do the checksum only from the specific elements. As I understand you receive the MD5 independently? Is it calculated from the whole file, or only the tags/content? MD5 Public Domain code link - http://www.fourmilab.ch/md5/ XML library for C - http://xmlsoft.org/ Exact solutions depend on the code used. Based on your comment you need to do the following steps: load the xml file (possibly even as plain-text) read the MD5 substitute the MD5 in the file with zero, write the file down (or better to memory) run MD5 on the pure file data and compare it with the value stored before
