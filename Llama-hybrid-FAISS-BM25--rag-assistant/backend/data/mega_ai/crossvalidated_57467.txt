How to perform dimensionality reduction with PCA in R

I have a big dataset and I want to perform a dimensionality reduction. Now everywhere I read that I can use PCA for this. However, I still don't seem to get what to do after calculating/performing the PCA. In R this is easily done with the command princomp . But what to do after calculating the PCA? If I decided I want to use the first $100$ principal components, how do I reduce my dataset exactly?
