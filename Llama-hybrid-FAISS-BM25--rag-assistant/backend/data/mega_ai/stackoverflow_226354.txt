How do you move a CALayer instantly (without animation)

I'm trying to drag a CALayer in an iOS app. As soon as I change its position property it tries to animate to the new position and flickers all over the place: layer.position = CGPointMake(x, y) How can I move CALayers instantly? I can't seem to get my head around the Core Animation API.
