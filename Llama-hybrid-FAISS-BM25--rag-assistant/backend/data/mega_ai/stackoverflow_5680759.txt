My assumption is you have more than 1 training set, and you have a gold standard. Also, I assume you have some way of storing the state of the neural network (whether it's a list of probability weights for each node, or something along those lines). Using as many compute nodes in a cluster as you can, launch the program on a data set on each node. Save the results for each, and test on the gold standard. Which ever neural network state performs best set as the input for the next round of training. Repeat as much as you see fit
