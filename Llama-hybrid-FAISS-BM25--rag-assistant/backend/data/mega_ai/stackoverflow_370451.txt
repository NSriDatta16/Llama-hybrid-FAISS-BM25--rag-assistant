Scrollable div without overflow:auto?

In my app I have 2 divs, one with a long list of products that can be dragged into another div (shopping cart). The product div has the overflow but it breaks prototype draggable elements. The prototype hacks are very obtrusive and not compatible with all browsers. So I am taking a different approach, is it possible to have a scrollable div without using CSS overflow:auto ?
