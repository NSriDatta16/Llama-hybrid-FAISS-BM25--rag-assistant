I don't know if the HTML format is a must have for you, but actually embedding an image in an email can be achieved without using HTML, just with image as attachment. Just have a look at the way it is achieved here : http://iphone-dev-tips.alterplay.com/2009/11/attaching-image-of-uiview-to-email.html the crucial part is this : // ATTACHING A SCREENSHOT NSData *myData = UIImagePNGRepresentation(screenshot); [controller addAttachmentData:myData mimeType:@"image/png" fileName:@"route"]; You get the PNG representation of your UIImage (as NSData ) and you attach it yo your email.
