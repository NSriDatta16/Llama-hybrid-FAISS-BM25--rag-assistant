A Poisson does not seem right for your data, you cannot hatch more eggs than there were. It is perhaps no surprise that it does not fit so well. A binomial distribution (e.g. logistic regression) would enforce that constraint. If there is clutches or different incubators, you may want to account for that using a fixed or random effect.
