What does -1 mean in glm model specification mean?

I am working through Applied Longitudinal Data Analysis: Modeling Change and Event Occurence by Singer and Willett, using the R code supplied here . I am working through Chapter 11, on fitting discrete-time hazard models, and came across this model specification. model Which yields this output: Call: glm(formula = event ~ factor(period) + pt + pas - 1, family = "binomial", data = firstsex.pp) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.1787 -0.6182 -0.4338 -0.2836 2.7862 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) factor(period)7 -2.8932 0.3206 -9.024 I am familiar with logistic regression but have never encountered the -1 in a glm model specification before. The interpretation of the regression coefficients in the book seems to be exactly the same as it usually would be. I am finding it difficult to obtain any online examples where it is used. What does this -1 mean? Is it something unique to survival analysis?
