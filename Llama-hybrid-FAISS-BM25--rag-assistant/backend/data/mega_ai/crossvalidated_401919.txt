Mean Absolute Scaled Error implementation on multistep time series forecast

The formula for MASE can be found here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_absolute_scaled_error I am building a multi-step time series forecaster and I want to use MASE as a measure of prediction accuracy for a horizon of $n$ steps. These $n$ steps are part of the testing set, not the training set. I've trained the model and now I choose a starting point from my test set to begin the $n$ -step forecast. When calculating the naive mean absolute error (naive = using previous time step as next time step) should I calculate it on the same interval as the multistep forecast (which is comprised of test data), or on the entire training set? Currently I calculate the naive mean absolute error on the entire training set, and I use that constant number for very multi-step MASE calculation. I still get MASE
