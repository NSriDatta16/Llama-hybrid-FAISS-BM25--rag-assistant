Using Git with an existing Xcode project

I am trying to figure out how to use git in my project workflow, and I have an existing Xcode project that I want to put into the repository. I think I have the repository set up correctly under organizer, but the Source Control menu is grayed out. Apparently, it's easy to do if you start a new project, but how do I import an existing project with snapshots and everything? I'm using Xcode 4 and git 1.7.4 Also, if there are any good walkthroughs on git configuration and best practices, that would be nice. I'm a little late to the game, so anything that can get me up to speed would be cool.
