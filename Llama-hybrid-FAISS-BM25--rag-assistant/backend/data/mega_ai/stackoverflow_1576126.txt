iPhone and floating point math

I have following code: float totalSpent; int intBudget; float moneyLeft; totalSpent += Amount; moneyLeft = intBudget - totalSpent; And this is how it looks in debugger: http://www.braginski.com/math.tiff Why would moneyLeft calculated by the code above is .02 different compared to the expression calculated by the debugger? Expression windows is correct, yet code above produces wrong by .02 result. It only happens for a very large numbers (yet way below int limit) thanks
