What does it mean to be evenly spaced in log-space?

I'm reading a article on evaluation of various pedestrian detectors ( link ). In section of evaluation methodology, the authors propose to use the log-average miss rate to summarize detector performance. As quoted: We use the log-average miss rate to summarize detector performance, computed by averaging miss rate at nine FPPI rates evenly spaced in log-space in the range 10^−2 to 10^0 I could not understand this sentence clearly, maybe it's due to my lack of some basic concepts. I understand the "average" part ("averaging miss rate at nine FPPI rates"). But I don't know what nine FPPI rates evenly spaced in log-space in the range 10^−2 to 10^0 means. What does it mean to be evenly spaced in log-space? Could someone please help me to understand this?
