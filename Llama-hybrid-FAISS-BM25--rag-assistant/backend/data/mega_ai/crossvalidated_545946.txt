Cross validation is intended to estimate the generalization error of the model building process you’re using. You don’t build a model prior to doing cross validation. In each of the folds, you build a model doing everything you intend to do on the training data (including variable selection). Each model built on the K folds predicts on the held out part of the data to obtain an error or loss metric. The average of those error/loss metrics is an estimate of the error/loss metric for that model building process
