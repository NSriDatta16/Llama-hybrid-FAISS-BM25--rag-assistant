Assuming that by "Bayesian" you refer to subjective Bayes (a.k.a. epistemic Bayes, De-Finetti Bayes) and not the current empirical Bayes meaning-- it is far from trivial. On the one hand, you infer based on your data alone. There are no subjective beliefs at hand. This seems frequentist enough... But the critique, expressed even at Fisher himself (a strict non (subjective) Bayesian), is that in the choice of the sampling distribution of the data subjectivity has crawled in. A parameter is only defined given our beliefs of the data generating process. In conclusion-- I believe the MLE is typically considered a frequentist concept, albeit it is a mere matter of how you define "frequentist" and "Bayesian".
