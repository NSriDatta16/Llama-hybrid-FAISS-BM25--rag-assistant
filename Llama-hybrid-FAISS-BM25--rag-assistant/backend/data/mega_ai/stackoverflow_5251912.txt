As @nabulke and @Jan Hudec stated in their comments, Boost.Asio is very good solution for your problem. Have a look at pretty simple example "Async TCP Echo Server" . It uses just 2 classes: server and session . No session_manager . Sessions are managed automatically by smart pointers, very convenient and simple approach. Using Boost.Asio you can keep the network part simple (and almost optimal by efficiency using asynchronous processing). As a bonus, adding couple of code lines, you receive multithreaded server w/o headache (I would recommend this example: "An HTTP server using a single io_service and a thread pool calling io_service::run()." , just ignore HTTP stuff. pay attention to boost::asio::io_service::strand used in connection class)
