The first thing to mention is that the two clusters in your data are very easily separated. This makes it hard to notice differences between approaches to improve the separation between clusters. You can run the code below and see that the clusters will differ when taking the third variable in consideration. C here is caused by A and B so you can literally consider it a response variable. library(ggplot2) set.seed(123) a = rnorm(1000) b = rnorm(1000) c = a+b + rnorm(1000) df = data.frame(a, b, c) cls $cluster = as.factor(cls$ cluster) ggplot() + geom_point(data = df, mapping = aes(x = a, y = b, colour = cluster)) + ggtitle("Clustering Without the Response Variable") cls $cluster = as.factor(cls$ cluster) ggplot() + geom_point(data = df, mapping = aes(x = a, y = b, colour = cluster)) + ggtitle("Clustering With the Response Variable") I understand that in general, clustering is considered to be an "unsupervised learning algorithm" which is meant to be used when the response variable is not present. But in terms of statistical methodology, is there anything wrong with running a clustering algorithm (e.g. K-Means) on some data that has a response variable? There is nothing really preventing you from using approaches more commonly used in supervised learning to unsupervised learning problems and vice-versa (or semi-supervised, and so on). People do this all the time. Sometimes it works well, sometimes it doesn't. Take Support Vector Machines (SVM) , for example. People usually think of it as a way to do classification in supervised learning. However, some other people have been using it for regression . Some other people for clustering in unsupervised learning . Same thing for Neural Networks (supervised, semi-supervised, unsupervised, and so on). As for including a variable that in a supervised learning context would be seen as a response variable, it's fine, as long as you don't run into data leakage, what @ttnphns mentioned (contamination). Let's say you're trying to identify fraudulent purchases. When a new putative fraudulent purchase comes for analysis, do you have for that purchase all the variables used to separate the clusters before? If so, it's fine.
