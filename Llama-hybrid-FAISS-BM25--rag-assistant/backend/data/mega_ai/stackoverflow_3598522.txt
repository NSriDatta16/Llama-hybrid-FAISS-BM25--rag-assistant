The clustered index effects the physical storage of the data in a table, so by definition there can only be one. You can widen your clustered index to include the other columns, but this can have its own disadvantages. The performance advantage from a clustered index is that the records are stored in a manner that reflects the index (which is why random inserts and updates to the clustered index very quickly fragment the table), and therefore query performance based on this index can be as good as performance as reads from your storage device, you can't get this on other indexes.
