Contradictory results while performing Z-test

Hello Everyone, I'm relatively new to statistics and this community so please bear with me and forgive me if I commit any mistake while asking my question. For starters, here are two hypotheses tests that I want to perform: Test 1: If on an average, Girls score more than 600 in an exam? Test 2: Mean score of girls = 600. Given: sample mean(x) = 633.4, sample size(n) = 30, population std dev(σ) = 100 So first I performed Test 1 where ( null hypothesis(H0): mean and (alternate hypothesis(H1): mean > 600) . Z = (x – μ) / (σ / √n) = (633.4-600)/(100/√30) = 1.83 . Taking alpha = 0.05 and since this is a upper-tailed Z test , the decision rule is: Reject H0 if Z > 1.645 . Hence, we reject H0 and accept H1 . Therefore, Girls score more than 600 in an exam. Now, coming to Test 2 H0: mean score = 600 and H1: mean score != 600 Z = 1.83 and since this a Two-Tailed Z Test , the decision rule is: Reject H0 if Z 1.960 However, we fail to reject H0. Therefore, mean score = 600. Please explain why the 2 tests are giving contradictory conclusions?
