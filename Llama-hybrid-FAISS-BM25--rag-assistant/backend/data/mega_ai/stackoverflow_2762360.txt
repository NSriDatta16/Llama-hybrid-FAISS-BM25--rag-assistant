There is some overlap in the functionality of noexcept and throw() , but they're really coming from opposite directions. throw() was about correctness, and nothing else: a way to specify the behavior if an unexpected exception was thrown. The primary purpose of noexcept is optimization: It allows/encourages the compiler to optimize around the assumption that no exceptions will be thrown. But yes, in practice, they're not far from being two different names for the same thing. The motivations behind them are different though.
