Sounds like a standard feed-forward neural network will do what you want? input data: other person's pronunciation target value: your pronunciation According to how much data you have, you can vary the depth of the network (1 or more layers), and how many neurons in each network etc. If you dont have much data, keep the network shallow, few neurons, add a bunch of regularization (l1, l2, dropout ...) I dont think its really transfer learning as such. Transfer learning would be: you have tons of data mapping from eg a written sentence to how someone pronounces it you train on this (using supervised learning probably) then you have a few examples of your pronunciation of one or more written sentences and you train on these sentences, but somehow bring across all the awesome knowledge that was learned on your earlier huge dataset
