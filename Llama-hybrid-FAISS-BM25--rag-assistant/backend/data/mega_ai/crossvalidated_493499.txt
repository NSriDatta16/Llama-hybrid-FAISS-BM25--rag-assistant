You seem confused about the concepts of sufficiency and unbiasedness. To be clear: unbiasedness plays no part in the definition of sufficiency . The reason is simple: If $T$ is sufficient for some parameter $\theta$ indexing a distribution family, then so is also $T/10, 10T, 1000T$ and a lot of other one-to-one functions of $T$ . Al those functions cannot be unbiased at the same time (as estimators of $\theta$ or of some function of $\theta$ .) When you are clear about this you can think again, starting afresh, on your first paragraph question.
