Is it advisable to use FFMpeg on my local server for video conversion?

We are starting a video sharing website where users will be able to upload videos in their native formats. However, since video streaming on the web generally is in the FLV format, we need to convert the videos to FLV. Also, the site will be hosted on Amazon EC2 and storage using S3. Can i run FFMpeg on amazon EC2 ? Is this the best way to go ? Are there other alternatives to video encoding rather than doing conversion on our own server ? I also came across www.transloadit.com which seems to do the same but they are charging a bomb. Are there cheaper and more intelligent alternatives ? We are planning to make this website as one of top 10 biggest niche video streaming websites on the internet.
