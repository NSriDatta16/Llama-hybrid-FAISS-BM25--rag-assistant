It is very rare for a paragraph to be absolutely positioned, so no it is not standard practise. That said, if you have a single paragraph that you want to position, it would be pointless to wrap it in a div just for that. The usual guidelines apply: Write the markup that best describes the semantics of the content, then add the minimum amount of additional generic markup (divs, spans) needed to style it the way you want. It sounds like, in this case, the minimum amount is 'none at all'. So don't add a div.
