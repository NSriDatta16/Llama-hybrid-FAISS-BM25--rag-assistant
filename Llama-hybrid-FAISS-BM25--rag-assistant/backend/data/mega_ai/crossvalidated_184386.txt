Terminology question; Cross-sectional study and logistic regression - "predictors" or "correlates"?

Is the use of the term "Predictors" with regard to IVs in a logistic regression model appropriate or should an alternative term, such as correlates, be used instead? Specifically thinking of a cross-sectional design.
