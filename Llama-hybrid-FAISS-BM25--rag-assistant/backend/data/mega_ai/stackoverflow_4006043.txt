Soliciting Rails Association Feedback + Questions from a Noob

Preface: If you hang out in #rubyonrails on freenode this may sound like an echo to you as i asked it in there 2 days ago. After spending a number of hours researching AR associations, following my discussions in #rubyonrails, i still feel lost so I'm asking here. :) Goal I host a number of blogs. My intent is to create batch submissions where i take a Post, select the blogs I'd like the Post to be Submitted to, then give the Batch a submission date. Later on I'd like to create a Worker that queries the Batches and then actually submits the Post to it's associated Blogs. The Confusion I am confused about how I should setup my associations and the corresponding tables. Here is what i have for Models. class Blog :submissions end class Post :submissions end class Submission Here is what i have for Tables. [Blogs] id :integer not null, primary key title :string(255) etc [Posts] id :integer not null, primary key subject :string(255) content :text etc [Submissions] id :integer not null, primary key submit_date :datetime post_id :integer forum_id :integer etc Questions I currently have no Batch model -- should i have this? Or can a "batch" be inferred by backtracing submissions? If i should have a Batches model, would that mean the Submisson model then gets an additional foreign key? Is there a more "rails way" to do this? Any other input is welcome! Thanks a lot for reading this gigantic post.
