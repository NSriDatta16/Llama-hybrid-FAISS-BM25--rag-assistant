The benefit of embedding custom assembly code is that sometimes (dare I say, often times) a developer can write more efficient assembly code than a compiler can. So for extremely performance intensive items, custom written assembly might be beneficial. Games tend to come to mind.... As far as using it to learn assembly, I have no doubt that you could. But, I imagine that using an actual assembly SDK might be a better choice. Aside from the standard experimentation of learning how to use the language, you'd probably want the knowledge around setting up a development environment.
