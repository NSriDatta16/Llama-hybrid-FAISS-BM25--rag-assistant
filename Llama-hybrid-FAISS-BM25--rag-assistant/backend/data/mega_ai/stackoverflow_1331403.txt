Yes, you can do this with Adobe ColdFusion and other CFML engines that are built on Java. It's actually simpler than you thought. #str.startsWith("hello")# This text will be output #str.startsWith("goodbye")# This text will NOT be output This is possible because CFML strings in ColdFusion are the same as Java strings. You can use any native string method (Java.lang.String) on a CFML string. If you haven't guessed, this also works with CFML arrays (some kind of list, probably a java.util.Vector) and structs (probably a java.util.Map). Experiment with data types and the cfdump tag, you will find a lot of secrets. One word of warning, this is not standard CFML, so if your underlying engine changes, including just upgrading to a new version, there are no guarantees that it will still work. That said, string.startsWith() is native to Java as well as .NET, so this will also work if your CFML engine is BlueDragon.NET. The only CFML engines it will not work on are ColdFusion 5 and previous. Is it safe to use? I would say yes. As long as CFML engines run on Java or .NET, it's perfectly safe. It's undocumented, but easy to understand, so I would say use it freely.
