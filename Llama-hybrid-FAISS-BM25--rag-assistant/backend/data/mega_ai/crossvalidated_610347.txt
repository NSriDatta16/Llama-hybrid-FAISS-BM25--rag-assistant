How to test if there's a statistically significant difference between two counts, based on relative percentile?

How to test if there's a statistically significant difference between two counts Hi! I'm struggling to test if two ratios on the same row of my dataset are significantly different from each other. I need to do this test for as many rows are in my dataset. The ratios, a and b, are in two separate columns of my data, and I'm trying only to plot points that have a statistically significant difference between them. What I've done is take the difference between each set of values (a - b) and calculated the percentile rank of each difference relative to its column using scipy.stats.percentileofscore. I've made a histogram of this data. But I'm not sure how to proceed now. The histogram doesn't look normal. I want to just take the values above 95 and below 5 percent on the histogram, but since my distribution isn't normal I don't think that'd be correct! What's difficult here is that I'm analyzing data from an experiment I really should have done in replicates, rather than just once. And comparing between counts, not averages, confuses me. Any guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thanks so much :)
