Is there a way to extract a custom request header with cgicc

I am using Cgicc , which has some methods to extract specific request headers, e.g. getUserAgent would return "User-Agent" header. Is there a generic method that can return an arbitrary header value, e.g. something like getHeaderValue("x-my-header"); Is there a way to do this using cgicc? and if cannot be done with cgicc, how else can I extract a custom header from the request in c++?
