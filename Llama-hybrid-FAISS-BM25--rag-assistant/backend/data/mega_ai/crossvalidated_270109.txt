If the time series is nonstationary, should we make it to stationary for running auto.arima OR will this function automatically convert it? auto.arima will automatically convert it. arima, is so-called "auto-regression integrated moving average", there is a parameters "d" which is used for the order of first-differencing. How to optimise the auto.arima? auto.arima doing this automatically optimise using the stepwise algorithm. If we take log of a time series to make it stationary, the forecasted values are in the log format. How do we convert them to the original scale? If you manually log the time series, then you should manually convert the forecast values to the original scale.
