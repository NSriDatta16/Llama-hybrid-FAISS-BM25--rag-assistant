I think your data is similar to Secom data on which I have worked in past and faced lot of difficulties. Following is what I have tried: Different sampling techniques Different classifiers like Random Forest, ANN, GBM, Ensemble methods, etc. I've also tried 1-Class SVM which has given better results as compared to others like adaboost, Random Forest. You can try that as well. And I can see you've asked this question 1 year back so if you've found the best way then kindly post it here so that I can get help from it to get better accuracy.
