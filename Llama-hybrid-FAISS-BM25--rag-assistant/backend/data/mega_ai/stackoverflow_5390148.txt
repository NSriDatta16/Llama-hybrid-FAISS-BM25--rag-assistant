You're asking where to find it : In XCode 4 there is a new button - look for the big "Organizer button" which is at the TOP RIGHT. Physically connect your device and then click Devices. It seems that the new "Organizer button" is one of the "most-missed" things in the transition to XCode4. Note, the questioner is asking: " WHERE should I be looking to correct this?"
