Android Reading image names from database

This is probably pretty straight forward, but I am getting no-where at the moment. I have read through a lot of posts but have not hit the answer yet. I have a gallery in my app,based largely on the google gallery app, with the images stored in R.drawable and the paths to the images stored in an 'Integer' array. I have moved the image paths into a database table and am trying to read them back and so display the images, but all I am seeing is a blank gallery. I would be so grateful if someone could point me in the right diorection here, I feel I'm going in circles. Below is the code I use to read the items from the database: //get the gallery items from the cursor ArrayList galleryList = new ArrayList(); for(cursor.moveToFirst();!cursor.isAfterLast();cursor.moveToNext()){ Integer gal; gal = cursor.getInt(cursor.getColumnIndex("small_img")); galleryList.add(gal); } myImageIds =(Integer[])galleryList.toArray(new Integer[galleryList.size()]); db.close(); This is the Integer array the names paths are read into: private Integer[] myImageIds; Then in the 'ImageAdapter' class I try to copy the array into the 'Integer' array mImageIds: public class ImageAdapter extends BaseAdapter { int mGalleryItemBackground; public ImageAdapter(Context c) { mContext = c; mImageIds = Drager.this.myImageIds; As I say, this gives me an empty gallery, where am I going wrong? Is there a different way to store the paths to the drawable directory in a database? Any help appreciated. Thanks
