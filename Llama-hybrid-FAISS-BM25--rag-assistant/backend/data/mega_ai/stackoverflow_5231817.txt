I have in my code Is there away to use it in JSF2 (dynamic source) EDITED: I am trying to link to file on the disc of another server: (the source is actually EL experssion). the file is not being displayed! When I try to open it with chrome it automatically changes it to: file://myip/storage/ogg/VX-276.ogg I tried to add in my servlet image path file:////myip//storage//ogg//VX-276.ogg however the url is changes to file:\myip\storage\ogg\VX-276.ogg which does not exist! if I write \\\\myip\\storage\\ogg\\VX-276.ogg the file is found by not being displayed in the browser! How do I need to write the URL to display it?
