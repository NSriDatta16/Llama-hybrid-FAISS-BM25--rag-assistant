The single most best thing you can do without disrupting other people and their way of working is setting up hudson to watch the CVS repository for each of your project. Just doing that will give a central place to see cvs commit messages. Next step is getting these projects to compile under Hudson. For Eclipse this typically means either switching to ant or - as we did - use ant4eclipse to model the existing eclipse build process. Not easy but very worthwhile. Remember to send out mails when the build breaks - this is extremely important. Ant4eclipse requires team project sets - introducing them in your organization Will make your colleagues happy the next time they need to set up a fresh workspace. When you have a situation where your stuff builds properly whenever somebody commits changes then consider making that automatically built code the code to actually go to the customer. As it was built on the build server and not on a developers machine, you know that you can reproduce the build. That is invaluable in a "hey fix this ancient version" situation.
