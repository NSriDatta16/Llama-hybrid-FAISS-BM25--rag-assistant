Mapping of an unseen Field/word to an existing description (in the input data), given Field and their respective descriptions as input/training data

I am working on a NLP problem. Problem Statement Given the input of fields & Labels and the respective descriptions, the goal is to the map a new unseen field to one of the most appropriate definitions. Sample Dataset Label Descriptions Release Date Date of formal issuance Language The language of the dataset So, for any new field, I want to map the field to one of the existing definition Approach I used a bert model for embedding combined with cosine similarity to compute the similarity between every new field (test unseen word) with the existing fields and take the definition of the most similar existing field. Challenges As my dataset is very small, the results are not great. Question to the Community Is it possible to generate a synthetic dataset that simulates the existing dataset, in order to have a bigger dataset which is "contextually similar" to my existing dataset. That might help my results to improve. Would greatly appreciate any assistence. Best regards, nitin
