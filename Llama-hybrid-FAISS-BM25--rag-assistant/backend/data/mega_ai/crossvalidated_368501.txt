+1 to both existing answers. Louvain's and the Triangle counting algorithms are great ways to go about this. Complementary to those, you might want to consider the following community detection algorithms (one newer and two oldies) early on in your analysis to understand a graphâ€™s structure Label Propagation algorithm. This has been presented in " Near linear time algorithm to detect community structures in large-scale networks " by Raghavan et al (2007). This is related to the greater affinity propagation clustering approach where labels/information propagate between the nodes of the network forming clusters based on consensus. Connected Components / Union-find algorithm. This was presented by Galler & Fischer in 1964; it very fast and nowadays is mostly used as pre-processing step in large databases to detect disconnected components. Strongly Connected Components algorithm, introduced by Tarjan in 1972. It has similar utility as the Union-Find algorithm doing a depth-first search but it is particular for directed graphs.
