MIT-OCW's course on Linear Algebra by Gilbert Strang. Incredible lectures by an incredible man; if your understanding of matrices is solely derived from programming sources (like MATLAB) then a course on Linear Algebra will definitely give you the fundamentals to do crazy things with matrices. http://www.ocw.cn/OcwWeb/Mathematics/18-06Spring-2005/VideoLectures/index.htm
