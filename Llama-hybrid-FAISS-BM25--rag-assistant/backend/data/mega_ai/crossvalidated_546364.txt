Rescaling random intercept coefficients from hierarchical logistic regression

My logistic regression model includes an overall intercept, multiple categorical variables + and continuous covariates like so: $logit(\mu)$ = $\beta_0$ + $\alpha_{j}$ + $\gamma_k$ + $\beta$$X$ where $\beta_0$ is the overall intercept, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are categorical variables with $j$ and $k$ levels (essentially variable intercept terms) and $\beta$ is a vector of coefficients associated with multiple continuous covariates $X$ . I have scaled each variable in $X$ by substract the mean and dividing by the standard deviation. I understand that rescaled $\beta_0$ = $\beta_0^{*}$ - $\sum(\beta^{*}\times\frac{\bar{x}}{sd_x})$ and rescaled $\beta=\frac{\beta^*}{sd_x}$ . My question is: Is it necessary to rescale $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ ? If so, how?
