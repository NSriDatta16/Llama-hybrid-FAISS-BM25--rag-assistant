That regex is not using a capture group. Apparently he is using a common regex variable: $& returns the entire matched string (some systems its $0) In this case he is just matching 1 character at a time equivalent to s/[.*+?|()\[\]{}\\]/\\$&/g Obscure fact: In Perl there is a function called quotemeta("your string") that does this or it can be inlined in the regex with \Q. I love Perl. As a side note, he might have left out the carret ^ and possibly, but not sure, the $ The fact that there is no built-in or inline method might be a bad thing. And escaping metachars like this must be thought out, as regex fragments can be problematic.
