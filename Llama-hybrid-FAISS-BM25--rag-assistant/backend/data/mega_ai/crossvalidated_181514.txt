I prefer using Greek letters for unknown quantities and Roman letters for known quantities. So the problem you have is that you want a probability distribution for $$ \gamma = \frac{\alpha+b}{2} = \frac{\alpha}{2}+\frac{b}{2} $$ where $$ \alpha \sim N(m,s^2)\mathrm{I}(\alpha By Theorem 3.5.6 in Casella and Berger, the probability density function for $\gamma$ is $$ p(\gamma) = \frac{\frac{2}{s}\phi\left(\frac{(2\gamma-b)-m}{s}\right)}{\Phi\left(\frac{K-m}{s}\right)}\mathrm{I}((2\gamma-b) Althought you could work with this density directly, it may be easier to just work with the distribution for $\alpha$ and the equation for $\gamma$, e.g. Sample $\alpha \sim N(m,s^2)$ until $\alpha Calculate $\gamma = (\alpha+b)/2$. If you do this many times, you can plot a histogram of the values which is an approximation to the true pdf. You can take an average of the values which will give you an approximation to the expected value for $\gamma$.
