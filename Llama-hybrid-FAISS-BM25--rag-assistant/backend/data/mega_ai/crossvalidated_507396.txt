What statistical test to use, Dichotmous IV and DV, with multiple sets of data

I have previously run an experiment relating to a number of measurements from the internet. I have run the experiment from multiple hosts / participants, multiple times. ie. several sets of data distributed over time per host. The data I have concerns connections to a collection of hosts conducted in two separate ways. During these connections. A binary event does or does not happen. I would like to deduce whether the choice of method to connect influences whether the event during the connection happens. I have already looked at logistic regression models, however I am unsure if this is the correct approach.
