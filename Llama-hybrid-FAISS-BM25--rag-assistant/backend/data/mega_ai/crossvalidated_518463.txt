You’ve correctly understood $w_j$ and $w_I$ : they’re the target word and input word. Section 1.2 goes into more detail about the CBOW case; I’m filling in the pieces that weren’t explicit. The LHS of the equation would be different: $$p(w_j \mid w_{I1}, \ldots, w_{IC})$$ to show that you’re conditioning on several input words. The RHS is also different, because we no longer use $\mathbf{v}_{w_I}$ to represent the input. Instead, the numerator and denominator should both replace that term with $\bf h$ from equation (18): $$\mathbf{h} = \frac{1}{C} \left(\mathbf{v}_{w_{I1}} + \mathbf{v}_{w_{I2}} + \ldots + \mathbf{v}_{w_{IC}} \right)^T$$ This term averages the representations of the $C$ input words.
