Part 1. B should pick 2/3, as then C will randomly pick a spot between A and B, giving B an average payout of 1/2. (If B picks b 2/3, C randomly picks c Part 2. Without loss of generality, assume A's pick is at most 1/2. A should choose 1/4. By a similar argument to part 1, B then chooses 3/4 and C randomly chooses 1/4 If A chooses a If A chooses a > 1/4, then B chooses 1 - a + p for p as small as possible, so that C picks a - q for q as small as possible. Then A's expected payoff is (1 - 2a + p + q)/2
