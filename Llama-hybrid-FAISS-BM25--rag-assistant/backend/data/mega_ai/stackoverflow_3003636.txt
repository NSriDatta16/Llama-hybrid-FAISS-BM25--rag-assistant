Well this actually wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. One way to enable this is to add the following to your ~/.vimrc "smart indent when entering insert mode with i on empty lines function! IndentWithI() if len(getline('.')) == 0 return "\"_ccO" else return "i" endif endfunction nnoremap i IndentWithI() It simply checks for an empty line when you hit 'i' from insert mode. If you are indeed on an empty line it will delete it and open a new one, effectively leveraging the working 'open line' behavior. Note: "_ before the cc makes sure that your register doesn't get wiped
