Converting a JavaSE application into a single, big bundle basically means that you're launching your code in a different way. Instead of the public static void main(String[] args) you now implement the BundleActivator interface which has a start() and a stop() method (each with a BundleContext as argument). Launching that depends a bit on what framework implementation you chose. Since OSGi 4.2 there is a launcher API (paragraph 6.2 of the spec) which specifies a universal mechanism to launch a framework and run your single bundle. If you use an older implementation, launching is framework specific and I can only refer you to the documentation of that framework.
