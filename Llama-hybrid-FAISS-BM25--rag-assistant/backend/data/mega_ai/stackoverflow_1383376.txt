I can't answer your question definitively because, as you said, the question does seem to be subjective and any answer would ultimately be an opinion. It sounds like you are really struggling with a design decision based on the "academic" definition of a DTO as opposed to some kind of pragmatic requirement. We've all been there. When faced with similar situations I generally tend to carry out the implementation in the most simple and straight forward way as I can avoiding things like complex tightly coupled relationships and excessive amounts of design. This way, once I am able to get everything running I can refractor from there will less impact. Overall, it sounds like you are constructing some kind of ETL system. I don't know what platform you are dealing with but if you are using SQL Server Have you looked at SQL Server Integration Services? It has a lot of constructs to handle things like Office documents, XML, and flat files as data sources. Anyway, good luck with your struggle.
