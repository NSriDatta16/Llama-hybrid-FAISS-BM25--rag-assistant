The Discrete Weibull distribution is defined by: \begin{align} f(x) = q^{x^b}-q^{(x+1)^b} , b>0,q\in (0,1),x=0,1,2,\ldots \end{align} Having a set of covariates, $X$, there are three ways of connecting distribution parameters to the covariates, \begin{align} 1. &\, logit(q)=X\beta\\ 2.& \,\log(\log(q)) =X\beta\\ 3.& \,\log(b) =X\beta\\ \end{align} In your case, the logit transformation is used without any transformation on $\beta$.
