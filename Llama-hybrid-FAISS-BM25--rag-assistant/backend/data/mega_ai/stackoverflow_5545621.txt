It's common practice to use an asterisk on the label. Is it common practice because it's a good method, or is it just common practice because of habit? I don't know. I know I'm not a big fan of it. I generally encourage: Really think about each field. Do you REALLY need to require it? Can you ask for the info later? Can we shorten the form down so it's only the fields we really need? If we've reduced the fields down to only those that we really need, then we can just way all fields are required.
