I have some tips : (1) How residuals ought to compare to fits isn't always all that obvious, so it's good to be familiar with diagnostics for particular models. In logistic regression models, for example, the Hosmer-Lemeshow statistic is used to assess goodness of fit; leverage values tend to be small where the estimated odds are very large, very small or about even; & so on. (2) Sometimes one family of models can be seen as a special case of another, so you can use a hypothesis test on a parameter to help you choose. Exponential vs Weibull, for example. (3) Akaike's Information Criterion is useful in choosing between different models, which includes choosing between different families. (4) Theoretical/empirical knowledge about what you're modelling narrows the field of plausible models. But there's no automatic way of finding the 'right' family; real-life data can come from distributions as complicated as you like, & the complexity of models that are worth trying to fit increases with the amount of data you have. This is part & parcel of Box's dictum that no models are true but some are useful. Re @gung's comment: it appears the commonly used Hosmer-Lemeshow test is (a) surprisingly sensitive to the choice of bins, & (b) generally less powerful than some other tests against some relevant classes of alternative hypothesis. That doesn't detract from point (1): it's also good to be up-to-date.
