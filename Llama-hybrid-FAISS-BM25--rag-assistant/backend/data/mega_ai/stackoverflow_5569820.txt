A burndown chart is useful for tracking progress towards the team's commitment. In this case, it sounds like your team is struggling with two things that don't relate to the burndown chart: 1. Unplanned work 2. Poor estimates. The key here is to focus on those problems. No matter what you do with the burndown chart, if you're adding unplanned work and your estimates are poor... you'll never derive any value from the burndown chart. I'd recommend a couple of things: 1. Switch to tracking hours for Tasks... not points. Hours are tangible for the team... they mean something. Points are typically burned down at the release level. 2. Try shortening the length of your sprints. It's easier to achieve a smaller goal. 3. Ensure that task estimates are no longer then 8 hours. In fact, I'd shorten that to probably 4 hours. Estimating tasks that take longer than a single day encourages the wrong behavior for the team. 4. Ensure that you're spending enough time in Sprint Planning that that team can make a commitment. An effective sprint planning meeeting is the first step towards an effective sprint.
