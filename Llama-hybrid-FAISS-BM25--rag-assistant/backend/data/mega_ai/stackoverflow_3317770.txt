Do you know of any examples of elegant solutions in dynamically typed languages?

Imagine two languages which (apart from the type information) do have exactly the same syntax, but one is statically typed while the other one uses dynamic typing . Then, for every program written in the statically typed language, one can derive an equivalent dynamically typed program by removing all type information. As this is not neccessarily possible the other way around, the class of dynamically typed programs thus is strictly larger than the class of statically typed programs. Let's call this dynamically typed programs, for which there is no mapping of variables to types making them statically typed " real dynamically typed programs". As both language families are definitly turing-complete, we can be sure that for every such real dynamically typed program there exists a statically typed program doing exactly the same thing, but I often read that "experienced programmers are able to write very elegant code in dynamically typed languages". I thus ask myself: Are there any good examples of real dynamically typed programs, for which any equivalent statically typed programm clearly is much more complex / much less "elegant" (whatever that may mean)? Do you know of any such examples?
