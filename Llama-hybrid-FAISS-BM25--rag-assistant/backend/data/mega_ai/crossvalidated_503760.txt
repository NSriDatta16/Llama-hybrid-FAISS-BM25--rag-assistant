I believe the standard way to do predictions when using MCMC is to use each simulated set of parameters to form predictions, then study the distribution of the predictions across all of the simulations. If the model is linear in the parameters then this will give the same results as using the average parameters to form predictions, but in many interesting models (e.g. all GLMs) you'll get different results. With a large dataset this might not be practical: if you have 10000 MCMC steps and 100000 data points, you'd need to store a billion values. In that case you might be able to do predictions only at a subset of "typical" data points, and you can certainly thin the output without much loss.
