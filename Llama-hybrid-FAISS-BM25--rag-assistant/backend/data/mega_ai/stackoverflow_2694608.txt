Using exceptions for control flow is generally a bad practice (exactly because of the poor efficiency that you're observing). What type of data do you need to convert to decimal ? Could you use TryParse method or some other method that doesn't throw exception if the input is not in the expected format? Decimal.TryParse method should do the trick if you're parsing strings as it reports failure by returnning false : decimal d; if (Decimal.TryParse(str, out d)) // Ok, use decimal 'd' else // Failed - do something else
