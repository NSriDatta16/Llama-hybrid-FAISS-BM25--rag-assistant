Not sure if you still need this, but the classic texts are on subject are Hall and Horowitz "On Blocking Rules for the Bootstrap with Dependent Data", Lahiri "Theoretical Comparisons of Block Bootstrap Methods", in addition to the Lahiri book you mentioned. I found Hongyi Li and Maddala "Bootstrapping Time Series Models" useful as well. I'm writing my Masters dissertation on the subject so if I can be of any other help please let me know.
