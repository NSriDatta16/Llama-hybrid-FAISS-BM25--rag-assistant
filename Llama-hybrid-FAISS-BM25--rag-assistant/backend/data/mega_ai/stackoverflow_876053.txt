Cross posting my comment by request: Wouldn't an (apache) rewrite of traffic from facebook be the most elegant solution? Your internal machine would only have to deal with one path, and if you wanted to integrate the app with another service/platform at a later date, you would only have to add another rewrite rule rather than messing with the application itself.
