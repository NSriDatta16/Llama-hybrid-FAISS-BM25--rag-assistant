Build and Archive - nothing happens on Submit Application

After successfully building the distribution version of my app for submission to iTunes Connect, I selected Build and Archive, as recommended, and the Organizer window popped up. Why, wondered I. OK, if I click the Archived Applications tab it displays one archived application (unfortunately grayed out - don't know if that means anything. I mark it and click Submit to iTunes Connect, XCode asks for credentials - and nothing happens. OK, says I, I will add the app manually via the browser, and right-click it and select 'Reveal in Finder'. I go hunting for files created recently, and find nothing. How are you supposed to submit apps, really?? :) I followed the iOS dev guide for Distribution, here . I would also like it confirmed that submitting from within XCode allows me to log onto iTunes Connect and add screenshots etc, this is my first app for Appstore. Update: Apparently it ends up in username/Library/MobileDevice/Archived Applications/somelongnumber - on the second go it revealed it in Finder. I updated the title, since I now have some files ;) To clarify, I was expecting some kind of upload progress bar after supplying the credentials, followed by 'your app has been submitted to iTunes Connect' or similar. Is this a common problem? Will uploading manually be possible now? I guess iTunes Connect will tell me what files to upload if so?
