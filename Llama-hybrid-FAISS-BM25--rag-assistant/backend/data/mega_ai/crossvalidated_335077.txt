Questions about how to code are off topic here, but your question has a statistics component as well. Multinomial logistic will not be right here, as far as I can tell. If you are interested in the number of correct answers then that would be the DV and you would use a count regression model such as Poisson or negative binomial regression with your two IVs. Whether to run multiple logistic regressions with each DV or one regression with all of them depends on whether you are concerned about the relationships among the DVs. If you are, then you would need multivariate logistic regression. I don't know if SPSS can do this. Be careful in searching as some people use this term to mean one DV and several IVs (which is not what you want). These models are tricky, it's much simpler to run separate models for each DV.
