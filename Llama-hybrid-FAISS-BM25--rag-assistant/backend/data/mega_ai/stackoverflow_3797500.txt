Looking at the Referer and UserAgent you are sending I have some doubts from ethics standpoint about what you are doing here. This being said you may try to clean your code using WebClient : using (var client = new WebClient()) { client.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.UserAgent] = "Hacker"; client.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.Accept] = "text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8"; client.Headers[HttpRequestHeader.Referer] = "http://yougothacked.com"; client.UploadValues("http://87.255.55.218/register", new NameValueCollection { { "username", "foo" }, { "someOtherParam", "value" } }); } If this doesn't work then maybe, well, the server throttles multiple registration requests from the same IP. Of course you could always contact the provider and ask him whether this might be the case.
