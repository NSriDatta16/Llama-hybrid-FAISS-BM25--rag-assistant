System.Diaganostics.Process.Id Isn't the Same Process Id Shown in Task Manager. Why?

I'm using C#'s System.Diagnostic.Process object. One of its properties is Id . The Id this produces is not the same as the PID , shown in Windows Task Manager . Why is this? You see, once this process is started. It launches two other unmanaged processes, for which I can't explicitly get IDs for by object property references. I have to search through all processes to find them by process name via System.Diagnostics.Process.GetProcesses() . I'm trying to find a reliable way to kill this process and all associated processes by PID , the one that shows in Task Manager . Is there a better way? I can't just kill all processes with the associated process names, because that might kill other instances of those processes that have nothing to do with my program.
