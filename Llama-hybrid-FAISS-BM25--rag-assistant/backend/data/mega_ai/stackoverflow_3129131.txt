The reason you're getting those values is because the NSTableViews are not direct subviews of the NSSplitView. Firstly, an NSTableView is actually enclosed within an NSScrollView, and according to your IB screenshot, that is in turn enclosing within another plain NSView (the "Custom View" you see in the outline there). If it were me, I would either go the route of just making an outlet to the direct subviews of the split view, or access them by just calling -subviews on the split view, rather than trying to navigate up the hierarchy from the table view. Either of those options seems less fragile than working upwards from the table view, in my opinion. However, if you want to go from the table view to the subview of the split view, this should do the trick: NSRect aTableViewFrame = [[[aTableView enclosingScrollView] superview] frame];
