forecast rainfall using ARIMA in R

I am a new student approaching ARIMA prediction analysis in R. If the question is too simple or incorrect, please forgive and guide me. I am currently using the ARIMA provided in R. I use the data as the rainfall time series to forecast rainfall for the next several years. My data: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1MmFeWoUSfXrGNbsL4SiK28FoMAby0gwD I used the code to draw the following diagram: datats Because our data has a rainfall month with a negative value, I used the command auto.arima () with the properties as follows: ARIMAfit Code run result: Best model: ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,1)[12] %Series: (log(datats + 1)) %ARIMA(0,0,0)(0,1,1)[12] %Coefficients: %sma1 %-0.8855 %s.e. %0.0729 %sigma^2 estimated as 1.064: log likelihood=-304.42 %AIC=612.84 AICc=612.9 BIC=619.48 Make predictions for the next 48 months: fact Code run result: After that, I proceeded to graph the predictive data for the data using the exp() function - to convert the predicted value into the original value. plot(exp(fact), col = "chartreuse4", lwd=3) But this results in an error: Error in exp(fact) : non-numeric argument to mathematical function My question is: Could you please help me to see if my prediction method is accurate and how to handle errors in R? Could you please help me run the code in R to predict rainfall according to the above data?
