How does an influence function-based estimator estimate a target functional for an unknown distribution?

How exactly does a "1-step" influence function-based estimator estimate a target functional (like average treatment effect) for an unknown distribution? As described in Aaron Fisher and Edward H. Kennedy's tutorial (2019), the aim is to find an unbiased estimate of a functional $T(P)$ and its variance for an unknown distribution $P$ by approximating with a smoothed parametric estimate (or possibly nonparametric estimate using machine learning models) $T(\tilde{P})$ from the observed data. The plots above are from Aaron Fisher and Edward H. Kennedy's tutorial (2019) on influence functions. Panel B illustrates how a Taylor series approximation is used to estimate a hypothetical $T(P)$ by a linear extrapolation from the slope (calculated using an influence function) at $T(\tilde{P})$ (that is, the $y$ -intercept), where the solid line shows the path of the target functional value $P_{\epsilon}$ as we vary the weight $\epsilon \in [0,1]$ . The Taylor series expansion is then: $$T(P_0)=T(P_1)+\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial \epsilon}T(P_{\epsilon})\Big{|}_{\epsilon =1}\right)\times (0-1)-R_2$$ where $R_2$ is the second order term of the Taylor expansion. The plots seem a little too convenient, where a step size of exactly $\Delta \epsilon=1$ , from 1 to 0, magically gets you from $T(P_1)=T(\tilde{P})$ to $T(P_0)=T(P)$ even though you don't know in advance what the $T(P_{\epsilon})$ path looks like.
