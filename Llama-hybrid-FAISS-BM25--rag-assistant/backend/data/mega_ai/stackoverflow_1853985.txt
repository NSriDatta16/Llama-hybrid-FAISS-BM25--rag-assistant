Is there a comprehensive list of Google App Engine applications out there?

I'm considering leveraging Google App Engine for a small side project, but before I go in head first and start coding my apps (which are fairly trivial and common stuff) I'd like to check out what has already been done. But I haven't been able to find any place that lists the sorts of applications already out there. Anyone knows of such a place?
