No, this does not produce a reasonable answer. For two reasons: (1) there is no such thing as an "optimal" or a "true" prior. Priors reflect your prior beliefs or your prior information about the problem, not a truth about the parameter $\theta_0$ that is behind your data $x$, (2) your simulation is dependent on the simulation parameter $\theta_0$ which is arbitrary, so your "choice" of prior will also depend on $\theta_0$. In addition, your method ends up picking a prior for frequentist properties, rather than conditioning on the observation $x$, another departure from the Bayesian perspective...
