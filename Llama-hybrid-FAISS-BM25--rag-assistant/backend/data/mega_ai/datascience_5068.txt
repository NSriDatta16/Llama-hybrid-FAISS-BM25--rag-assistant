Data science, being a new term, covers a broad spectrum of jobs. At one end you are expected to write production code. At the other end you do statistics in packaged software. They also call such people statisticians or analysts. So decide what you enjoy doing before you leap. If you just want to analyze data, you could definitely get by with R or python as long as you're mathematically proficient. I find that in these kind of jobs, your communication and social skills matter too, since you have to explain the data to executives and the like.
