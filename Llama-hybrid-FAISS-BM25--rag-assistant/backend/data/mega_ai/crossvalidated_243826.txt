This question is not answerable. It depends on what is your computational resources. xgboost is good at taking advantages of all the resources you have. And it can run in clusters with hundreds of CPUs. Of course, time would be different for different platforms. However, you can estimate how long it will take on your computer. Just pay attention to nround , i.e., number of iterations in boosting, the current progress and the target value. For example, if you are seeing 1 minute for 1 iteration (building 1 iteration usually take much less time that you can track), then 300 iterations will take 300 minutes. To understand boosting and number of iterations you may find following posts helpful. How does linear base leaner works in boosting? And how it works in xgboost library? Boosting: why is the learning rate called a regularization parameter? How to know if a learning curve from SVM model suffers from bias or variance?
