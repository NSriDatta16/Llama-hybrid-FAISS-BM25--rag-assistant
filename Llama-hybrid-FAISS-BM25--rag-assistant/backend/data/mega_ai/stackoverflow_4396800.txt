Here's a clue (I'm still working on it) : I created a VerticalReversedLayout.as class based on VerticalLayout. In updateDisplayListVirtual and/or updateDisplayListReal there is a for (var...) positioning the children on the y axis, just invert the direction of the loop. Then you just assign this layout to your DataContainer (or List in my case). It works perfectly. If you use the dragMove feature, you may have to modify calculateDropIndex as well.
