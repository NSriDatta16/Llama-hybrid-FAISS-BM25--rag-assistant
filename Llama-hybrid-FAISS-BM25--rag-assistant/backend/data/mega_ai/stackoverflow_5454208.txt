No, it couldn't. The maximum SMS message size is 140 bytes, even if when you use SmsManager.sendDataMessage() . So you need to set a loop to handle your multipart sms. Maybe you also need SmsManager.divideMessage(String text) to do several fragments. Please refer to this man's problem: http://goo.gl/vl99e BTW, so I think just for this reason, Google choose to open this API: SmsManager.sendMultipartTextMessage()
