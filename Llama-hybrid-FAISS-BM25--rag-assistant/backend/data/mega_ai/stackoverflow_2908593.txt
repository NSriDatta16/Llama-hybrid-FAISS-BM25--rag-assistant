Have a listen to the OWASP podcast 67 with Jeff Williams on XSS . He talks about not sanitising or encoding before storage. The primary reason is that if (when) libraries evolve in response to new vulnerabilities your data is going to be stuck back in the old version. Of course this doesnâ€™t stop you from running any input against a whitelist at the entry point and rejecting anything outside acceptable range.
