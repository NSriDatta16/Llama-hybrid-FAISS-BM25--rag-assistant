There will definitely be a translation task at the end if you prototype using just mongo. When you run a MapReduce task on mongodb, it has the data source and structure built in. When you eventually convert to hadoop, your data structures might not look the same. You could leverage the mongodb-hadoop connector to access mongo data directly from within hadoop, but that won't be quite as straightforward as you might think. The time to figure out how exactly to do the conversion most optimally will be easier to justify once you have a prototype in place, IMO. While you will need to translate mapreduce functions, the basic pseudocode should apply well to both systems. You won't find anything that can be done in MongoDB that can't be done using Java or that is significantly more complex to do with Java.
