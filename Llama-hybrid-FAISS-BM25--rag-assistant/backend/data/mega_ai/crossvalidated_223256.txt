Tensorflow Cross Entropy for Regression?

Does cross-entropy cost make sense in the context of regression? (as opposed to classification) If so, could you give a toy example through tensorflow and if not, why not? I was reading about cross entropy in Neural Networks and Deep Learning by Michael Nielsen and it seems like something that could naturally be used for regression as well as classification, but I don't understand how you'd apply it efficiently in tensorflow since the loss functions take logits (which I don't really understand either) and they're listed under Classification here
