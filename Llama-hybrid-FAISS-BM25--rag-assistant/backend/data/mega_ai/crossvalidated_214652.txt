I think you have a few options depending on what you care about. You can go with the mean and see if it falls within some range of 2. This would be like averaging your votes. The advantage here is that you can check on how balanced people's votes are. If you care more about how the votes land with at least 1/2 voting more or less at some point you would want to go with the median. The advantage of the median is that it is based more on vote distribution. You might be interested in where the most voters voted. This would be the mode. You used the word mainly so you might be interested in this metric. Advantage is where the most voted, disadvantage is that as you get more options this can mean less. One thing to keep in mind is also that you may have some controversial words where most voters are 1 and 3. In this case you should be careful since most would not say 2, but some methods would give you 2. I would thus suggest you use mode, in the case of two modes you would reject or use another method such as median. e: You could also look into percent of votes that are 2. If it is above 50% then mainly people believe the question is a 2. E: If you really want to add complexity you could also try to address the issue of voters not agreeing and having a bias. You would then need to do some transformation of the vote and do a mean/median.
