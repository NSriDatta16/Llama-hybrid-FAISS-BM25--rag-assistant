Here's a way to repeat the items. In your page load event, add the following: Dim repeatTimes() As Integer = New Integer(){1, 2, 3} myRepeater.DataSource = repeatTimes myRepeater.DataBind() The repeater items will be repeated by the number of elements in the Array. In this case, there are 3 elements. The actual contents of the array don't matter, just the number of elements. EDIT: I don't know VB.NET that well, but I think this should work Sub Page_Load() Dim NumberToRepeat As Integer ''*Should come from the parameter If Not Page.IsPostBack Then Dim repeatTimes(NumberToRepeat) As Integer myRepeater.DataSource = repeatTimes myRepeater.DataBind() End If End Sub
