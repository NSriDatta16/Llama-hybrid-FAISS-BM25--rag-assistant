Judging from the recent questions you've asked, you might want to read up on the unit circle . This is a fundamental concept in trigonometry, and it is how angles are calculated when doing rotations using CGAffineTransforms or CATransform3Ds. Basically, the unit circle goes from 0 to 360 degrees, or 0 to 2 * pi (M_PI is the constant used on the iPhone) radians. Any angle greater than 360 degrees is the same as that angle minus a multiple of 360 degrees. For example, 740 degrees is the same as 380 degrees, which is the same as 20 degrees, when it comes to the ending position of something rotated by that much. Likewise, negative degrees are the same as if you'd added a multiple of 360 degrees to them. -20 degrees is the same as 340 degrees. There's no magic behind any of these calculations, you just have to pay attention to when something crosses the 0 / 360 degree point on the circle. In the case you describe, you can add 360 to any negative values to express them in positive angles. When subtracting angles, if the ending angle is less than the starting angle, you may also need to add 360 to the result to account for crossing the zero point on the unit circle.
