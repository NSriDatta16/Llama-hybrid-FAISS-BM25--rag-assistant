With regard to CSS and JS files in general, I wouldn't combine all JS files to a single file during development. It gets very hard to develop in one big JS file. Rather use a module that combines them on-the-fly or during deployment. I usually go with (both CSS and JS): one general file: project.css and one per page: project_welcome.css and any special components (login controls, ad area views etc) have a seperate one as well. That way you can apply some organizing techniques and won't go crazy managing that single large file. HTH Alex
