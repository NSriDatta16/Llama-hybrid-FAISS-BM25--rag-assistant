Hands-off, servant leadership, unofficial or "tribal" leadership over traditional management, seem to be all the rage these days. Basically getting out of the way and allowing the team to get their job done seems to make sense to me, but it all depends on the culture. I would say an effective manager would already have a style, and know how he wants to work, whereas a less effective manager would probably learn from other senior managers and simply emulate "however things get done around here". Actually in a lot of places the latter is the only choice. If you have the freedom to do things the way you want, I would probably prefer to borrow ideas from the agile/lean camp than the more traditional PMI/Prince2/PMBOK camp, but it all depends really.
