Book about time series analysis in Stata

Does somebody know a good book which outlines the time series analysis in Stata, that is, the various commands explained. I am aware of the Stata manuals; however, they are not that user friendly for me. I am searching for a book similar to "Microeconometrics using Stata" by Cameron and Trivedi which is related to time series analysis.
