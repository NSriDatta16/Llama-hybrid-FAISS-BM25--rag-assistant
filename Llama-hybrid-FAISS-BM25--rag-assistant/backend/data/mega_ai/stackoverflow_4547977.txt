ad hoc builds install team provisioning profile

When I install an ad hoc build of my ipad app, I notice that I get both the ad hoc provisioning file and a "team provisioning profile" showing up on my ipad. I've only ever dragged the ad hoc provisioning file to my itunes and am trying to debug why for a while I had an error showing up when I was syncing the app, something about a signer not being valid. Does anyone know what makes this team provision file get added and either 1) how I can prevent it from being added so I can debug the adhoc provision file itself or 2) if this team provision file is normal and how things work now with ad hoc builds? It shows up when I install it from my mac where I develop the app and also on a secondary mac where I don't develop the app so it doesn't seem to be something xcode is sticking on the ipad during debug builds.
