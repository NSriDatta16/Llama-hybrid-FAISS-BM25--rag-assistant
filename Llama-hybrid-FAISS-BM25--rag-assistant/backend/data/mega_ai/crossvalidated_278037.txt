How can eigenfaces (PCA eigenvectors on face image data) be displayed as images?

I am trying to clarify some concepts for face recognition. According to my understanding, given a training set of images with each image measuring 225 x 255 pixels, we will have a matrix of training images, n x (255 x 255). Using PCA, we would be reducing the high dimensions of 255 x 255 to something smaller say 200. However, i have seen cases when blogs display the eigenfaces. I would assume that the eigenfaces would have a dimension of 200. How would it be possible that the resulting eigenfaces image have the same dimensions as the original image? Although it seems that the eignfaces are much blurred.
