I went to web programming, with its newer languages that lack proper data handling (which leads to the perceived need for ORM) at the same time I built my be-all-end-all code generator. Have never looked back. One reason I would never consider an ORM is because I actually know how databases work, very well thank you. I don't something to try to make it look like I'm not using a Relational database, I want something to get me the power of the database with as little work as possible -- and that will never be an ORM because that is not what they are about. In my experience a good dictionary-based generator is the truest D-R-Y programming (Don't repeat yourself), it can free me from the nit-and-pick of working with the DB and allow me to concentrate on what matters, getting good biz logic written on top of a solid table design. EDIT : Two more points: 1) Going a non-ORM route is, if nothing else, lonely , inasmuch as ORM is so much the rage it is hard to find the people who never needed it and don't see the point. But let your technical judgement guide you. 2) A couple of years ago I wrote a blog entry, "Why I do not use ORM", which I will not link to because it was too inflammatory. After some time I tried again to capture the sense of why it is possible to look at ORM objectively and see no value, without being inflammatory, and that link is: http://database-programmer.blogspot.com/2010/12/historical-perspective-of-orm-and.html
