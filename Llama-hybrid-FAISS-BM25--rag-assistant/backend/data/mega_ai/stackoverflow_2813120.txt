Well, it seems that you consider a paragraph delimiter, an empty line. So the easiest solution seems this: $text = str_replace( "\r", "", $text ); // this removes the unwanted \r $lines = explode( "\n", $text ); // split text into lines. $textResult = ""; foreach( $lines AS $line ) { if( trim( $line ) == "" ) $textResult .= " "; $textResult .= " " . $line; } I think this solves your problem. $textResult would have your result
