I found the source of the citation here , and we can check the etymology of the word parsimony as follows: economy, thrift, frugality, sparingness in the use of expenditure of means Simply put, parsimony in your scenario means less complexity (a smaller number of independent parameters ). A regularization method to prevent overfitting and improve generalization. It can also be called Occam's razor which in statistics and probability means that adding a variable in the model should have its penalty. Why the amount of variables matters? Because more variables we add into the probabilistic graphical model, the more parameters the model has, the more “complex” a model is, the better we can fit it to data. Then we can always improve the model just by adding variables, which is actually nonsense. So we should consider taking the number of independent parameters into account. There are many criteria for the penalty such as p-value, adjusted $R^2$ , Akaike Information Criterion(AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion(BIC), DIC, Bayes factor, Mallow’s $C_p$ .
