Capturing performance of a cluster

I am having a cluster containing 10 nodes all of which have similar operating system(ubuntu 10.4).I want to monitor the performance of each node basically capturing the cpu ,memory etc at a given time.How can i capture the same at each node and aggregate the result to get a combined result Example the average CPU usage of the entire cluster. Are there any command I can run and get the results. Thanks in Advance.
