C# 6.0 Edit: With C# 6.0 we can now have a succinct, cast-free version of the orignal method: string s = myObj?.ToString() ?? ""; Or even using interpolation: string s = $"{myObj}"; Original Answer: string s = (myObj ?? String.Empty).ToString(); or string s = (myObjc ?? "").ToString() to be even more concise. Unfortunately, as has been pointed out you'll often need a cast on either side to make this work with non String or Object types: string s = (myObjc ?? (Object)"").ToString() string s = ((Object)myObjc ?? "").ToString() Therefore, while it maybe appears elegant, the cast is almost always necessary and is not that succinct in practice. As suggested elsewhere, I recommend maybe using an extension method to make this cleaner: public static string ToStringNullSafe(this object value) { return (value ?? string.Empty).ToString(); }
