This all depends or your needs. It is a trade off between precision, speed and size of data. If you are writing an accounting application you cannot lose any precision and so might well use NSDecimal number. Ig you are doing complex numerical analysis the speed could matter and so NSDecimalNumber would be too slow. But even in that case your analysis would look at the precision and errors you could afford and here could be cases where you need more precision that doubles etc give you. NSNumber is a separate case it is a class cluster to allow storage of C type numbers in other objects and other use in Cocoa.
