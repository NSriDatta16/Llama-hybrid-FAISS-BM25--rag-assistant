can I make this select follower/following script more organized? (PHP/Mysql)

In this script, it gets the followers of a user and the people the user is following. Is there a better relationship/database structure to get a user's followers and who they are following? All I have right now is 2 columns to determine their relationship. I feel this is "too simple"? (MYSQL) USER | FRIEND avian gary cend gary gary avian mike gary (PHP) $followers = array(); $followings = array(); $view = $_SESSION['user']; //view is the person logged in $query = "SELECT * FROM friends WHERE user='$view'"; $result = $db->query($query); while($row=$result->fetch_array()) { $follower=$row['friend']; $followers[] = $follower; } print_r($followers); echo " "; $query2 = "SELECT * FROM friends WHERE friend='$view'"; $result2 = $db->query($query2); while($row2=$result2->fetch_array()) { $following=$row2['user']; $followings[] = $following; } print_r($followings); echo " "; $mutual = array_intersect($followers, $followings); print_r($mutual); **DISPLAY** Your mutual friends avian Your followers avian You are following avian cen mike (I know avian is in all 3 displays, but I want to keep it that way)
