In these tasks full true output is known during the training; it makes the task somewhat easier than in general Reinforcement Learning setup. A setup when a good policy for training data is already known, and the task is to find a good policy which works on unseen data is sometimes called 'Imitation Learning'. You may find papers about SEARN, DAgger and LOLS interesting; they explore these ideas. Start with http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02206 and explore referenced papers. https://github.com/JohnLangford/vowpal_wabbit uses these techniques for structured prediction.
