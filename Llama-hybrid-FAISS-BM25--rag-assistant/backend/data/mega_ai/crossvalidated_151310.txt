They obtain 5 explanatory variables. Then they apply PCA and get its first component score. Next, they run multinomial logit using that score as an explanatory variable, instead of the original 5 variables. PCA score is nothing more than a weighted average of the variables, except that the weights are chosen in a certain way. I'm skeptical of this kind of studies. I bet you can get the same or similar result with a simple average of these 5 variables instead of PCA. In my opinion PCA is just a fancy method which doesn't add anything to this kind of data. It only makes it look more scientific.
