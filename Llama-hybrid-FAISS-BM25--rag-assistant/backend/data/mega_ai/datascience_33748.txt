If your individual classifiers are better than random guessing , i.e their error rate is less than 0.5 , then ensemble of these classifiers will lead to an increase in performance , i.e , a drop in error rate. You can refer to Combining Different Models for Ensemble Learning chapter in Sebastian Raschka - Python Machine Learning Book for a mathematical understanding of the same.
