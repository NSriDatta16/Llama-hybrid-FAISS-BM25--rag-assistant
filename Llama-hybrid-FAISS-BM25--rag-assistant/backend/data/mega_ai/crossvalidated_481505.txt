I have an argument for, and an argument against. My recommendation is not to force the quadratic terms when adding interaction. If they fit your problem, then go ahead and add them, but not as a general rule of thumb. Yes Include quadratic terms, because 2nd order Taylor expansion would suggest so: $$y=f(x,z)+e\approx f_x\Delta x+f_z\Delta z+2f_{xz}\Delta x\Delta z+f_{xx}\Delta x^2+f_{zz}\Delta z^2+e$$ From a point of view of mathematical elegance it would make a sense to throw in the quadratic terms whenever the interaction is added, if you like Taylor expansion interpretation of the regression coefficients. No This would make your approximation quadratic, which usually is not what you want: $$y=\beta_0+\beta_xx+\beta_zz+\beta_{xz}xz+\beta_{xx}x^2+\beta_{zz}z^2+e$$ So, e.g. when $x\to-\infty$ then $y\sim |x|^2$ , i.e. increasing at quadratic speed. This is rarely a desired behavior in linear regression because we usually expect monotonic effect of regressors. On the other hand, without quadratic terms the dependence on $x$ remains linear with an interaction $(\beta_x+\beta_{xz}z)x$ , although the slope varies with $z$ , which is a desired behavior. This is the reason, for instance, why in LOESS type of local polynomial fits the odd order polynomials are used with p=1 or 3.
