How to extract bullet information from word document?

I want to extract information of bullets present in word document. I want something like this : Suppose the text below, is in word document : Steps to Start car : Open door Sit inside Close the door Insert key etc. Then I want my text file like below : Steps to Start car : Open door Sit inside Close the door Insert key etc. I am using C# language to do this. I can extract paragraphs from word document and directly write them in text file with some formatting information like whether text is bold or is in italics, etc. but dont know how to extract this bullet information. Can anyone please tell me how to do this? Thanks in advance
