fastest way to match fingerprints?

I am trying to check whether a fingerprint exists/matches in a huge collection of fingerprints (100,000 fingerprints). It will take more time to search for matches sequentially. is there any better way to search for match? is it possible to organize the fingerprints in a binary tree structure so that the number of comparisons can be reduced? if yes how can we do it? it would be helpful if the answers are in Java perspective. edit: I have all the fingerprints as .gif images. how can i convert the finger print images into data? Thanks.
