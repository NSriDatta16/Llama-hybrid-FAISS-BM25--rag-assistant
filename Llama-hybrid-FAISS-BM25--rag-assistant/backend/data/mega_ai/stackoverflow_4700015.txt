I can't delete a method using eclipse refactoring?

I have a method which I want to delete. This method is being called from n number of classes. I want to delete this method using refactoring and also make eclipse delete all calls to this method rather than go and clean up in each file. I could not find a straight way to do this from refactor (I am using ganymede)
