What statistical analyses should one perform on ensemble forecasts (given a measurement)?

I have an ensemble of time-series predicting a scalar variable. Additionally, I have a measurement time series of this scalar variable. Which statistical analyses could and/or should I perform to judge the ensemble predictions?
