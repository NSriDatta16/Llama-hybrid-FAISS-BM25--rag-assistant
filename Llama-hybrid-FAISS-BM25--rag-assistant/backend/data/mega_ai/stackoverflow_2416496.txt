Pay attention to register of 32-bit components using the correct register (C:\Windows\SysWOW64\regsvr32.exe). If you have already registered up with the 64-bit version, unregister each dll with the same version. More help you find here Team is Going from XP32 to XP64 for .NET Development - Any Gotchas? Good luck
