Completely biased response: learn plyr , reshape2 and ggplot2 . They will cover 90% of your data manipulation and visualisation needs. All three packages have a consistent philosophy of data (which the ggplot2 book touches upon), and are designed to be consistent and easier to learn. Rather than learning many specialised functions, I really encourage you to learn about simple functions that can be flexibly composed to solve a wide range of problems. This is what plyr strives to do for data manipulation, and what ggplot2 strives to do for visualisation. It does mean you need to invest more time up front to learn a little about the underlying theory, but it's my belief that it will pay off handsomely in the long run.
