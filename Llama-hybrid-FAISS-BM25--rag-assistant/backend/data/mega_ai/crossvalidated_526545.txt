A comment requiring clarification: The data in your residual plot looks more like a box instead of a cloud. Is there a reason to believe that data has been truncated? If so, when the data is truncated, what do you obtain? The data in your residual plot has "inner clouds". Are there other factors that you have information about? Answers to your questions What would be the solutions in such a scenario? Indeed, transformation help to spread the data distribution. Though, you would lose the linear relation. An idea, to practically implement the density graph you have also shown, would be to slice the data in X at non-uniform intervals. For example, every interval contains n contiguous points. For each slice calculate the average, and use these new points for your linear regression. To determine a reasonable amount of point, plot the standard deviation of the residuals vs the amount of points used. Are there other models that may solve this? I would use a SVM with a circular kernel to create two groups, therefore separating the points at x=0 (group 0) from all others (group 1). From group 0 you establish b0 and the noise that can be expected from group 1 you can obtain your b1.
