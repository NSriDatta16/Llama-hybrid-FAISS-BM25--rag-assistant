C# removing an event handler

I've been doing this for a while, but I haven't noticed that I've been using a new each time I remove an event handler. Am I supposed to be creating a new object? Basically is there a difference between 1 and 2? ethernetdevice.PcapOnPacketArrival -= new SharpPcap.PacketArrivalEvent(ArrivalResponseHandler); ethernetdevice.PcapOnPacketArrival -= ArrivalResponseHandler; EDIT: Okay this is a duplicate. Sorry about that. Answer posted here . Two delegates of the same type with the same targets, methods, and invocation lists are considered equal.
