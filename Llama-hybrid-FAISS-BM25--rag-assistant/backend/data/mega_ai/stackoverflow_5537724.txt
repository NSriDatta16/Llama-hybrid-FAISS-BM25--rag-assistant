When embedding F# Interactive, Visual Studio uses the --fsi-server: parameter. As far as I know, this does two things: Changes the way output is printed (instead of printing > , it prints SERVER-PROMPT> on a separate line, so it should be easier to remove it from the output and detect state when input is expected) It also starts some .NET Remoting channel that you can use to stop execution of commands in F# Interactive (e.g. if it runs into an infinite loop) and it can also provide some completion information. The F# Interactive pad in MonoDevelop F# plugin uses the flag ( see source code on GitHub ). I think it works mostly right, but I believe it sometimes prints additional \n in the output.
