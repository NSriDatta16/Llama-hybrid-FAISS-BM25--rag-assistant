If I understand your schema, what you're doing is building a name/value storage system, with specific tables for the datatypes you're trying to support (dates, numbers etc.) This is a totally valid approach - but it brings as many problems as solutions. For instance, you can't really model the "relational" part of a database schema in a clean way. Creating queries with even moderately complex logic is tricky - imagine writing something with a few ANDs, ORs and INs. Aggregate functions like MIN, MAX etc. would be very hard to do. Another problem is that you're working in a different way to the rest of the industry - this makes it hard to bring new developers into the team, or use standard tooling/frameworks such as Object/Relational mapping tools, E/R diagrams etc.
