Yes, is probably the short answer. Download a similar app like Trails Lite to test it for your needs. If you average your location samples over 10 seconds then you will end up with a pretty accurate speed reading. Think of it like the needle of a speedometer in an old car, bouncing around with every pothole. If you look at it for a split-second, then you can't tell what speed you're doing, but if you study it for 10 seconds (and I don't recommend trying this) you can get a much better idea. As has already been pointed out, the accuracy of absolute positioning may only be accurate to 40m or so, but relative positioning is much more accurate, and that's what you need.
