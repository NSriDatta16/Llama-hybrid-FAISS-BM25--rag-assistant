If I understand correctly, you intend to store a database on the Android? Unless you have a very restricted location like a college campus, I think you might find that you don't have enough storage. You don't tell us what you application is, so it's difficult to help precisely, but I would suggest that want to query publicly available datababses which are online for features of interest near to you and display those. As your location changes you would thnen have to re-query the databases. I highly recommend Google maps which integrates well with Google Android and which provides some of this functionality for you. A good book to get started is Map Scripting 101 . There is also lots of good information at the website. Hope this helps.
