likelihood function in Bayesian analysis?

Below is the distribution of my outcome variable y in the data, characterized by a heavy mass at zero and very long tail. Can you help me select an appropriate probability distribution for the likelihood in Bayesian analysis? My goal is to figure out the posterior mean y_bar and its credible intervals, given the data (as shown in the graph) as well as the likelihood and prior selected. I've thought about using exponential or Poisson. But (1) the underlying sampling process is neither a wait-time or a count process, and (2) their density functions do not have the distinct features of the data, heavy mass at zero and long tail. So I ruled them out. The closest that I can think of is a gamma distribution with very small shape and rate parameter: My question is, (1) Is the gamma distribution a good choice for the likelihood? And if yes, what kind of prior do you think I can consider? (2) Why can't I just use the normal distribution as the likelihood?
