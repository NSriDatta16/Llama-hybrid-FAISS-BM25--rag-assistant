Xcode 4 not recognizing iPhone as provisioned device

My iPhone has a green dot in the organizer, runs 4.2.1, and I just updated Xcode to 4.0. When I try to build and run my project on the iPhone, it says that no provisioned devices are connected. It worked in the previous version of Xcode. I have ensured that the provisioning is up-to-date, and that the project settings have the correct provisioning file selected. I also deleted the Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport/4.2.1 to be sure that's not it. I would appreciate any help. Thanks!
