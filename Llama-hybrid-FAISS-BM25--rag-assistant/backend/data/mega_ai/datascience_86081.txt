As a first step, You can take the table of measurements as-is, run k-means on all the columns representing intensities. In the image, I see pixels in 5 colors (red, orange, green, azure, magenta), so the author of the top image has decided to run k-means with k=5 clusters. (k in in k-means is often chosen to be an odd number) To get a clearer signal, people often run preprocessing steps such as Principal Components analysis (PCA) on their datasets before running k-means, and then choose the first, say, 10 components (should be larger than 5). Then people run k-means on those 10 columns. Choosing the number of components to calculate k from, and then choosing a value for k, is basically guesswork, at least initially. It is also guesswork to assign colors to cluster numbers found by the k-means algorithm. So you probably have to set a lookup table manually, in another preprocessing step, such as { 1 => "red". 2 => "azure", 3 => "limegreen" 4 => "yellow", 5 => "orange" }. And then make an x-y plot coloring the pixels accordingly. The sequence is arbitrary. Sorry, I don't know how to do this in Orange.
