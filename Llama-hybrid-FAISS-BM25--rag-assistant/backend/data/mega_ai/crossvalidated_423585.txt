What is the difference between the average class accuracy and average instance accuracy?

In some papers, I find some strange evaluation metrics that did not give a clear explanation, like average class accuracy and average instance accuracy! What is the difference between both? I can not find any explanation about them... How to calculate them in Python3? also, I post two links: (1) https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03265 Fig.7 and 8 ; (2) https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231218311561 Table 1 and 2 . Thanks a lot !
