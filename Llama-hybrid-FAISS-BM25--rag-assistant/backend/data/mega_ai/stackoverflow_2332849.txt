I had exactly the same problem. After going through settings, reinstalling the agent etc, I found that the problem was rather simple - the TeamCity agent placed a wrong teamcity URL in it's property (and other paths as well). Find the buildagent.properties file ( buildAgentInstallDir \conf\buildagent.properties), and you'll probably see that all of the lines have 'escape' characters in them (e.g. serverUrl=http://localhost:8090/ ) Modify the file to remove escape chars (i.e. links should be plain like: serverUrl= http://localhost:8090/ , env.TEAMCITY_JRE=C:\Program Files\TeamCity\BuildAgentInstalled\jre and similar) Hope this helps...
