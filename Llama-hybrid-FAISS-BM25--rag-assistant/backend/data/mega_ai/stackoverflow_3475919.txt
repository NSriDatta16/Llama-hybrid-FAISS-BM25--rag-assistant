It's absolutely possible to convert flash to html 5, depending on what it is you want to do. A good example of this being done is www.zombo.com (flash) -> http://html5zombo.com/ (html 5). If you look at the source on html5zombo.com there is an explanation of how he did it (reprinted below) HTML5zombo.com Bertrand Fan (bertrand@fan.net) 5/19/2010 I wanted zombo.com on my iPad. That is all. =================================================================== How I did it, for nerds: =================================================================== Watched the Net tab for zombo.com in Firebug wget http://www.zombo.com/inrozxa.swf wget http://www.zombo.com/welcomeclip.swf Opened them in SWFRIP to extract the MP3 and SVG representations of the logo and spinner. Opened the SVG files in Adobe Illustrator (ironic, I know), tweaked a bit, exported new SVG files Copy-pasted the SVG contents into this HTML file, tweaked the attributes a bit Wrote the JS code to rotate the SVG spinner Converted the MP3 to OGG using oggenc2 (not really necessary for the iPad, but apparently for Firefox) Discovered that the iPad does not respect autoplay on HTML5 audio tags, crafted a javascript link for iPads wget http://www.zombo.com/favicon.ico =================================================================== References: =================================================================== http://www.zombo.com/ http://twitter.com/zombocom http://sourceforge.net/projects/swfrip/ http://developer.apple.com/safari/library/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/Using_HTML5_Audio_Video/AudioandVideoTagBasics/AudioandVideoTagBasics.html http://html5doctor.com/native-audio-in-the-browser/ http://emacsformacosx.com/ http://www.apple.com/hotnews/thoughts-on-flash/
