Android MediaRecorder .prepare Unhandled IOEception

Setting up a MediaRecorder as a simple Audio recorder, my "recorderName.prepare()" is being showing by Eclipse as an "Unhandled IOException". If I put in place some error exception the program runs but obviously the .prepare statement doesn't work. As far as I can make out I have declared everything for the MediaRecorder: AudioSource OutPutFormat Encoder OutputFile I have also declared RECORD_AUDIO and WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE permissions in the manifest. import android.media.MediaRecorder; private MediaRecorder mRec; //Gobal . . . public void StartRec() { mRec = new MediaRecorder(); mRec.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC); mRec.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.THREE_GPP); mRec.setAudioEncoder(MediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.AMR_NB); mRec.setOutputFile(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath()+"/test.3gp"); mRec.prepare(); //Underlined as an Unhandled Exception mRec.start(); } Eclipse recommends surrounding it a try and catch or adding a declaration to the method. As for a stack trace, which is produced from the emulator?, I cannot compile the application. Also please bear in mind I have been at this for less than two weeks. This question may be acheingly easy, but considering I have been only just started out on Android I feel justified in opting out and asking for help :( Thank You
