st extract a classical description of the states and then implement an ideal discriminating measurement based on this information. This would only require classical learning. However, one can show that a fully quantum approach is strictly superior in this case. (This also relates to work on quantum pattern matching.) The problem of learning unitary transformations can be approached in a similar way. Going beyond the specific problem of learning states and transformations, the task of clustering also admits a fully quantum version, wherein both the oracle which returns the distance between data-points and the information processing device which runs the algorithm are quantum. Finally, a general framework spanning supervised, unsupervised and reinforcement learning in the fully quantum setting was introduced in, where it was also shown that the possibility of probing the environment in superpositions permits a quantum speedup in reinforcement learning. Such a speedup in the reinforcement-learning paradigm has been experimentally demonstrated in a photonic setup. Explainable quantum machine learning The need for models that can be understood by humans emerges in QML in analogy to classical machine learning and drives the research field of explainable QML (or XQML in analogy to XAI/XML). These efforts are often also referred to as Interpretable Machine Learning (IML, and by extension IQML). XQML/IQML can be considered as an alternative research direction instead of finding a quantum advantage. For example, XQML has been used in the context of mobile malware detection and classification. Quantum Shapley values have also been proposed to interpret gates within a circuit based on a game-theoretic approach. For this purpose, gates instead of features act as players in a coalitional game with a value function that depends on measurements of the quantum circuit of interest. Additionally, a quantum version of the classical technique known as LIME (Linear Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations) has also been proposed, known as Q-LIME. Quantum Kernel Methods and Generative Models Quantum kernel methods have emerged as particularly promising approaches for near-term applications. Large-scale benchmarking studies encompassing over 20,000 trained models have provided comprehensive insights into the effectiveness of fidelity quantum kernels (FQKs) and projected quantum kernels (PQKs) across diverse classification and regression tasks. These studies have revealed universal patterns that guide effective quantum kernel method design. In the generative modeling domain, quantum generative adversarial networks and quantum circuit Born machines have shown particular promise for tabular data synthesis. Novel quantum generative models for tabular data have demonstrated performance improvements of 8.5% over leading classical models while using only 0.072% of the parameters, indicating significant potential for parameter-efficient learning. Classical learning applied to quantum problems The term "quantum machine learning" sometimes refers to classical machine learning performed on data from quantum systems. A basic example of this is quantum state tomography, where a quantum state is learned from measurement. Other applications include learning Hamiltonians and automatically generating quantum experiments. Quantum learning theory Quantum learning theory pursues a mathematical analysis of the quantum generalizations of classical learning models and of the possible speed-ups or other improvements that they may provide. The framework is very similar to that of classical computational learning theory, but the learner in this case is a quantum information processing device, while the data may be either classical or quantum. Quantum learning theory should be contrasted with the quantum-enhanced machine learning discussed above, where the goal was to consider specific problems and to use quantum protocols to improve the time complexity of classical algorithm
