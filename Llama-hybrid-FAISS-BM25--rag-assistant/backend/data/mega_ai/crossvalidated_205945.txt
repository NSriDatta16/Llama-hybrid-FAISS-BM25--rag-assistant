MCMC Metropolis-Hastings initial values

my posterior values that I obtained via Metroplis-Hasting are always around my initial values. For instance if I chose $\theta_0 =(1,2)$ my posterior values, after either taking mean or median, are around (1,2) Any idea how to get the MH to explore more values? For the proposal transition I am using T-distribution with c$\Sigma$ covariance. constant c as suggested by Gelman. I tried to get the empirical bayes estimator and used them as initial values but it does not work. CODE: USING R Trying to maximized log-likelihood function. ββ is of dimenssion 2 ββ[i,] # Current value log_post_curr= lik.b(ββ[i,]) # current log-likelihood values ββ[i+1,] =rmvt(n=1,delta=ββ[i+1,],ΣΣ=sig,df=3) : # Generating new value from T-distribution centralized at the current value with known covariance matrix. df: degree of freedom log_post_prop= lik.b(ββ[i+1,]) # log-likelihood value for the proposed ββ log_prop_curr= log(dmvt(ββ[i,],delta=ββ[i,],ΣΣ=sig,df=3)) # log T-value for the current ββ log_prop_prop= log(dmvt(ββ[i+1,],delta=ββ[i+1,],ΣΣ=sig,df=3)) # log T-value for the proposed ββ log_αα = log_prop_curr+log_post_prop - log_prop_prop-log_post_curr # log of the acceptance ratio ϵϵ[i] = min(1,exp(log_αα)) # Acceptance ratio u = runif(1) # Generating a uniform value if ((u
