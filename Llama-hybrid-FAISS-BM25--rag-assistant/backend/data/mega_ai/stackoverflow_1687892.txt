If you're loading your plugins from a .vimrc file, what you could do is put a q on some line part way through the file to make it quit so you can use a process timer, like the unix time command. More thoroughly, this would look like: backup existing .vimrc file comment out all but a select number of plugins insert a q line call time vim repeteadly and average restore backup This is not elegant but I think it will get the job done.
