Well, if you plan to use a simple, linear classifier, it makes perfect sense to generate new features which are a non-linear function of the existing ones, specially if your domain knowledge indicates you the resulting feature will be meaningful and informative. Note that a linear classifier cannot consider those complex features unless you explicitly provide them. Ideally, If you use a sufficiently powerful nonlinear classification algorithm it should be able to create a decision boundary which considers arbitrary non-linear transformations of the input features if they are informative for classification. However, in practice most non-linear classifiers just look at some type of transformations. For instance, a polynomial kernel SVM will consider polynomial interactions between features, but maybe a more informative feature can be created by applying other types of transformations... In short, if domain knowledge indicates that a hand-crafted non-linear combination of features might be informative, it makes sense to add that into the existing set of features.
