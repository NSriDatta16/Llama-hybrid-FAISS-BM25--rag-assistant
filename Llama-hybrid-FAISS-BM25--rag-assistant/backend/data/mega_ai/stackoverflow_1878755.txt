Amazon goes to a lot of effort to tailor the search results to what the (potential) customer is likely to want to buy. All sorts of things happen that (to the outside observer) are not exactly predictable / explicable. I could say more ... but I think I'm still under an NDA. In short, I'm not surprised that your application is seeing different results all the time. EDIT: By the way, if you are screen-scraping the Amazon site for some reason, you should pay attention to the following excerpt from the "Conditions of Use" page: Amazon grants you a limited license to access and make personal use of this site and not to download (other than page caching) or modify it, or any portion of it, except with express written consent of Amazon. This license does not include any resale or commercial use of this site or its contents; any collection and use of any product listings, descriptions, or prices; any derivative use of this site or its contents; any downloading or copying of account information for the benefit of another merchant; or any use of data mining, robots, or similar data gathering and extraction tools. This site or any portion of this site may not be reproduced, duplicated, copied, sold, resold, visited, or otherwise exploited for any commercial purpose without express written consent of Amazon. You may not frame or utilize framing techniques to enclose any trademark, logo, or other proprietary information (including images, text, page layout, or form) of Amazon without express written consent. You may not use any meta tags or any other "hidden text" utilizing Amazon's name or trademarks without the express written consent of Amazon. Any unauthorized use terminates the permission or license granted by Amazon. You are granted a limited, revocable, and nonexclusive right to create a hyperlink to the home page of Amazon.com so long as the link does not portray Amazon, or its products or services in a false, misleading, derogatory, or otherwise offensive matter. You may not use any Amazon logo or other proprietary graphic or trademark as part of the link without express written permission. In short, GET PERMISSION.
