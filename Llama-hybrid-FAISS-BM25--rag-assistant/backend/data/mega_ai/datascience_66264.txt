KeyError: 'i' and Error

I am implementing the codes for https://www.kaggle.com/eray1yildiz/using-lstms-with-attention-for-emotion-recognition which is an emotion analysis from the text. I am having some errors when I am Encoding my samples with corresponding integer values. The following codes are: X = [[word2id[word] for word in sentence] for sentence in input_sentences] Error: Traceback (most recent call last): File " ", line 1, in X = [[word2id[word] for word in sentence] for sentence in input_sentences] File " ", line 1, in X = [[word2id[word] for word in sentence] for sentence in input_sentences] File " ", line 1, in X = [[word2id[word] for word in sentence] for sentence in input_sentences] KeyError: 'i' can someone please help me. thanks
