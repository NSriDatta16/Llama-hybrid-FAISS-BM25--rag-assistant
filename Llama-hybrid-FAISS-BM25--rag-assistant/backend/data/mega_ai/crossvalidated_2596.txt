Well, @Srikant already gave you the right answer since the rotation (or loadings) matrix contains eigenvectors arranged column-wise, so that you just have to multiply (using %*% ) your vector or matrix of new data with e.g. prcomp(X)$rotation . Be careful, however, with any extra centering or scaling parameters that were applied when computing PCA EVs. In R, you may also find useful the predict() function, see ?predict.prcomp . BTW, you can check how projection of new data is implemented by simply entering: getS3method("predict", "prcomp")
