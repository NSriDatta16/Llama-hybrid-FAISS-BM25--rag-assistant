The note at the bottom of your output is important to understand. See Stata FAQ's Explanation of “completely determined” message : it says you either have a great linear predictor or hidden collinearity among your predictors. This may not explain the problem completely, since their examples don't have pseudo $R^2=1$ nor missing standard errors...but if your outcomes are all separated perfectly by your predictors, that might cause the problem. Logistic regression doesn't work quite so well when all observations are 1 for some combination of predictors or all 0 for some other combination. If you only have 12 cases, this model is probably doomed to failure, but if you have more than that, you might want to try some of the suggestions in answers to these related questions: How to deal with perfect separation in logistic regression? Adding interactions to logistic regression leads to high SEs
