Selecting categorical and continuous variable for logistic regression

I am new to R. I am trying to do a logistic regression using a categorical and continuous variable and I am supposed to select the right variable for my model. There are 27 variables and a 8,000 observations. I have gone through a couple of articles online including stepwise regression by AIC and all I do is confuse myself the more. I was also told to select my variables from the correlation matrix but when I do the correlation I don't seem to find the correlation especially with the categorical variable. I also try to fit all the model and I get some variables with p-value less than 0.5. This is the code: d4 d3
