What's an elegant way to conditionally add a class to an HTML element in a view?

I occasionally have to add a class to an html element based on a condition. The problem is I can't figure out a clean way of doing it. Here's an example of the stuff I've tried: > some message here OR some message here I don't like the first approach because it's crowded looking and hard to read. I don't like the second approach because the nesting is screwed up. It'd be nice to put it in the model, (something like @status.css_class ), but that doesn't belong there. What do most people do?
