Calculating Standard Deviation of the Volume of a Cube

Let's say I have a machine that makes cubes. My goal is to determine the average and standard deviation the volume of a cube. I have N length, width and height measurements. I do not believe these variables are independent (since they are all coming from the same machine). The product of the average length, width and height would give me the average volume, but how would I determine the standard deviation? Edit: although I have 3 columns of data, they are not arranged such that row 1 is length, width and height from the same cube.
