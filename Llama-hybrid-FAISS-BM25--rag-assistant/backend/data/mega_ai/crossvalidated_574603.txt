Valid to compare variable importance ranks across RF with different responses?

I have a dataset with multiple response variables that share the same predictor set (in particular, semantic differential scales in an attitudes task). I want to find the predictors that best explain each response variable. In a situation like this, is it valid to run random forests on each response and compare the ranks (not the magnitudes) of predictors' variable importance scores? I mention ranks because the magnitudes aren't comparable across models . Here's an example implementation in R using party::cforest() suppressPackageStartupMessages(library(party)) data("mammoexp", package = "TH.data") f1 [1] "SYMPT" "PB" "ME" "DECT" names(sort(imp2, decreasing=TRUE)) #> [1] "DECT" "PB" "ME" "SYMPT" Created on 2022-05-09 by the reprex package (v2.0.1)
