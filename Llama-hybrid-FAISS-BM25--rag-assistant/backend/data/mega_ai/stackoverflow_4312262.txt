What would be an effective way to put a marker drawable on the mapview everytime the user clicks the map

I am playing around with Android MapView and have come across a requirement, where i have to put a marker at the place where the user clicks. in my scenario, the user can pan a map , zoom in and out, and click wherever she likes. in this case, the marker should be put wherever the user is clicking on the map. If a previous marker was there on map, then at click event it should be cleared and be put at the new place. This should repeat every time the case repeats. In future, I'll be having some more drawables like range representative and a pointer to select range which can be dragged. I am able to put the marker on the first place, but my code doesn't work when the user clicks anywhere else. Here's the code for the class that I am using: http://pastebin.com/6idn7VwK The full class extending MapActivity and the one extending the ItemizedOverlay can be found in the link above. I understand that I might be doing some wrong things, so please correct me. Thanks!
