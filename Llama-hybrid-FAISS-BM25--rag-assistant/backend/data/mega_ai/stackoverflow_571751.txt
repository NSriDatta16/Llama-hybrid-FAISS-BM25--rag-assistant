The only problem you will encounter is at least 10 years away when Javascript or some kind of open source scripting framework becomes the Web standard. Server side scripting languages like PHP, ASP, JSP, etc and Plugins like Flash, SVG, VRML fill in gaps that a relatively slow client side scripting language like Javascript cannot accomadate. In the future, as PCs get faster and Javascript engines continue to get more efficient, you will see the gradual decline of 3rd party solutions like Server side scripting and plugins. Then the only problem you will face is a bunch of old code that gets laughed at by the cyber punks zooming by on their anti gravity boards. Ofcourse, this is in the future, and by the looks of things the specs people loving dragging their feet. So in short, PHP is your only hope for doing anything useful in a browser for the forseeable future. Your only worry should be whether you want to learn ASP instead, its pretty cool. Although PHP has a huge community and code snippets galore.
