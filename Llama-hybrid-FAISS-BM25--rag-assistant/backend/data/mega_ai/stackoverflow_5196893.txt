Initialising array to a dynamic size - C#

I am using an array to hold the results of an SQLite query, at the moment I am using a two dimensional table to do this. The problem that I have is that I have to manually specify the size of one of the indexes before the array can be used but it feels like a waste as I have no real knowledge of how many rows will be returned. I do use a property which allows me to retrieve the amount of columns that are present which is used in the arrays initialisation. Example: using (SQLiteDataReader dr = cmd.ExecuteReader()) { results = new object[10,dr.FieldCount]; while (dr.Read()) { jIterator++; for (int i = 0; i Example Storage: I simply add the data to the array for as long as the while loop returns true, in this instance I set the first index to 10 as I already know how many elements are in the database and 10 will be more than enough. How would I go about changing the array so it's size can be dynamic, Is this even possible based on the way I am getting the database results?
