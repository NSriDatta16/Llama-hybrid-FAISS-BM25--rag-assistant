I performed an Interview with 44 questions Protocol. The structure of questions is based on 18 variables. Major variables are coming from theory. Every major variable consists of 3,4 or more question items. In fact, I want to compare every major variable with each other and compute a correlation coefficient.

Similarly,major variable(2): organizational trust consist of three ordinal data and two nominal data. Now my available data are the combination of ordinal and nominal. I don't know how do I merge nominal with ordinal data to build a unique variable? The major variable are based on theory,
