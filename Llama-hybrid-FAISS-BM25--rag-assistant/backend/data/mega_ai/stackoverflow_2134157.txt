as3, flash fl tween transitions freezing

I have a bunch of different tweens going on in different movie clips but it seems that sometimes the tweens will freeze halfway through during my transitions. This guy is having the same problem and his question was answered but I'm not too sure exactly what they meant when they told him what to do: http://www.actionscript.org/forums/showthread.php3?t=222606 Do I have to import my tween classes at the very beginning of my site in the root then reference those in every movie clip as opposed to importing the classes in each movieclip separately? Here is an example of a tween inside one of my movieclips: // Import classes import fl.transitions.Tween; import fl.transitions.easing.*; // Bring in elements with tweening var bandY:Tween = new Tween(band, "y", Strong.easeOut, 533, 259, 3, true); var boxY:Tween = new Tween(box, "y", None.easeOut, -122, 0, 1, true); var signY:Tween = new Tween(sign, "y", Regular.easeOut, 551, 224, 1.5, true); var signX:Tween = new Tween(sign, "x", Regular.easeOut, -17, 82, 1.5, true); var dragonMaskWidth:Tween = new Tween(dragonMask, "width", Regular.easeOut, 30, 500, 3, true);
