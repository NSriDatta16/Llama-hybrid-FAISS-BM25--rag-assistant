What you are asking for is usually called basket analysis . I think you should get maximum value from the data you have by using both of them: user & items. What you said about "item-based" approach means something like recommendation based on item tags or categories. It isn't a recommendation system in the full sense, because it uses your categorization/tagging. In other words, you will never place diapers and beer into a single category, but it is still legendary buying pattern :). Item-based data is used typically in basket analysis algorithms, such as frequent pattern mining. In couple words: you search for most frequent item sets (items bought together or coherently) and make suggestions based on them. User-based data shouldn't be ignored either. Clustering approach works here: you can find some groups of customers which buying attitude to item sets (found above) is different from the average. You can find more at statistics stack exchage site. Questions like this . And more .
