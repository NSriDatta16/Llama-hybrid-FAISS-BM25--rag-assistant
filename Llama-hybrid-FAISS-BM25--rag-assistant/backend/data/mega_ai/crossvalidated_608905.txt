MSE and log-MSE after applying log transformation

Consider a time series $\{Y\}$ and the forecast $\hat{Y}_{t+1}$ for the true value $Y_{t+1}$ . Now consider the time series $\{y\}$ , where $y_t \equiv log(Y_t)$ , and the forecast $\hat{y}_{t+1}$ for the true value $y_{t+1}$ . Are the functions $L_1(Y_{t+1}, \hat{Y}_{t+1}) = (logY_{t+1} -log\hat{Y}_{t+1})^2$ and $L_2(y_{t+1}, \hat{y}_{t+1}) = (y_{t+1} - \hat{y}_{t+1})^2$ the same? If not, is there any way to obtain the value of $\hat{Y}_{t+1}$ assuming to know $\hat{y}_{t+1}$ ?
