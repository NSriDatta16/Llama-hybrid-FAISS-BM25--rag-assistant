Embedding both IronRuby and IronPython

I am trying to run both ironruby and ironpython at the sample application. I am getting an exception - Unhandled Exception: System.Reflection.TargetInvocationException: Exception has been thrown by the target of an invocation. ---> System.Reflection.TargetInvocat ionException: Failed to load language 'IronPython 2.6.2': Could not load file or assembly 'Microsoft.Dynamic, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=3 1bf3856ad364e35' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file spe cified. ---> System.IO.FileNotFoundException: Could not load file or assembly 'M icrosoft.Dynamic, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=31bf3856ad364 e35' or one of its dependencies. What to do? How to fix it?
