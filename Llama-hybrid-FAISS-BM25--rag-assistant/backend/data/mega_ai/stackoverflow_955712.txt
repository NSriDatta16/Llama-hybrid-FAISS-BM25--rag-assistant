While I thank Marc Gravell and Jon Skeet for their input, my question was how to go about parsing a file containing lines in the format described using the FileHelpers library (albeit, I worded it badly to begin with, describing 'CSV' when in fact, it isn't). I have now found a way to do just this. It's not particularly the most elegant method, however, it gets the job done. In an ideal world, I wouldn't be using FileHelpers in this particular implementation ;) For those who are interested, the solution is to create a FileRecord class as follows: [DelimitedRecord(" ")] public sealed class HTTPRecord { public String IP; // Fields with prefix 'x' are useless to me... we omit those in processing later public String x1; [FieldDelimiter("[")] public String x2; [FieldDelimiter("]")] public String Timestamp; [FieldDelimiter("\"")] public String x3; public String Method; public String URL; [FieldDelimiter("\"")] public String Type; [FieldIgnored()] public String x4; [FieldDelimiter(" ")] public String x5; public int HTTPStatusCode; public long Bytes; [FieldQuoted()] public String Referer; [FieldQuoted()] public String UserAgent; }
