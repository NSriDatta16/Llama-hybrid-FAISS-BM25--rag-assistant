As quoted here: What measure of training error to report for Random Forests? Andy Liaw, who maintains the R-Package randomForest, states that Random Forests tend to nearly zero loss on trainingset and that this perfect prediction is "by design". So to tell wether a model is overfitting, one has to compare the accuracy from e.g. cross-validation with accuracy on the independent testset.
