I think this is about as good as you're going to get: var arrayObject = $.parseJSON(data); var htmlToShow = $.map(arrayObject,function(o){ return ' ' + o[0] + ' ' + o[1] + ' '; }).join(''); $('#tableResults').html(htmlToShow); Incrementally building all the intermediary strings with += is not a good idea. Using html() to set one big blob of HTML (as you did) is, however, a good idea. If you need to add additional rows to an existing table, note that it is legal to add multiple tbody elements to the same table. Do this and then set the html() of the new tbody en mass as above. Edit : Well, I modify my answer. If you really, really want to eek every last bit of performance from your script, don't use jQuery. Don't use map , don't use each . Write your own for loop to map one array to an array of strings, join them, and then set the innerHTML directly. But I think you'll find the performance savings in doing this do not merit the extra work, testing, or possible fragility.
