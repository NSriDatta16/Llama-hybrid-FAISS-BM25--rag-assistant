The Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) Pattern is a design pattern. Per definition a design pattern shows a common solution in the object-oriented world and this solution can be applied in various platforms (WPF, WinForms, Java Swing, etc.). I agree that MVVM is best used with WPF because it leverages the strong binding capabilities. However, Windows Forms supports data binding as well. The WAF Windows Forms Adapter shows how to apply the MVVM Pattern in a Windows Forms application. It comes with a MVVM application which is implemented twice: 1. WinForms; 2. WPF. Both applications share the lower layers which are independent of the UI technology.
