High code coverage: For an individual unit test, it does not have to cover 100% of the method or methods under test. Eventually, the suite of unit tests need to cover as much of the method or methods under test as you feel is important. Could be 1%, could be 100%, and it is probably different for different sections of code. I generally try for 70%-80% coverage, and then pay more attention to the trend of coverage than to the actual value. High performance: More important than the speed of an individual unit test is the time it takes to run all the tests in the suite. If it takes too long, developers may decide not to run them as often. But you often can't afford to spend a lot of time optimizing, especially when it comes to unit tests. You need the entire suite to run fast enough. It isn't uncommon for a system I'm on to have hundreds of unit tests, and still run in 2 minutes. One really slow test, or a bunch of slightly slow tests, can really slow down the build-test-refactor cycle.
