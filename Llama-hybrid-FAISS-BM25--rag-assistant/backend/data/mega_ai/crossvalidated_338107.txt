Stratification vs. interaction

I'm doing a secondary analysis on a large sample of children from 4- to 18-years-old using logistic regression. In addition to analyzing effects of predictors (age, sex, IQ, autism severity, medical conditions) on the outcome (sleep problems) in the full sample of children, I did analyses in groups stratified by sex and age groups (early, middle, late childhood). A reviewer commented, "As complementary to stratified associations, the authors should consider presenting results from interaction tests between predictors and subgroup variables to provide the reader with relevant statistical evidence as to whether associations truly differ between these subgroups." When doing the full and stratified sample, I get main effects for most of the predictors; but when I do the analyses with interactions in the model, I only get interactions between age and IQ. Does this mean the main effects I found in the stratified groups are not valid (apart from IQ). How do I report this and respond to the reviewer? Thanks!
