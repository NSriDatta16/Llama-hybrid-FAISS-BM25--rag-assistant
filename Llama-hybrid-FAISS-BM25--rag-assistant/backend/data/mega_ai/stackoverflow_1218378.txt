I would start by using a corner detector (The Harris detector works nice) to find the intersections and corners of the sudoku grid. Then I would use those points to do an image rectification to transform the image to have the grid as rectangular as possible. Now you should have no trouble finding each square to do OCR. Image rectification is not simple and entails quite a lot of math. Be prepared to do some reading :) If the images of the game boards are already close to rectangular you can of course skip the rectification part and directly use the corner points to find your squares for OCR. A lot of people have been suggesting to use Neural Networks. I am quite certain that throwing a neural network on this problem is totally unneccessary. NNs are (sometimes) good if you need to classify objects where the definition of the object is vague. "Find cars in image" is a problem which could have use for a Neural Network since cars can look very different but have some features the same. Thus, given enough data, you can train your NN to detect cars. In this problem you have something that is very regular and always looks almost the same, so a NN will not make anything easier or better.
