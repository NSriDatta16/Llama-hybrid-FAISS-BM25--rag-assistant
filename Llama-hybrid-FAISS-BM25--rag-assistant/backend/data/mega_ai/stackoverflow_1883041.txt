Actually, there is a way, it just hurts a bit. SQL Server 2005 supports updating part of a column: http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms177523(SQL.90).aspx And you can do a read of part of a column with substring (yes, even binary - it'll cheerfully return an array of bytes). The caveats here are that it's only an update - so you'd have to create a value in the varbinary(max) field first, then update it. Other than it, it's absolutely possible to deal with as though you're streaming data to/from SQL Server. I wrapped the retrieval / update functionality with a stream class to make my life easier. Hope this helps.
