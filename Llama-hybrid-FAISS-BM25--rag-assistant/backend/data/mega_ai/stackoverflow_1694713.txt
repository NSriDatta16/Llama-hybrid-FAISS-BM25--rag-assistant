Personally, there's no way I would use a dropdown for 3000+ items. Not only is there a problem with data transfer & viewstate but also its a pain for any user to scroll through that many items to find the option they require. Have you considered something like this: http://jquery.bassistance.de/autocomplete/demo/ You have a textbox that says something like 'start typing'... the second the user types the first letter of what they are looking for, an ajax query is made grabbing all the entries that begin with that letter. Given that there are 26 letters in the alphabet, you will return on average 4% of the data i.e 120 entries rather than 3000!! Also as users get to know your system, they can type more and more letters and find what they are looking for much faster. Beats scrolling through a list of 3000 entries, and makes your application easier to use, more responsive and more network friendly!
