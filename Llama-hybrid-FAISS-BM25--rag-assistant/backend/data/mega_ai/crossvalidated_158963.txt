Which is the best way to check (with some certainty) if the mean of a time series is a constant?

I am testing the time series output by a light sensor, and trying to know when dawn and dusk end. I used a cusum test to check when light level starts changing, and now I need to know when it stabilizes to a constant level (night or day). I learned about student tests and p_values. The problem is that in the examples I found, the null hypothesis is always that the slope of the linear regression is zero, but I need the opposite: the null hypothesis should be that the slope is non-zero, so I can conclude with certain confidence that my time series is constant (slope = 0) Is there a way that I can change the null hypothesis for the alternate one? Or is there a better way to check if the sensor output is constant? (By the way, I am working in python)
