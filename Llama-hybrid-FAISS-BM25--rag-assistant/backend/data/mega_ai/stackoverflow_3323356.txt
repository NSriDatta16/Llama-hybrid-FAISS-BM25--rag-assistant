Although it would be a kludge at best, if you own the code for the exception class you're interested in, you could add a static data member to that class (bool) that would be set to "true" in the constructor for objects of that class, and false in the destructor (might need to be an int that you increment/decrement instead). Then in the destructor of your RAII class, you can check std::uncaught_exception(), and if true, query the static data member in your exception class. If you get true (or > 0) back, you've got one of those exceptions--otherwise you ignore it. Not very elegant, but it would probably do the trick (as long as you don't have multiple threads).
