I can see two obvious causes for this low AUC: The labels are getting reversed. Somehow either the logistic regression or ROC analysis thinks that 0 is 1 or 1 is 0. This is the most likely explanation. Overfitting . The fact that you have p > N is a sign that it is likely to happen, even with a "simple" model like logistic regression.
