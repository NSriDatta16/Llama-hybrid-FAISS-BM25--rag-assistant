One potential fix is to remove max_iter = 12 (which would set it to the scikit learn default of max_iter=-1 ). Using such a low value can lead to bad scores as you can see from the following example: from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split from sklearn.svm import SVC from sklearn.metrics import plot_roc_curve from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer data = load_breast_cancer() X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(data.data, data.target, test_size=0.2) model = SVC(max_iter=12, probability = True) model.fit(X_train, y_train) plot_roc_curve(model, X_test, y_test) results in However, executing exactly the same code ( max_iter=12 still) again gives a totally different result: After removing max_iter=12 the code consistently produces higher AUCs around $0.95$ to $0.99$ .
