It sounds valid to me although you have to make some assumptions. Suppose there are $N$ respondants, and number them $i=1,2,\ldots,N$. Suppose there are ten fake questions and one real question (let's suppose the real question gets put last, so it is number eleven). Number questions $k=1,2,\ldots,K,K+1$. So, in this case $K=10$ and the real question is $k=11$. Denote the (real, truthful) answer of person $i$ to question $k$ as: \begin{align} Y_i^k &= \left\{ \begin{array}{l} 1 \; \text{agree}\\ 0 \; \text{disagree} \end{array} \right. \end{align} Let's call the population mean of each $Y^k$, $\mu^k$. We are interested in the population mean of $Y^{K+1}$. The mean of a dummy variable is the same as the probability that it is one which is the same, here, as the proportion of people who want a boy. Now, assume that as long as there are at least ten questions, the respondent tells the truth. Person $i$ randomized into ten questions will report $S_i = \sum_{k=1}^K Y^i_k$. The person randomized into eleven questions will report $S_i^+ = Y^{K+1}_i + \sum_{k=1}^K Y^i_k$. Let $C$ be the set of people randomized into the ten question treatment and $\#(C)$ be the number of people in set $C$. Similarly for $T$ and the eleven treatment. If the randomization is good and under the assumption of truthful reporting, we get: \begin{align} E\left(\frac{1}{\#(C)} \sum_{i \in C}S_i \right) &= E(S) = \sum_{k=1}^K \mu^k\\ E\left(\frac{1}{\#(T)} \sum_{i \in T}S^+_i \right) &= E(S^+)= \mu^{K+1}+\sum_{k=1}^K \mu^k\\ \end{align} The first equality in each line is true by the usual arguments in RCTs. I.e. they get the expectations correct for the underlying latent variables in the treatment and control arms. And that is pretty much it, the thing we are interested in, $\mu^{K+1}$ is unbiasedly estimated by the difference in those two: \begin{align} \mu^{K+1} &= E\left( \frac{1}{\#(T)} \sum_{i \in A}S^+_i -\frac{1}{\#(C)} \sum_{i \in A}S_i\right) \end{align} There is a lot going on in the truthful reporting assumption here, though. There is the obvious "maybe ten is not enough to suppress lying" thing. But there are also the usual survey issues. Maybe the first ten questions really annoyed respondents and they were feeling disagreeable by question 11. Maybe some respondents have trouble counting, remembering where they are in the count, and thinking about answering questions (this isn't trivial: 50% of people have below average IQ). Maybe this gets worse with one extra question. If the counting mistakes are biased in one direction (and why wouldn't they be?), you can get problems. One could go on in this vein for a while.
