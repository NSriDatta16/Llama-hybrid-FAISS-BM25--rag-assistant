One method that works with virtually every language is to insert instrumentation using a program transformation system. A technical paper found here: http://www.semdesigns.com/Company/Publications/TestCoverage.pdf explains how this can be done in general. My company, Semantic Designs offers, a large set of test coverage tools that provide what is called C1 coverage above (e.g, "Branch coverage") so yes it is commonly done), for different languages (C, C++, C#, Java, COBOL, PHP, all in multiple dialects).
