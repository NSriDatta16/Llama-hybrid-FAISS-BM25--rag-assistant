Capture coloured console output into WPF application

Similar to this question , except the console program being wrapped up in the WPF application produces coloured output, so it would be nice if I could capture the colour as well as the text. This is my first WPF program and I'm not sure how to go about finding/modifying the right control, currently I'm just using a TextBox which works but only captures plain text. Update: I tried using RichTextBox: richTextBox.Document.Blocks.Clear(); richTextBox.Document.Blocks.Add(new Paragraph(new Run(process.StandardOutput.ReadToEnd()))); Alas it only showed plain text.
