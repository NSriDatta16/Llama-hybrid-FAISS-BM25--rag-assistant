Yes, it is used in practice, generally in winner-take-all situation or situation where you want to assign 1 (close to) to maximum value and 0 (close to) to all others. And it is still called softmax . If you think about it, the value for $\sigma'(\mathbf{z})_K$ will be very close to 1 and value for all others will be close to 0. See this paper titled "Softmax to Softassign: Neural Network Algorithms for Combinatorial Optimization" for more information: https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anand_Rangarajan/publication/2458489_Softmax_to_Softassign_Neural_Network_Algorithms_for_Combinatorial_Optimization/links/0deec5214b1cb9dbde000000.pdf#page=6
