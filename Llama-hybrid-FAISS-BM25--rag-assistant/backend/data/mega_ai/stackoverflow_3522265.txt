Languages per se (without libraries) are suitable/comfortable for specific areas of research/investigation and/or learning/studying ("how to do the simplest things in the hardest way"). Suitability for commercial development is determined by availability of frameworks, libraries, development tools, communities of developers, adoption by companies. For ex., in internet you shall find support for any, even the most exotic issue/areas (including, of course, AI areas) , for ex., in C# because it is mainstream. BTW, what specifically is context of question? AI is so broad term. Update: Oooops, I really did not expect to draw attention and discussion to my answer. Under ("how to do the simplest things in the hardest way"), I mean that studying and learning, as well as academic R&D objectives/techniques/approaches/methodology do not coincide with objectives of (commercial) development. In student (or even academic) projects one can write tons of code which would probably require one line of code in commercial RAD (using of component/service/feature of framework or library). Because..! oooh! Because, there is no sense to entangle/develop any discussion without first agreeing on common definitions of terms... which are subjective and depend on context... and are not so easy to be formulate in general/abstract context. And this is inter-disciplinary matter of whole areas of different sciences The question is broad (philosophical) and evasively formulated... without beginning and end... having no definitive answers without of context and definitions... Are we going to develop here some spec proposal?
