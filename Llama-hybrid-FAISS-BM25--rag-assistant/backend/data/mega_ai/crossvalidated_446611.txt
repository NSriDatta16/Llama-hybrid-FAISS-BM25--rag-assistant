are you carrying out your analysis in R? I would recommend doing so, and reading the vignettes on the "vegan" package, particularly the one about "ecological diversity". https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vignettes/diversity-vegan.pdf There are a few things to consider with your analysis. Was the sampling intensity the same between your sites? i.e. does the site with 54 species have more than the other site because it is more diverse, or because you sampled it more and so captured more of the diversity. There will always be species that you did not detect (particularly with fungi), so before comparing species richness you might want to either try and estimate the total diversity of your different sites, or more conservatively, rarefy back your sampling so that the sampling intensity matches between sites. If you want to correlate fungal presence with forest health, then I would suggest building a matrix that shows the abundance of each species at each site. You can then calculate distance metrics that show the similarity, or dissimilarity, of your different sites e.g. Bray-Curtis, Jaccard etc. You can then use some of the functions in the vegan package to see whether your measures of forest health correlate with changes in the distance metric. For example, have a look at the envfit function, which fits environmental variables onto ordination diagrams of your sites (see the intro to ordination https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vignettes/intro-vegan.pdf ) By the way, you should probably not use t-tests to compare your species richness values. This is count data, so a generalized linear model (poisson family) would work better. Hope this helps, happy to answer follow up questions. p.s. I wasn't sure what you meant by your "175 samples"? Are the 'samples' soil cores, or quadrats, or something else?
