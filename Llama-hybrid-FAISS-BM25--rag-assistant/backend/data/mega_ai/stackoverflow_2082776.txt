I heard that one before. I don't know what is with java developers and always insisting that you have to write the gui by code and can't use drag and drop tools. For me I don't care if it generates unnecessary code. I personally don't think it will make that much of a difference. The only thing I would never recommend is using a designer for websites since they usually never look the way you designed it when you actually test it on a browser but for windows GUI just use a designer. I look at it this way. There might be a bit more of unnecessary code but your bosses won't care about that. They will be more concerned why your taking so much longer on something and costing the company so much more money on little to no effect to the final product. To answer your question you probably can pick up any book from java and they will have tutorials on how to make GUI's by code.
