You can look at what is known as the "marginal effect" of variables. This doesn't quite give you what you want, because all marginal effects do not sum to the probability, but it is a way to say "how much does the probability change on average when this variable changes". This is a technique that can apply to models more generally, though you typically see them used with GLMs like logistic regression because people want to do inference on the quantity. Working with your example, let's say one of our variables is a binary indicator for "Is Cloudy Outside". To compute the marginal effect of cloudiness, simple compute the average difference in predicted probabilities when all observations have the variable "Is Cloudy = 1" and when all observations have "Is Cloudy=0". Mathematically, Let $f$ be a model which produces estimated probabilities $\hat{p}$ from a given set of data $\{ (\mathbf{x}_1, w_1, y_1), \dots, (\mathbf{x}_n, y_n) \}$ . Here, $w$ is the variable for which we want to compute the marginal effect, $\mathbf{x}$ are other variables in the model, and $y$ is the label. The marginal effect would then be $$ \dfrac{1}{n} \sum f(\mathbf{x}_i, w_i=1) - f(\mathbf{x}_i, w_i=0) \>.$$ This is easy to do in code. Here is an example in R. Let's first make a problem set.seed(0) N From the code, we already know the marginal effect of $w$ , its 0.075. So on average, changing $w$ from 0 to 1 will yield a 7.5% increase in probability. Let's fit a model to these data using fit and compute the marginal effect p_w_1 [1] 0.06910256 Our estimated marginal effect of the variable $w$ is ~7%. This approach lines up with what libraries would give us library(marginaleffects) library(tidyverse) marginaleffects(fit) %>% summary() Term Effect Std.
