Note of caution when applying causal discovery This is clearly somewhat subjective and case-dependent, but let me caution you against putting too much trust in the results of causal discovery methods. This may seem discouraging, but given how gigantic and consequential the task of automated causal discovery really is, it should not come as a surprise. Having worked on causal discovery benchmarking, I'd recommend to treat the results of any causal discovery method with great caution. The field is not at a point where the methods can be trusted in real-world settings (mostly because the assumptions are not realistic). If they are applied well, they may be able to give an indication when there is no domain knowledge, but they certainly do not come close to actual domain expertise and may well do more harm than good. It is not easy to provide evidence since negative results don't tend to get published as much - so let me ask instead: Do your data match the model class of the causal discovery algorithms? Are there credible examples of successful and useful applications of causal discovery in your domain? The answers to these questions should be a useful prior on how much trust to put into your algorithmically discovered casual structures.
