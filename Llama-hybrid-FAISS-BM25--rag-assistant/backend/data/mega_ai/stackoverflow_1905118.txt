can you suggest a smaller storage size or any clever setups to store one of these three values without sacrificing any ease-of-understanding? As you mention, finding the smallest data type is moot when you can buy terabyte drives for $100. An additional table, called RATING_CODE , with two columns: RATING_CODE , pk DESCRIPTION Change your current table's rating column to be rating_code , and setup a foreign key relationship to the RATING_CODE table. Now it's easier to understand what each rating value means, because there's a description to go along with it. It's future proof, in case you want to add ratings like going up to 5 or 10.
