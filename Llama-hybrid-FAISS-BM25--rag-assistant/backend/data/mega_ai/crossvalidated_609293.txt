Predicting patients' probabilities from different classification models

Suppose I am a doctor trying to predict the probability of a patient getting a heart attack. The way I would approach this, in a clinical setting, is by using a logistic regression. For exmaple: P(HA) = 1/1+e^-(b0 + b1age + b2race + b3sex + ... + bnvariable_n). Is it possible to obtain predicted probabilites from other classification models? Say I used XGboost and it had a better performance than logistic regression for my classification. I then chose the 10 most important features in the model. I would like to obtain an equation that predicts that a patient would get a heart attack knowing their 10 characteristics ? I do not want to only classify the person, I would like to obtain a probability. The reason I am asking this is because I would like to predict the different probabilities of different combinations of characteristics of high risk groups. i.e I would like to obtain different probabilites' profiles given the different combinations of 10 characteristics. Is this possible for all following classification models (linear SVM, KNN,LDA) ?
