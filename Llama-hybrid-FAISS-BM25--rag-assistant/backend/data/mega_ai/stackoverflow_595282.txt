From Firefox Colspan Border-COllapse Bug : The obvious workaround is to just set the colspan before the DOM has finished loading, or at minimum, before the table has finished rendering. However, this requires that we clutter our otherwise clean HTML with inline tags, or have prior knowledge of the number of columns at the HTML generation stage. I hope to find a more elegant "non-invasive JavaScript" solution in the future, but at the current time I don't know of one. Simply setting the table's "display" style to "none" and then re-setting it back to "block" did not do the trick.
