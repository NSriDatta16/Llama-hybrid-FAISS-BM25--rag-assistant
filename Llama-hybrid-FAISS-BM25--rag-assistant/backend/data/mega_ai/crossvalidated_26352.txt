Interpreting positive and negative signs of the elements of PCA eigenvectors

If I center my variables and then run a PCA, do I need to interpret negative eigenvectors different than positive eigenvectors? Clarification: In my PCA I have in a component both negative and positive variables. This is probably very basic, but I've been told different things about the interpretation of the variables within a component, so I just need some clarification. Is it so that the negative values within a component moves in the same direction and the positive in the opposite? Or is it so that I should only look at the absolute values of the variables within a component?
