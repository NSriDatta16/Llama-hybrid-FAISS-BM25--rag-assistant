Utility to Create DBML

Is anyone aware of a free utility, preferably with source code, that will create a Linq-to-SQL DBML based on the contexts of a SQL Server database? I realize Visual Studio can create one, but I don't want to have to drag hundreds of tables onto the L2S canvas just to create a DBML. Thanks very much - Randy
