I think your best bet is to get good at Scala and to get visible in the Scala community. These are not necessarily the same thing but luckily they are very closely related in the Scala community. Once you do this there are definitely opportunities to use Scala for fun and profit, whether as a consultant/contractor or as a (remote) full-time employee. As part of getting better and more visible I would recommend becoming active in one of the existing communities ( Lift , Akka , ScalaNLP , you name it) or even going out in the wilderness and hacking away to solve a common problem, even if it's just making a native Scala alternative to a popular Java library (e.g. squeryl and Dispatch maybe weren't necessary but they're awesome). I guess what I'm saying is that contributing to any good, useful Scala code will be good experience and I think the ecosystem is so young that there's no need (or benefit?) to specializing in only one part of it. Of course, if there's a specific subject that Scala is useful for and/or a specific field that benefits from Scala that jumps out to you, direct your attention in that direction.
