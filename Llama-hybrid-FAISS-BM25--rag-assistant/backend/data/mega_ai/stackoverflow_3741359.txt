How can I treat many log files as one virtual file in Perl?

I've got multiple access logs in the logs directory, following the naming convention below: access.log.1284642120 access.log.1284687600 access.log.1284843260 Basically, the logs are "rotated" by Apache per day, so they can be sorted in order. I am trying to "read them one after another", so that they can be treated as one log file. my @logs = glob('logs/access.log.*'); The above code will glob all the logs, but I am not sure: In which order will the logs be organized, alphabetically? if I want to check "the latest access time from an unique IP", how could I do this? I have a Perl script that can read a single access log and check this easily (my algorithm is to have a big hash which uses IP address as the key and the access time as the value, and just keep pushing key/value pairs to it...). But I don't want to just merge all access files into one temporary file just for this process. Any suggestions? Many thanks in advance.
