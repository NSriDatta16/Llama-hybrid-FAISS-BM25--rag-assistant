See 4.3.5 Uniform of The OpenGLÂ® Shading Language specs : There is an implementation dependent limit on the amount of storage for uniforms that can be used for each type of shader and if this is exceeded it will cause a compile-time or link-time error. Uniform variables that are declared but not used do not count against this limit. It will fail at link or compile-time, but not using the program.
