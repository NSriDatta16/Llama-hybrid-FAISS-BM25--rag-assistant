This question could be just closed because it's a little unclear as the first comment indicates. However, it might be useful to have an answer that might suggest some direction. I think the answer is that it depends on the particular case. It seems likely that if one is concerned about including the previous states in the prediction, than one should choose a different overall model (maybe google time series forecasting/prediction) to begin with that includes it. Trying to tack it on after the fact probably is not an ideal approach.
