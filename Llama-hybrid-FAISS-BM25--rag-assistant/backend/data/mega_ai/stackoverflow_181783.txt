Quick answer is no. As others have noted, you can use Server.Transfer and then you can - however this is to be used with caution. It is a "server side redirect" eg. Your user is on http://mysite.com/Page1.aspx they click a button and you perform a Server.Transfer("Page2.aspx"). Page2.aspx will be rendered in their browser, but the URL will still be Page1.aspx, this can cause confusion and mess up back/forward navigation. Personally I would only use Server.Transfer as a last resort - in the world of the web, sharing data across pages generally means you need to use a storage mechanism; Cookie, QueryString, Session, Database - take your pick.
