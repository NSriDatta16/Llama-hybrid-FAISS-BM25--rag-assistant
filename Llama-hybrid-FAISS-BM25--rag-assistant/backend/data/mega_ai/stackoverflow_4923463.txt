What causes a 40 second delay when running an executable using Process.Start()?

I'm running an executable on the local file system using Process.Start() from an ASP.NET web application. This runs correctly and does what I expect it to, the problem is that it takes around 40 seconds before the exe starts after Process.Start() has been called. When I run the exe from the command line it only takes a few seconds to complete its work. Does anyone know what is causing this long delay when I use Process.Start()? Thanks in advance! Robert
