First I talk about first order difference First order difference : To run most time series regressions stationary is essential condition. If your data is not stationary then we use differencing.When we deduct present observation from it's lag it's called first order difference. To run whether MA or AR or ARMA you should first ensure stationary. Moving Average : Moving average is used when your time series suffers from auto-correlation. It is basically a regression technique in which you regress the error term of the model with its lag. If you regress it with first lag we call it MA(1). If second we call MA(2) and so on.
