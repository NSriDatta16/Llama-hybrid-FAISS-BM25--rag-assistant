Do you always have exactly two measurements? If so, you do not need to break the table at all (just have one table with two sets of columns for the two measurements). Table: ALL_THE_DATA Field: ID (int, Primary Key) Field: aNumber (int) Field: aDouble (double) Field: measuredValue1 (double) Field: standardDeviation1 (double) Field: calculatedValue1 (double) Field: weightedError1 (double) Field: measuredValue2 (double) Field: standardDeviation2 (double) Field: calculatedValue2 (double) Field: weightedError2 (double) For a non-optional 1:1 relationship between structures, embedding the child structure into the parent table is acceptable designwise and efficient. This makes it more difficult to add a third measurement type, though.
