How to organize a dataset with many attributes

I have a set of data which consists of many different types (measurable, categorical) For example: name measurable_attribute_1 categorical_attribute_1 measurable_attribute_2 categorical_attribute_2 ... Number of attributes may grows quite quickly during my study: into my spreadsheet, I can as many new entries as attribute... I have about a hundred of entries in this classification scheme, about 70 attribute, so far, and I am at the beginning of my data collection. I would like to perform statistical analysis of this data set. For example, what are the common features of the entries that have a similar categorical_attribute and this range of values of measurable_attribute. Well, I would like to generate relationships between attributes in order to create training images. However, I am not sure of how to organize the data prior to classification. Even though, should I organize the data?... (referring to this question ) Also, I can hardly gather entries into classes. I do not want to introduce any bias obviously. I am also quite new to statistical analysis (but eager to learn).
