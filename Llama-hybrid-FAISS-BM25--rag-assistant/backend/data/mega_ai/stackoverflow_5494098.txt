Simple Regular Expression that detects strings that start with a z, but not zz

I'm sorry if this sounds amateur (and for many of you this will) but I'm in a rush, and I thought I'd leverage the wonderful brains of this community rather than attempting to create and expression that does not work. I need to achieve the following in MySQL! In a certain field, if the string starts with a z, pick them up in teh SQL statement, but NOT if it's followed by another z. This only applies to the beginning (^) of the string. Case insensitive. So if the string is already "zz_fdfad" that should not be picked up, but anything with "zfda" should be picked up. Also, if the z is followed by anything other than an alpha numeric value, they should be NOT picked up (so I do NOT want results that are like "z_fdfdsa" or "z-fdfsdaa", or "z@fdfds".. you get the idea). All this while keeping in mind I need an SQL statement for this in MySQL, and it will be processed in PHP. Thank you so much!
