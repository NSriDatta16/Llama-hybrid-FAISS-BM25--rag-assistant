SVM vs. artificial neural network

I have multiclass unbalanced data (4 class with 15% 25% 45% 15% data in each class). Which method is good for classification of such data- SVM or ANN? UPDATE- Let me make the question little more general. @Dikran Marsupial said in one answer "choice of classifier depends on the nature of the particular dataset" but what are the factors that one should consider before choosing a classifier. I understand the first chose may not give best answer all the time but it can be a good starting point. So what properties of data I should consider before choosing a classifier??
