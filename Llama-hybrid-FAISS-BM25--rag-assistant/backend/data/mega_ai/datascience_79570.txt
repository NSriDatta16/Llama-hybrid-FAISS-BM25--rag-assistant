When to One-Hot encode categorical data when following Crisp-DM

I have a dataset that contains 15 categorical features (2 and 3 level factors which are non-ordinal) and 3 continuous numeric features. Seeing as most machine learning algorithms require numerical data as input features, and actually automatically One-Hot encodes them on the fly (random forest, glmnet etc.), should you not perform One-Hot encoding during data pre-processing to allow exploration of the relationship of the encoded feature data? Or is it best to rather explore relationships between raw categorical data and then only encode before running algorithms? Basically my question evolves around data exploration and data understanding, and whether this needs to be performed on the raw or encoded categorical features?
