rest + xop / binary data embedded in xml response

I've been given the task to embed binary data (like pictures, music, thumbnails etc) into a xml metadata container in order to publish the whole package via REST interface. Currently we're using Jersey and spring in our project. I really don't want to fall back to soap/wsdl (which seems to be the default answer for every ws-based problem) or any container format like zip just to get that data over the wire so i googled a while for a more appropriate solution. I found out that recommends the XOP format for embedding content into xml which is part of the MTOM protocol used in SOAP but I don't see a solution that provides XML+XOP responses via REST directly. My question : can someone give me a hint how to implement XOP + REST by using Jersey / spring? I've seen posts that imply that someone has done it before... Best regards, tim
