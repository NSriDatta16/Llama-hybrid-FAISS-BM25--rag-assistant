You need dtexec to run SSIS packages from command line. In SQL2005 Express you got dtexec and necessary tools with SQL Server 2005 Express Edition with Advanced Services Microsoft SQL Server 2005 Express Edition Toolkit However, without SQL Agent you have to use other scheduling methods. More information: http://daron.yondem.com/default.aspx?month=2006-05 Caveat: I haven't actually tried this and there are reports that dtexec just fails with a licence error. In my case, I just needed to run a dtsx once and did it with Developer edition with SQLExpress as data flow destination.
