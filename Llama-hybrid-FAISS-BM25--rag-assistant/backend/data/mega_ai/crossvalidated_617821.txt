Interpreting test results for ARCH effects in ARIMA model

I would like to ask you, how to correctly interpret different results for different number of lags in arch.test (R)? We reject the null hypothesis (homoscedasticity) up to 12th lag but after that we fail to do so. So, what does it mean that our time series looks homoscedastic (no ARCH effects) for lags=4 and 8, but for lags=12 and above result is heteroscedastic?
