Splitting comma separated email addresses in a string with commas in quotes

Say I have the following email addresses comma separated in a string: $addrList = 'Kevin.Brine@pppg.com, Robert.Thomas@pppg.com, "Guice, Doug" '; I need the following result: [0] => Kevin.Brine@pppg.com [1] => Robert.Thomas@pppg.com [2] => "Guice, Doug" Seems fairly simple, but that comma in the quoted name really has thrown me in trying to find a solution using either preg_match_all or preg_split. Also we should accommodate for emails that use single quotes for names too, ie: 'smith, tom'
