Building Oracle DB; Good Directory Layout

I'm looking for advice on how to best organize a new Oracle schema and dependent files in my project directory - with the sequences, triggers, DDL, etc. I've been using one monolothic file called schema.sql for some time, but I'm wondering if there's a best practice? Something like... database/ tables/ person.sql group.sql sequences/ person.sequence group.sequence triggers/ new_person.trigger Penny for your thoughts or a URL that I may have missed! Thank you!
