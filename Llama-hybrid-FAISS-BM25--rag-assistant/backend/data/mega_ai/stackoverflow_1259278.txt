I think its ok to have a string as PK here because the list of car manufacturers is small (200?). Even the list of carmodels is not that large (20000?). If you drill further into details then you wont be happy with string keys anymore. The list of rims/tyres per car is realy large. The problem you will have is that you can not have the Name in the URL "Alfa Romeo". To have it human friendly I would change it to "Alfa-Romeo" and have that as PK and URL, but keep the original name as readable name. The Problem gets even worse with car models. Especially the french are pretty bad at this "Renault MÃ©gane". You need to look into " Unicode decomposition " for that The think I dont like about a surrogate key for this is, that the names of the cars will not change that often, but your surrogate key will.
