for i in range(len(a)): The result will be the length of a multiplied with the average time for any index in range(len(a)) (let's ignore the break for now). if a[i] == 0 or a[i] == 1: Two accesses of the values of a , so let's add 2 * [time to retrieve a[i]] . The probability that a value of a (an element of an infinite set, ℕ) is an element of any finite set(such as {0,1}) is infinitely close to zero. Since the further code inside takes finite time, we can safely ignore it. Average case complexity: 2 len(a) [time to retrieve a[i]] ∈ Θ(len(a)) ⊂ O(len(a)) .
