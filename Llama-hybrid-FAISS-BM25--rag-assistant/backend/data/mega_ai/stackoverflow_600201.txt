Sounds like the classic conundrum :-). In Python, there's nothing dirty or shameful about choosing to use a module if that's the best approach. After all, modules, functions, and the like are, in fact, first-class citizens in the language, and offer introspection and properties that many other programming languages offer only by the use of objects. The way you've described your options, it kinda sounds like you're not too crazy about a class-based approach in this case. I don't know if you've used the Django framework, but if not, have a look at the documentation on how it handle settings. These are app-wide, they are defined in a module, and they are available globally. The way it parses the options and expose them globally is quite elegant, and you may find such an approach inspiring for your needs.
