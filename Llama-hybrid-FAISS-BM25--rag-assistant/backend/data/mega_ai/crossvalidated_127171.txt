You can use the glmnet package for fitting L1, L2 models. It's not limited to logistic regression but includes it. Here is the vignette: http://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/glmnet/glmnet_alpha.html There is also a webminar: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BU2gjoLPfDc Liblinear is good, but i've found glmnet easier to get started. Glmnet includes a function thats does cross-validation and selects a regularization parameter for you based in different metrics such as the AUC. Regarding theory, I would read the tibshiarini paper regarding lasso (L1 regularization) and the chapter in elements of statistical learning. http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/lasso/lasso.pdf About the log loss, it's just to evaluate models. It's not a loss function for model fitting.
