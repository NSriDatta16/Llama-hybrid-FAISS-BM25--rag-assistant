The sole purpose of doing an ensemble is to increase predictive performance. There is no point in trying to interpret an ensemble model as I don't see it answering any question pertaining to the data analysis that you have done. If you go to the link you will understand that interpretation is synonymous with finding meaning in something. The best model, in terms of mean average squared error is an ensemble Model What you have is an ensemble output of the outputs of two different models. This has only been done to improve performance and get better predictions. You can ask yourself : Trying to interpret an average of two quantities going to answer any necessary question? Is it going to explain any relationship among variables? I believe not.
