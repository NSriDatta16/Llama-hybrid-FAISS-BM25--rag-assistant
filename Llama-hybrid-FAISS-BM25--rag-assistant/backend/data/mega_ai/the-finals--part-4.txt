latform in opposite directions. The platform follow a set path around the arena, and will destroy any terrain in its way.The game will end when one team moves the platform towards their designated goal. If time runs out while the losing team has control, overtime is incurred where the leading team must gain control of the platform before the losing team can gain the lead. Like other quick-play game modes, Power Shift allows players to change not only their loadout but also their contestants throughout the match, and have full access to all weapons, specializations and gadgets. Loadout changes will take effect whenever a contestant respawns, but not when they are revived. Terminal Attack (Removed Indefinitely) Terminal Attack was initially a limited-time event game mode, launched on May 2, 2024. This game mode was set to end on May 22, 2024. In Terminal Attack, ten players are divided into two groups of five â€“ Attackers and Defenders. Attackers have limited time to breach insert a Decryption Key into one of two Terminals available in the arena. Meanwhile, Defenders must strategize and coordinate their defense to prevent the Attackers from achieving their objective. The teams switch sides after three rounds in a best-of-7 format. In this game mode, players cannot respawn or heal themselves, and Medium characters are unable to use their Healing Beam or Defibrillator, meaning each contestant has one life only per round, only able to regenerate a small portion of their health while out of combat. Additionally, items such as grenades or traps have limited charges and are only renewed at the start of each round. The damage dealt to the arena is persistent throughout the entire match. Terminal Attack is similar to the default modes in Valorant and Counter-Strike. On May 22, 2024, Embark announced that Terminal Attack will become a permanent game mode due to greater than expected popularity. On June 7, 2024, it was announced that in Season 3 of The Finals, Terminal Attack would replace Cashout Tournament as the main ranked mode. According to Embark, this was to give the developers time to balance Cashout without affecting the leaderboards. As of September 26, 2024, partially due to heated backlash from the fanbase, Cashout Tournament was reinstated as the main ranked gamemode, with Terminal Attack being relegated to a quick-play gamemode. As of Season 8's start on September 10, 2025, Terminal Attack has been removed from the game, and is replaced with Head-2-Head. Team Deathmatch Team Deathmatch debuted towards the end of Season 5, being a temporary gamemode brought into the game by the in-universe hacker group known as "CNS." Two teams of 5 fight in a best-of-3 format. In each round, teams must earn $3,000 (30 eliminations, $100 per elimination) to win the round, and be the first team to win 2 rounds. The gamemode returned at the beginning of Season 6 as a permanent quick play gamemode to huge positive reception by fans, mimicking the previous love of the mode during its temporary addition. Some players criticise the mode for not being directly objective but rather elimination based, yet most find the gamemode positive for the game. Head-2-Head Head-2-Head was a limited-time event game mode added on August 14 2025, and lasted until September 10 2025. The gamemode follows Tournament Cashout rules, specifically the final round of a Cashout Tournament, where two teams of three fight to earn two cashouts. Unlike the tournament modes, as a casual mode, respawn tokens are provided in unlimited quantity. During it's original run, it also featured an exclusive game show event where a kaiju-style monster throws debris around the arena, destroying terrain over time. Since season 8, Head-2-Head is a permanent new addition, replacing Terminal Attack.
