For PCA, the best axis for the projection of the points is the one who has the minimal or the maximal inertia?

I am learning statistics mainly from a book : Elements de statistique, from three author of the Brussels University. 5th Edition On the PCA chapter, however, I need to read from other sources, especially to understand how to describe what the axis represents from individual and variable analysis. I then read the whole courses that can be found everywhere over the Internet. And I have a trouble. My book wrotes : La droite qui ajuste le mieux le nuage N* des individus est celle autour de laquelle l'inertie de N* est minimale. (The line that adjusts the best the cloud N* of individuals is the one around which the inertia of N* is minimal). And the problem is : almost all other sources I can read are searching for the maximal inertia to find the best axes. I can't figure my book could be wrong (on it's 5th edition such a bug would had been found), so what is it trying to explain to me ? And why do I find the contrary elsewhere ?
