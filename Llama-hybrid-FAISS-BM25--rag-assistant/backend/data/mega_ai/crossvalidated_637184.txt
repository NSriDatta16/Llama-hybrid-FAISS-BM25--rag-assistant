Linear regression to compare proportions in different groups...?

Days ago I asked this question ( Comparing proportions inside groups...? ) and someone told me to compute a linear regression over each frequency distribution and compare the average residuals to see which one is the most directly linear relationship. Also, to compare proportions as I did, they told me to always take the arithmetic mean, not just when n >= 4. However, I have some questions about this... To do a linear regression, what would be "x" and "y" in this case? Also, for the case of the group of 3 members how would I do the arithmetic mean? Wouldn't it be just 6/2 = 3? What would it mean to do the arithmetic mean when n
