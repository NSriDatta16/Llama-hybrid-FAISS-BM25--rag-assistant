Briefly: You can check for --enable-R-shlib by looking at thethe binary of the resulting R built; on Linux I can do ldd /usr/lib/R/bin/exec/R which reveals that libR.so --- the shared R library --- is loaded by this binary. That is what other projects embedding R (RInside, littler, the R-in-Apache modules, ...) use and presumably what RSRuby would use. If you get an error 'R home directory not defined' I would start by defining the environment variable R_HOME . Edit: Regaring Question 1, on OS X, your dynamic libraries end in .dylib . So the directory listing you show clearly demonstrates that R was built with --enable-R-shlib as a compile-time option. Regarding Question 2, the very first Google hit I got for rsruby os x clearly describes how to set R_HOME on OS X (as I had told you), see https://github.com/alexgutteridge/rsruby .
