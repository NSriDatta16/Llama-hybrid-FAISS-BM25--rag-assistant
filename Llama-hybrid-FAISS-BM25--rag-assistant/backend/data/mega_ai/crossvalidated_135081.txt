No, There is no best univariate extrapolation method for a short time series with $T \leq 20$ series. Extrapolation methods need lots and lots of data. Following qualitative methods work well in practice for very short or no data: Composite forecasts Surveys Delphi method Scenario building Forecast by analogy Executive opinion One of the best methods that I know that works very well is the use of structured analogies (5th in the list above) where you look for similar/analogous products in the category that you are trying to forecast and use them to forecast short term forecasting. See this article for examples, and SAS paper on "how to" do this using of course SAS. One limitation is that forecast by analogies will work only of you have good analogies otherwise you could rely on judgemental forecasting. Here is another video from Forecastpro software on how to use a tool like Forecastpro to do forecasting by analogy. Choosing an analogy is more art than science and you need domain expertise to select analogous products/situations. Two excellent resources for short or new product forecasting: Principle of Forecasting by Armstrong New Product forecasting by Kahn The following is for illustrative purpose.I just finished reading Signal and Noise by Nate Silver, in that there is a good example on US and Japanese(analogue to US market) housing market bubble and prediction. In the chart below if you stop at 10 data points and use one of the extrapolation methods (exponential smooting/ets/arima...) and see where it takes you and where the actual ended. Again the example I presented is much more complex than simple trend extrapolation. This is just to highlight the risks of trend extrapolation using limited data points. In addition if your product has seasonal pattern, you have to use some form of analogous products situation to forecast. I read an article I think in Journal of Business research that if you have 13 week of product sales in pharmaceuticals, you could predict data with greater accuracy using analogous products.
