If you ship an MDE/ACCDE you can't update your references. But what specific references are causing you your problems? Chances are you are referencing Word, Excel or Outlook. If so use late binding so your solution doesn't matter what version is installed on the client system. Late binding means you can safely remove the reference and only have an error when the app executes lines of code in question. Rather than erroring out while starting up the app and not allowing the users in the app at all. Or when hitting a mid, left or trim function call. This also is very useful when you don't know what version of the external application will reside on the target system. Or if your organization is in the middle of moving from one version to another. For more information including additional text and some detailed links see the " Late Binding in Microsoft Access " page.
