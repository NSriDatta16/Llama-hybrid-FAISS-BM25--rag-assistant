I wouldn't highly recommend this, but the other option is to alter the window.name property. You can save some minor bits of data here, then retrieve them on the next page load. Pros: Quick-n-dirty, but works Cons: Messes up any window references for popups/child iframes Since its a "hack", browser vendors may break this "feature" in the future Of course if you can exclude all the old browsers, then use Global/Client Session Storage !
