Modeling prices with the Hedonic regression

I'm using the concept of Hedonic regression in order to model the prices for real estates. I'm having some trouble with my approach. What I have and what I do my data consists out of real estates with following charcteristics: price | livingArea | propertyArea | condoFloorNumber | roomCount | elevator | garage | quiet | etc. I run a robust regression without intercept lmRob(price ~ . -1) What I want a model with which I can predict the price of real estates, but which are not in the used data set also it would be nice to have some constraints on the coefficients Problems very often I get bad values for the coefficients ex: bathroomCount = -80000 . it's not possible that with a additive bathroom , the price of the house will sink with 80.000€ also I tried to use the function pcls in order to put some constraints on the coefficients, but this method gave very bad results. In the plot Y = price and X = livingArea . as you can see, the regression line isn't correct. another thought was to transform the regression problem into a maximization or minimization problem, but didn't managed to do it also I tried to use different regression methods lm, lmrob, ltsReg, MARS , but they also give me bad coefficients. (sometimes this bad coefficients make a good price estimation) I think that the big number of dummy variables damages a little bit the regression Is my approach false? Does someone have some hints, tricks for me? ( I'm not a statistician ) [UPDATE] This is how the plotted data looks like. LivingArea is the only non-dummy variable. [UPDATE 2] y = bX means y = b_0*X_0 + b_1*X_1 + ... + b_k*X_k which is an equation system like this: y[0] = b_0*X_0[0] + b_1*X_1[0] + ... + b_k*X_k[0] . . . y[n] = b_0*X_0[n] + b_1*X_1[n] + ... + b_k*X_k[n] Did I got it right? If so, isn't possible to add some inequality constraints equation to it. example: b_0 >= 2000 b_2 [UPDATE 3] I'm running the regression without intercept, because if all the characteristics of a real estate = 0, then of course it'S price = 0. Nobody would pay for an apartment with 0m². but it seems that the regression line where it was used an intercept (blue) looks far more better than the regression line without intercept (green). I can't understand why it is so. and why doesn't the regression line without intercept start at the point (0,0)?
