Yeah, like this: (1-5.857) + (9-5.857) + (8-5.857) + (9-5.857) + (9-5.857) + (1-5.857) + (4-5.857) = .000999. What you're not understanding about the formula is its context. Here's the full paragraph you cite: "The method starts by searching for every distinct values of all its predictors, and splitting the value of a predictor that minimizes the following statistic (other regression tree models have different optimization criteria): SSE=∑i∈S1(yi−y1¯)+∑i∈S2(yi−y2¯)SSE=∑i∈S1(yi−y1¯)+∑i∈S2(yi−y2¯) where y1¯ and y2¯ are the average values of the dependent variable in groups S1 and S2." The formula here measures a type of variance (because it sums the difference between the average and each item). The overall goal of the regression tree is to minimize variance (and determine relative strength of factors), by recursively selecting whichever split will lead to the greatest reduction in variance. Other models use standard deviation [sqr rt of (∑i∈S(y−y¯)/(n - 1)] instead, like this one: http://www.saedsayad.com/decision_tree_reg.htm (which you've probably already read, as it was one of the answers to the question on Quora) Hope this is sorta helpful.
