There are really two parts to this question: 1) How to standardize variables with different non-Gaussian distributions to make their values comparable , and 2) How to combine these standardized values into a single index? For the second part, something like PCA would be recommended, to prevent "double counting" where the measures are correlated. Peter's answer addresses this issue. In terms of the first part, a common approach is to essentially use quantiles/percentiles. These can be converted to equivalent "z-scores", in which case this technique is sometimes called the normal score transform . In the simplest version of this, for each variable you estimate quantiles from the Empirical distribution function . (More broadly, you could use any parametric or non-parametric approach to estimate the CDF.) The variables will then be in "comparable units", each approximately uniformly distributed. In the second step, you transform these to approximately normal by putting through the inverse normal CDF function to get the z-scores corresponding to those quantiles. This second step is optional, but can be useful if you want to "treat the variables as Gaussian" for subsequent analyses (e.g. PCA or least-squares more generally is most well suited for Gaussian variables).
