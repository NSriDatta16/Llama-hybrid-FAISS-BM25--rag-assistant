PCA is a decomposition process. Meaning it takes an existing vector space and transforms it into another vector space. If i understand correctly, you chose the first N components of the transformed vector space. If N is lower than the original vector space shape(number of features) then the explained variance might be lower than 100% and can basically range from 0-100. It you used a specific package for the PCA, you can change the explained variance by setting the hyper-parameter(n_components in Sklrean.PCA) to something different. Another thing to consider, explained variance lower than 50% is not that bad, depending on your thoughts on how good the features describe your problem domain.
