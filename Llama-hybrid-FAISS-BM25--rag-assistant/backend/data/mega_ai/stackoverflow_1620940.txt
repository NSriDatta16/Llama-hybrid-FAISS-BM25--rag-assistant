Determining neighbours of cell two dimensional list

I have a list of lists, something like [[1, 2, 3,],[4, 5, 6,],[7, 8, 9]] . Represented graphically as: 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 I'm looking for an elegant approach to check the value of neighbours of a cell, horizontally, vertically and diagonally. For instance, the neighbours of [0][2] are [0][1], [1][1] and [1][2] or the numbers 2, 5, 6. Now I realise, I could just do a bruteforce attack checking every value a la: [i-1][j] [i][j-1] [i-1][j-1] [i+1][j] [i][j+1] [i+1][j+1] [i+1][j-1] [i-1][j+1] But thats easy, and I figured I can learn more by seeing some more elegant approaches.
