Which multi-axes, multi-scale plotting tool to use?

I am looking for plotting tools capable of using more than one or two vertical axes with different scales, like for instance: (source: mathworks.com ) The goal is to plot several time series with different ranges in a same plot. For instance, I could have: Time series 1 with range [-1, 1] Time series 2 with range [-10, +10] Time series 3 with range [0, 1500] Time series 4 with range [0.5, 0.9] Ideally I could plot each time series in its own axis with its own range, as shown in the image. Which tools or libraries do you know that can do this? Note: this question is related to this one , but I'm looking for more possibilities than Matlab.
