Routine to keep names of methods, classes and functions organized?

I am working on a web application with a couple of colleagues for the moment. It have turned out that we all have our own way of naming the classes, methods or whatever functions that we currently are writing. This is starting to get really annoying already so I know that we have a iceberg ahead if we continue like this. Obviously the best way is to find one routine and stick to it - but how should that specific routine look? - What is common sense when naming pieces, objects, functions or whatever? Are there any standards out there? Thanks a lot!
