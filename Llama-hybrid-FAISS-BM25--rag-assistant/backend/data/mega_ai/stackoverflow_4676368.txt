Is a Captcha and a math question enough for SPAM prevention?

One of my websites gets a ton of registration spam. I have a Captcha and a math question on the registration form but it doesn't seem to help much. Am I likely experiencing manual spammers or are my prevention mechanisms not good enough? The registration form is here: http://peaksoverpoverty.org/wp-signup.php Update I've been tracking behavior a bit closer over the past week and this is what a typical request looks like in the access logs: 174.132.130.194 - - [18/Jan/2011:07:24:55 -0600] "GET / HTTP/1.1" 302 20 "http://peaksoverpoverty.org/wp-signup.php" "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 8.0; Windows NT 6.1; Trident/4.0; SLCC2; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.5.30729; .NET CLR 3.0.30729; Media Center PC 6.0; .NET CLR 3.0.04506; Media Center PC 5.0; SLCC1; Tablet PC 2.0)" After poking around a bit, the user agent string doesn't necessarily look malicious - this tool was able to explain the entire string. Then again, I haven't ever really stared at user agent strings for a long time. I know they can easily be spoofed, but this is what the spammers are sending. Also this is a list of offending IP addresses I have gathered over the past week and blocked: 174.120.203.66 174.120.245.194 174.122.107.138 174.122.175.162 174.123.101.98 174.132.130.194 174.142.241.137 175.41.168.169 184.154.74.21 187.63.208.241 195.56.42.131 199.16.130.53 200.17.56.7 201.22.130.66 201.59.175.2 201.59.175.29 205.186.184.10 208.100.27.143 208.100.27.154 208.100.27.159 208.100.27.186 208.101.30.165 208.43.73.29 209.151.224.235 209.151.224.240 212.227.119.47 213.251.189.204 213.251.189.205 216.108.225.220 216.108.225.242 220.181.94.212 222.237.79.242 24.252.62.57 62.215.5.66 64.22.89.70 66.172.42.11 66.232.112.144 66.232.112.168 66.249.71.217 66.96.219.38 67.109.124.170 67.18.19.194 67.18.5.2 67.18.72.2 67.225.184.5 69.117.20.174 69.117.22.237 69.117.24.21 69.117.26.195 69.147.240.90 69.147.249.161 69.147.249.22 69.147.249.99 69.167.175.27 69.28.58.35 69.56.228.130 69.89.31.240 71.208.210.208 72.18.157.147 74.220.215.68 74.53.28.2 74.54.131.82 74.54.95.210 77.235.37.41 79.125.33.136 79.172.242.144 80.252.171.68 82.80.235.146 84.16.243.243 85.17.199.46 85.214.92.15 85.92.83.164 86.196.41.15 86.208.68.211 88.191.126.212 88.208.33.130 90.18.14.167 90.47.218.215 90.59.74.139 91.121.203.226 91.184.49.210 91.207.254.234 93.174.95.153 94.125.27.20 95.133.38.238 It seems like the attackers are providing fairly dynamic IP addresses. Any further thoughts would be great. I'm really starting to think these are manual attacks but still not 100% sure because I've never dealt with a spam issue this bad.
