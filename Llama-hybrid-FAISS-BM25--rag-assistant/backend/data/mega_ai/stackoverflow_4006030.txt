Is it unrealistic for me to expect it to get the correct column type? No, it's not unrealistic and the current result is clearly unexpected. Am I using it wrong, or do I have the wrong expectations? Your mappings doesn't look wrong. Could you just try the following and confirm that you get the same result (I'm simply omitting the referencedColumnName that you should not have to define anyway)? @Entity @Table( name = "contract" ) @SequenceGenerator( name = "CONTRACT_SEQ_GEN", sequenceName = "CONTRACT_SEQUENCE" ) public class Contract implements DataObject { @Id @GeneratedValue( strategy = GenerationType.SEQUENCE, generator = "CONTRACT_SEQ_GEN" ) private Long key; ... @ManyToOne( optional=false ) @JoinColumn( name="organization_key" ) private Organization organization; ... } I don't have PostgreSQL installed, can't try myself. Is it expected for me to have to use the columnDefinition each time? No.
