Here is an attempt at visualizing the password strength data by following the "less is more" principle. The idea is simple: Create five strength categories: "very weak [0-4]", "weak [5-6]", "medium [7-8]", "strong [9-10]", "very strong [11+]". I came up with these groups by looking at the histogram of strength values but you might have a better idea for how to split the numeric range of strength into bins. The "very strong" passwords are the "outliers". Make a bar plot for each password category. Order the bar plots by increasing average strength. For comparison (and since otherwise there is a gap in the 3x4 grid of panels by password category) I add the overall bar plot as well. This visual has a lot less detail than those proposed by @NickCox and @GeorgeSavva but it's easier (at least for me) to compare the password categories qualitatively. For example: "food" is the worst choice as it never results in a strong password. "simple-alphanumeric" is the second worst choice because it's risky: it can generate a (very) strong password but many choices are very weak. NB: The alphanumeric password "abc123" has strength 32 but I have doubts that it's a good password choice. "rebellious-rude", "name", "cool-macho" and "sport" are mostly medium strength. "nerdy-pop" is the safest choice.
