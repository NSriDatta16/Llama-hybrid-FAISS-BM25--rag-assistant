Data binding with XML linq

I have spent literally hours searching for how to do this and unfortunatly being a C# novice cannot work out how to do this although im sure its pretty simple. I am trying to grab the data I have stored in XML and bind it to a list. I was currently using the foreach method and just adding items to the listbox using the code but this seems inefficient and a bit clumsey when you want to store as much as I do. I'm using the following code to retreive items from IO at current: using (IsolatedStorageFile storage = IsolatedStorageFile.GetUserStoreForApplication()) { foreach (string items in storage.GetFileNames("*.item")) { XElement _xml; IsolatedStorageFileStream location = new IsolatedStorageFileStream(items, System.IO.FileMode.Open, storage); System.IO.StreamReader file = new System.IO.StreamReader(location); _xml = XElement.Parse(file.ReadToEnd()); XAttribute att = _xml.Attribute("att"); Thanks in advance!
