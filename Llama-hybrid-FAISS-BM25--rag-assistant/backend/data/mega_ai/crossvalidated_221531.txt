If you are fitting a logistic regression model, the parameters are usually reported as odds ratios. One can show that the odds ratio for independent variable $i$ is given by $e^{\beta_i}$. Thus, if $\beta_i=0$, then $e^{\beta_i}=e^0=1$. An odds ratio of 1 indicates no effect of that independent variable on the dependent variable, just like a coefficient of 0 would indicate no effect of that independent variable on the dependent variable in a linear regression model. Thus for any estimate where $p>0.05$, your confidence interval should contain 1; whether or not the interval contains 0 is of no relevance when assessing the significance of a predictor in a logistic regression model. Confidence intervals for $\beta_i$ are of the form $\beta_i\pm t^*_{df}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}$, but if your estimates are reported as odds ratios (i.e. $e^{\beta_i}$), then your intervals will likely be reported in the form $e^{\beta_i\pm t^*_{df}\frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}}$. Since we're taking $\beta_i$ and adding or subtracting a constant, then exponentiating the result, your confidence interval is going to be lopsided - that is, your estimate $e^\hat{\beta_i}$ will not be exactly in the middle of your confidence interval. In order to check whether or not your estimates and intervals are provided in odds ratio form, you should try taking the natural log of each estimate, generating the confidence intervals using $z$ or $t$ (whichever you feel is appropriate), and exponentiate both sides to get your confidence interval. As for using 1.96 versus the critical $t$-value, you are correct in that it will depend on your sample size. I would err on the side of caution and use the $t$-distribution rather than the $z$-distribution to find the answer. I would imagine that this is simply an issue within the package.
