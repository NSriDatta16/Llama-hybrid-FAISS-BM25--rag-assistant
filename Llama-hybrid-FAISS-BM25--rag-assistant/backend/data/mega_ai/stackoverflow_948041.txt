silverlight isolatedstorage security implications

I have a LOB application in SL, one of the aims is to save partially entered data to persist user's state. for example, you start adding a new employee to system, close the browser (or it crashes), next time you open the browser, you have whatever data you had entered before. the saving and loading is easy, I was wondering if there is already a best practice for securing the data, considering both encryption and decryption happen on the same machine and same code, it looks a bit tricky...
