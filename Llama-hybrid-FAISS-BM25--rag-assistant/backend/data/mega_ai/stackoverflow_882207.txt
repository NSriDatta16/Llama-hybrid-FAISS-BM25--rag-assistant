Project's documentation when dealing with lots of business-logic rules. How to organize it?

I'm working on quite complicated project, in terms of business-logic quantity and quantity of components. Each developer mostly works on "his own" component. I understand that this isn't very cross-functional, but it is impossible to know every components' details. Team sostav changes from time to time. So we have situations when one person have to work on "other person's component". And this can be on periodic basement, so you can come back to the issue a month later - in that moments you can ask component business-logic's owner the same questions again and again, because you simply can forget some tiny but important details a month later. This situation is annoying sometimes. We have daily stand-up meetings , when person tells about what he has done and going to do. We have project's wiki F.A.Q. page - we extract the most frequently asked questions. What do you think about the problem? And how would you recommend us to solve it?
