can tree-based models extrapolate with categorical independent variables

I am aware of the fact that tree-based (machine learning) models struggle to extrapolate - see regression example here . I am only familiar with the concept of extrapolation for numeric independent variables. AFIK whether an independent variable is numeric or categorical, does not really matter for tree-based models. So can I conclude, that tree-based models can also not extrapolate for categorical independent variables? Which model can extrapolate for categorical independent variables, if this concept actually exist for categorical independent variables?
