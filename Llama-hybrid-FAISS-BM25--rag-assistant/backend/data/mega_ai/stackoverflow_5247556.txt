You need to join the table to itself, so that you have a result set containing every combination of two rows (for a given transaction_id ) and then select out the combinations you want e.g. SELECT COUNT(*) FROM crm_purchases cp1 JOIN crm_purchases cp2 USING (transaction_id) WHERE cp1.product_id = 123 AND cp2.product_id = 12; I encourage you to try the query without the COUNT or WHERE (on a small dataset!) so that you can see what it's actually doing.
