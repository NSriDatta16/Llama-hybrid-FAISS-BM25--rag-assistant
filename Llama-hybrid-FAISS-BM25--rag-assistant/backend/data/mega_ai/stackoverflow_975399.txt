Are there any demerit if I use JSON as the storage mechanism, for storing ID/password information?

I asked for PHP login system and I got answers, lots of files tactics * aaa.txt(content is aaa-pass) * bbb.txt(content is bbb-pass) * and scandir. XML CSV MySQL SQLite PEAR::AUTH But no one mentioned about JSON. but I feel JSON is the best way for me. Because it looks easy , and PHP has JSON dedicated built-in function. So I am considering to choose JSON for my login system, but I want to confirm that there is any demerit if I use JSON for my login script. Anyone have any opinions?
