GLMM for count data using square root link in lme4

I have data from a field survey. The objective of the study is to relate number of seedling (respond variable, count data), landform (exploratory variable, categorical variable with 3 levels) and percent canopy coverage (exploratory variable, quantitative). In each habitat, I have data from five 25x25 meter plots. Within each plot I used three 2x2 meter subplots nested within the bigger plot, and number of seedlings were count from these subplots. Total number of observations is 60; 20 plots x 3 subplots. Only one kind of landform contained seedlings. Other two landforms contained no seedlings, so they are empty plots. the data looks like this: data.frame': 60 obs. of 5 variables: $ plot : Factor w/ 20 levels "HD2","LC1","LC2",..: 16 16 16 17 17 17 12 12 12 9 ... $ subplot : Factor w/ 60 levels "HD2.1","HD2.2",..: 46 47 48 49 50 51 34 35 36 25 ... $ av.canopy : num 92.2 92.2 92.2 92.3 92.3 ... $ landform : Factor w/ 3 levels "abandoned","ridge",..: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 ... $ seedling.2016: int 6 7 5 2 5 4 4 6 4 0 ... The problem is when I compared number of seedlings between landforms using this code: seedling The result does not make sense for me-there were no any significant different between landforms event there is only one landform (ridge) that has seedlings, while other had no seedlings at al. It is also note that SEs are enormous. The result looks like this: Generalized linear mixed model fit by maximum likelihood (Laplace Approximation) ['glmerMod'] Family: poisson ( log ) Formula: seedling.2016 ~ landform + (1 | plot) Data: streblus.subplots AIC BIC logLik deviance df.resid 294.9 303.3 -143.5 286.9 56 Scaled residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -6.3619 -0.0001 -0.0001 0.0000 8.7305 Random effects: Groups Name Variance Std.Dev. plot (Intercept) 2.637 1.624 Number of obs: 60, groups: plot, 20 Fixed effects: Estimate Std.

My question is: Is it valid in term of statistics to use square root link with Poisson distribution, there are any better methods available with better ground of statistics?
