200K times 50 values is not a huge table. Don't worry about performance until you have such things as ease of use and freedom from self contradiction under control. There are a variety of reasons to decompose a table. Decomposing a table means splitting it into two or more tables with most columns going into only one table, and other columns going into more than one table (foreign keys). Farell mentioned mormalization. The primary benefit to normalization is that it precludes certain kinds of update anomalies, including ones that allow contradictory facts to be stored in the same table. Storage benefits are secondary. Performance benefits, if present, are likely to be minor. Having said that, normalization is the most important thing you can learn about table design. If you violate normalization rules without understanding the consequences, you're flying blind. If I were introduced to a database table with 40 columns or more and there were any kind of problem in the databse (performance, corruption, or whatever), I'd look into whether that table can be further normalized, and what are the cost/benfits of doing so. There are a variety of reasons to partition a table. As Reinerpost said, don't start worrying about partions until you've got normalization under control.
