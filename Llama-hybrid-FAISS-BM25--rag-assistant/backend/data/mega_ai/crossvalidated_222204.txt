Derivation of autoencoders in backpropagation

I'm following the basics of autoencoders here: http://ufldl.stanford.edu/wiki/index.php/Autoencoders_and_Sparsity Here are some of the important parts: But I don't understand the last part: Why is the backpropagation equation modified like that? Can anyone help me ? I'm not really good with math, although I have been trying a lot :( . Thank you very much
