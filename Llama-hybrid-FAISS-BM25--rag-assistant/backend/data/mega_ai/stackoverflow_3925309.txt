Is this googlebot or someone trying to impersonate googlebot?

On my elmah exceptions i keep getting exceptions of what appears to be googlebot but what I imagine is someone impersonating themselves trying to download what appears to be wares and other dodgy software from my server. Here are just a few of the attempts and the software they are trying to get. The controller for path '/download/msjavx86.exe' was not found /downloads/IEZawGyiGtalkfont.EXE' /downloads/alphazawgyiremover.exe /downloads/gtalkmyanmaraddinremover.exe' /cgi-bin/irbis32r/cgiirbis_32.exe /ticker/MBISetup.exe' The user agent and remote host are always the same REMOTE_HOST 66.249.65.163 HTTP_USER_AGENT Mozilla/5.0 (compatible; Googlebot/2.1; +http://www.google.com/bot.html) So my question is, is this googlebot searching for malware , or someone having a go at my server ??
