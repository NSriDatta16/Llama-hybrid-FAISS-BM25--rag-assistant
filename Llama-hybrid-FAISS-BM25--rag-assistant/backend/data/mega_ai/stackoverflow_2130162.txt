Can a signed Java Applet/Web Start manipulate content in a cross-site IFRAME?

Is it possible for a signed Java Applet or Web Start app to write to the DOM of an IFRAME under a different domain? Does the fact that they're a signed applet/javaws allow them to ignore browsers' standard cross-browser security? If this does work, how well is it supported across the major browsers? Thanks! EDIT : My motivation is to add a browser plugin-like tool to third-party websites I don't control. It's not required that I use Java at all---any ideas or suggestions are encouraged.
