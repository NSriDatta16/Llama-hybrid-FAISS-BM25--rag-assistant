I agree with Philip, use SQL Agent. Since I didn't want to give two separate comments to the other posts, I'll post as answer instead. Mixing the OS scheduling (at, schtask) with SQL operations is riddled with problems. It makes administering and troubleshooting the deployment unnecessary difficult. The OS schedulers don't follow SQL in event of a failover (clustering or mirroring). They don't participate in the system backup and restore strategy. They have a separate administrative toolset meaning the admins have to know to look for them. They are not found when searching for dependencies. And so on and so forth. Since SQL Server comes with such a rich job scheduling tool as Agent, which has been around for a while and the know-how around how to us it is just abundant, there's really no reason to turn to at.exe and its baby cousin. The only place when the OS schedulers are even worth considering is when Agent is not available: Express deployments. For them I prefer using timers since they are persisted in the database so they play better with the backup/restore scenarios, but I concede that the OS schedulers are a valid choice too. Again, only for Express.
