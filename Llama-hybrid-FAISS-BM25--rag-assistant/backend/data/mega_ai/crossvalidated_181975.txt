How can you interpert the percent of variance explained by additional values with Nagelkerke's r^2

I have Nagelkerke's R^2 for two Poisson regression models, model A contains several predictors while model B contains all the predictors of A plus a couple extra. Would it be correct to say that the proportion of variance explained in B beyond what is explained in A is equal to $1-(1-R^2_B)/(1-R^2_A)$ based on property iv of this paper ? In addition, is Nagelkerke's R^2 appropriate for all GLM models or just logistic regression?
