Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on

I get the following error Cross-thread operation not valid: Control accessed from a thread other than the thread it was created on. This is a callback from a wcf. I have a textBox and I need to update the value and appendtext to it. This value is coming back from another thread and updates the UI. public CarStatus CarState { get { return _carState; } set { _carState;= value; CarStatus tmpCarState;=null; if (txtResult.InvokeRequired) { txtResult.Invoke(new MethodInvoker(() => { tmpCarState;=null;= _carState;})); } txtResult.AppendText(string.Format("Car status is: {0}{1}", tmpCarState, Environment.NewLine)); } the following crashes!!
