Batch processing in a neural network

I am trying to understand how each batch is processed in a neural network. I understand that if we have a training set $X=\{x_1,...,x_{|X|}\}$ and we specify a batch size of $n$ than the neural network will process $n$ entries of $X$ at a time: $\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ , $\{x_{n+1},...,x_{2n}\}$ ,... What I fail to understand is what actually happens at each batch iteration. If I have the vectors $X$ and $Y$ for training, where for each $x_i\in X$ we have a corresponding value for expected prediction $y_i\in Y$ and a batch size of $n$ , does this mean that the training iteration will associate the sequence $\{x_1,...,x_n\}$ to $y_n$ only? If so, does this mean that the values $\{y_1,...,y_{n-1}\}$ are dismissed? Or is the training process associating each $x_i$ to each $y_i$ and then average the result to $n$ ? If the latter is true, then why is it so much slower for smaller values of $n$ ?
