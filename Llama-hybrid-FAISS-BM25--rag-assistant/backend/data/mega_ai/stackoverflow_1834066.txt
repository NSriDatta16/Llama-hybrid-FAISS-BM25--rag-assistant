pl/sql: converting xmltype to node

I am trying to put together an XML document from several pieces. To get the data, I had several queries whose results were XMLTypes. I found a function named getNodeFromFragment in the xmldom package that looked like it could take these XMLTypes and return a DOMNode that contained them, but it doesn't seem to work. Simple example here: set serveroutput on; declare node xmldom.DOMNode; node2 xmldom.DOMNode; doc_node xmldom.DOMNode; doc xmldom.DOMDocument; el xmldom.DOMElement; buf varchar2(1000); begin doc := xmldom.newDOMDocument; el := xmldom.createElement(doc => doc, tagName => 'test'); node := xmldom.makeNode(elem => el); xmldom.writeToBuffer(node, buf); dbms_output.put_line('buffer: '||buf); node := dbms_xmldom.getNodeFromFragment(XMLType(' soemthing somethingelse ')); xmldom.writeToBuffer(node, buf); dbms_output.put_line('buffer: '||buf); end; / Printing the element works fine, but when I try to print the fragment as a node, nothing is output. Any tips on getNodeFromFragment?
