It's important to understand the difference between Browser Mode and Document Mode. Document Mode is under the control of the document. Setting the X-UA-Compatible or DocType controls the Document Mode. Browser Mode is NOT under the control of the document, and affects the User-Agent String and Conditional Comments/Version Vector. Browser Mode is controlled by the user's Compatibility View settings, and the URL of the document. If the document is on your Intranet, for instance, by default it is in the Compatibility Browser Mode. This can be disabled by clicking Tools > Compatibility View Settings > and unticking "Display Intranet Sites in Compatibility View." You can see (and temporarily override) both modes in the IE Developer Tools (hit F12).
