jquery - referencing a jquery object

So I'm using the ui library, and I have something like: $('#trash-bin').droppable({ tolerance: 'touch', drop: function(event, ui) { alert(ui.draggable.id + " was dropped"); } }); $('#images').draggable({}); Which I know is wrong (the alert says "undefined dropped") How can I reference the image's id that was dropped?
