They do agree. One deals with a probability of $p=0.5$ . The other deals with a log-odds of $0$ . $$ \log\bigg(\dfrac{p}{1-p}\bigg)=\log(1)=0 $$ Importantly, though, logistic regression alone is not a classification method, thereâ€™s nothing special about using $0.5$ probability as a cutoff threshold, and methods like logistic regression are best-evaluated on their probability outputs rather than threshold-based metrics (e.g., accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1 score). https://www.fharrell.com/post/class-damage/ https://www.fharrell.com/post/classification/ https://stats.stackexchange.com/a/359936/247274 Proper scoring rule when there is a decision to make (e.g. spam vs ham email)
