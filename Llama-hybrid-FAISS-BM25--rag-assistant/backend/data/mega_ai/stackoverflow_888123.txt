Unique identification of a certain computer

i have following scenario and can't seem to find anything on the net, or maybe i am looking for the wrong thing: i am working on a webbased data storage system. there are different users and different places and only certain users are allowed to access certain parts of the system. now, we do not want them to connect to these parts from at home or with a different computer than they are using at their work-place (there are different reasons for that). now my question is: if there is a way to have the work-place-pc identify itself to the server in some way over the browser, how can i do that? oh and yes, it is supposed to be webbased. i hope i explained it so everyone understands. thnx for your replies in advance. ... dg
