Assuming you are looking for P(A) at any given time at least 5 steps into the sequence, then it is simply $p^5$ , 5 consecutive events of probability, p. As to how to estimate P(A) via simulation, I would have a computer generate a sequence of some length, say 1,000,004. Then I would have the computer count the number of 5-in-row sequences of zero. Note that a sequence of M zeros (M>5) would actually entail a quantity of (M-4) 5-zero sequences. Example 0100000011100000 would have 3 sequences (the final 5 zeros plus two 5-zero sequences in the 6-zero sequence). Then divide that count by (length-4). In the contrived example $\hat{P(A)} = \frac{3}{16-4} = \frac{3}{12} = \frac{1}{4}$ An interesting check would be to estimate p as well. For that just divide total 0s over the length. In the above example, $\hat{p}=\frac{12}{16}=\frac{3}{4}$ How well do these agree? $\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^5 \approx 0.237$ , which is not too far from 0.25 (above). If they disagreed too significantly it might suggest that the sequence is not sufficiently random (or just not long enough for things to average out).
