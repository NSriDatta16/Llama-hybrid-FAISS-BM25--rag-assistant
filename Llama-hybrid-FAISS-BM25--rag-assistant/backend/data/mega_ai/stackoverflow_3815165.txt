How to implement Bitcount using only Bitwise operators?

The task is to implement a bit count logic using only bitwise operators. I got it working fine, but am wondering if someone can suggest a more elegant approach. Only Bitwise ops are allowed. No "if", "for" etc int x = 4; printf("%d\n", x & 0x1); printf("%d\n", (x >> 1) & 0x1); printf("%d\n", (x >> 2) & 0x1); printf("%d\n", (x >> 3) & 0x1); Thank you.
