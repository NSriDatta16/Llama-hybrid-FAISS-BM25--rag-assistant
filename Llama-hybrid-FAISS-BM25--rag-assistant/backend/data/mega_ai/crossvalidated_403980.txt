The $i$ th residual is $y_i-\hat{y}_i$ , and it has variance $(1-h_{ii})\sigma^2$ (see Leverages and effect of leverage points for this and other algebra used here) so dividing by $\sqrt{1-h_{ii}}$ we get a constant variance: $$ \DeclareMathOperator{\V}{\mathbb{V}} \V \frac{y_i-\hat{y}_i}{\sqrt{1-h_{ii}}} = \frac1{1-h_{ii}} \sigma^2 (1-h_{ii})=\sigma^2 $$ so the variance is indeed constant. So I suspect the squares in the summation should not include also the denominator, or there is missing a square root. This is related to the concept of a studentized residual , see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Studentized_residual .
