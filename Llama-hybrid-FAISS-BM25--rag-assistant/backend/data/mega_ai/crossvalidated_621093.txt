Is there a connection between sample quantile distribution and Gaussian processes?

It is known that sample quantiles from any distribution are Gaussian-distributed: $\sqrt{n} (X_{[np]} - q_p) \sim \mathcal{N}(0, \frac{p(1-p)}{(F'(q_p))^2 })$ Here sample size is $n$ , $X_{(np)}$ is the order statistic number $[np]$ (sorted ascending), $q_p$ is the real quantile of level $p$ , $F$ is the distribution function. Order statistic $X_{(np)}$ serves as a sample quantile. We also know that if we take sample quantiles of several levels (e.g. two levels, $p_1$ and $p_2$ ), they have a multivariate normal distribution with covariations $Cov(X_{[np_1]}, X_{[np_2]}) = \frac{p_1 (1-p_2)}{n F'(q_{p_1}) F'(q_{p_2})}$ . Does this multi-variate approach give rise to Guassian processes? If we consider $k$ sample quantiles, where $k \to \infty$ , we can think of them as of a Gaussian random vector. With $k \to \infty$ , this random vectors converge to a realisation of a Gaussian stochastic process with covariance matrix defined above. Is this a valid approach to derive Gaussian processes, alternative to Bayesian kernel ridge regression?
