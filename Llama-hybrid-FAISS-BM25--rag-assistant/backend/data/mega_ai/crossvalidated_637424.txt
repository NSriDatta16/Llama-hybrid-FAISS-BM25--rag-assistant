Using Cramer's V to find which variable has the strongest correlation

Apologies in advance if this has been asked before; I'm a stats amateur and wasn't having much luck with my searches. I'm currently analyzing product data, and I'm trying to find which variables (all nominal categorical) are most strongly associated with conversion from trial product to sold product. To elaborate a bit more: in the trial product, there are certain actions that the user can complete, and I want to see which of these completed actions has the strongest correlation with the product selling. I already used a Chi-square Test of Association to confirm that there is indeed a correlation between each action being completed and the product selling, but I now want to be able to compare each action and see which one has the strongest correlation, so that I can form hypotheses about which may be most beneficial to encourage the user to complete. Would finding the Cramer's V for each action and then comparing these values be a valid way to answer this question? In other words, if one variable has a higher Cramer's V value than another variable in the same dataset, then is it correct to conclude that this variable has a stronger correlation with the outcome than the other?
