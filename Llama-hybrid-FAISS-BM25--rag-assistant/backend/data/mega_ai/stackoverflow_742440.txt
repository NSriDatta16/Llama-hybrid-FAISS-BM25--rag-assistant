Tagging unit-tests

I'm working on a PHP project with solid unit-tests coverage. I've noticed, that last time, I'm making very tricky manipulations with unit-tests Command-Line Test Runner' --filter command. Here is this command's explanation from official documentation: --filter Only runs tests whose name matches the given pattern. The pattern can be either the name of a single test or a regular expression that matches multiple test names. I ofter use it because sometimes it becomes very useful to run just a single test suite or test case from the whole test base. I'm wondering if this is good practice or not? I have heard that sometimes it is good practice to to run the whole test suite on your Continuous Integration machine, if you know for sure that you have modified only one component and 100% percent confident , that it won't fail other component's unit-tests. What do you think about it? Some time ago I thought that we shouldn't care so much about time require to run the whole suite of all unit-tests, but when you have very complicated business logic and unit-tests - this can take significant time. I understand, that "real" unit-tests shouldn't interact with DB, use mock/stubs objects, I agree with that. But sometimes, it is much easier(cheaper) to use DB fixtures for the tests. Please give me some advice, how this problem can be solved?
