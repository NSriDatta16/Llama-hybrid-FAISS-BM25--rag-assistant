It's always a problem dealing with many predictor variables. Even in your logistic regression you might need to add interaction terms (if you haven't done it yet). So apart from picking the variables you have to pick interactions as well. I'd recommend first trying a decision tree as it does take interactions into account and automatically selects best variable combination (in terms of prediction). Check libraries "party" "rpart". Another solution is not picking some variables but combine all of them to create other, new, variables to use. Check PCA (principal component analysis) approach, but make sure it handles categorical variables and not only continuous.
