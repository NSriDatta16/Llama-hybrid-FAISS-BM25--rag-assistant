No. Unix and Ruby are alive and well Unix and Ruby are both alive and well, Unix vendor Apple's stock is headed into orbit, linux has an irrevocable dug-in position running servers, development, and lab systems, and Microsoft's desktop-software empire is surrounded by powerful SaaS barbarians like Google and an army of allies. Unix has never had a brighter future, and Ruby is one of its key allies. I'm not sure the software-tools pattern is such a key element of Unix anyway. It was awesome in its day given the general clunky borderline-worthless quality of competing CLI tools but Unix introduced many other things including an elegant process and I/O model. Also, I think you will find that many of those Ruby programs use various Unix and software-tools interfaces internally. Check for popen() and various Process methods. I think Ruby simply has its own sphere of influence.
