You're looking for local minima and maxima, I presume? That's really easy to do: You just have to specify a radius of search, and it will give you back an array of local minima and maxima of the data. It works in a simple way: it cuts the array into segments of length $radius and finds the minimum of that segment. This process is repeated for the whole set of data. Be careful with the radius: usually, you want to select the radius to be the average distance from peak to trough of the data, but you will have to find that manually. It is defaulted to 2 , and that will only search for minima/maxima within a radius of 2 , which will probably give false positives with your set of data. Select the radius wisely. You'll have to hack it into your script, but that shouldn't be too hard at all.
