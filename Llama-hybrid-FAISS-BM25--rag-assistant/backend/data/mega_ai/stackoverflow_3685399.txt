First of all: the use of the CLASSPATH environment variable is very strongly discouraged. The best thing is for you to forget that it exists. Use the -cp command line switch or similar methods to set the classpath. Second, the classpath entries each represent a place where the classloader will start looking for .class according to the package hierarchy, i.e. it will look for the class org.myCompany.Library in a subfolder org/myCompany in any of the classpath entries. Therefore, if you add a classpath entry C:\java\project\ and there is a class file C:\java\project\org\myCompany\Library.class which is actually part of a package org.myCompany (capitalization matters here!) and your MyApplication class has an import org.myCompany.Library; Then it really should work.
