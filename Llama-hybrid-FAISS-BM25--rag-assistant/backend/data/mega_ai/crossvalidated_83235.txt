My answer is based on making some assumptions about your question. Assumption 1: Dependent variable is binary. Assumption 2: Independent variable (predictor) is ordinal. Question 1: If these assumptions are accurate, then the answer is yes. A binary logistic regression would be appropriate as the type of regression one runs is dependent on the dependent variable. A helpful hint is that if possible, have your independent variables have a meaningful 0 (e.g., "never" or "neutral" or sample mean). This tends to help with interpretation of the regression weights. Question 2: Based on the information you provided, it sounds as if you have the individual items of a scale (or subscale). For example, if I have 3 questions about different symptoms of a disease, they should factor together. I could average these items or sum the items to create a scale score that is then used as an independent or dependent variable in regression. This is commonly done in many different fields (particularly any field that uses surveys). Hope this is helpful.
