If there aren't proportional hazards then no single hazard ratio adequately summarizes the results. The hazard ratio between the two groups is changing with time. A vignette for the R survival package on time-dependent survival models covers both time-dependent covariates and how to deal with time-dependent coefficients/hazard ratios. Start there for ideas about handling specific time periods differently (which might have a reasonable rationale for HAI) or developing a function of time informed by the changes in scaled Schoenfeld residuals over time. A couple more notes. For one, it's possible that some of your problem might be coming from important predictors that aren't included in your model. I suspect that there are many variables besides age and HAI that contribute to mortality. You often want to include as many predictor variables as possible as you can in a Cox model without overfitting the data. Also, there's a little ambiguity in the way you phrased the question: you do a Cox regression but speak of "6-month mortality," which sounds more like a logistic regression. Does that mean simply that you didn't collect data longer than 6 months from study entry for an individual (however you defined the study entry time)?
