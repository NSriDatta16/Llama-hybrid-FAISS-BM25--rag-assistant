I guess it is a matter of taste if the first fragment looks ugly ;-)... However, the reason why the second code fragment takes longer (IMHO) is that now for every iteration of the for loop, a new instance of PreparedStatement (getProteinIdQuery) gets created whereas in the first fragment, you reused the prepared statement, using it the way it was meant to be: Instantiated and then supplied with proper values. At least, that's my opinion... Jan
