Bootstrapping necessary in IPTW?

IPTW as in inverse probability of treatment weighting. Currently I am working on a project investigating the ATT of certain antiviral, and I found out there are several stats papers on the necessity and ways of bootstrapping when using IPTW, eg this and this . Yet I also found various papers in good medical journals (like JAMA) that use IPTW but do not involve bootstrapping. Propensity calculation is logistic regression and outcome modelling is weighted univariate coxph cox regression. Do I really need to bootstrap? If so, what is the proper way to do so, ie bootstrap the data and carry out IPTW on samples, or run IPTW just once and bootstrap on the weighted data?
