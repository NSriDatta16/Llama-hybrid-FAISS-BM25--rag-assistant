There is no reason not to proceed in a Bayesian way for this problem. Starting with a reference prior on the unknown parameter, $\theta$, the posterior distribution on $\theta$ gets updated after each new observation and so does the predictive distribution $p(x_{n+1}|x_1,\ldots,x_n)$. If the model is regular enough, the posterior and the predictive concentrate at the same speed as the MLE, enjoys a Central Limit (Bernstein-von Mises) theorem, &tc. while providing for a finite $n$ a complete array of inferential answers. In addition, highly efficient computational tools like particle filters have been devised exactly for this kind of problems and hence deliver Monte Carlo approximations to the sequence of posterior at a limited computational cost.
