Progress notification in WCF for long running processes - How?

I have to design and implement a way to deal with long running processes in a client/server application. A typical long running process would/could take 2-3 minutes. I also need to report progress to the UI in the meantime and keep the UI responsive. Having these in my mind I though of a few solutions: One async request to start the process which starts the server-side process and returns an assigned LRPID (Long Running Process ID) then poll periodically from the client using that LRPID. ( Pro : simple to deploy, no firewall messing around Con : Unelegant, resource consuming etc.) Use a duplex binding (such as NetTcpBinding) and initiate callbacks from the server as progress is being made ( Pro : Elegant, efficient, Con : Deployment nightmare) [Your suggestion???] What would be your take on this?
