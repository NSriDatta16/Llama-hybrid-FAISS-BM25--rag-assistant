Creating Hello world event dispatcher(observer) in Magento?

I am trying to create an event dispatcher in Magento (which should be called after a product gets added to cart). What I've done so far: I Googled this and found this link. I followed the instructions specified in this link. I configured the config.xml file and created a Observer.php filder under mymodule/model folder. But, I can't see any result from this. (The code for config.xml and Observer.php file that i used in my example can be found under http://goo.gl/O7dBy , my custom module name is Crossdata and package name is MyModule - am i doing it wrong?) Any other link with simple helloworld event dispatcher example would be helpful. Thanks, Balan
