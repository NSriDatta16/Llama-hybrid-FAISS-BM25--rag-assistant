Here's what I've come up with. Does anyone know of a cleaner solution? $entries = $msg->map['map'][0]['entry']; $map = array(); foreach($entries as $entry) { $vals = array_values($entry); if(count($vals) == 1 && is_array($vals[0])) { $vals = $vals[0]; } $map[$vals[0]] = $vals[1]; } This gives me: array 'id' => int 42 'status' => int 42 'result' => string 'aString' (length=7) which is pretty much what I'm looking for, but the code to get there seems pretty fragile.
