This may or may not be relevant to your question, but there are many strange things in your code. UltraDropDown fruitUltraDropDown = new UltraDropDown(); Infragistics includes wizards to create, populate, and display controls in the designer.cs file. Instantiating a control like this throws away all the designer data and creates a new, default control. Do you really intend this? Is this an excerpt from the designer.cs file? fruitUltraDropDown.DataSource = fruits.ToList(); This creates a new List > from your Dictionary . fruits is now unreachable and eligible for garbage collection, any change made to it will never be propagated to fruitUltraDropDown . Why are you creating fruits only to throw it away? What event can I handle so when a user types "grape"... Types where? fruitUltraDropDown ? The designer data has been thrown away so fruitUltraDropDown is not editable, unless there is a lot of code you are not showing. MyUltraGrid ? You do not show any code for this, so no one can have any idea what it implements. A text field? Programmatic data? A total mystery. I can add it to the dictionary... Adding anything to Dictionary is pointless because you no longer use it. If you want to add it to ultraDropDown1.DataSource you have to add a KeyValuePair : var ds = ultraDropDown1.DataSource as List >; ds.Add(new KeyValuePair (-3, "grape")); This will just add the entry to the backing store. If you want to include it in ultraDropDown1 : ultraDropDown1.DataBind(); If this is not helpful you must add enough information to your question so that someone without your source code can understand what you are trying to do.
