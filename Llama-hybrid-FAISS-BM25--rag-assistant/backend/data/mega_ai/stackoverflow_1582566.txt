Working with DIVs sometimes takes huge effort, when trying to tell a complex designs to behave exactly as the designer (or a control freak client) wants. When ever possible, I use tables instead of divs, this gives me the peace of mind when working on a tightly scheduled project when messing around with different browsers. ALternatively, when I got the time, I use DIVS as an elegant way of doing things right. just for the fun of it.
