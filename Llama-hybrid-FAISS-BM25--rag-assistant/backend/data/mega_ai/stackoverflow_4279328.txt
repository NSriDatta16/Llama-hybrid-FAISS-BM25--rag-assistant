Windows Client vs Web Client

I have a discussion going on in the organisation where I am employed as a consultant. The discussion revolves around the replacement of an application built using VB6(MDI) thick client. This application has around 100 screen + 40 reports. Used by approx 400 users the reports and the data are pulled using inline queries while the db structure is pretty normalized. the rest of the code is pretty bad. While discussing replenishment strategies we are throwing around a few ideas. J2EE Web application running on Web sphere using Crystal reports for Reports. ASP.NET web forms web application using crystal reports for reports. Windows Client application (WPF/Win-forms) with reporting services for the reports. While I don't want to start a flame war (Dot net vs. Java or WEb vs. Desktop) it would be nice to know the community thoughts on the matter. Just to be upfront I feel that option 3 maybe the best version, but I would like to know the opinions of others.
