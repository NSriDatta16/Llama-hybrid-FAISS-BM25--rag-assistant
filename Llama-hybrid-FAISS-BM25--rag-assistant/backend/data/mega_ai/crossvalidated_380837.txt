How do deep CNNs handle problem of "perceptual aliasing" while visual place classification?

Deep CNNs have achieved state-of-the-art performance in image classification. The underlying concept of place recognition is similar to image classification where the task is to classify or recognize a place. Two different places can have the same appearance, or the same place can appear drastically different at different times. We as humans even face difficulty in answering the question sometimes. This challenge is described as "perceptual aliasing". For a detailed description of the problem visit here (Lowry et al., 2016). So my question is what are the approaches existing in the literature to address the problem of perceptual aliasing, specifically for methods using deep CNNs. I'm aware that sequences of images (or videos) are sometimes used to eliminate the confusion, but I believe there must be a better way out. Reference Lowry, Stephanie, et al. "Visual place recognition: A survey." IEEE Transactions on Robotics 32.1 (2016): 1-19.
