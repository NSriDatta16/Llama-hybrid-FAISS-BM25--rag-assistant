There are plenty of sites to help with this sort of question, but I will highlight a few. To have a better understanding of "what is weighted least squares?" , this link will help . It has a high-level overview of the method, as well as a pros-and-cons list to the method. It also goes over weighting schemes, which answers the question you stated. For a mathematical basis of the answer to your question, see this thread , which describes the method used in most algorithms. This link will show you some in-depth examples of how to implement Weighted OLS. Both examples and code are given along with the explanation. If you are interested in Recency-weighted regressions (as to be used in time series), take a look at this article , which gives a nice overview of the method with a baseball analogy, where observations are highly autocorrelated.
