User feedback remains when changing state in Sketchflow

Wanting to check if I missed a setting somewhere, or if I'm just using the product in an unintended fashion. I've created a prototype based on an existing site, and am using states to mimic functionality, along with tabcontrols and the like. When the end-user is marking up the page, and then changes tabs, or clicks a button to change states (but stay on the same 'screen'), the drawings from the end-user remain in the same spot. The issue is that if the user highlighted or crossed something out, it interferes with the new state. Is this intended, an undocumented feature, or am I just expecting a little too much? This may be a dealbreaker for us using this tool in our organization if we can't either resolve or have a reasonable workaround. I'm open for suggestions.
