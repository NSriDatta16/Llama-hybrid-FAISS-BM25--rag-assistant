Copy Special Symbols From One PowerPoint Presentation to Another

I need to copy text from one PowerPoint presentation to another. However, I have problems copying special symbols, such as smileys, which appear in the target presentation as empty boxes. Looking at the Open XML file in the original presentation, I can see that the Run containing the smiley has a "SymbolFont" attribute: However, in VBA, Shape.TextFrame2.TextRange2.Font =the Font of that Run - shows Arial. How can I determine the SymbolFont of a text Run using VBA or C# (not XML)? Then I could specify that SymbolFont in the target presentation. Perhaps there other ways for copying the text that do not involve XML? Note that this problem happens not only with Smileys; other special characters may show different SymbolFonts, such as: Code example: getRuns(TextRange2 paragraph) { foreach(TextRange2 run in paragraph.get_Runs(-1,-1)) _myRuns.Add(new MyRun {_text=run.Text, _font=run.Font} ); } copyRunsToParagraph(TextRange2 paragraph) { foreach(MyRun run in _myRuns) paragraph=paragraph.InsertAfter(run._text); } Note: Run.Font seems to return only the Latin font, not the Symbol font, e.g., Arial but not Wingdings. As I wrote, different symbols may have different SymbolFonts, so always using Wingdings does not work.
