Mixture model for decomposing bimodal or multimodal distributions

The gaussian mixture model (GMM) is fed mixture components or features whose time series each have differing means and variances from one another, but are unimodal (have one mode) with each component forming a differently placed Gaussian distribution. Can this instead be done recursively (backwards) somehow, where if, starting with bimodal -distributed mixture components that each have bimodal distributions (two modes, as shown in the image), is there a model that can back out unimodal data series or parameters from bimodal components? So instead of classifying sub-populations, you actually split apart the bimodal into sub-populations
