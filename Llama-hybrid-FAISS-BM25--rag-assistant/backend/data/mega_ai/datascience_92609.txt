How to determine Number of neuron in hidden layer for classification

I used Iris dataset for classification with 3 layer Neural Network I decided to use : 3 neurons for input since it has 3 features, 3 neurons for output since it has 3 classes and In the hidden layer what is the best number of neurons to do classification in this case?
