Mapping UML Class Diagram in Eclipse (modelling tools) to actual Classes

I'm looking at a "reverse-engineerable" modelling system for students in Eclipse. Currently, I'm looking at the Eclipse modelling tools in the Ganymede release ( http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-modeling-tools-includes-incubating-components/ganymedesr2 ) I'm happy with the UML modelling design surfaces in Eclipse for building UML models. But, does anyone know how to map these to code and back and forth? I'm a little spoiled, because I do this all the time in Visual Studio.
