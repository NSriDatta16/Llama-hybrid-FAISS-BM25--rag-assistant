NLP: What are some popular packages for phrase tokenization?

I'm trying to tokenize some sentences into phrases. For instance, given I think you're cute and I want to know more about you The tokens can be something like I think you're cute and I want to know more about you Similarly, given input Today was great, but the weather could have been better. Tokens: Today was great and the weather could have been better Can NLTK or similar packages achieve this? Any advice appreciated.
