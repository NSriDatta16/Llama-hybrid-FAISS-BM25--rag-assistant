How to compute confidence interval from a confidence distribution

I am a bit confused about how to get a 95% confidence interval from a confidence distribution. My question is based on the paper "Confidence distribution, the frequentist distribution estimator of a Parameter: A review" written by Xie & Singh (2013) I think I am getting lost in something really naive. This is the confidence distribution in Example 7: \begin{align} H_n(\theta) &=\int^\infty_{n\bar{x}}\left(\frac{t}{\theta}\right)^{np_0}\frac {e^\frac{t}{\theta}}{\Gamma\left(np_0\right)t}dt \\ &= 1-F_{\Gamma\left(np_0,\theta\right)}(n\bar{x}) \end{align} where $F_{\Gamma\left(np_0,\theta\right)}(\cdot)$ is the cumulative distribution function of a ${\rm Gamma}(np_0,\theta)$ From that confidence distribution, I just need to take the inverse of the CD with respect to the parameter of interest (in this case $\theta$) in order to get the level $100\left(1-\alpha \right)\%$ confidence interval, for the parameter $\theta$, defined in the paper as $\left(H^{-1}_n\left(\frac{\alpha}{2}\right),H^{-1}_n\left(1-\frac{\alpha}{2}\right)\right)$. As a complementary source, here is the Wikipedia link . Now, my questions is: is it possible to compute the confidence intervals algebraically? I find it difficult to invert a CDF to get a confidence interval with the tools and methods I have been studying so far. I just started learning about the confidence distribution and I am looking for some insights about making inference. EDIT: I have a doubt about the whole process I'm going through, and it also involves coverage probability. From a statistical model I obtained a fiducial distribution that it's also a confidence distribution. Saying, from a random variable X distributed as a Binomial, I obtained the fiducial distribution of the parameter p which is a Beta. And I know that this fiducial distribution is also a confidence distribution. I want to make inference about p, in particular I would like to compute a 95% confidence interval. As I stated above, I can compute the inverse of the CD and obtain the confidence interval. Since I don't need any approximation, I suppose I can compute an exact confidence interval for p, right? Does the actual coverage probability coincide with the nominal, since I am computing the confidence interval from a continuous distribution such as a Beta? Does it solve the problem of the discrepancy between actual and nominal coverage probability of the discrete distributions? I would also like to implement this procedure in R, computing the quantile of the beta distribution with the q function and then plotting the coverage probability graph with different sample size. Which function should I use?
