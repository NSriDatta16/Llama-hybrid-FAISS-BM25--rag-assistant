How to understand which red bar is related to which leaked block in Instruments?

I'm trying to understand locating leaked memory using Xcode4 and Instruments but I'm stuck at some point. I started recording the application and Instruments gathered the leaked memory. So ok, I see the leaked blocks in the lower pane, but how can I understand which leaked block is related to which red bar? I assume that although all the blue bars indicate leaks, reds are the one that need real attention and so I want to know which block causes the red spike. I cannot click on a red bar to get further information about it. When I click on somewhere on the upper pane, all I got is a dashed line. Need your directions, please.
