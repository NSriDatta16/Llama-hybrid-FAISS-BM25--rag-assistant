It is best to look at the distribution of waiting times for a particular provider. My first thought would be that if the process is anything like a queueing If process that the distribution should be nearly exponential. So I would check to see if the sample mean and standard deviation are approximately equal. If so, I would look to see if an empirical CDF (ECDF) of the data roughly fits the CDF of $\mathsf{Exp}(\text{rate} = \lambda),$ where $\mu = 1/\lambda$ is estimated as $\hat \mu = \bar X,$ the sample mean. Only if that doesn't seem to work well, would I pursue fitting the data to a gamma distribution. This is also a plausible possibility, partly because the sum of $k$ exponential waiting times (of the same rate) is gamma-distributed with shape parameter $k.$ [If you use a 'distribution ID' program, a 'gamma' distribution will almost always win out over 'exponential' because the family $\mathsf{Exp}$ is a sub-family of $\mathsf{Gamma}.$ ] Exponential data. As an initial example, let's pursue data randomly sampled from $\mathsf{Exp}(\text{rate} = 1/10),$ so that the average waiting time is (a perhaps optimistic) 10 days. Suppose we have waiting times for $n = 500$ patients. set.seed(714) # for reproducibility x = rexp(500, 0.1) mean(x); sd(x) [1] 9.909112 [1] 10.36662 So the sample mean and SD are about the same. In practice, I would not know the true rate $\lambda$ so I will estimate it as $\hat \lambda = 1/9.9 = 0.101.$ In the plot below, the boxplot shows many high 'outliers', as is typical of an exponential sample. The Density function of $\mathsf{Exp}(0.101),$ is a reasonable fit to the histogram of the data. Also (usually more revealing), the ECDF plot of the sample is well-approximated by the CDF of this distribution. [The ECDF is a 'stairstep' plot that jumps up by $1/500$ at each of the $500$ observed values.] par(mfrow=c(1,3)) boxplot(x, col="skyblue2", pch=19, main="Boxplot of DATA") hist(x, prob=T, br=20, col="skyblue2", main="Histogram with EXP(.101) Density") rug(x); curve(dexp(x, .101), add=T, col="red") plot(ecdf(x), main="ECDF with EXP(.101) CDF") curve(pexp(x, .101), add=T, col="red") par(mfrow=c(1,1)) These favorable results are hardly surprising because data were sampled from an exponential population. If real data performs as well, then you could simulate additional data from a similar population with R code rexp(n, 0.101) , where parameter n is the desired number of simulated values. However, you must realize that you are not gaining additional information about actual patient waiting times by doing that. All the 'information' you have is given by the sample and the assumption that the population is exponential. Gamma data. If the exponential model does not seem to fit, perhaps the next step is to assume that data are gamma-distributed, to estimate the parameters, and make similar plots to see if you get a better fit to the data. [Several pages on this site and online discuss estimation of gamma parameters; one recent page discusses both MMEs and MLEs.] Just to see what happens if we have gamma data and try to fit an exponential model, I repeat the simulation above, but using x = rgamma(500, 2, .2) . set.seed(714) # for reproducibility x = rgamma(500, 2, 0.2) mean(x); var(x) [1] 10.62662 [1] 59.49749 Pretending that these data are exponential and estimating the rate as $\hat \lambda = 0.1062,$ R code similar to that above gives the following graphs--with noticeably unsatisfactory fits. Using a gamma model with method-of-moments estimators (MMEs) from the link above, I estimate the shape parameter as $\hat \alpha = 1.90$ and the rate parameter as $\hat \lambda = 0.178.$ [Maximum likelihood estimators (MLEs) would likely be more accurate, but MMEs are good enough to give an idea how the graphing procedure works.]
