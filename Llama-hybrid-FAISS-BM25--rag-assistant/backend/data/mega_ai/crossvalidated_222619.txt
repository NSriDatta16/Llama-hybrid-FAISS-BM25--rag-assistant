As Ngiann notes, Fahlman and Lebiere (1989) is the original paper. The pdf is widely available on the Internet, including this address . I wasn't sure from reading your question if you just wanted the original paper that launched CasCor, or the best "go-to" reference, or a list of alternatives. Since Fahlman and Lebiere naturally didn't cover a lot of the variants or experiments with CasCor that came after 1989, I'll list a few good ones I've encountered, all of which are available on the Internet without a paywall. So far, my impression is that there isn't one single dominant paper or book that acts as a sort of CasCor Bible, but there are some that are clearly worth reading. • The most comprehensive treatment I've seen to date is Balázs, Gabor, "Cascade-Correlation Neural Networks: A Survey," which can be found here . There may be better ones, but I haven't run across them yet. • Another general reference is Prechelt, Lutz, 1996, "Investigation of the CasCor Family of Learning Algorithms," which is available online . • For some empirical testing of cascade correlation, try Yang, Jihoon and Honavar, Vasant, "Experiments with the Cascade-Correlation Algorithm" at this address . • One noteworthy variant is Fahlman's extension of cascade correlation to RNNs, in Fahlman, Scott E., 1991, "The Recurrent Cascade-Correlation Architecture," which can be found here . • Another well-written article involves the extension of cascade correlation to RBFs. See Lu, Weiying and Harrington, Peter de B., 2009, "Radial Basis Function Cascade Correlation Networks," pp. 1045-1068 in Algorithms, Vol. 2. I found it at this Google address . I hope that helps. I've also run into a few decent case studies, but I don't think they'd answer your question. The three articles on variants and experimentation are not general treatments per se, but they do contain good summaries of CasCor nets.
