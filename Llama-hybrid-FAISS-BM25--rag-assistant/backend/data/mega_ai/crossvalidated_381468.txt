Merging a few separately trained skikit-learn MLPRegressor models into one

I am thinking about parallel training a few MLPRegressor models using individual subset of training data (or maybe random selection from same test data) and then somehow "merge" individually trained model into one, presumable better trained. Is any official way to do it? If no - what could be hack? I am not familiar with MLPRegressor internals but from common sense I should average same weights from separate models and put those averages into final model. Any more ideas?
