On average, how many times will I obtain a six by rolling a die N times?

If I understand the terms correctly, I am asking: what is the expected value of the random variable defined as the number of sixes obtained by rolling a 6-sided die N times? I found a source which said that for $N=2$, the expected number of sixes is $12/36=1/3$, but I'm not sure why.
