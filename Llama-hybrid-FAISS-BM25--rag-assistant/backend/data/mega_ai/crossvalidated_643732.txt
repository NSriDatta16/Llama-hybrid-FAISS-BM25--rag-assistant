How can I use machine learning to find the aspect ratio of particles in a simulation?

I have a gravitational model where particles (n ~ 1000) are being pulled by a massive blackhole. The particles can be seen to get stretched due to this. I want to measure this aspect ratio (Length : Width) vs time plot. An example of this stretching can be seen in this clipping (different colours show different times, so this shows evolution of the particles): I tried doing this in a different way by considering the velocity vector and rotating one of the position axis to this and measuring the length and width that way. But at some point the center of mass velocity vector doesnâ€™t point (or align) towards the stretching. Is there a way I can do this using other algorithms in computational geometry/machine learning?
