The only difference between the two elements is semantics. Both elements, by default, have the CSS rule display: block (hence block-level) applied to them; nothing more (except somewhat extra margin in some instances). However, as aforementioned, they both different greatly in terms of semantics. The element, as its name somewhat implies, is for paragraphs. Thus, should be used when you want to create blocks of paragraph text. The element, however, has little to no meaning semantically and therefore can be used as a generic block-level element â€” most commonly, people use it within layouts because it is meaningless semantically and can be used for generally anything you might require a block-level element for.
