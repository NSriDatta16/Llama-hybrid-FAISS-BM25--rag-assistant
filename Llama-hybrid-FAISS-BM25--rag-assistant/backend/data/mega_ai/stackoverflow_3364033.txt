Iterating over column names in a data frame

In a loop, I am trying to perform a simple renaming of the variables in a df. Without the loop, this works perfectly: names(c1) With a loop-friendly approach ("1" in place of i in the dry-run example) the following correctly references names(c1): names(get(paste("c","1", sep=""))) but as I write the whole operation I get an error to the tune of "only the first element is used as variable name", here's the code: assign(names(get(paste("c","1", sep=""))), c("sales", "month")) I don't know what the error means, but no column title has been changed. Any ideas? Thanks, Roberto
