Unsupervised Learning on Multilevel/Multidimensional Data

I am working on a case-control study, where I for each individual have high dimensional data (like illustrated in the image). I would like to do both PCA analysis and Clustering on this data, but it is complicated by the fact that I do not only have several independent columns per individual, but I also have several independent rows. Do you have any suggestions for what methods can handle this kind of data, or am I forced to summarize the data such that I only have one value per individual per column?
