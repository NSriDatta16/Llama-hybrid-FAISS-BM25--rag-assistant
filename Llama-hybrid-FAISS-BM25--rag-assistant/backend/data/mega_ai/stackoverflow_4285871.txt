This is the bit that's failing: "Average: " + Average(double Value[]) The double Value[] bit should be an argument for the method, e.g. "Average: " + Average(Value) I would strongly recommend that you start following normal Java naming conventions, e.g. naming classes with PascalCase, methods and variables with camelCase. Also, given that your Value variable actually holds multiple values, I'd pluralize it to values . You'd be amazed at how much easier code is to read when the names are chosen well :)
