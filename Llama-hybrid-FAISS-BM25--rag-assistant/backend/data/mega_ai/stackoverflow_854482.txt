Creating tables for copy from Word to Excel

So, I needed to take some data done in MS Word tables, and manipulate in excel. I decided to get it from word to excel via a VBA subroutine to "save time". My source word document contained like twentysomething tables. I took my source document's tables, extracted my data and made a new document, with a new table, only needing me to copy and paste it into excel. However, while the final table before copy looks good in word. When i copy it to excel, it breaks up the cells that contain whole paragraphs into separate cells. As most excel peeps would know, even though a solution looks like in excel, doing a merge and center - that only preserves the content in the uppermost cell in the selection! So, any advice, on either a better merge and center, or a better "time saver" alltogether, would be great. Here's a sample of the code so far: Sub First() Dim tableLength, tableIndex tableLength = ThisDocument.Tables.Count Dim tblReport As Table Dim docReport As Document Set docReport = Documents.Add Set tblReport = docReport.Tables.Add(Selection.Range, 1, 2) With tblReport Dim fieldOne, subvalueAription, subvalueA, subvalueB, subvalueC For tableIndex = 1 To tableLength fieldOne = ThisDocument.Tables(tableIndex).Rows(2).Cells(2).Range.Text subvalueA = Trim(ThisDocument.Tables(tableIndex).Rows(4).Cells(2).Range.Text) subvalueB = "A: " & Trim(ThisDocument.Tables(tableIndex).Rows(5).Cells(2).Range.Text) subvalueC = "B: " & Trim(ThisDocument.Tables(tableIndex).Rows(6).Cells(2).Range.Text) subvalueAription = subvalueA & subvalueB & subvalueC & "C: " Dim rowNext As row Set rowNext = .Rows.Add rowNext.Cells(1).Range.Text = fieldOne rowNext.Cells(2).Range.Text = subvalueA & subvalueB & subvalueC Next End With End Sub
