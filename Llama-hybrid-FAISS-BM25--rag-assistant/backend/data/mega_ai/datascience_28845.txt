If you have a fairly large set of 'good' and 'bad' images, You can use a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a package like pytorch or tensorflow (pytorch is more pythonic). As I understand it, nowadays for image tasks, CNNs are what all the cool kids use. There is a package to preload models and you can take something small like vgg16 as shown here and then replace the last layer with a fully connected output of size 2 as shown toward the end of the tutorial, or download the notebook. Its nice that You don't have care what 'good' and 'bad' are in this case (so it can be very true to your question), as long as you have like 10K images...
