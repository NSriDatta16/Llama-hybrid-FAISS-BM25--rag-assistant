In a multilinear regression, does the usage of White standard errors always correct for heteroscedasticity?

I've calculated a multilinear regression. When testing the assumptions of linear regression, I've come to understand that my model violates the assumption of homoscedasticity (as shown with a Breusch-Pagan test). I've been searching for ways to palliate for this violation, and I've come upon the usage of White standard errors (sandwich method). 1- Does the usage of White standard errors guarantee correction for heteroscedasticity? 2- Is there a method I should be using to verify that heteroscedasticity has been accounted for after having used the sandwich method? 3- What are the implications of reporting White standard errors instead of the initial standard errors? Are there any differences in the interpretation of the multilinear model?
