Don't know if you still have this problem, but I had a similar issue and I've managed to fix it. I removed the testrunconfig file from my solution folder. Then added it back in and it came up with the settings dialog box, where I enabled the code coverage. Then I double clicked on code coverage and it came up with a list of dlls and I selected the ones that I needed. It saved the settings correctly and now when I run my tests, I can see the results in code coverage. Hope this helps someone.
