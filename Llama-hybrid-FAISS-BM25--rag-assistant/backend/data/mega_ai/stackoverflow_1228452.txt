Yeah IE is a real pain when it comes to this. I found that I actually had to force it to redraw the DOM element inorder to get it to move. How I did this was to very quickly hide and show the parent object in your case it sounds like the parent to your row. This is not the most elegant solution, but it does the job. In my case I used jQuery to get the job done. var forceRedraw = function(obj) { /// Forces a redraw of passed objects. /// The object for force the redraw on. obj = $(obj); // force IE to redraw the obj if (jQuery.browser.msie) { obj.css("display", "none"); obj.css("display", "block"); } };
