I don't know STATA but an interaction term is usually simply the product of the two terms involved. Since both your independent variables are binary, you can code each of them 0 for no and 1 for yes, then the interaction term will be 1 if both of them are "yes" and 0 otherwise. After you have output, you can interpret it. There will be a parameter for each independent variable and their interaction. The main effect for water is the effect for water when insurance = 0; the main effect for insurance is the effect for insurance when water = 0. To get the effect of each variable when the other = 1, you have to add the interaction term. Since it is a logistic regression, these effects will be on the logit; alternatively, you can find odds ratios, but there will no longer be 1 OR for each independent variable - you will have to specify the level of the other.
