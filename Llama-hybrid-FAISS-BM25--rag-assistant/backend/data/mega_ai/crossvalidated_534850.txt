Factor analysis with different experimental conditions: Implications(?)

I have conducted (exploratory) factor analysis (EFA) on data from a within-subject design with four different experimental conditions . Each participant goes through all conditions one after the other (in a random order, of course), within a 1-hour session. I have scoured Cross Validated and read a lot of posts about PCA with repeated measures, but I believe this case is different because it is not simply about repeated measures but about the implications of adding to that different experimental conditions . Question What are the implications for conducting EFA on collapsed repeated-measures data from different experimental conditions (e.g., which assumes that each observation is independent/comes from a different personâ€”though we know this is not true)? Is this a valid approach? What are the possible limitations or caveats? Note: I am not interested in suggestions of alternative methods (SEM, multilevel EFA/CFA, etc.), just to more fully understand the limitations and implications of the current method.
