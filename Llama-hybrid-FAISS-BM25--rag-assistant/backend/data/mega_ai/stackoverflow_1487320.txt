Blogging with R: easy way to embed R in a blog post?

There is a very nice Mediawiki plugin for R which allows you to embed R code in any wiki page. It takes a little effort to configure, but it's really useful once you have it in place. Does anyone know of an equivalent for embedding R in a blog post? The only thing I could find was this wordpress plugin called RWebFriend , but it only allows you to send code to Rweb . I'm envisioning something where you can embed your code between two tags and it is executed and returned.
