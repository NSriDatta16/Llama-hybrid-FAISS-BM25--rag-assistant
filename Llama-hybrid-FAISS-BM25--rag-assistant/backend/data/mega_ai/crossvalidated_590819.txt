Using a Neural Network (NN) would be a solution. NN learn/train on dataset to target dataset, and then make a forecast on that particular database set. NN are very good at processing binary data (some of them generalize input data for better processing). There is no need to know what binary data represent or how they are translated back (using non-generalized data leads to overwhelming complex models, a beginner overkill). Some Open Source Statistical Software Packages for Mining Data feature learning NN like Orange/Quasar, JASP, KNIME to name a few, to start on. In general, the more dataset the better outcome. There are more heavy-weight software packages that feature learning NN but there is a huge learning curve not only for starting to use such software packages, but also what in particular all those tools are, what they are for, how and when to use them, and how they perform, especially for a beginner. The easiest way to start on that in MS Excel is to use XLSTATA, NeuralSolution, PALISADE as MS Excel Add-ins, to name a few, but they are all commercial some offer a full trial use. In Excel such Add-ins offer more easy "control" over steps performed on those tools, like SVM, k-NN, and Log regression, ... to start on.
