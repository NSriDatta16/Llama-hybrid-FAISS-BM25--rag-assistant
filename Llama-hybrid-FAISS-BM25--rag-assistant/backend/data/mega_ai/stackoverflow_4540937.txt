When you group by, all the rows in a group get condensed into one. Depending on what you're trying to do, you need to use the appropriate group functions (SUM, GROUP_CONCAT, etc.), or you can do what I think you're trying to do with a subquery: SELECT * FROM activity WHERE agent IN (select agent from activity group by agent asc having count(agent) > 3);
