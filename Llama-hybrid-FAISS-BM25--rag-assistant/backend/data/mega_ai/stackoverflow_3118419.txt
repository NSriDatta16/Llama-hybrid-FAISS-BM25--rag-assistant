Unfortunately, it's very common for ImageJ plugins to be written without programmatic use in mind, and there's not really an elegant way of getting around that without changing the code of the plugin. (You've already discovered that there are unsatisfactory ways around it :)) So, in your position I would just change the code in Polar_Transformer.java in the following way: http://gist.github.com/452826 ... which is vaguely along the lines suggested in the Fiji PlugIn Design Guidelines , while still trying to just make minimal changes to the original code. Then you can just create the PlugIn object and call exec(...) on it supplying the options you want. (I haven't really tested that patch, but you get the idea.) I hope that's of some help - I see that your question was some time ago, though, so I guess you may have found some other workaround in the mean time.
