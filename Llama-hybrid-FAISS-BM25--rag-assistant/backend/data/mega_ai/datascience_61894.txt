do bagging and then evaluate model, also you should split your data into train and test 60/40 and on train do folds or split it into train and validation https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Training,_validation,_and_test_sets problem with your dataset is that it's small so maybe just use logistic regression with bagging
