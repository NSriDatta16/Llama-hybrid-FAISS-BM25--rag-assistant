No, I don't think OpenCV provides this facility. You are already doing it right by calculating the the gradient. How ever, you could do with a simple calculation of (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) to tell a gradient between two points. Using gnuplot may be heavy. You could also use Numdifftools . Adding additional links on OpenCV that I did not find in previous answer. http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/cookbook.html#using-goodfeaturestotrack http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/python/index.html
