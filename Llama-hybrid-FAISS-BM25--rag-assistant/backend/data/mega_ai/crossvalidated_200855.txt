It would be useful to have more details on your dataset in general, and your meta-analytic estimates in particular. In addition, it would be interesting to know what are the averages and SDs of the complete studies you are including. Having said that, my pragmatic approach would be, as you hint, to use sample size weighting (why inverse?), but remember this will be at best a hypothesis-generating meta-analysis, whose greatest strength will be pinpointing at the drawbacks of primary studies. Here are some useful references on the potential use of sample weighting in meta-analysis: http://faculty.cas.usf.edu/mbrannick/papers/conf/SIOP08Wts.doc https://www.meta-analysis.com/downloads/Meta%20Analysis%20Fixed%20vs%20Random%20effects.pdf http://epm.sagepub.com/content/70/1/56.abstract
