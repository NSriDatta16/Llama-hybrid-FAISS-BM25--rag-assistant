I found this solution from a comment on weblogs.asp.net . It might be a hack, but it does work. This cross browser compatibility struggle is getting upsetting. if (Request.UserAgent.IndexOf("AppleWebKit") > 0) { Request.Browser.Adapters.Clear(); } If anyone has a better solution that's not so much a hack, I would be grateful if you posted it. And from my extensive web searches, it looks like I'm not alone with this problem with the menu control, so some good references would help out others in the same situation.
