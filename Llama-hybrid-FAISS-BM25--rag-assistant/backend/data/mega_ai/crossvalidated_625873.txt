Count prediction with Poisson Regression

Is it essential to have the data grouped in a Poisson regression? An example: I want to know the determinants of traffic accidents in a country through data from two cities. My 3 explanatory variables are the number of young people, gender and the number of cars. Later I want to know if my model correctly predicts the number of accidents in each city. poisson Must the data organized by this way? ga Or must I group_by the information previousle to run GLM? df % group_by(ga, gender)%>% summarise(accidents=sum(accidents), population=sum(population))
