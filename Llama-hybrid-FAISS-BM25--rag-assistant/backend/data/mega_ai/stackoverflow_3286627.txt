There are many things that need to be done to ensure the card data is secure. What companies you mentioned, PayPal, Amazon and other PaymentsGateway, have gone through is expensive and time consuming. They have to go through annual audits based upon Payment Card Industry standards (PCI). If you choose to go this route, keep in mind that it is expensive to get compliant and espensive to stay compliant. Another option would be to outsouce the storage of the credit card data to a company that is in compliance with the card storage rules. There are companies out there that store the data and provide you back a token you can use to call the payment data to update or charge. One that I prefer is: www.paymentsgateway.com
