I think you'd have less internal fragmentation with a simple heap allocator. You just allocate the amount of memory you actually use (plus the overhead for the header). If you're already resigned to doing stop-the-world compaction, you could combine this with new arena allocation, and allocate a new (larger) arena and copy all your live blocks to the new arena.
