As a general rule of thumb you should avoid doing different things between your train and test dataset. As a second general rule of thumb you rarely want to use knn for missing value imputation. One efficient way to deal with missing value in your case would be to use a model that can handle missing values, like a tree model. (decision tree, random forest, xgboost...).
