This totally depends on the job at hand. In my experience (I have a PhD), there are 3 types of jobs. First, as it has been said, most industry jobs these days are oriented towards applied machine learning, i.e. apply-tweak of existing ML algorithms to the domain-specific problem in question. These are by far the most common ML jobs and a Masters degree is more than sufficient for these kind of jobs. A smaller number of jobs, which happen to be in the research wing of companies or universities, institutions are apply-tweak-create ML jobs for the domain specific problem. The experience of creating a new method by looking at existing methods using new mathematics typically takes some time and these experiences are typically gained during the PhD, as the new theoretical result should be sufficiently robust to gain the acceptance of ones peers (a publication). Last and probably the hardest, highest risk and most uncommon type of jobs are the pure theoretical stuff going on at research universities where the focus is to come up with a new algorithm totally, or understand the mathematical properties better of existing algorithms (also has to be good enough to be published). This too is experience typically gained as a PhD. While a PhD student might have had some exposure to all three types of jobs during his/her training (purely due to the length of time of the program and the fact that there are no immediate product deadlines like a real job), the MS student typically is well trained for the first job and would probably have had only minor exposures to the 2nd and 3rd types of jobs. Each one of these jobs are equally important.
