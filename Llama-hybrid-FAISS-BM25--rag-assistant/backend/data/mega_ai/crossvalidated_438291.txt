For the single individual, have a look at binomial confidence intervals iff you can assume each observation to be independent of all other observations. If you record at least a few seconds, the normal approximation should work well. The interesting feature of the binomial confidence intervals is that you can determine appropriate recording times beforehand, since p = 0.5 is the "worst case" = has highest variance. If the observations of a single individual are not independent, look into time series to find out how long to record for each of them. For the number of individuals, I'd then indeed bootstrap (by individual and including intra-individual variation if that's possible). Individuals being independent of each other doesn't make their fractions being normally distributed. However, CLT should work for the mean fraction (but may not be so very normal yet if only a few individual fractions are averaged). Standard deviation of the mean is $\frac{s}{\sqrt n}$ (s = standard deviation of the population and, n = number of individuals). I.e., if the standard deviation of the mean for your preliminary data with $n_1$ individuals is too large by a factor $f$ , in first approximation you'll need to measure $n \approx n_1 f^2$ to get the standard deviation down to your requirements. In practice, this is often sufficient with a somewhat generous rounding up to account for the uncertainty in the estimation of s based on only few individuals. To get a conservative estimate of $n$ (i.e. one unlikely to underestimate the required sample size) you can also calculate required sample size with the upper limit of the confidence interval for the standard deviation ( second approximation ). For a normal distribution (this is where CLT is needed: if the distribution of the fractions isn't already normal, the $x'$ here is already the average of sufficient individuals to make $x'$ normally distributed), you can use the one-sided confidence interval $\sigma_{x'} \leq \sqrt{\frac{(n' - 1)s_x'^2}{\chi^2_{n'-1, 1 - \alpha}}}$ with confidence level $1 - \alpha$ - don't forget to multiply the resulting $f^2n'$ with the number of individuals that were averaged to get the actual number of individuals $n$ . (Note that this is still approximate) What @whuber comments about ending up in extreme-value theory does have consequences here as well: if you find out that you basically end up with a bimodal distribution (fractions being pretty much either 0 or 1 for each individual) you'd need to average far more individuals until you can work with a normal distribution for the mean than if you find already your distribution of individual fractions basically looks normally distributed around 0.2.
