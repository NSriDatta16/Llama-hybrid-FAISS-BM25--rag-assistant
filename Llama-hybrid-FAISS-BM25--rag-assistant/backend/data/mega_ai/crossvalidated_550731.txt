Is there a reason we need to make a logistic regression linear using the logit?

My understanding is that we use the logit function to convert the sigmoidal curve of a logistic regression to be linear. As a result, we go from a curve modeled as P = e a+bX / (1 + e a+bX ) to one that can be modeled linearly as logit for p = a + bX . Why is this important? (why do we need to do this?) One suggestion I found was that this conversion to log odds shifts the model from being probability based to being a likelihood-based model. IS this true? If so, what value does that hold? Summary: why do we transform a logistic regression equation to be linear?
