Matrix storage in Rails?

I'm wondering what's the best way to handle a huge matrix in Rails 3. This matrix would store distances between points (it's symetric). Points could be added anytime so the matrix could be frequently updated. I see two ways: storing values in database and get distances through db requests (easy but a bit slow) storing values in a file and put this file in cache (could be hard to update) Thoughts? PS: I'm packaging this for a new release of my gmaps4rails gem (dedicated to make gmaps easy for rails users)
