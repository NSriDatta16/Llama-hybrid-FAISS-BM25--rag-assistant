Unit of Analysis Conversion

We are working on a social capital project so our data set has a list of an individual's organizational memberships. So each person gets a numeric ID and then a sub ID for each group they are in. The unit of analysis, therefore, is the group they are in. One of our variables is a three point scale for the type of group it is. Sounds simple enough? We want to bring the unit of analysis to the individual level and condense the type of group it is into a variable signifying how many different types of groups they are in. For instance, person one is in eight groups. Of those groups, three are (1s), three are (2s), and two are (3s). What the individual level variable would look like, ideally, is 3, because she is in all three types of groups. Is this possible in the least?
