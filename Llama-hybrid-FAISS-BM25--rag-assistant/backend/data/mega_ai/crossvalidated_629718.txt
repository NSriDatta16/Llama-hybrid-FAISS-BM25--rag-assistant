How much (not whether) to trust estimates that differ from other populations is a tricky question. The problem is similar to the one of figuring out an informative prior in Bayesian statistics, but it comes up, regardless of whether you are Bayesian, frequentist, or some other school. How well done was your sampling? Was it from a different population? You mention that income skews low (which would be very unusual) and rural/urban skews rural. Well, those might be related. Doubtless income distribution is different in rural and urban populations and, while I don't have data, it wouldn't surprise me at all if it was found that the typical right skew in income is (at least, in the USA and similar places) mostly due to urban populations -- rich people like to live in cities. New York City and the Bay area of California have a huge over-representation among the Forbes 400, which would certainly add right skew! And, while the owners of large farms may well be wealthy, they often don't live on the farm, and agricultural work is usually fairly low paying. Another issue is that most large prisons and jails are in rural areas--were incarcerated people included in your study? How about the well known ones? So, how well done was your sampling? This is something that requires a lot of thought and insight, in most cases. There are all sorts of issues such as non-response, finding the appropriate population, sampling appropriately (was it simple random sampling? Stratified? Cluster? If it was anything other than simple random, were appropriate adjustments made?) And so on. (This answer was just what I came up with in 10 minutes; there are lots of other issues too).
