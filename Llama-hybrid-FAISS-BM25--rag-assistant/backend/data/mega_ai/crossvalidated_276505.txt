Heteroscedasticity does not bias linear models unless the model is misspecified. It leads to possibly incorrect calculation of standard errors. If by pooled OLS you mean that you are aggregating values and conducting an ecological study of averages, then you will need to use precision or frequency weighting. Irrespective of that, if there are more than 40 observations, the Huber White error estimator gives valid SE estimates regardless of the variance structure of your data.
