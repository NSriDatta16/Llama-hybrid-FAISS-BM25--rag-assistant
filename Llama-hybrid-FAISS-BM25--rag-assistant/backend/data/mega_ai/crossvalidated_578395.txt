I will try to answer you, though it is somewhat vague at this point what you are looking for. It seems that you already have a setup to gather the data you want. The basic way I would try to analyze the data you would have would generally be regressions ( lm or glm , as appropriate) or aov analyses. In the simplest formulation, you would input the formula as voltage ~ temperature in input the appropriately labeled data. As for blocking, which you specifically mentioned, I would handle that by adding other variables to your formula. It seems specifically that you are concerned about a time element as well. You could create an ordered categorical variable for when each measurement happened (or group them more), put the time elapsed in as a numeric variable, or use one of R 's built-in time-series-regression tools, such as ts and arima . lubridate might be a helpful package for some of this, but so would all of the tidyverse . Some packages that would useful if you are looking into time series include zoo , (maybe) plm , xts , and tsibble , though depending on the specifics that you want, you might want to look here . Of course, you did ask for specifically experimental design packages . Since I am still not sure what you are looking for those packages to do, I would recommend ones that would go relatively well with the approach I outlined above, which would be MOTE and its dependencies, and GAD . I could elaborate more with more detail.
