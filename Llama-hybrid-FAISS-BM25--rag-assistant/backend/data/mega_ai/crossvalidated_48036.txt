Precision and recall in a multi-class classification system?

Having looked at Wikipedia and looked around here, I'm still not clear how to identify the true positives, true negatives, false positives and false negatives in the multi-label classification problem that I'm doing, so that I can calculate precision, recall and F-measure. I have a few categories and a few hundred documents. Having trained an SVM to perform classification, I have the following data document 1 | actual category, category assigned by SVM document 2 | actual category, category assigned by SVM ... document n | actual category, category assigned by SVM The category assigned by the SVM is often the same as the actual category but not always. The true positives are when actual category = category assigned by SVM I guess false positives would be actual category =/= category assigned by SVM But I'm not sure about false positives or true negatives. I feel like this may be a basic question but I can't find a clear (enough) example.
