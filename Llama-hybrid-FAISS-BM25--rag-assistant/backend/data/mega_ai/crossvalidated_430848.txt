How to analyze experiment (based on DoE and via mixed model)?

I am about to deploy my DoE which is based on six parameters with two whole plots: Temperature and relative humidity. The experiment aims at studying a sensor due to the presence of several gases (which will be injected in series). Following designs are currently of interest: FrF2(nruns = 32, nfactors = 6, factor.names = c("T", "rH", "p", "H2", "CO", "C2H4"), default.levels = c("low", "high"), randomize = TRUE) Experimental

low high class=design, type= FrF2 Experimental background : The gases H2, CO and C2H4 are of interest. As I am also (somehow) used to mixed models, I would like to use a lmm to analyze the results. Of interest is, of course, how T, rH and p affect the gas injection wrt to the sensor (which means how the gas changes its resistance). The sensors are housed and the parameters like T , rh and p can be controlled through several settings. The gases will be injected manually into the system. I already begin to think about constructing the final relationship for it: R_gas = [R_{H2}, R_{CO}, R_{C2H4}] lmer(R_gas ~ T + rH + p + (1|Sensor), df) Finally, I would like to know, basically everything I can drag out of this experiment. But of main interest is how the sensor just reacts to the gases due to the applied parameters. In total, about 20-30 sensors will be examined in parallel. R's lmer cheat sheet is quite useful yet I don't know how to apply it to my purpose. edit : A better description about the sensor and the gases: The sensor has a resistance and its value R_gas changes (decreases) with the presence of any of these gases. So in principal it should be R_H2 , R_{CO} , R_{C2H4} . Sensor would then probably be the serial number or any other ID to identify the sensors individually. edit edit : Goals of the experiment are: Study variances/differences within the sensors Study the response of the sensors in general (mean value..?) Does pressure have any influence on the response? Do the gases affect each other? Means, will the presence of a gas affect the detection of another gas? Further goals which I think should be addressed in another experiment but maybe it is doable though? Determine optimal working point of the sensors Examine repeatability (will the sensors show the same response)
