I think your question is off-topic, but I'll still try to answer because it might help you. Getting a job in data science isn't something everybody can do, it's a competitive field. Well done, for landing yourself in data science. However, data science is a big area, so you'll need to think what you want to do and plan ahead. Do you want to get yourself into machine learning? Do you want to get yourself into statistics? Right now, you're more like a software engineer in the field, still not quite being a data scientist. Do you want to become a real data scientist? Or are you happy being a software engineer in the field? If you're planning to become a data scientist, you should train yourself hard in statistics, machine learning etc. Being a Hadoop user is simply not enough to step yourself fully into the field. I give you my own experience. I was a software engineer myself. It wasn't easy to get a job in data science. I had to do a postgraduate degree in mathematics. Trained myself as much as possible. In the end, I landed myself a job as a bioinformatician. Recommendation Don't leave just because nobody mentors you. Learn as much as possible and prepare yourself. Once you're comfortable, move on.
