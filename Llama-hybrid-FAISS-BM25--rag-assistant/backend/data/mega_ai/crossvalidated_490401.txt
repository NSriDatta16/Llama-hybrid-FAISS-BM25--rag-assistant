What's the formula behind Normalization function?

sklearn.preprocessing.Normalizer(norm=l2) I need to undone a normalization ( Normalizer algorithm ) within my dataset and I'd like to know which formula I should use for it. I've try both formulas (below) and didn't work out. z-score formula: $X_{original} = (x_{normalized} \cdot \sigma) + \mu$ Min-Max formula: $X_{original} = [x_{normalized} \cdot (X_{max} - X_{min})] + X_{min}$ Thanks for your attention
