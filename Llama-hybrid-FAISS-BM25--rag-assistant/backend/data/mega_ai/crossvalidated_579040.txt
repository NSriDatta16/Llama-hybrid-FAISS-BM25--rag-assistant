Data Visualisation - Mesh Plot

Please feel free to migrate me to whatever platform best suits this question best. I just find myself in a bit of loose end looking for examples of such plots in R or Latex. If someone could help, would they be able to identify how this plot was produced and with which software? More specifically, a mesh structure representing a self-organising map. Iterative would be amazing. But it doesn't have to be. The reference for the plot is: https://algobeans.com/2017/11/02/self-organizing-map/ . All help and direction appreciated. https://annalyzin.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/som-iterateanimate.gif?w=620
