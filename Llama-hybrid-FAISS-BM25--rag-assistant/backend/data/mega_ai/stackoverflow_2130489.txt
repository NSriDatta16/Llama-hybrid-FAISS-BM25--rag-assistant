Yes. The indices into the array have no semantic meaning whatsoever. This makes them 'magic.' paxdiablo's response is a pretty good way of doing it, though I'd be tempted to combine the limit and grade name into a single class/struct. Even keeping the code structure, consider these two fragments: // original else if (finalGrade >= LETTER_GRADE_BARRIERS[13] && finalGrade = MIN_C_GRADE && finalGrade The second sample attaches more semantic meaning to the code, rather than relying upon what '13' and '14' represent. Storing them in an array buys you little, as you're not actually iterating over the array. A good check for magic numbers is to describe the solution to the problem to someone. If the numbers don't show up in your verbal description, they're almost certainly magic.
