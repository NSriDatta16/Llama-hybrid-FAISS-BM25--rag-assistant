ARIMA model with huge MAPE value

I have a question about the role of the MAPE in the ARIMA model optimization. For a daily time series I have found that the best model (using the Box-Jenkins approach) is an ARIMA(7,0,7)(0,0,0). If I check the ACF and PACF of the model residuals, I see that there is no more information I can extract; see the right panel of the picture below. However, the MAPE value is as high as 18209.16. To me this sounds too high according to its definition. Have I missed something? Can I accept this ARIMA model even if it has such a high MAPE? By the way, I am getting similar results if I use auto.arima ; MAPE is always big.
