It would be something like this, OrgIds.ToList.Contains(p.OrginizationID) Though really I would do it more like this: var OrgIds = (from oh in this.Database.OrganizationsHierarchies join o in this.Database.Organizations on oh.OrganizationsId equals o.Id where (oh.Hierarchy.Contains(@OrgId)) || (oh.OrganizationsId == Id) select o.Id); List query = (from p in this.Database.Personnels where (OrgIds.Contains(p.OrigizationID) select p).ToList(); That way the final query to get personnel will execute containing the combined query from both.
