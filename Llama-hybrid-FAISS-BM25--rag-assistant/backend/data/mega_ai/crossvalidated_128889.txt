If you are a beginner I would recommend to catch up with theory so to have a better understanding of different methods. For example, there is great series of lectures on data mining by Trevor Hastie and Rob Tibshirani available here online . There also two books by the lecturers that are also available freely online: an introductory handbook and more advanced one . As about a specific method that you could try, consider using logistic regression . This is a pretty typical method for this kind of analysis. Also you have to remember that Naive Bayes classifier does not estimate probabilities precisely because it is based on some simplified assumptions on probability (so it is called "naive"). Because of that you should consider the estimates of Naive Bayes rather as some subjective weights rather than as reliable estimates of probability.
