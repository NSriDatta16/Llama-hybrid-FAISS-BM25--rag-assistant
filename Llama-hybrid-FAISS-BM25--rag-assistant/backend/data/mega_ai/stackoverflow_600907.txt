Java Image messes up when I run the .jnlp file

I have a method that gets called at the start of my program, and it works fine when I run the jar, but when I run the jnlp file it crashes. public void newImg(String i) { try { File file = new File(i); img = ImageIO.read(file); } } img is a bufferedImage, by the way.
