PCA - Removing variables with high loadings in several factors

I have variables with factor loadings similar to each other (PCA - Varimax). For example 0.536 and 0.602 etc. Please see the example: Self direction_10 . I have read that I can remove such variables. In my case I have done so and I got much clearer factors. Is there any reliable reference to support this decision? I have read that others have done it - but they hardly reference their work to support this! As a side note for example, I am keeping Achievement_7 even as Component 2 has a reasonably higher load compared to .416.
