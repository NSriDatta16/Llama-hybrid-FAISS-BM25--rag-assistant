Confounder (lurking variable) is a variable that influences both the dependent variable and independent variable. While you are right that feature interactions are "missing" in logistic regression I am not sure how can "adjusting for confounders help" What can definitely help is including these interactions in log.regression formula IF there are any significant ones. How do you know Domain knowledge and you suspect it Use random forest for example and deduce interactions from there. How do you include them? build a second model log.regression model and average predictions for example . Generally dont play with it, just use a model that does it automatically.
