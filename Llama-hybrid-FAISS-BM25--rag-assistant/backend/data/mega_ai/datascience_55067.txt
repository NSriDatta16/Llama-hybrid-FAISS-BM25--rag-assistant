Constrained Deep Learning

What are the ways to perform constrained optimization of weights in deep model? I am working on deep similarity learning, and many methods are based on constrained optimization; the vast majority of deep learning methods, however, only rely on unconstrained optimization. Are there any was to implement constraints in SGD?
