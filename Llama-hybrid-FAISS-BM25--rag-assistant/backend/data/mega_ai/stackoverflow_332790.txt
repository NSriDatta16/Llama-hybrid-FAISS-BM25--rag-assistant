Very rough rules of thumb generally more elements per layer for bigger input vectors. more layers may let you model more non-linear systems. If the kind of network you are using has delays in propagation , more layers may allow modelling of time series . Take care to have time jitter in the delays or it wont work very well. If this is just gobbledegook to you, ignore it. More layers lets you insert recurrent features. This can be very useful for discrimination tasks. You ANN implementation my not permit this. HTH
