In addition to familiarizing yourself with one of the widely used machine learning frameworks (e.g., tensorflow, pytorch, theano), I'd recommend reading an introductory book on machine learning. With your mathematical background, these should come easily to you, but they will give you an idea of the machine learning tools (and notational conventions) out there. Here are some suggestions: Kevin Murphy, Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective , 2012 As of this writing, still the newest comprehensive machine learning book out there. It covers a wide range of topics, including graphical models, some basics of deep learning, MCMC, and non-parametric models. Most chapters are fairly brief but given your mathematical background you might appreciate the conciseness. Great as a reference book. Ian Goodfellow et al., Deep Learning , 2016/17 If you mainly want to learn about deep learning, choose this book. Given how fast the field moves, this is the only book in this list which can give you up-to-date knowledge on this topic. Chris Bishop, Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning , 2006 A bit older now, but still great as a gentle introduction to machine learning. Covers topics such as Bayesian statistics, maximum likelihood, linear models, backpropagation in neural networks, graphical models, expectation maximization, variational inference. David Barber, Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning , 2010 If you fancy statistics, this book might be a good choice. No deep learning but lots of probabilities.
