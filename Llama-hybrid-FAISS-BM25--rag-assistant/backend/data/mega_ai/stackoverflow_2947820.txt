C# PredicateBuilder Entities: The parameter 'f' was not bound in the specified LINQ to Entities query expression

I needed to build a dynamic filter and I wanted to keep using entities. Because of this reason I wanted to use the PredicateBuilder from albahari. I created the following code: var invoerDatums = PredicateBuilder.True (); var inner = PredicateBuilder.False (); foreach (var filter in set.RapportInvoerFilter.ToList()) { if(filter.IsDate) { var date = DateTime.Parse(filter.Waarde); invoerDatums = invoerDatums.Or(o => o.Van >= date && o.Tot o.OnderzoekType == temp); } } invoerDatums = invoerDatums.And(inner); var onderzoeksVragen = entities.OnderzoeksVragen .AsExpandable() .Where(invoerDatums) .ToList(); When I ran the code there was only 1 filter which wasn't a date filter. So only the inner predicate was filled. When the predicate was executed I got the following error. The parameter 'f' was not bound in the specified LINQ to Entities query expression. While searching for an answer I found the following page . But this is already implemented in the LINQKit. Does anyone else experienced this error and know how to solve it?
