As an starting point, it will be good to create a recursive descent parser (RDP) (let's say you want to create your own flavour of BASIC and build a BASIC interpreter) to understand how to write a compiler. I found the best information in Herbert Schild's C Power Users, chapter 7. This chapter refers to another book of H. Schildt "C The complete Reference" where he explains how to create a calculator (a simple expression parser). I found both books on eBay very cheap. You can check the code for the book if you go to www.osborne.com or check in www.HerbSchildt.com I found the same code but for C# in his latest book
