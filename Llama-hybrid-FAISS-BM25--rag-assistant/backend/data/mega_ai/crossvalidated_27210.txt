Mixture model fixed effects

One standard model used with panel data is fixed effects: $y_{it} = \mu_i + \theta_t + \epsilon_{it}$, where $i$ is the individual and $t$ is time subscripts. This can be estimated easily with OLS and dummy variables. The model assumes that there is a single underlying time series, $\theta_t$ for $t = 1,2,...,T$. All individuals in the data are assumed to follow this time series plus some individual effect, which is constant relative to time. Suppose, however, that there are two or more groups of individuals, that each group has its own time series, and that, before looking at the data, we don't know who is in which group. I would like to estimate the fixed effects model in this case and to figure out which individual is in which group / cluster . The approach that I thought of is that the model should become: $y_{it} = \mu_i + \sum_j \pi_{ij} \theta_{jt} + \epsilon_{it}$. $j$ indicates the group $1,2,...,J$. $\pi_{ij}$ is the probability that individual $i$ is in group $j$. $\theta_{jt}$ is the time effect for group $j$ at time $t$. In my particular application, $\{\pi_{ij}\}$ needs to be a set of additional parameters. However, I can see that in other applications, it could be modeled as a function of some covariates. Is this model a good approach? Has anyone tried it before? How do I estimate this model? The model has a lot of parameters. I've tried basic optimization, and it has not worked. Ideally, I am looking for software to do the estimation, such as a package in R; or, a solid reference that I could use to program this. If the model that I've proposed is not a good approach, how else could I solve this problem? One possibility that I could see is first figuring out which individual belongs to which cluster, and then estimating a regular fixed effects model on each cluster. The issue then is how to perform the data classification. Regardless of the approach, I am still looking either for software or a good reference.
