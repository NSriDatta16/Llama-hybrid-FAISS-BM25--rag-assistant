How to reduce the Root mean square error

I have dataset which describe "how many passenger arriving in some airport " and I would like to predict how many passenger arriving in monthly bases for next year. The features that I have is the following : year, month, airport, number of passenger (monthly) In the data, three out of of 50 airports are usually have huge passengers arriving. I have used random forest classifier but the issue that i'm encounter is I have RMSE is high. As a result i see huge different between the actual value and predicting value. How to fix this issue ?
