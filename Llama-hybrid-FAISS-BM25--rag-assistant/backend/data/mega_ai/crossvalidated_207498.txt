You should use a count regression model (such as Poisson or negative binomial), or possibly logistic regression, with "school" or "class" as the independent variable. First, I find it strange that every classroom has exactly 25 kids. That argues for either using logistic regression on the proportion of left handers (rather that the count) or else using a count regression model and accounting for total number of kids in the class. Second, since left handedness is relatively rare (about 10% of people) you are going to get a lot of classrooms with small counts. This argues against using t-test/ANOVA. Third (as an aside) what about ambidextrous kids? Handedness is not really a dichotomy. There are people who use different hands for different things in all sorts of combinations. This argues for using a better measure of handedness.
