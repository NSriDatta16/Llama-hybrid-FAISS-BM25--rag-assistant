I'm not really clear what you are trying to predict, but let's suppose you want to investigate how sign-ups relate to gender and age. Well you either sign-up or your don't, i.e. it's a binary variable. So you could try logistic regression . That's would allow you to predict the probability of signing up give the persons gender and age (and anything else you have).
