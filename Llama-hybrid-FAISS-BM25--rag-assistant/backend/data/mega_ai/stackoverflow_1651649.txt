How to implement a "flag for moderator attention" feature on a Comment model in a Rails app?

I have a Comment model in my app but am encountering a lot of problematic postings that I have to remove manually. What I want to do is add a "flag for moderator attention" feature so that users of the app have the ability to remove a comment from view without my need to review all content in the app. I'm thinking that after a comment has been flagged three times, I will remove it from view automatically and then when I have a chance to review these postings I will decide whether to allow them or permanently remove them from view. What I'm having trouble with is how to implement this. Should I have a separate table that records all items that have been flagged? Or should I have a "flag count" field as part of the Comment table that keeps track of how many times a comment has been flagged? A separate table would allow me to keep track of detailed information about the flagging actions - who is flagging, which IP they are flagging from, etc. This is what I'm leaning towards. But perhaps a gem or plugin already exists that does this type of thing?
