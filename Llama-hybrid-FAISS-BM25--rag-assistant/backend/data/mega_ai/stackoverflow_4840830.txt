I am new in jQuery too and, I believe, the way you have it would not work since "data" even though could have been served by your php as a div, a paragraph, etc, it does not exist as of yet. Therefore, you could not be modal-ed, ... I think. However, though, you could load that data into a hidden div and modal it: $('#myDiv').html(data); $('#myDiv').modal();
