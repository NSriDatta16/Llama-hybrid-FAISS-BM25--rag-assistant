There are already many great answers, but I would like to provide my two cents. He mentioned that if a pharmaceutical drug was found to be effective on a cohort of men all having similar age groups, lifestyles, backgrounds and medical histories - the best we can do is say that any man from the general public who fits this cohort profile will likely experience similar effects from this drug : we can not really make any individual prediction apart from this. How is this not a prediction for an individual ? It is for an individual with that age, lifestyle, background, and medical history. The prediction for the individual is made on the basis of their belonging to the group. If your professor's requirement is that the prediction be bespoke for the individual, I think that is a fairly high standard to have. This would require encoding all information on the individual in a vector to be used in regression. That's a tall order (and a wide design matrix). He mentioned the field of "Survival Analysis" and told us that statistical models are routinely used to estimate the survival odds and hazard of surviving at the group level and not the individual level - he gave us an example: if you have 1 Male Asian Patient and 99 Male Non-Asian patient, you have no choice but to analyze the average survival rates of MALES ... how can you perform "Asian Specific Analysis" and make inferences about the average Asian when you only have 1 observation!? I don't think a reasonable person would argue that this could be done. He closed by mentioning the new and emerging field of "Precision Medicine" in which "accurate molecular taxonomy of diseases that enhances diagnosis and treatment and tailors disease management to the individual characteristics of each patient " ( https://www.mdpi.com/2227-9717/10/6/1200/pdf ) - i.e. for the first time, medical treatments are being considered for the individual patient's condition, and not for the average profile of this patient (although he mentioned that this is still in its infancy and should be used with great caution). The extent to which this is being done is often greatly exaggerated. Morse and Kim 1 identify personalized medicine (sometimes used interchangeably with "precision" medicine" as "[an emerging field] with a goal of applying genomic information as a predictor of disease risk as well as individualization of drug therapy". No one person is completely and uniquely described by their genetics, lifestyle, and demographic factors. These are only means of further conditioning the outcome on additional variables which may be relevant to the outcome. It is merely an extension of the approaches your professor seems to be criticizing. With this, he largely dismissed "Data Science" as a "pseudo science" and said although many "Data Science" models have demonstrated success, the methodology is not mathematically rigorous and can only be considered as an "engineered solution" (e.g. a Random Forest predicting if an individual patient will develop a disease - he said that this should not be done for many reasons, e.g. interpretability, blackbox, lack of odd's ratio and individual prediction). This seems mostly handwavy to me. What does lack of odds ratios have anything to do with individualized prediction. Furthermore, to criticize machine learning and data science on their inability to provide an individualized prediction is simply begging the question -- we're trying to determine if individualized prediction is even possible. What I anticipate has happened is that your professor has interpreted the word "personalized" in its literal sense. That this prediction $y_i$ is bespoke for me, like a well tailored suit. In that sense, it seems personalized prediction is not possible, because as I have said no one is completely and uniquely described by their finite set of covariates. However, that does not preclude us from using those predictions to some success. I do not know if smoking will give me lung cancer or not, but based on data obtained from people who are unlike me in several ways I choose not to smoke. Additionally, as the set of covariates we use to condition on increases, we shrink the group of people for which the prediction applies. Granted, this is not personalization in the way your professor might want, but shit it's the closest we've gotten now isn't it? If you condition the prediction on my behaviour which is so finely measured and so meticulously recored, that is fairly personal. Data science and machine learning -- which I think your professor unduly criticizes -- are really great examples of this. Just open your friends youtube homepage to see just how well predictions can be personalized.
