So you want to learn a dynamics model of some system, and to improve the robustness of the model, you want to sample a wide range of inputs from a GAN. While it's certainly possible to learn a dynamics model, I don't think it's a good idea to generate inputs exclusively with a GAN -- indeed, GANs are known for mode dropping and mode collapse, exactly what you don't want. I would advise using VAEs if you want to go down this path, since they're not as vulnerable to this problem. There is a large body of work which generates synthetic data (for example, computer renderings of 3D scenes), and then uses conditional GANs to improve the photorealism of the renderings. This avoids mode dropping (since you're in full control of the computer rendering). Of course the downside is that it's up to the programmer to generate varied, interesting, and challenging synthetic data. A complementary line of attack is data augmentation -- it's often possible to easily perturb a single input datapoint slightly in many interesting ways (for images: flipping, cropping, rotating, color adjustments, elastic deformation, adding rain/fog, etc) in order to synthesize new datapoints.
