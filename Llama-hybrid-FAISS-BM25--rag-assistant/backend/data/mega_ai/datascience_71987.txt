XGBoost Objective is Changed

I am trying to use XGBoost in python for logistic regression. I am calling it as follows import numpy as np from xgboost import XGBClassifier x_train = np.array([[1], [2], [3], [4]]) y_train = np.array([0, .25, .75, 1]) params = { "objective": "reg:logistic" } model = XGBClassifier(**params) model.fit(x_train, y_train) print(model.objective) This outputs an objective of "multi:softprob" instead of "reg:logistic." Therefore, it isn't doing a logistic regression. How can I make sure that XGBoost doesn't switch the objective?
