Not really an official methodology, but I have done a lot of solo development (independent consultant and ISV), and here are the things I have found to be important: Find an online organization (like oisv.com ) to share thoughts and ideas Make sure you take time to interact with actual people in the real world Set project goals, deadlines, and milestones Take time to do appropriate up-front design and project planning Set aside working hours are stick to them Don't work too much and burn yourself out Nothing is ever perfect, so strive for good code that works, not perfection Get some non-programming hobbies
