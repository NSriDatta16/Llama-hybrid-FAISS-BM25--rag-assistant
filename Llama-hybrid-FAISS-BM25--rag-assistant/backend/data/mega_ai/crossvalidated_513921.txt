Kurtosis comparison with different range

I simulated an agent based modeling that individuals can end up with a different range of attitudes. Individuals in Model 1 end up with the attitude range -3 +3 Individuals Model 2 end up with the attitude range -25 (min) + 25 (max) In Model 1, individuals CAN reach attitude -25 or 25, but they didn't. I think it is similar to the situation where the samples with extreme attributes are not available in the sampling process. What I'd like to measure is attitude polarization. So I use excess kurtosis and standard deviation as dependent variables. Is it statistically appropriate to compare Model 1 and Model 2 by kurtosis?
