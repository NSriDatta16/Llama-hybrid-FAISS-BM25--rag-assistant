You even don't need to perform any development for displaying the static block on a particular category page or any cms or layout based page. Use Widgets functionality of Magento. Go to "CMS -> Widgets" Press "Add New Widget Instance" button Select widget type (in your case it is "CMS Static Block") and theme where it should be shown. Press "Continue" button. Type in "Widget Instance Title" and select stores where it should be displayed. Press "Add Layout Update" button and select your widget "display on" settings (Categories, Products, CMS Pages, Checkout Pages, etc) and select in wich part of the page you want to show it up. Go to "Widget Options" tab and select static block which you want to show up. Hope it will help you with your problem without any development :)
