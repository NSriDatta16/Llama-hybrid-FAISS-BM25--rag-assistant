Distance from hyperplane in SVM rbf kernel in R

I am running ksvm in R(using kernlab package) for a highly imbalanced data.Is there any way i can get the distance of my test data points(each of dimension 8-10) from the hyperplane?so that i can conclude the far one point is from the hyperplane the more it belongs to that class(except misclassified points).is there any other package in R which can give me that distance?(even if not given directly how can i compute?)
