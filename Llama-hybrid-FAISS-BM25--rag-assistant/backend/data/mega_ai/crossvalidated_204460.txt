Can SMOTE deal with categorical variables

I am dealing with a highly unbalanced dataset to detect hacker intrusion in a network (~23k 0 or negative events, and ~1k 1 or positive events). I am using sklearn random forest algorithm. To deal with the unbalanced issue, I am using SMOTE based on this code . However, most of my variables are dummies. Given that the code requires the data go as a numpy array, they are coded not as factors or categories, but as integer. SMOTE thus creates the synthetic data with these dummy variables (originally coded 0/1) as floats. Is there any way around this? Otherwise, for a variable that would originally be, say, 1, I get 0.988 or 0.233. I thought about recoding these floats as 0/1 depending if they are 0.5 but this doesn't seem the correct approach. Or is there a way to make a numpy array treat an integer as a factor?
