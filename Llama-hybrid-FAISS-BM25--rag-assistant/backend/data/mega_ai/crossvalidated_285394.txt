Is standard deviation useful for frequency of occurrence?

Frequency of occurrence (FO) is a simple metric measuring the proportion of samples (often expressed as a percentage) where a certain item is present. It can be calculated as follows: $FO= 100\% \times \frac{n}{N}$, where n is the number of samples where a certain item was observed and N the total number of samples. For binary data, FO is equivalent to average of a binary vector multiplied by 100%. I.e: x Following this logic, it is possible to calculate standard deviation for the FO estimate: 100*sd(x) # [1] 52.70463 Yet the standard deviation appears to be affected by the number of observations: 100*mean(c(rep(1,5*10^6), rep(0,5*10^6))) # [1] 50 100*sd(c(rep(1,5*10^6), rep(0,5*10^6))) # [1] 50 But does not seem to converge the FO estimate in every case: 100*mean(c(rep(1,2*10^6), rep(0,8*10^6))) # [1] 20 100*sd(c(rep(1,2*10^6), rep(0,8*10^6))) # [1] 40 My questions are: 1) What does standard deviation mean in practice for frequency of occurrence? 2) Is this metric or other variance derivates (standard error, confidence intervals) useful for expressing the uncertainty of a FO estimate?
