magento - Product page 404 error

I've copied products from a Magento platform with 1 store to a Magento platform with 2 stores. After that, the product's page from one category page of 1st store redirects me to a 404 error page. The product is shown in the admin catalog, and is listed with the other products in the index. But, when I click to see the detailed product, it gives me the 404 page. I use magento 1.1.7.
