Logistic regression with time-specific intercept

I'm trying to fit a pooled logistic regression model with time-specific intercept on time-series data, i.e., $$\text{logit} Pr(y|t,x)=\beta_0(t)+\beta_1x.$$ The pooled data set contains person-month samples, where I have multiple observations for each person at different times $t$ . What estimator should I use to estimate the coefficients? Is there any package in Python or R that I can use for fitting such a model?
