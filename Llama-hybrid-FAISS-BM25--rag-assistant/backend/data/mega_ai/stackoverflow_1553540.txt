No, the Content-Length value must be the exact content length : When a Content-Length is given in a message where a message-body is allowed, its field value MUST exactly match the number of OCTETs in the message-body. HTTP/1.1 user agents MUST notify the user when an invalid length is received and detected. So you cannot send just an estimated Content-Length value to get a progress bar.
