Is it better to look at ECDFs than PDFs when exploring empirical sample distributions?

I know that when plotting CDFs, ECDFs, or PDFs by using finite samples, we must be doing some form of interpolation. As far as I guess, empirical cumulative density functions (ECDFs) perform linear or stair-case interpolation in most software that plot them. Which is a rough interpolation with sharp edges. But my eyes (and the natural neural network in my head) can automatically interpolate smooth curves by looking at the rough ECDFs. Which is nice in my view. Alternatively, I can represent that ECDF into a PDF. But this will require me to interpolate using a software that is different than my eyes (and the natural neural network in my head). Usually such software didn't have the chance to evolve for billions of years (which I had), and usually we end up with KDE where we need to pick a kernel and a bandwidth which affects how the smoothing of the interpolation. And I cannot use parametric density estimation methods because the goal here is to explore an empirically collected sample points. Assuming any known distribution will reduce my ability in identifying the true distribution. The problem I face when I look at PDFs is that I always worry about how the smoothing is affecting the shape of the PDF to that extent that I end up asking my self: should I believe this PDF? However, I don't face the PDFs problem above when I look at ECDFs as I know that what I look at is the result of very primitive interpolation (linear/stair-case) that cannot be too misguiding to my eyes. So my questions are: Is the problem above really a problem? Or is it a side effect of simply me not knowing enough about statistical methods of visualizing the data? Is there anything in the tool-kit of statistics that can solve my PDF problem above? What are generally the preferred data exploring methods that are usually used as first-attempt methods?
