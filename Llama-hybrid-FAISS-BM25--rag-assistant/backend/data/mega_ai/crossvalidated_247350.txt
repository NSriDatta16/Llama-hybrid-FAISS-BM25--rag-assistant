Reginald, you have probably moved on by now, but for people that stumble across this post I would like to note that the DHARMa package (available from CRAN, see here ) that I have created solves this problem, i.e. it will allow you to test if the residuals are compatible with the assumptions of nb (or any other distributions for that matter). From the package description: The DHARMa package uses a simulation-based approach to create readily interpretable scaled residuals from fitted generalized linear mixed models. Currently supported are all 'merMod' classes from 'lme4' ('lmerMod', 'glmerMod'), 'glm' (including 'negbin' from 'MASS', but excluding quasi-distributions) and 'lm' model classes. Alternatively, externally created simulations, e.g. posterior predictive simulations from Bayesian software such as 'JAGS', 'STAN', or 'BUGS' can be processed as well. The resulting residuals are standardized to values between 0 and 1 and can be interpreted as intuitively as residuals from a linear regression. The package also provides a number of plot and test functions for typical model mispecification problem, such as over/underdispersion, zero-inflation, and spatial / temporal autocorrelation.
