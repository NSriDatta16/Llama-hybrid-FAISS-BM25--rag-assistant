CLT - Adding small samples to one big sample

According to CLT, the SE is the SD of the distribution of several samples means. This SE depends on each sample mean, the SD of each sample and N (the size of each sample which I test). Since there is no relation to the number of samples, why can't I add all the samples to get a more precise estimated average, more precise SD and more precise SE ? Numerical example - If I have 5 samples of 100 observations each, I can calculate each SD, mean ... But why can't I just add all of the 5 samples to get a big one sample of 500 ? Once I calculate the mean and SD of this big sample - It will be much more precise. Bottom line - since we know how the mean of samples is distributed, why cant we find the parameters just according to one big sample ? Is there any importance for samples number?
