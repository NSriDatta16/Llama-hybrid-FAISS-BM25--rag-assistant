If you're planning to only push out the app to others in your organization, you could enter the Enterprise developer program, which allows you to distribute the apps within your organization for free. Note, that the Enterprise program requires a minimum of 500 employees at your company. http://developer.apple.com/programs/iphone/enterprise/ You could also join the standard ($99) developer program, which lets you install your app on up to 100 devices through ad-hoc distribution. Since your app won't need to go through the approval process, like apps headed for the App Store do, you can feel free to use any tools like PhoneGap or MonoTouch to develop your app. Or Xcode of course!
