One thing you may wish to consider is to change the recovery model of the database to simple. If you do not intend to perform any write activity to the database then you may as well benefit from automatic truncation of the transaction log, and eliminate the administrative overhead of using the other recovery models. You can always perform ad-hoc backups should you make any significant structural changes i.e. to indexes. You may also wish to place the tables that are unused in a separate Filegroup away from the data files that will be accessed. Perhaps consider placing the unused tables on lower grade disk storage to benefit from cost savings. Some things to consider with DBCC SHRINKDATABASE, you cannot shrink beyond the minimum size of your database. Try issuing the statement in the following form. DBCC SHRINKDATABASE (DBName, TRUNCATEONLY); Cheers, John
