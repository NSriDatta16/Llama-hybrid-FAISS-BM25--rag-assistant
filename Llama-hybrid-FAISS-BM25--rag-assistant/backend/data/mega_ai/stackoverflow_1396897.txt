I try to organize all such invoke messages to the GUI as fire and forget (handling the exception the GUI can throw due to the race condition on disposing the form). This way if it never executes no harm is done. If the GUI needs to respond to the working thread it has a way of effectively reversing the notification. For simple needs BackgroundWorker already handles this.
