It could be just chance, meaning that that particular 80-20 split can be "easier to learn" than the average. How do you get the average? By increasing your cross-validation $k$ to a value such that your accuracy remains stable, in the sense that if you repeat the procedure you get a similar accuracy. You can try to do a second iteration of your 80-20 split, and check the accuracy, very probably it will be lower than 77%, and probably lower than 70%. Also, remember that if you are using a random seed your first split will always be the same, even if you run it multiple times.
