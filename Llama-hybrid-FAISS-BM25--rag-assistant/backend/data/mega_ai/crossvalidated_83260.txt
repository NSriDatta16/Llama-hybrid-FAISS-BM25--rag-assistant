How to calculate Prob > chi2 in R to test model fit of conditional logistic regression

I used the clogit function (from the survival package) to run a conditional logistic regression in R with a big dataset of 1:M matched pairs with n=300368964 and number of events= 39995. model I received following results: coef exp(coef) se(coef) z Pr(>|z|) OVB -0.0498174 0.9514031 0.0166275 -2.996 0.00273 ** BVB 0.0277405 1.0281289 0.0304956 0.910 0.36300 CVC 1.1709851 3.2251683 0.1089709 10.746 Since Rsquare equals 0 and the test ratios seems very high, I tried to plot the results to check whether the model fits. But I wasn't able to plot it properly. I would online many papers which use the ratio Prob > chi2 = 0 from Stata as test ratio to proof the model fit. How could I calculate this ratio in R? Are there any other ways I could check the model fit of my clogit results? I would appreciate any help. Thanks you very much in advance.
