If the density is proportional to a constant, then it has the same value at each point in the domain being considered (not stated in your question). That is, the density is uniform over whatever subpace $(\theta_1,\theta_2,\theta_3)$ is defined to have support on. Presumably this is for a Bayesian problem in which case a either a proper prior or an improper prior* is being defined. * (it's quite possible that the intent is to define an improper, flat prior over say the whole of $\mathbb{R}^3$ . This is a common thing in Bayesian statistics) More context might allow more specific answers but I think this covers all the likely use-cases.
