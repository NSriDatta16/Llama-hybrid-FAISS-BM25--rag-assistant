When we load the iris data directly from sklearn datasets , we don't have to worry about slicing the columns for data and target as sklearn itself would have organized the data in a manner we can use to directly to feed into the model. But when we are loading from the data from csv file, we have to slice the columns as per our needs and organize it in a way so that it can be fed into in the model. When you execute the below lines after reading csv file using read_csv in pandas x=iris.data y=iris.target you are actually referring to the attributes of the pandas dataframe and not the actual data and target column values like in sklearn. You will have to use iris['data'], iris['target'] to access the column values if it is present in the data set.
