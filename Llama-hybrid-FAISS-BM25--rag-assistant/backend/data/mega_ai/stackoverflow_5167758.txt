Setting PERL5LIB at runtime will not affect Perl's search path. You need to export the variable before executing the interpreter. Alternatively you can modify @INC at compile time (also possible to do in a separate script/module): BEGIN { unshift @INC, "/path/to/dir" } This is what the lib pragma does.
