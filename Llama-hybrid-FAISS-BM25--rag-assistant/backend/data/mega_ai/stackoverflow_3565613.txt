Interesting question. I don't think there is an elegant way to handle this; even multi-tasking falls short of being able to wake the app to perform a task. The only thing you're allowed to do is schedule a Local Notification, but this is only allowed to increase the badge number - sending a badge number of "0" indicates "no change". Sorry there isn't a better answer. andrew
