Actionscript classes to 1 SWC file

I'm using Flash Builder 4 (the version after Flex Builder 3, so very similar to Flex Builder 3) and have a bunch of actionscript classes that I frequently need to reference. I have them in a separate folder/package to keep things clean. I know that it's possible to create a SWC from these actionscript files. My question is how do I do it in Flash Builder 4 or Flex Builder 3. Do I need other tools? My objective is just to use the SWC in the project and keep things clean instead of dragging around all these files.
