Instead of calling a function that contains SetLength a zillion times, rather preallocate the storage, and pass the preallocated arrays into the function. One such way is something like this: const NUM_ARRAYS = 1000; ARRAY_SIZE = 1000; type TMyArray = array [0..ARRAY_SIZE] of Integer; var MyStorage: array[0..NUM_ARRAYS] of TMyArray; procedure DoWork(var AArray: TMyArray); begin Blah; end; procedure MainLoop; var i: Integer; begin for i := 0 to High(MyStorage) do begin DoWork(MyStorage[i]); end; end; This will be significantly faster than calling SetLength inside an inner loop. The main thing to watch out for is using too much memory for the hardware.
