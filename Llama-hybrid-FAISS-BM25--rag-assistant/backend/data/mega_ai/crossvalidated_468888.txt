Following my comment above, here is a reproducible answer: library(CARBayesST) ################################################# #### Run the model on simulated data on a lattice ################################################# #### set up the regular lattice x.easting $samples$ Y # Get mean (or median) of the column for the average posterior prediction colMeans(model $samples$ Y) Note how this prints out values for those 51 values set to NA. We can calculate a naive accuracy as: caret::RMSE(colMeans(model$samples$Y), Y[950:1000]) Note I took the colMeans , although you may want to take the median. You can also use other accuracy metrics to your liking. Note that increasing the n.sample parameter greatly increased my accuracy (and most examples you will see will have 20,000+). This is my shot at the problem - I am working with a similar model set. Let me know what you think! Hope it is helpful.
