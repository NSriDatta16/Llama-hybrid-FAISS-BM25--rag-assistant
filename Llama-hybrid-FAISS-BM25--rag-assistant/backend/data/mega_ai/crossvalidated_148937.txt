Best way to fit an ARIMA model when the values of the variables don't change

I have a time series with various features that record sensor data. It can be the case that the values are recorded although they did not change compared to the previous observation. Hence, the series has multiple parts where the values of many consecutive observations are constant. As far as I know, this is very problematic when fitting an ARIMA model. My idea is to simply remove the parts of the series where nothing changes, thereby only fitting the model to the parts where things actually happen. Does this make any sense or will I mess up the coefficients that way?
