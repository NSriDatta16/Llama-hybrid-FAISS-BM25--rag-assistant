You are initializing two copies of vector DayNames = vector (); because you included the header twice. You should replace it with extern vector DayNames; in the h file and vector DayNames = vector (); in the cpp file. Also you seem to have two copies of ostream & operator The reason your header guards isn't helping this case is that when you include the headers, you basically duplicate the definitions in all your files that you have included the header. In C, when you declare a variable, you basically instantiate it/allocate static space for it. When you put the variable declaration in the header, what you are effectively doing is allocating static storage space for the variable in two different objects, giving you your error.
