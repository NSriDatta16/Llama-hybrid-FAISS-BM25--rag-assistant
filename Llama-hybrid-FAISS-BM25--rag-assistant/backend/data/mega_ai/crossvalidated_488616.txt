How to combine outputs from different non-machine learning prediction models?

I have a list of cancer mutations and I have run five different bioinformatics tools that predict whether a particular mutation will lead to a more aggressive form of cancer or not (0-neutral;1-aggressive). I also have a ground truth set of labels that can be used to judge the performance of the individual tools. So basically I have five lists of 1s and 0s and I want to learn the optimal weights to combine them in order to get the best ensemble model and compare that with the ground truth. Is there any way to accomplish this task in python? P.S: I have read about stacking classifiers from python but I can't use them here because I am not using traditional classifiers to perform the classification task.
