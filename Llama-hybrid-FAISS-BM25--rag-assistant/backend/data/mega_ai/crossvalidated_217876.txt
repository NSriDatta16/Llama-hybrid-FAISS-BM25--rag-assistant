Interpretation of feature contribution in random forest

In the featureContribution function (in the R package rfFC ), what should we interpret if all the scores for all the features are negative? For example, if there were 7 features and after running the featureContribution function we got feature values as: fc = c(-0.031544542, -0.064272583, -0.02307187, -0.000213402, -0.040743263, -0.042137713, -0.080828973) Then what is the final interpretation? Is it something like all the features are not contributing to the prediction for this data point? The github code for the package can be found here . Please find a reproducible example to work with below # # randomForest - For random forest model library(randomForest) # # rfFc - For feature contribution library(rfFC) set.seed(294056) # # Read input data df = read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kartheekpnsn/MyScripts/master/Files/input.csv") # # Remove this column df = df[-8] # # Remove status column df$Status = NULL # # Master data 1-7 columns and Anomaly column mydf = cbind(df[,1:7], df["Anomaly"]) rm(df) # # Make Anomaly column as factor mydf[,8] = as.factor(mydf[,8]) # # Change the name of Anomaly column to Status (not necessary) colnames(mydf)[8] = "Status" # # X: predictors X
