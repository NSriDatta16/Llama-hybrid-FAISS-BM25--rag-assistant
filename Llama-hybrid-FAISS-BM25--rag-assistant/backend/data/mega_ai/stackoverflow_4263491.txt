SQL Server Service wont start up

I just rebooted my development server but when the server came back up, I can no longer connect to the DB. I can't even connect from the Management Studio on the server. So I check the services and the SQL Server (MSSQLSERVER) and SQL Server Agent (MSSQLSERVER) are not started. Starting them gives me an error Windows could not start the XXX service. Any ideas? EDIT: In addition, I ran the service from the command line and noticed this error: 2010-11-24 15:38:32.02 Server Error: 26055, Severity: 16, State: 1. 2010-11-24 15:38:32.02 Server The SQL Server failed to initialize VIA suppo rt library [QLVipl.dll]. This normally indicates the VIA support library does no t exist or is corrupted. Please repair or disable the VIA network protocol. Erro r: 0x7e. So I went into The Configuration Manager -> Network Configuration -> Protocols and disabed VIA. That allowed me to start it back up again... but I'm worried that is should be enabled... -Evan
