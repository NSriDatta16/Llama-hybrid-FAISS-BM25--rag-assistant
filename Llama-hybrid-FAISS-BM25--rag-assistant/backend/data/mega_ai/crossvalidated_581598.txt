Bayes Nets - Understanding Inference

I was wondering if anyone could explain the following to me (from https://lips.cs.princeton.edu/complexity-of-inference-in-bayes-nets/ ): "Briefly, recall that a Bayesian network consists of a directed acyclic graph with a random variable X_i at each vertex. Let $\pi_i$ be the parents of $X_i$ . Then the Bayes net defines a distribution over $X = (X_1,\dots,X_n)$ of the form \begin{equation*} \Pr[X] = \prod_{i=1}^n \Pr[X_i | \pi_i]\end{equation*} Inference in a Bayes net corresponds to calculating the conditional probability $\Pr[Y | Z = z]$ , where $Y,Z \subset \{ X_1,\dots,X_n \}$ are sets of latent and observed variables, respectively." I understand the $\Pr[X]$ sectopm well enough, but am confused about the inference section; my guess is that $\Pr[Y]$ is the probability of the outcome variable/node but I'm not sure what $Z = z$ means and how this would be represented as a graph. Thank you! :)
