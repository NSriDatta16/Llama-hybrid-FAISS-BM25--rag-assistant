Poisson process - measuring empirical changes

I was recently discussing Poisson processes in industrial settings with a colleague and he came up with a great question. Let's say that defective products on a manufacturing line tend to occur with an average of 1 defective unit per 1000 units produced. We study the intervals (number of good units produced) between the defective units and find they are exponentially distributed. This is a Poisson process, so we can use the Poisson distribution to identify probability of N defects in a certain number of units produced. Industrial process changes are put in place that are supposed to reduce the defect rate to an average of 1 defective unit per 3000 units produced. Presuming that intervals between defects will still be exponentially distributed, how many units do we need to see produced before we can be confident (to some fairly high degree) in saying that the process changes were effective in reducing defects? Going one step further, is there a way (without observing many hundreds of thousands of units and checking for defects) to make a statement about the new defect rate? I studied Poisson processes a bit in grad school, but never had any question like this. Thanks!
