JSON is an excellent solution and very fast, although splitting strings is very fast too. You may also want to look into using window.name as a client-based storage solution. The window.name property can easily store a few megabytes worth of data. I've played around with my own implementation. You "String-ify" your JSON data and stash it in window.name. When your page loads, you grab window.name and "JSON-ify" it, assign it to a JavaScript variable and see if you got what you expected, if not, go grab it from the server via AJAX. I use Prototype for my JSON-string conversion and AJAX, but you can just as easily use jQuery. http://www.thomasfrank.se/sessionvars.html
