As said in the comment, you don't need machine learning to solve such problem, at least not as a solution to start with. This kind of problems can be easily solved with things like: Clever set of regular expressions. Using automated spellchecker to fix the typos. Using approximate search software, e.g. Elasticsearch , that matches words based on their similarities, rather than using exact matches. Try any of those, or their combinations first. This should solve vast majority of the simple cases. Maybe it would be enough? It it is not enough, you would at least have a benchmark to compare with (if your machine learning solution works not better than this, you'd at least know it is not worth it). Moreover, it can help with solving many different problems: It can help with labeling the data. You can use it for validating the results obtained using machine learning solution (what are the discrepancies between rule-based solution vs machine learning? what does this tell you?). The rule-based system can be used to solve the easy cases cheaply, so you would need to use the machine learning heavy guns only for the non-trivial cases. It saves you, and your bosses', frustration, since you would have something that works early on, rather than waiting for the very first results for months till you polish your deep learning model. Finally, after all this, if you decide to try machine learning, you would be probably interested in character-level models. Again, probably best to start simple, with something like character-level recurrent neural network and if this doesn't work well enough, try more complicated models.
