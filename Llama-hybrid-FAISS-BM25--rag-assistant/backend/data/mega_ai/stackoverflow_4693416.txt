Firstly, remember, pcap sees only packets. It doesn't see "outgoing" or "incoming" - simply packets. So yes, you must filter using the src / dst in the ip headers. There is no other way to tell whether the packet is incoming or outgoing. Secondly, yes, there is nothing stopping an adapter having multiple IP addresses. So you need to grab the IP addresses configured from that adapter. pcap_findalldevs() (WinPCap Documentation) ought to help you here, from which you should be able to deduce which devices you want to monitor.
