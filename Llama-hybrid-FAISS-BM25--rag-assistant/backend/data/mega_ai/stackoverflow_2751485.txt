Fragment caching

I would like to fragment cache part of a page. On the view I have . In the controller: def index read_fragment("saved_area") end In config/production: config.cache_store = :file_store, File.join(RAILS_ROOT, 'tmp', 'cache') The file was created in the tmp/cache directory. But I am not sure if the cache is being used in the request, since I presume there should be a line in the log stating that the cache is being used (and there is not).
