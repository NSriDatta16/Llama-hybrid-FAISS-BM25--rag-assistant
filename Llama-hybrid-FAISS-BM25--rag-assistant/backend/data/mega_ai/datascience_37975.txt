What is the intuition behind using 2 consecutive convolutional filters in a Convolutional Neural Network?

I understand the purpose of Convolutional filters (or kernels). I visualize them as learnable feature extractors. E.g. Extract vertical edges or horizontal edges, etc. Could somebody kindly explain to me the intuition behind stacking 2 or more consecutive convolution filters? Why couldn't the 2 filters be merged into 1? Picture from Andrew Ng's video Video URL Here is the link to Andrew Ng's lecture on Machine learning as a reference
