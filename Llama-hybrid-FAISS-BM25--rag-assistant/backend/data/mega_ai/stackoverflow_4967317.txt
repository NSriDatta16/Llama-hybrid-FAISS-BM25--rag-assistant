In what type of application or scenario PL/SQL is better as back-end?

I am a java/j2ee developer. I always like JPA/JTA or hibernate for ORM. Since it gives me portability. But for large scale application, portability is not that important sometimes. Lots of time they ask to use PL/SQL as BE. I always find it un necessary. Apart from ARRAY and scheduling etc. Cos, with PL/SQL, application logic gets fragmented in java and PLSQL. What are business / application scenario where PLSQL is better in-terms of performance / design / maintainability.
