Does CRNN use sparse tensor value for its label?

I just read paper about cnn + rnn for text recognition. The labels of dataset is tensor of char index (e.g [0, 1, 2 ] for image with label "abc"). Since the label of each input has different length do I need to convert the label to sparse tensor value ? since the paper does not mention about it.
