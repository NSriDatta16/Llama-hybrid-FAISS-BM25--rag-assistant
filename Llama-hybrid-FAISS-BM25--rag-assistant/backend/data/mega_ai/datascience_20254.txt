From what you said, you are constrained by the following: No pre-defined dataset of conversation to train a model No use of APIs for pragmatic reasons - presumably to have better control over what goes on under the hood (my guess). To be honest, you may as well just try putting together an expert system with a programming language you feel comfortable with. For what you hope to do in chatbot form, you would basically prompt people for answers to various yes/no or multiple choice questions. You could have it ask questions to determine someone's BMI for instance, as well as any other questions you may find relevant to determining someone's health. Take a look at the quizzes on this site for inspiration: http://counsellingresource.com/quizzes/ This isn't as sophisticated as the Neural Conversational Model you mention, but this approach does not require any training data - which from what you say is a major constraint to what you're doing.
