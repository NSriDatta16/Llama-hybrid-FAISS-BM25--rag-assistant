How to change the pooling to adaptpooling before FC layer in the Inception-ResnetV2 model in keras

Now I am using the keras model: Inception-ResnetV2 to do image classification using transfer learning. The main code about this model is as following: def model_InceptionResNetV2(img_dim, num_label): print('begin to get model') input_tensor = Input(shape=img_dim) #InceptionResNetV2 # base_model = InceptionV3(include_top=False, # weights='imagenet', # input_shape=img_dim) base_model = InceptionResNetV2(include_top=False, input_shape=img_dim, weights='imagenet') bn = BatchNormalization()(input_tensor) x = base_model(bn) x = GlobalAveragePooling2D()(x) x = Dropout(0.5)(x) output = Dense(num_label, activation='softmax')(x) model = Model(input_tensor, output) print('finish getting model') return model But the model is not good for my image classification, some guys suggest me changing the pooling to adaptpooling before FC layer in model_InceptionResNetV2 so that the mode is not sensitive to image size, I want to use 512*512 size not just 299*299. Could you guys suggest me how to do it. Thanks!
