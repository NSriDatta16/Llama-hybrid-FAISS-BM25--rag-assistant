Resize a WPF window, but maintain proportions?

I have a user resizable WPF Window that I want to constrain the resizing so the aspect ratio of the window stays constant. Ideally I would like to constrain mouse location when the window is being resized by dragging a corner to positions that maintain the proper aspect ration. If an edge is resized with the mouse, the other dimension should change at the same time. Is there a simple way to do this or a good on-line example that anyone knows of? If no better solutions come up, I'll post what I've done after I've refined it a bit.
