If you know the y-axis scale, it should be possible. To screenscrape, you could first filter your image with a color filter for each of the series. Second step would be to gather the coordinates of all remaining pixels in your temporary image and transform them these to the scale needed. given a pixel at coordinates x,y the offset of the charts Origin in image pixels xoffset, yoffset the Scale of you chart axis xscale, yscale you could calculate the data for this pixel (pseudocode) pixelData.x := (x - xoffset) * xscale pixeldata.y := (y - yoffset) * yscale And afterwards, do some interpolation if your series line is more then one pixel wide (for example get the average data for all pixels in a single column or so). Update1: Pseudocode for naive color filter filtering out red charts //set up desired color levels to filter out redmin := 240; redmax := 255 bluemin := 0; bluemax := 0; greenmin := 0 greenmax := 0; //load source bitmap myBitmap := LoadBitmap("Chartfile.bmp"); //loop over bitmap pixels for iX := 0 to myBitmap.width-1 do for iY := 0 myBitmap.height-1 do begin myColorVal := myBitmap.GetPixels(iX, iY); //if the pixel color is inside your target color range, store it if ((mycolorVal.r >=redmin) and (myColorVal.r =greenmin) and (myColorVal.g =bluemin) and (myColorVal.b
