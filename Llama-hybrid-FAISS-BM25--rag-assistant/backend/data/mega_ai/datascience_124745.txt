Creating a bot for real-time PvP games raises ethical concerns and is often against the terms of service of the game. Using bots to automate gameplay can provide unfair advantages and is generally considered cheating. Game developers invest a lot of effort in creating fair and enjoyable experiences for players, and the use of bots can undermine these efforts. It's essential to respect the terms of service of the games you play and avoid engaging in activities that may result in penalties, including the suspension or banning of your account. If you are interested in exploring machine learning or AI in a gaming context, I would encourage you to focus on projects that align with ethical considerations and contribute positively to the gaming community. This could involve creating AI opponents for single-player modes or developing tools that enhance the gaming experience without providing unfair advantages.
