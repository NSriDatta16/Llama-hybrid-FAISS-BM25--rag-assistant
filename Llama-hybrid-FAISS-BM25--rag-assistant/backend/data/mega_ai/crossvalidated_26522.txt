IT is not completely clear what you mean, but if you are asking "is it true that if the training data is separated with a hyperplane then the SVM will always separate the test data witout error", then the answer is "no". Consider the case where the true decision boundary is non-linear, but where the training set has fewer samples than input features. In this case it is always possible to separate the training data with zero error with a linear hyperplane, but the classifier will have a non-zero test error (because the true decision boundary is non-linear). The SVM is an approximate implementation of a bound on generalisation error, but the bound will always be greater than zero for non-trivial problems.
