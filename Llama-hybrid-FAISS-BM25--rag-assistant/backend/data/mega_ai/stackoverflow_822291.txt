I haven't used a web application since VS 2003. Website projects have it all now: masterpages, organized folders for the content of your site (ie - App_Data, App_Themes, etc.), sitemap files. Ever since MS introduced Cassini as a built-in web container for debugging in VS, it's been MUCH easier to just use websites.
