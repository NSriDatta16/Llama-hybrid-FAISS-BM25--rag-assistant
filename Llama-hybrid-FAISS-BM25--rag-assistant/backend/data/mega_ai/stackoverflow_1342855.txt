edited, with my head hanging in shame Ahh! The using statement you're refering to is used to import a namespace, not to wrap an IDisposable object! Very different, ambiguous terms... you had me confused :-) Personally I like them outside the namespace at the top of the file; but it's probably due to me switching between C# and VB.NET. I like to organize my projects into 1-file-per-class, no inner (nested) classes, and only one class per namespace ( per file ) . In this situation the location of the using statement is irrelevant whether inside or outside the namespace. The iDesign C# coding standard is a solid standard to follow (or to derive your own from). It recommends keeping the using statements outside the namespace as item #14. But it's all down to your company / project's convention
