Logistic Regression to identify significant covariates(variables)

I am working on logistic regression to identify the most cucial genes that can predict the response of stimuli. I have a workflow that looks fine to me but I want inputs from the people who have more experience on similar problems. I have a data set that looks like below: Resp CDK6 EGFR KIF2C CDC20 Sample 1 pos 11.39 10.62 9.75 10.34 Sample 2 pos 10.16 8.63 8.68 9.08 Sample 3 pos 9.29 10.24 9.89 10.11 Sample 4 neg 11.53 9.22 9.35 9.13 Sample 5 neg 8.35 10.62 10.25 10.01 Sample 6 pos 11.71 10.43 8.87 9.44 ... This a table of dimension 130 * 82. What I have done is calculated each genes individually. Below is the code for that and selected the ones with that gave p-value glm=glm(Resp ~ CDK6, data = dataframe, family = binomial(link = 'logit')) Once I have x number of genes (say 35 genes) that have p-value glm2 The above model gives me a 9 genes that are significant with p-value Then I perform cross validation, like below cv.glm(dataframe, glm2, K=nrow(dataframe))$delta This was followed by confusion matrix and sensitivity & specificity scores threshold=0.5 predicted_values threshold,1,0) actual_values sensitivity(conf_matrix) [1] 0.9153846 > specificity(conf_matrix) [1] 0.9666667 My Question is, I started with 82 genes/variables and I got it down to 9 genes with the above approach. Is this approach ok? or am I doing something wrong or this can be further tuned up? Your suggestions are very welcome. Thank you for your time.
