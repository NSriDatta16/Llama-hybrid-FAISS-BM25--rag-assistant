How to fit Markov Chain on price time series?

Markov Chains usually deal with discrete states. But price time series is continuous. Actually we will be considering not the time series itself, but its diffs: continuous_diffs = [1.1, 1, 0.99, 1.01, ...] so the price at time t will be price(t = 7) = price(t = 0) * diff_1 * diff_2 * ... diff_6 . It's possible to manually split continuous state into let's say 5 discrete states huge_down, down, same, up, huge_up so the diffs will be continuous_diffs = [1.1, 1, 0.99, 1.01, ...] discrete_diffs = [huge_up, same, down, up, ...] And now the serie is discrete and it's possible to fit Markov Chain. But, there are problems . We need to find two parameters - number of states K = 5 and the boundaries of those states. Should boundaries be evenly distributed, or maybe log-scale, or somehow else? So, how to solve that? Ideally - fit Continuous Markov Chain (if it exists). Or tell Markov Chain number of states K = 5 and Markov Chain somehow himself find the optimal discrete boundaries . Are there such algorithms? Or executable examples, notebooks?
