Have a look at: http://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/LongLines By default, soft returns are automatically inserted as you edit, to keep your text wrapped. If you do not want this effect, set ‘longlines-auto-wrap’ to ‘nil’. You can still type ‘M-q’, or use any of the other fill commands, to fill text using soft returns (see FillParagraph.)
