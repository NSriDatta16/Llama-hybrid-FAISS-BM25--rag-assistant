My rule of thumb is that if it takes longer than a second (on average) to complete - I shove it to a background job, otherwise I will keep in synchronous. I use delayed job , it works well and I have had no reason to leave it. I had one case where I didn't need to hit the database in the background job and I used a custom rake task, it was very efficient and saved me having to implement a background job processor.
