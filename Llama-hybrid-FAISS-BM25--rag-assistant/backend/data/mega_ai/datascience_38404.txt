Which ML algorithm to use if we have categorical data, numeric data, derived data (derived from) other variable in our data set?

I am a beginner in Data Science. I have a data set which contains numerical data, categorical data and derived data (derived from other columns). The target column (dependent) is binary. Which Machine Learning algorithm will predict my target column most accurate?
