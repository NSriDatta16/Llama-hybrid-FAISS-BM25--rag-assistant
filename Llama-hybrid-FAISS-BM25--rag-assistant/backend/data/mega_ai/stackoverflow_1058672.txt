Even a simple instant messaging app will hold a few interesting problems to solve, like: asynchronous network communication and handling those events in GUI creating custom controls (e.g. contact roster with statuses and avatars) working with shell drag and drop for file transfers desktop notifications (incoming message) and other desktop integration features (handling Send To in windows maybe) managing configuration state providing power awareness - your app should for example disconnect from server before your computer goes into standby handling user idle events creating a chat window with a rich text message editor etc. Cool stuff!
