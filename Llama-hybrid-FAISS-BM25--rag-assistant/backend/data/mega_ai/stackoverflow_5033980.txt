Delete requires more logic than you think; how much so depends on the structure of the schema. In almost all cases, when deleting a record, the server must check for any dependencies upon that record as a foreign key reference. That, in a nutshell, is a query of the system tables looking for table definitions with a foreign key ref to this table, then a select of each of those tables for records referencing the record to be deleted. Right there you've increased the computational time by a couple orders of magnitude, regardless of whether the server does cascading deletes or just throws back an error. Self-balancing internal data structures would also have to be reorganized, and indexes would have to be updated to remove any now-empty branches of the index trees, but these would have counterparts in the Insert operations.
