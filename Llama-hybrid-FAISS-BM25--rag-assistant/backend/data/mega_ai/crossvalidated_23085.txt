I don't know of anything offhand, aside from Doug Bates' books and his postings on various online forums. That should be sufficient to justify why you don't report them. But if you want to try and quantify uncertainties, I might try a Bayesian approach, i.e., simulating from posterior distributions of variance parameters using MCMC. Maybe look at: http://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Bayesian.html
