I came through VB and have held onto the control type prefix for controls. My private members use lower-camel case (firstLetterLowercase) while public members use Pascal/upper-camel case (FirstLetterUppercase). If there are too many identifiers/members/locals to have a 90% chance of remembering/guessing what it is called, more abstraction is probably necessary. I have never been convinced that a storage type prefix is useful and/or necessary. I do, however, make a strong habit of following the style of whatever code I am using.
