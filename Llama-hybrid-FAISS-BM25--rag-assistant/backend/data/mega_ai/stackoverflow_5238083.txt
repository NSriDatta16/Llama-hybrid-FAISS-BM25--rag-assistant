An UNSIGNED type cannot be negative, but on the other hand it has twice as large a range for the positive integers. The types TINYINT, SMALLINT, MEDIUMINT, INT and BIGINT all have signed and unsigned versions. For INT the ranges are defined as follows: Type Storage Min Max INT 4 -2147483648 2147483647 INT UNSIGNED 4 0 4294967295 The signed and unsigned types take the same storage space (4 bytes for INT). See the documentation for more details.
