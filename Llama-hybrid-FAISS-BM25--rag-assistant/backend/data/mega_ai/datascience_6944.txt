remove seasonality from weekly time series data

I need to decompose a series to remove seasonality. The series has 2 columns date and volume. This is what my time series object looks like: salestsDec I ran the decompose() function on a 'ts' object. salests = sales[, c(1,6)] View(salests) salestsDec Upon, running the decompose() function, I get a list of 6 components, observed, trend, seasonal, random for both date and volume. I should only be seeing, observed, trend, seasonal and random component for Volume in my plot. I've attached an image of what the plot looks like. Moreover, when I try to remove seasonal component from the series, I am getting an error. It appears that it's the same underlying issue. Error: Error in salests - salestsDec$seasonal : non-numeric argument to binary operator In addition: Warning message: Incompatible methods ("Ops.data.frame", "Ops.ts") for "-"
