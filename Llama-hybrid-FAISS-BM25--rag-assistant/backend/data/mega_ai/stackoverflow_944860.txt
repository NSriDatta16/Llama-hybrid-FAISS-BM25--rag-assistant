How to extract nested tables from HTML?

I have an HTML file (encoded in utf-8). I open it with codecs.open() . The file architecture is: // header // some text // some rows with cells here // some cells contains tables // maybe some text here // a form and other stuff // probably some more text I need to retrieve only first table (discard the one with form). Omit all input before first and after corresponding . Some cells contains also paragraphs, bolds and scripts. There is no more than one nested table per row of main table. How can I extract it to get a list of rows, where each elements holds plain (unicode string) cell's data and a list of rows for each nested table? There's no more than 1 level of nesting. I tried HTMLParse, PyParse and re module, but can't get this working. I'm quite new to Python.
