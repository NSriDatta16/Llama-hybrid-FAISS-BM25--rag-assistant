Exchanging integrals with inner products with kernel mean embeddings

I am doing some reading on kernel mean embeddings. In particular I am reading the survey paper by Muandet et al . On page 27 (Section 3.1) the authors begin a gentle introduction to kernel mean embeddings based on Dirac measures $\delta_{\mathbf{x}}(\cdot)$ . Of course we have the familiar property that $$ \int f(\mathbf{t})d\delta_{\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{t}) = f(\mathbf{x}) $$ for any measurable function $f$ . The authors use this fact along with the reproducing property of reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (such as $\mathcal{H}$ ) to conclude: $$ \int f(\mathbf{t})d\delta_{\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{t}) = \int \langle f, k(\mathbf{t}, \cdot) \rangle_{\mathcal{H}}d\delta_{\mathbf{x}}(\mathbf{t}) = \left\langle f, \int k(\mathbf{t}, \cdot)d\delta_{\mathbf{x}}(t)\right\rangle_{\mathcal{H}} = \langle f, k(\mathbf{x}, \cdot)\rangle_{\mathcal{H}} $$ where $k$ is the kernel function associated with $\mathcal{H}$ . In this sense $k(\mathbf{x}, \cdot)$ is an embedding of the measure $\delta_{\mathbf{x}}$ in $\mathcal{H}$ . My question regards the second equality. How is this step rigorously justified? Intuitively, I understand that this step is similar to using linearity to move a sum inside an inner product but I am not sure how a similar logic is justified here with the integral? EDIT: This thought arose to me as I was writing this question so I have included it as an edit. Is this a case of first taking $k(\mathbf{t}, \cdot)$ as a simple function so that the integral changes to a sum? Then perhaps a limiting argument gets you the general case?
