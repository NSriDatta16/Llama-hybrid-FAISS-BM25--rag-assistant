Does isomap give possible new bases with respect to importance order as PCA?

I am running isomap for feature reduction and I want to see what number of features are best for classification with experiments at different number of features. Do I need to run isomap for each try to get specified number of features or just run the algo. once and chose again and again the number of features I need? Is it like PCA? PCA gives possible new bases with their relative importance (eigenvalues) and you might choose the bases incrementally and test classification performance so you do not run PCA again and again for each experiment.
