What is the most Oracle compatible open source DBMS?

My organization is thinking on using an open source DBMS (free if possible, but not mandatory) for all new apps that we develop. Since we already have quite a few apps that connect to an oracle server, we would like to use a DBMS that is as compatible as possible with Oracle. So we can port the apps to oracle with the less work in the case we don't get the same performance or just don't like how it responds. Also, most of the developers have experience only with Oracle. Which one would you recommend? We're trying to cut down costs.
