Understanding how good is a Pastry-P2P-like resource allocation via DHT

I am about to develop a distributed system. The system, among all functionalities, needs to allocate some resources (large resources that can be fragmented in smaller blocks). In order to do that, I want to use the Chord/Pastry P2P approach (stations on a logic ring-net). Pastry has a very interesting approach for resource allocation: when a user station needs to send something, the hash of the station guid is used to find the key in the dht, so something like this is considered: User Station -> GUID (hash on user station ip) -> HASH -> I obtain a value called X -> Use this hash and find in the Pastry ring-net the station having that same GUID (hash on Pastry node public key) value is located (or the immediate predecessor) -> put data there. Well, this means that, ideally, every user always locates its own data in the same Patry station (Pastry node). Well, the protocol also mirrors data on neighbours so a user can find its data in few nodes. Is this a good approach? Are there any possible side effects on proceeding as before?
