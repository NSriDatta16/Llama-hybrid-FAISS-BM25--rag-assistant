On general principles, fixing an integral order $k \gt 2,$ we would expect the central standard moment of order $k$ of three or more numbers to vary, because after centering the data and standardizing the moment we have used two of the three algebraic degrees of freedom, so that generally there ought to be an algebraic variety of possible values of dimension at least $3-2 = 1.$ This does not happen with kurtosis due to an algebraic identity. Background Standardizing a batch of numbers $(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$ re-expresses them as $$z_i = \frac{x_i - m}{s}$$ where $$m = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n x_i$$ and $$s^2 = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2.$$ (Note that the sd function in R does not compute $s:$ it returns $s\sqrt{n/(n-1)}.$ ) This guarantees that the sum of the $z_i$ is zero and the sum of their squares is $n.$ The standard central moment of order $k$ (for any number $k$ ) is the average of the $k^\text{th}$ powers of the standardized values, $$\mu_k(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n z_i^k.$$ Analysis Let's focus on $n=3$ numbers. To simplify the notation, let $(x,y,z)$ be a group of three numbers that have been standardized so that $x+y+z=0$ and $x^2+y^2+z^2=3.$ Consequently $z = -(x+y),$ whence $$3 = x^2+y^2+z^2 = x^2+y^2+(-x-y)^2 = 2(x^2 + xy + y^2).$$ Squaring both sides leads to $$9 = [2(x^2 + xy + y^2)]^2 = 4(x^4 + y^4 + 2x^3y + 2xy^3 + 3x^2y^2),$$ whence $$x^4 + y^4 + 2x^3y + 2xy^3 + 3x^2y^2 = \frac{9}{4}.$$ Use this to simplify the fourth central standardized moment: $$\frac{1}{3}(x^4+y^4+z^4) = \frac{1}{3}(x^4 + y^4 + (-x-y)^4) = \frac{2}{3}(x^4 + y^4 + 2x^3y + 2xy^3 + 3x^2y^2) = \frac{2}{3}\frac{9}{4} = \frac{3}{2}.$$ The sum is three times this, but when you use sd instead of $s$ in the formula, you are dividing by a further factor of $\left(\sqrt{3/2}\right)^4.$ Therefore in your calculations you obtain constant values of $$\frac{3}{2}\times 3 \div \frac{9}{4} = 2$$ for the sums of the standardized values. There's nothing so special about the other moments. With $n=3$ the other $\mu_k$ for $k = 3, 5, 6, 7, \ldots$ are non-constant functions of $y^3-3y.$ With larger $n$ there are just too many degrees of freedom.
