The problem is that you are trying to take the average of a set of averages where each component made up of a different number of rows: > table(rld$date) 2009 2010 2011 11 26 9 When you try and take the average of those groups, you assign equal weight to the average from 2009, 2010, and 2011. I think an easy parallel is thinking about a set of quizzes and tests. Quizzes are more frequent and worth fewer points, so having a 100% average from a set of five quizzes worth 10 points each carries less weight than the midterm which is worth 100 points.
