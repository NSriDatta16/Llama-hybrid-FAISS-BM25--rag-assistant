In short because it keeps adding the variance of the next increments to the variability we have in getting to where we are now. $\text{Var}(Y_{t}) = \text{Var}(e_1+ e_2+ ... +e_t)$ $\qquad\quad\;\;= \text{Var}(e_1) + \text{Var}(e_2) +... +\text{Var}(e_t)$ (independence) $\qquad\quad\;\;= \sigma^2 + \sigma^2 + ... + \sigma^2=t\sigma^2\,,$ and we can see that $t\sigma^2$ increases linearly with $t$ . The mean is zero at each time point; if you simulated the series many times and averaged across series for a given time, that would average to something near 0 $\quad^{\text{Figure: 500 simulated random walks with sample mean in white and }}$ $\quad^{ \pm \text{ one standard deviation in red. Standard deviation increases with } \sqrt{t}\,.}$
