Google Maps: Get points contained within a user-drawn polygon?

A local real estate agent is wanting to add Google maps to his web site that display his listings. However, rather than just showing map markers to all his properties, he wants the web site visitor to be able to draw an arbitrary polygon on the map, click a button, and then display all his houses within those bounds. My understanding is that this is going to take some GIS voodoo. But before I start looking into the complexity of PostGIS, I'm wondering if there's a better way to do this? The site runs on a standard LAMP stack, but I'm hoping to convince him to move over to Python/Nginx/PostgreSQL.
