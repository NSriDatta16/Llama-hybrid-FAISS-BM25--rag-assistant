Width of a is narrower when I use a in it on a fixed width . Why?

I have this HTML code fragment (in a valid document using strict doctype): Without &lt;br /&gt; lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum With &lt;br /&gt; lorem ipsum lorem ipsum lorem ipsum This is rendered like this in any browser: Please note that the third is wider in the first table, only because I haven't used a tag there. Otherwise the code for the two tables are identical. I would like to find a way to have the table rendered like it is on the second example, but without having to use a tag. Clarification I can't specify the widths of the cells because they may contain any number of characters.
