Recunstroction of PCA

I try to replicate this graph, which appears in this question with no luck. I post it here as I believe that this question is more about PCA understanding rather than coding/programming itself. # Code based on a question from: https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/229092/how-to-reverse-pca-and-reconstruct-original-variables-from-several-principal-com library(ggplot2) X = iris[,1:4] mu = colMeans(X) Xpca = prcomp(X) nComp = 1 Xhat = Xpca $x[,1:nComp] %*% t(Xpca$ rotation[,1:nComp]) Xhat = scale(Xhat, center = -mu, scale = FALSE) load I expected to see orthogonal lines between the slope (ratio) between the two feature based on the first PC, but this is not the case. As an illustration, I plot the expected segments. My understanig is that the first pc will project this data points to a single sub-space (i.e the purple line). #calculate the perpendicular segment manually perp.segment.coord $x1, yend = ss$ y1)+ geom_abline(intercept = intcpt[1], slope = slope[1], col = "purple", lwd = 1.5)
