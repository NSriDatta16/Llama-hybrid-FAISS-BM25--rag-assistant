Random vs. fixed effect in glmer binomial model

I'm using a binomial glmer mixed effects model using and I have two questions. One variable that I have, 'stimulus' has 12 levels. The levels were not randomly selected, so I have used it as a fixed variable in the basic model but R seems not to like it (at least this is my interpretation) given the way the output looks and the amount of time R takes to process it. m0.1 |z|) (Intercept) 2.7561 0.2657 10.371 So, my question is, can I consider 'stimulus' as a random effect instead? m0.1 |z|) (Intercept) -1.3754 0.6792 -2.025 0.0429 * ListgpTA 0.2284 0.3073 0.743 0.4572 ListgpTQ 0.1432 0.2513 0.570 0.5687 Signif. codes: 0 ‘’ 0.001 ‘’ 0.01 ‘’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Correlation of Fixed Effects: (Intr) LstgTA ListgpTA -0.235 ListgpTQ -0.288 0.636
