An exact, mathematical, true/false probability cannot be computed with the information you provide. However, in real life such information is never available with certainty. Therefore, using our intuition (and where all my money would go if we were betting), the car is definitely blue. (some believe this is not statistics anymore, but well, black/white views of science are not very helpful) The reasoning is simple. Assume the car is not blue. Then 90% of the people (!) were wrong. They could only be wrong because of a list of issues including: color blindness pathological lying being under the influence of substances like alcohol, LCD, etc not understanding the question other form of mental disorder a combination of the above Since the above is clearly not likely to affect 90% of an average random population (e.g. colour blindness affects around 8% of males and 0.6% of females, that is 43 people out of 1000), it is necessarily the case that the car is blue. (That is were all my money would go anyway).
