improves upon traditional methods by incorporating spatial clustering, density-based clustering, and locality-sensitive hashing. This tailored approach is designed to better handle the vast and varied nature of IoT data, thereby enhancing security and operational reliability in smart infrastructure and industrial IoT systems. Petroleum industry Anomaly detection is crucial in the petroleum industry for monitoring critical machinery. Mart√≠ et al. used a novel segmentation algorithm to analyze sensor data for real-time anomaly detection. This approach helps promptly identify and address any irregularities in sensor readings, ensuring the reliability and safety of petroleum operations. Oil and gas pipeline monitoring In the oil and gas sector, anomaly detection is not just crucial for maintenance and safety, but also for environmental protection. Aljameel et al. propose an advanced machine learning-based model for detecting minor leaks in oil and gas pipelines, a task traditional methods may miss. Methods Many anomaly detection techniques have been proposed in literature. The performance of methods usually depend on the data sets. For example, some may be suited to detecting local outliers, while others global, and methods have little systematic advantages over another when compared across many data sets. Almost all algorithms also require the setting of non-intuitive parameters critical for performance, and usually unknown before application. Some of the popular techniques are mentioned below and are broken down into categories: Statistical Parameter-free Also referred to as frequency-based or counting-based, the simplest non-parametric anomaly detection method is to build a histogram with the training data or a set of known normal instances, and if a test point does not fall in any of the histogram bins mark it as anomalous, or assign an anomaly score to test data based on the height of the bin it falls in. The size of bins are key to the effectiveness of this technique but must be determined by the implementer. A more sophisticated technique uses kernel functions to approximate the distribution of the normal data. Instances in low probability areas of the distribution are then considered anomalies. Parametric-based Z-score, Tukey's range test Grubbs's test Density Density-based techniques (k-nearest neighbor, local outlier factor, isolation forests, and many more variations of this concept) Subspace-base (SOD), correlation-based (COP) and tensor-based outlier detection for high-dimensional data One-class support vector machines (OCSVM, SVDD) Neural networks Replicator neural networks, autoencoders, variational autoencoders, long short-term memory neural networks Bayesian networks Hidden Markov models (HMMs) Minimum Covariance Determinant Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs): CNNs have shown exceptional performance in the unsupervised learning domain for anomaly detection, especially in image and video data analysis. Their ability to automatically and hierarchically learn spatial hierarchies of features from low to high-level patterns makes them particularly suited for detecting visual anomalies. For instance, CNNs can be trained on image datasets to identify atypical patterns indicative of defects or out-of-norm conditions in industrial quality control scenarios. Simple Recurrent Units (SRUs): In time-series data, SRUs, a type of recurrent neural network, have been effectively used for anomaly detection by capturing temporal dependencies and sequence anomalies. Unlike traditional RNNs, SRUs are designed to be faster and more parallelizable, offering a better fit for real-time anomaly detection in complex systems such as dynamic financial markets or predictive maintenance in machinery, where identifying temporal irregularities promptly is crucial. Foundation models: Since the advent of large-scale foundation models that have been used successfully on most downstream tasks, they have also been adapted for use in an
