Do proximity or importance influence predictions by a random forest?

Does proximity or importance influence in prediction quality in random forests? Or are they just information about the model? Setting them to True does increase accuracy? Does this model: tree=randomForest(x=aa[,5:19],y=aa$rst,mtry=7,ntree=501 ,nodesize=6,importance=T,proximity=T) make better predictions than this model? tree=randomForest(x=aa[,5:19],y=aa$rst,mtry=7,ntree=501 ,nodesize=6,importance=F,proximity=F)
