Data Science as a Social Scientist?

as I am very interested in programming and statistics, Data Science seems like a great career path to me - I like both fields and would like to combine them. Unfortunately, I have studied political science with a non-statistical sounding Master. I focused on statistics in this Master, visiting optional courses and writing a statistical thesis on a rather large dataset. Since almost all job adds are requiring a degree in informatics, physics or some other techy-field, I am wondering if there is a chance to become a data scientist or if I should drop that idea. I am lacking knowledge in machine learning, sql and hadoop, while having a rather strong informatics and statistics background. So can somebody tell me how feasible my goal of becoming a data scientist is?
