Bayesian approach to testing an unfair die

Suppose you have a six-sided die that you suspect is not fair and toss it N times. What would be a Bayesian approach to estimating the probability of the six outcomes given that you suspect the die may be unfair? I know that I have to come up with a prior density and a likelihood in order to define what the posterior would be. I was thinking of using the multinomial as the likelihood, but I am not sure what to use for a prior since the die is suspected to be not fair. Any help is appreciated... Thank you!
