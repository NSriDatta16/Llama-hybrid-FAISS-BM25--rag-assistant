Web technology is an inappropriate platform for implementing real-time interaction. It can be done, of course, but you will certainly have issues with scalability, responsiveness and development effort. I urge you to examine your requirements very carefully and consider whether it is at all possible to leverage a vendor product to accomplish what you want to do. If you still want to strike out on your own, the main hurdle you will have to overcome is how to push messages to the browser. "Pinging" the browser from the server is impossible using pure web technologies, because HTTP is built on a "pull-only" request/response model. There is no persistent connection maintained between the client in the server. After the server has finished sending the page to the broswer, the connection is gone. You could poll the web server for new messages, but this is not a scalable solution. If you're only dealing with a very small (say single digits) number of users, then this might work, but your responsiveness will be limited by the speed at which you poll, and the faster you poll, the less scalable this solution will be. A better solution would be to use Silverlight, Flash, or some other thick-client technology running in the browser. Then you could implement a service that handles message routing between clients. This article on CodeProject might be a good place to start.
