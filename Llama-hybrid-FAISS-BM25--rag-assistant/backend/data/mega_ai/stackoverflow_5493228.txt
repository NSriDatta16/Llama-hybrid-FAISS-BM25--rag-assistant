I didn't understand your paragraph, but to answer your question (assuming we want to know if an enemy can see the player, in a top-down game) Check that the player is in the enemy's cone of vision. We do this by computing the (absolute value of the) angle between the enemy's sight-vector and the vector spanning between the enemy and the player . If it is 0°, the enemy is facing the player. If it is 180°, the enemy is looking away from the player. Check that it is Check that there is nothing between the enemy and the player. This boils down to checking for a collision between the walls (or anything else) and the line segment spanning the enemy and the player. Note that if there are many walls, checking for collision with all of them can be very expensive. Narrowing the search down to only a few objects is called pruning, and outside the scope of this answer (see here for more information)
