I would personally go with option 1, You mention two additional tables later so I assume you're thinking of. Table -Tag Fields - TagID, TagName Table -TagArticle Fields - ArticleID, TagID Table - Article Fields - ArticleID, blah, blah, blah This shouldn't require much more in the way of storage than dumping to a field in Article. Plus it is normalised which will always stand you in good stead for the future and will leave your database far better able to search for articles by tag. As for updating, chances are you'll only be updating occasionally compared to the number of times you're reading so the impact should be negligible and I cant think of any maintenance tasks beyond ensuring your indices are up to date which you're going to have to do on other tables anyway and should be automated. Fringe benefits mean you can quickly create things like a top tags list or a tag cloud.
