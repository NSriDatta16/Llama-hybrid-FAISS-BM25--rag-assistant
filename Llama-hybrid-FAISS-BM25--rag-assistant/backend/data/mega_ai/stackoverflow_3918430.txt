Average between two columns in mysql that are date not timestamp

Alright so here it is. I need to figure out the average amount of days between two columns. Column 1 is recieved_date and column 2 is fix_date Just want to know how to take the two dates find the difference in days, do that for every row and pop out a number stating the average amount of days it takes to fix something. Tried to find it online but every time I find something like it, they have two specific dates. I need the entire columns averaged.
