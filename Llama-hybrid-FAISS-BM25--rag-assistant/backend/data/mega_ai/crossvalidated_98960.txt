Change Point analysis can mean detecting parameter changes OR changes in error variance OR changes in the Expected Value. Your example is simply the latter. Detecting change points in the Expected Value is called Intervention Detection http://www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf . This has been significantly enhanced in a product called http://www.autobox.com/cms/ which I helped develop that even incorporates user-specified predict series. I took your 19 values and AUTOBOX detected change points at M,H, and Q (13th,8th and 17th values) Note well that in general ARIMA structure has to be taken into account in time series analysis. In this case there is no provable arima structure ( autoregressive memory). It appears to me that your free software has a cost. Exploratory Data Analysis as championed by Tukey, Box et.al. speaks to extracting hypothesis/information from the actual data such as the form of the ARIMA model, the detection of anomalies , changes in parameters etc. all of which do not require specific quantitative hypothesis promulgated before the data arrives. If one is lucky enough to have these hypothesis handy one can of course test them. Modern analytics actually learn from the data. What you knew (visually or scientifically) to be unusual was indeed detectable. I would say that the Tsay reference is an example of a trustworthy procedure.
