Best Tips for documenting code using doxygen?

My team is starting to document our C code using doxygen, paying particular attention to our public API headers. There appears to be a lot of flexibility and different special commands in doxygen, which is great, but it's not clear what's a good thing and what's a bad thing without trial and error. What are your favourite ways to mark up your code, what are your MUST DOs and DO NOTs? Please provide your top tips, one per answer to facilitate voting. I am looking to define our whole approach to API documentation, including providing a template to get the rest of the team started. So far I have something like this: /** * @file example_action.h * @Author Me (me@example.com) * @date September, 2008 * @brief Brief description of file. * * Detailed description of file. */ /** * @name Example API Actions * @brief Example actions available. * @ingroup example * * This API provides certain actions as an example. * * @param [in] repeat Number of times to do nothing. * * @retval TRUE Successfully did nothing. * @retval FALSE Oops, did something. * * Example Usage: * @code * example_nada(3); // Do nothing 3 times. * @endcode */ boolean example(int repeat);
