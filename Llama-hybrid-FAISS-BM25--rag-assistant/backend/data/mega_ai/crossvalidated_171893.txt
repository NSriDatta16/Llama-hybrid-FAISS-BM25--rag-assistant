"Regret" as a term that applies to online machine learning is one that lends itself very easily to an intuitive explanation. Minimizing (or, alternatively, optimizing for) "regret" is simply reducing the number of actions taken which, in hindsight, it is apparent that there was a better choice. By minimizing regret, we are minimizing subobtimal actions by the algorithm. Depending on the application of the online machine learning algorithm, there can be many, many other measurements to be optimized. Several specific papers you may be interested discuss the topic in depth: Learning, Regret minimization, and Equilibria - A. Blum and Y. Mansour Optimization for Machine Learning - Hazan Online Learning and Online Convex Optimization - Shalev-Shwartz
