Is a random walk cointegrated with its own lag?

Can a random walk, or more broadly a unit-root process, be considered cointegrated with its own lag? E.g. if $y_t=y_{t-1}+u_t$ with $u_t\sim$ i.i.d., then $y_t$ is I(1), $x_t:=y_{t-1}$ is I(1) and there exists a $\beta$ (namely, $\beta=-1$ ) such that $y_t+\beta x_t$ is I(0). Formally, the requirements of cointegration appear to be satisfied: each process is I(1) but there exists a linear combination that is I(0). (This is a duplicate of this question on Economics SE. I am cross-posting this here as I am not convinced by the answers at Economics SE and would like to draw on the extensive time series expertise available on Cross Validated.)
