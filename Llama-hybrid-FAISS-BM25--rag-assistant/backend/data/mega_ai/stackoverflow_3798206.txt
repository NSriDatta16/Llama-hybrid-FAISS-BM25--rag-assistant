I really think the key here is good communication with your managers. Besides, I like PatrickV's idea. You could also try some other ways to engineer your tool around the problem so that it'll seem silly/be hard to use it as performance measurement - change the name of the statistics to mean something other than "how good programmer X is", make it hard to get data per-person, show error statistics. You can also try to display the data in another way (this may actually make your managers think you are trying to help them). Show a graph - a several pixels difference in position may be harder to identify than a numeric results (my guess - your managers are using excel and coloring red everything below average). Draw the error margin so it doesn't make sense to obsess over fractions of percentages. Give the result as a scale - low and high margin that take into account your error information, it is harder to compare. Edit: Oh yeah, and read about "social interfaces". You can start with's Spolsky's Not Just Usability and Building Communities with Software .
