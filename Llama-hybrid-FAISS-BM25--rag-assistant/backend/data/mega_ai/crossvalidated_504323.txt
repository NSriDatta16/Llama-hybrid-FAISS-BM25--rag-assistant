Consider a Markov chain $x_n$ on $\{-1,1\}$ . Let the initial distribution $\mu_0$ take the value $x = 1$ with probability $p$ and $x = -1$ with probability $1-p$ . Consider then the transition matrix $$ P= \left[ {\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \\ \end{array} } \right].$$ Depending on whether $x_0 = 1$ or $x_0 = -1$ the chain remain stuck indefinitely in whatever it hit with probability $1$ , and therefore the chain has a limiting distribution and two different stationary distributions.
