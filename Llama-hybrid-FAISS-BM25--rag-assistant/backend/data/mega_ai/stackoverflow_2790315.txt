RDF Usage Rates for Syndication

Is RDF still used widely for content syndication? Specifically, I know only of Slashdot as a large scale website syndicating content in that format (say versus RSS). Understandably this might seem vague to answer so more specifically: Can anyone list any larger sites similar in scale to Amazon or CNN using it? Any web based publishing platforms (Wordpress, Joomla, etc...) that generate syndication feeds with this xml vocabulary. Any other more quantifiable evidence that it is used for syndication online. I understand that RDF may be a parent specification but in this case I'm talking about sites that syndicate content using as a root element and heavily leveraging elements from the RDF namespace: http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#
