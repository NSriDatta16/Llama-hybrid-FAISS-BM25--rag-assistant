Average/extreme value in distrubtion

If I have a distribution like the one below, is there a way to say to what degree a value is part of the distribution? e.g. if I am considering the value 4.122e-4, it clearly falls within the distribution, but I guess I am asking to what extent is it an average value - for instance, if I was considering 7.524e-4 I would say this is quite an extreme value (towards the edge of the distribution) in comparison to 4.122e-4 - is there a measure of how extreme (or "un-extreme" a value is)? This may be a basic question - perhaps it just requires a simple description i.e. 4.122e-4 is XXX away from the mean. Background: The parameter "ratio" is the ratio of repeats (%) (i.e. % of repeat-like bases) within a nucleotide sequence (cf. bioinformatics) to length of the sequence itself. The question for the value 4.122e-4 is, is this ratio particularly high - i.e. does this particular sequence, this region of the genome, have a high per-base repeat percentage in comparison to other sequences in the genome, or is just average? So I think yes, it was generated by the same process. I hope this makes sense (I guess I could just use repeat (%) without dividing by the sequence length, but my thoughts were that longer/shorter sequences might tend to be more repetitive, and I wanted to take this into account). Thanks
