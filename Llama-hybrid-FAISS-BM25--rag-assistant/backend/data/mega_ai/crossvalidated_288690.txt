How to connect dense layer when learning relation between field description and categories

I have a relation between products that looks like this I would like to have a RNN (LSTM) to learn the descriptions of the items in the left column and with a dense layer learn to match a category to a given description. The is also a longer text description to each item (not in the image above) that I would like to pass to the LSTM to eventually improve the "knowledge" about a given item. I have been trying seq2seq methods and generating new "alike" content, but I don't know how to connect at dense layer to do this classification. Basically both "what input to feed" and "how to chain these" are my questions. If someone could clarify this for me it would be great.
