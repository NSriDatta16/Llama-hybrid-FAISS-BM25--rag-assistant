The advantage is that the caller only has to handle a ResourceLoadException instead of SQLException . That way if you later change your data storage to be in a file that accessing it might cause an IOException . You don't have to go back and change the type of Exception that your caller handles. This is useful to your caller because the caller is going to handle either exception the same way.
