If it's being run for a user, let's see, what sort of storage exists that is user-specific. Hmmm. That's it! The home directory. I knew it would come to me eventually :-) Sorry for the light jab. Seriously, I would just stash the PID into $HOME/.daemon.pid or ~/.daemon.pid (how you name the file is up to you of course). This is, of course, assuming you will only have one daemon running for a user. If not, you'll need to be a bit trickier. And hopefully allaying your fears that a user will inadvertently delete unknown files in their home directory, that's why you make it "hidden" by starting it with a . character. Most non-experienced users should never even see these and experienced users should know better than to muck about with them.
