Identifying parts of speech for individual words (not texts)

Please forgive the potential ignorance of this question. I am not a complete virgin regarding NLP: I am trying to assign parts of speech to individual words. I realize that many words can serve as multiple parts of speech, but I am looking for the POS that a human would be most likely to interpret the word as, seeing it out of context. Is there any database that has this info in it for a reasonably large set of words? Or, is there any large corpus with POS tags where I could feed it words, and get frequency distributions of the POS that each word is playing in the corpus. Thanks.
