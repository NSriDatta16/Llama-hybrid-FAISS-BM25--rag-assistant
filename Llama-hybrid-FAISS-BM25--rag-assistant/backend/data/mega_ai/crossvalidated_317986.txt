No statistical test proves causation. Such relations can be strongly supported from data produced by a particular experimental design. Usually this design associates to a randomised experiment but there is a huge body of work for observational studies as well. (see for example the book on " Explanation in Causal Inference " by VanderWeele or " Counterfactuals and Causal Inference " by Morgan and Wimnship) In any case, the data and evidence we gather strongly imply rather then prove causation. You specifically mention temporal data: in the case of temporal data it might be a lucrative idea to assume a causal relation but this can be a red herring; this matter was extensively discussed on the CV thread on: " Correlation does not imply causation; but what about when one of the variables is time? ". R allows you to try a variety of cutting-edge algorithms to assess causality relations. Off the top of my head I can think of the packages pcalg , InvariantCausalPrediction , CausalImpact to mention three packages one could try. Again, the results from the packages do not prove but provide strong evidence for causal relations.
