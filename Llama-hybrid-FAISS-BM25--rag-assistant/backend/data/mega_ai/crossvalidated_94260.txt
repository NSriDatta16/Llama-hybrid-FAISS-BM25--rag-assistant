ARMA type of process will shows wave-like ACF and PACF, kind of like decaying cosine function. AR(p) processes show exponential decay in ACF, and hard cut-off after p lags. The MA(q) processes show hard cutoff after q lags in ACF, and exponential decay in PACF. All these have to be significant, i.e. above the dotted lines on your plot. On your plot all bars are under the dotted line of significance, except a couple of ticks around 40 in ACF and PACF. They're barely above the line though so I'd be tempted to ignore them as benign, maybe random spikes. This means that your residuals do not show any obvious ARMA, AR or MA behavior, which is great, because it means that your ARIMA(1,1,1) model fits the data quire reasonably. If this was my data, I'd pay closer attention to those two spikes around 40, of course. They may point to something important, e.g. maybe you do something to your data every 40th time of collection. However, most of the time these spikes are circumstantial, e.g. your sample maybe not too large, and you have a couple of outliers 40 observations apart, they'd show up as correlation in lags too, red herring, if you wish. Here's an example in MATLAB, that shows AR, MA and ARMA % AR spec=arima('AR',[0.8 0.1],'Variance',0.1,'Constant',1) y=spec.simulate(1000); subplot(2,3,1) autocorr(y,30) title 'AR(2)' subplot(2,3,4) parcorr(y,30) % MA spec=arima('MA',[0.8 0.1],'Variance',0.1,'Constant',1) y=spec.simulate(1000); subplot(2,3,2) autocorr(y,30) title 'MA(2)' subplot(2,3,5) parcorr(y,30) % ARMA spec=arima('AR',[0.8 0.1],'MA',[0.8 0.1],'Variance',0.1,'Constant',1) y=spec.simulate(1000); subplot(2,3,3) autocorr(y,30) title 'ARMA(2,2)' subplot(2,3,6) parcorr(y,30)
