I don't know if what you're trying to do is possible, but there are lots of APIs for Google Apps stuff. This may be of some use: The Provisioning API provides a mechanism to programmatically create and manage Google Apps user accounts with one or more domains, nicknames, email aliases,organization units, and groups. Using this API you can minimize disruption to your organization's current processes by synchronizing user data between Google Apps and your existing user management system.
