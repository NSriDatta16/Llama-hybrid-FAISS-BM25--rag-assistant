agree with abdullah.abcoder. By putting js code in $('div id').height() you'll only have it run once when the page is loading (and only the html document before this is loaded). If you want to calculate the actually height of the div after pages loaded, try $().ready(function(){ $("your div id").height(); // or $().css('height'); }); To dynamically get the div's height, you need to put it into some events handler function, like div's resizable or draggable.
