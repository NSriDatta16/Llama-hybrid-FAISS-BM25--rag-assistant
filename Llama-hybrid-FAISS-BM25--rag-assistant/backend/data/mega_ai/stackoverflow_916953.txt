In other words, given the context of the article, he is saying that it would have been better for the developers of C# to concentrate on how they would store the data internally when a variable was declared and not care so much about specifying the precise method of declaring the variable. In other words by doing this in C# static int customerCount you are telling the compiler to prepare storage for a statically accessable integer and then telling it to label that storage as customerCount whereas in VB you would use this line dim shared customerCount as Integer telling the compiler, in theory, that you have a variable called customerCount that it should store and make statically available, and oh by the way, it happens to be an Integer. It all really a fine line distinction kinda thing.
