I think you might need to define data point before you can define data set : why is one primitive and not needing definition, but not vice versa? At least two definitions make sense to me: One or more observations (cases, records, rows) for one or more variables (fields. columns). Whatever is stored as data within a file readable by a program of choice. Tabular layout is common but I don't think it's part of any definition; how the data are stored can be practically important, naturally. P.S. The word "format" is so overloaded that to me it's best avoided unless specified unambiguously. I've seen it used for General or specific text or binary file format Data structure, e.g. tabular or other Data storage or variable types, e.g. bit, integer, real, character Display format controlling presentation, e.g. details on number of decimal places; decimal, hexadecimal or binary display.
