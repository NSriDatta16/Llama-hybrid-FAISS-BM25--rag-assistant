l collections, with text ranging from Western, medieval to handwritten Chinese manuscripts have been ingested into Monk. The systems applies continuous ('24/7') machine learning over internet, yielding fundamental results. The MONK system employs the computational and storage resource of Target. It recently became part of a collaboration, led by Prof. Popovic from the Department of Theology and Religious Studies at the University of Groningen, which will use a combination of carbon dating, paleography, and text/image recognition techniques to try and pinpoint the authors of the Dead Sea Scrolls manuscripts. LifeLines LifeLines is a long-term medical research project run by the University Medical Center Groningen (UMCG). An array of genotype and phenotype data will be gathered from 165000 people once every five years for a total period of thirty years, and the accumulated data will be used by researchers and medical specialists to gain insights into the processes related to aging in an attempt to understand why age-related health degradation varies so widely from person to person. Target provides LifeLines with the infrastructure for data storage, access, and processing. Data from LifeLines, as well as the SURFsara and Target infrastructure were used in the Genome of the Netherlands project, run by a consortium of the UMCG, LUMC, Erasmus MC, UMCU, and Free University of Amsterdam. Results from the project, using whole-genome sequencing to deduce population structure and demographic history of the Dutch population, were published in the Nature Genetics journal. GLIMPS Run by K. Leenders, a professor of neurology at the UMCG, GLIMPS is a research project set to find faster and more reliable diagnostic tools for Parkinson's disease. GLIMPS explores the possibilities of using complex image-based algorithms and PET scans for early detection of Parkinson's. To test the effectiveness of such algorithms, GLIMPS is building a large database of PET scans from several hospitals in the Netherlands. Target is responsible for building and maintaining the GLIMPS database as well as ensuring the smooth running of the image-based algorithms on its computing facilities. Others Additionally, Target is involved in the data management for other astronomical projects, such as the KiDs/VIKING astronomical survey using OmegaCAM, the ESO's MUSE instrument (mounted on the Very Large Telescope), and MICADO (to be mounted on the E-ELT). In addition, the data-centric approach to data management prompted by Target has been adopted by the ESA's Euclid mission. The project's spin-off company Target Holding B.V. also manages a number of commercial projects with private businesses in the North of the Netherlands. Public outreach and education is also part of the project remit and Target has organised many public events. The Infoversum 3D theatre is a spin-off of the Target project and provides a facility for the visualisation and explanation of scientific data for large groups. == References ==
