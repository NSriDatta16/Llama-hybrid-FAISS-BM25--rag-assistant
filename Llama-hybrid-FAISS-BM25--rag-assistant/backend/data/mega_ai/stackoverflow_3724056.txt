How can I change the output of a webpage depending on wether a user can access Youtube?

I'm looking at embedding youtube videos onto a webpage (a Drupal webpage if that helps), but I need to figure out what people will see if their business/workplace/country blocks youtube access. Does it show 'video no longer available', does it not show anything?, does it add a class or ID to the embedded html to let css, or a scripting language know that there is an error. I would like to be able to swap the embedded code out for a gif or something else. So users that can't access youtube will not be left with what ever youtube decides to show them. Any tips would be great. I tried editing the hosts file to test myself but it wouldn't take for some reason. Cheers. EDIT: * first-question *
