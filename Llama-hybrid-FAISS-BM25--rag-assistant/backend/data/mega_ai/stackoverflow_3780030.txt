Storage quota for app in iPhone / iPad

I am just wondering what's the storage size for an iPad/iPhone app to use? For memory, it is sure that every app can only use 100MB-like memory. How about the storage? I mean the file system in iPad/iPhone app? Use as much as I want until the file system is full? or something like that?
