Mouseup event over flash object not firing

I have got this script working from How to get mouseup to fire once mousemove complete working within the jQuery (document) scope. Later on I added a flash object inside the body. and when I click on the flash object the mousedown event fired, mousemove event fired, but not the mouseup event which where I want to unbind the mousemove. But when I click on non Flash area, mousedown works, mousemove works, and mouseup also works. It works like I wanted it to in Chrome, but not in Firefox. Here are the codes, and I called handleMouseDown in $(document).ready handleMouseDown: function () { jQuery(document).mouseup(function() { Log("unbind."); jQuery(document).unbind('mousemove'); }); jQuery(document).mousedown(function(e) { Log('click'); // You can record the starting position with var start_x = e.pageX; var start_y = e.pageY; jQuery(document).mousemove(function(e) { // And you can get the distance moved by var offset_x = e.pageX - start_x; var offset_y = e.pageY - start_y; Log('moves') ; return false; }); // Using return false prevents browser's default, // often unwanted mousemove actions (drag & drop) return false; }); } //firebug method log calls function Log(str) { if (typeof(console.log) == 'function') console.log(str); }
