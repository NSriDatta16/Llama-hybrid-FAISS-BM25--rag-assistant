Magento- attach file to shipment email?

How can I attach a pdf file to the shipment-email. This wil be the same static file attached to alle shipment emails (gov. required terms). I have looked into som of the files like dev/lib/mail.php and app/code/core/Mage/Sales/Model/Email also tried to look at some of the code of the Fooman email attachments extension (wich does not provide the functonality i want), but I'm unsure of how to proceed.
