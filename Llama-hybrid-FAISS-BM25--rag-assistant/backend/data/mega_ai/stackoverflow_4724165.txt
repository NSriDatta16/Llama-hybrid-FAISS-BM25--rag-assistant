There's no such thing as a "drop down list" with the default interface elements in iOS. You'll either want to use a UIPickerView or a UITableView , depending on your application. The easiest way to get started with UITableView is to use Xcode to create a new Navigation-Based app with Core Data for storage. This will setup most of the basic stuff for you and you can either tweak it to suit your needs or you can just see how the interface and data elements interact with each other.
