My application is showing EXTRA info...which is NOT needed

I have an action called 'list' and is defined like def list @subjects = Subject.order("subjects.position ASC") end And my list view looks like Subjects 'new'},:class=>'action new')%> &nbsp; Subject Visible Pages Actions 'show',:id=>subject.id},:class=>'action show'%> 'edit',:id=>subject.id},:class=>'action edit'%> 'delete',:id=>subject.id},:class=>'action delete'%> So the problem is that besides getting an organized list of all the subjects nearby my link "Add subject" the page is printing all the information that @subjetcs brings from the controller. Which of course is not a very good idea...I can't figure out why is that happening
