The best idea is to avoid cloning, as it is broken. Cloneable interface doesn't have method clone . Method clone is defined as protected in Object class. So to call clone you need to know the type of object to have access to clone . Better idea is either copy constructor (as Bloch recommends) or serialization and deserialization (via XML for example). Maybe you can gain access to clone with reflection, but I'm not sure. And I discourage it.
