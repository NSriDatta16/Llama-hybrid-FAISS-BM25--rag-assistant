Key - The key column indicates the key (index) that MySQL actually decided to use. The key is NULL if no index was chosen. To force MySQL to use or ignore an index listed in the possible_keys column, use FORCE INDEX, USE INDEX, or IGNORE INDEX in your query From your query result we can see that you have no Index defined for your table because possible_keys column is also NULL. A database index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table at the cost of slower writes and increased storage space.
