Using scatterplot before running a controlled experiment to test causality

This question is an extension of awesome thread Does causation imply correlation? . As an example, let's say that I am running an online experiment on Stackoverflow to see whether asking more questions leads to an increase in time spent on stackoverflow. For this case, I would have historical data on # of questions asked over, say, 1 week and average time spent on stackoverflow. I can plot a scatterchart for the last two years and see the the relationship. I have three interrelated questions: Question 1: Before running an experiment, is it a good practice to plot a scatterchart between # of questions asked in 1 week and average time spent on stackoverflow? Question 2: If we do decide to plot the chart, one could argue that this scatterchart will show me association between the two variables. If correlation (or association ) doesn't imply causation, what's the need for plotting such a chart? It will be great if someone can talk about the value of plotting scatterchart before running an experiment. Question 3: I learned from the Stackoverflow thread above that Causation doesn't imply correlation, but it does imply association . Hence, I'd believe that association (and not correlation) is a necessary condition for causation. If this is true, the benefit of scatterplot would be to check the necessary condition for causality. For instance, what if, I found from scatterplot that an increase in # of questions asked over a period of time is associated with a decrease in time spent on SO. This would mean that there is no causality. Hence, I'd not have to run an experiment. Am I correct? I am new to the field of experimentation and causal-checks. I don't have a Ph.D. in econometrics or statistics. I took advanced graduate courses in Statistics long time ago. So, please excuse my ignorance. I'd appreciate if someone can guide me. Many thanks.
