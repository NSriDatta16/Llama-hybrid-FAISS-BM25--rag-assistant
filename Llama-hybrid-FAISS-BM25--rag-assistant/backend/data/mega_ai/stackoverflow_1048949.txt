Swing: How could I get JInternalFrame treated equally to other components inside a container?

Background information: I am implementing a visual diagram editor, which consists of different complex elements (re-sizable, with title bar, sub-elements) and different simple elements (not re-sizable, no title bar, no sub-elements). All elements are draggable. I am using JInternalFrame (for complex elements) along with JPanel (for simple elements) to represent elements of a schematic diagram. There is a container (either a JDesktopPane or a JLayeredPane), which contain all these elements. I have several problems with this concept: Case 1 - The container is a JDesktopPane: JInternalFrames are always above other elements. Clicking other elements don't "deactivate" previously active JInternalFrame Case 2 - The container is a JLayeredPane: After clicking some elements inside a JInternalFrame, it stays "activated" forever. Case 3 - JInternalFrame used for everything, but without decoration for simple elements: My custom border (which is needed when I manually remove JInternalFrame's title bar) is every time replaced by current LAF border, after activating/deactivating the JInternalFrame. I don't get the whole concepts behind activating JInternalFrames anyway. If I could make a JInternalFrame not activable at all , I could choose Case 2 any would be happy. Please advice me, what would be an simple and straightforward solution to given problems. NOTE: Selection of components and activation of JInternalFrame seem to be different things.
