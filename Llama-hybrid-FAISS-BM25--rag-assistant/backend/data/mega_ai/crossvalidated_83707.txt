30 features is a not a high amount. A large amount of features in SVM standards signifies (hundreds of) thousands of features. You don't need to have thousands of examples to obtain a good decision boundary with such few features. In fact, 2000 examples is probably already plenty. If you get fairly poor results (after tuning the hyperparameters properly!) you are likely in a situation that requires a nonlinear decision boundary. This is very common in low dimensional problems. I suggest trying with an RBF kernel to see if your results improve.
