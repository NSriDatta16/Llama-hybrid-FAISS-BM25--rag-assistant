Since the Bayes factor is given by $$B_{12}(D) = \frac{\text{Pr}(M_1|D)}{\text{Pr}(M_2|D)}\Big/\frac{\text{Pr}(M_1)}{\text{Pr}(M_2)}$$ the ratio of frequencies of simulations from $M_1$ and $M_2$ that are accepted need be divided by the prior probabilities of $M_1$ and $M_2$ if these reflect the number of times each model is simulated. Apart from this, the approximation is valid. In a series of papers we pointed out the dangers of using summary statistics in this setting: Lack of confidence in approximate Bayesian computation model choice Relevant statistics for ABC model choice
