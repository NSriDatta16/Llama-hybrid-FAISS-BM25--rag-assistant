multi dimensional time series and matrix profile method

I have a time series of the following format: time product1 product2 product3 product4 t1 40 50 68 47 t2 55 60 70 100 t3 606 20 500 52 ... Values are sales. On day t1, how much money was spent on customers buying product1 for example. I want to do time series clustering on this dataset. I am trying to use matrix profile distance. However, this method assumes only 1 dimensional data. Is there anyways to work around this?
