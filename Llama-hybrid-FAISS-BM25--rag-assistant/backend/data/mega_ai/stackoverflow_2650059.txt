HTMLencode HTMLdecode

I have a text area and I want to store the text entered by user in database with html formatting like paragraph break, numbered list. I am using HTMLencode and HTMLdecode for this. Sample of my code is like this: string str1 = Server.HtmlEncode(TextBox1.Text); Response.Write(Server.HtmlDecode(str1)); If user entered text with 2 paragraphs, str1 shows characters \r\n\r\n between paragraphs. but when it writes it to screen, just append 2nd paragraph with 1st. While I'm decoding it, why doesn't it print 2 paragraphs?
