Sklearn Aggregating Multiple Fitted Models Into A Single Model? (binary classification)

My problem context: dataset too big to fit into memory. binary classification [0,1] 30 csv files in a directory with exactly 30,000 samples (rows) each file contains 15,000 0 class and 15,000 1 class (no unbalance) model is xgboost.XGBClassifier() If I iterate through these 30 files, fit a model, and pickle the model to disk; is it possible to aggregate these 30 fitted models into a single model? I am aware of sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier but that is used for: sklearn.ensemble.VotingClassifier Soft Voting/Majority Rule classifier for unfitted estimators.
