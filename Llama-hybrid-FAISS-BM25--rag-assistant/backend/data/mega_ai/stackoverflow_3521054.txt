Is it possible to get the pointer the continous memory fragment in a std::vector in C++?

I moved my code to use std::vector instead of char *mem = malloc(...) but now I am facing a problem that I can only access the vector data through operator [] but not via a pointer. I can't write stuff like: std::vector data; fill_data(data); char *ptr = data; Before I could do this: char *data = malloc(100); fill_data2(data); char *ptr = data; Any ideas if it's still possible to access data in a vector via pointer? Thanks, Boda Cydo.
