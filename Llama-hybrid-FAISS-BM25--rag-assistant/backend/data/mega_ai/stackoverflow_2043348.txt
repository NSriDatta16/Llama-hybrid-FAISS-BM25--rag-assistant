Dividing using nhibernate results in "Could not determine member from"

This is probably something simple but I seem to be lacking some knowledge of how nhibernate works. This is my code: ICriteria query = Session.CreateCriteria (); query = query.CreateCriteria (x => x.TblProjects) .Add (x => x.FldCurrentFunding != 0m) .Add (x => x.FldCurrentFunding / x.FldFundingGoal >= .8m) .SetResultTransformer( new NHibernate.Transform.DistinctRootEntityResultTransformer()); return query.List (); The resulting error I get is: "Could not determine member from (x.FldCurrentFunding / x.FldFundingGoal)"
