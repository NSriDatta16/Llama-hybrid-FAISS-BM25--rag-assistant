This methodology seems a bit strange and potentially overkill for the problem. I would try having your input just be a 5 dimensional vector that is the difference between racer 1 and racer 2 and have the output just be the result for racer 1 (or what every racer's features are being subtracted from the other racer's features.). From here you can just use a few fully connected layers (which is essentially what you are doing be having kernel's of size 5 anyway. I would also try some more traditional machine learning algorithms with this type of 1D input. EDIT: since signs are important for the difference between your two racer features, do not use a relu as your activation function for this approach.
