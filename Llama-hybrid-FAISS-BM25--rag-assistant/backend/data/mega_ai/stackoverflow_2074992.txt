In the Stackoverflow podcast #79 a service called Codility came up: There is a website that conducts programming tests on the internet for you at Codility, but weâ€™re skeptical this can actually work without the one-on-one human element of observation. I think it's probably as good as such automated tests can be but agree on the missing human element. It was more fun to solve the test problem in the worst manner that still gets you a score of 100 than to solve it as fast/good/elegant as possible. edit: oh, and it's not for free...
