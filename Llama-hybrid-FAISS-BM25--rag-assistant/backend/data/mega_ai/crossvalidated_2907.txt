I would start with robust time series filters (i.e. time varying medians) because these are more simple and intuitive. Basically, the robust time filter is to time series smoothers what the median is to the mean; a summary measures (in this case a time varying one) that is not sensitive to 'wired' observations so long as they do not represent the majority of the data. For a summary see here . If you need more sophisticated smoothers (i.e. non linear ones), you could do with robust Kalman filtering (although this requieres a slightly higher level of mathematical sophistication) This document contains the following example ( a code to run under R , the open source stat software): library(robfilter) data(Nile) nile . The last documents contains a large number of references to papers and books. Other types of filters are implemented in the package, but the repeated median is a very simple one.
