How to use a class derived from a .NET class such as TableLayoutPanel on a form

This is quite a basic question, that I'm sure many of you will be able to answer and applies not only to TableLayoutPanel, but to all other .NET controls too. I have created a new class which derives from TableLayoutPanel and I want to use this derivation on the form instead of the .NET version. I am expecting to be able to use drag and drop as one does will all the other controls in the tool box. However, I am not sure how to do this; I am also guessing that for dervived classes, this drag and drop onto a form can not be done in the designer; and must be done in code only. I am not sure about this and since this is my first .NET forms application, I have no experience to fall back on. public class CustomTableLayoutPanel : TableLayoutPanel { } The form that hosts this control (not directly) is implemented in a form called MainForm. I suppose I could go into the deigner.cs (MainForm.Designer.cs) file and change the member variable to be of my custom type instead of the .NET type, but I am not sure if this is the established method of performing this kind of function or whether that is a hack. As far as I know, you should not manually change code in and XXXdesigner.cs file since this is automatically generated.
