Autoscroll problen

1.Create a cocoa application (not document-based) 2.Create a new class "StretchView"(subclass NSView) 3.Open the Interface builder and drag a "Scroll view" to the main window 4.Choose the "Scroll view" and set the class "StretchView" (in class identity window) The size of the contentview is 500*500 and the size of the strechview is also 500*500 (horizontal Scroll is enabled). Then I start to draw some numbers(1,2,3,4......) horizontally one after the other. When the number is out of ranger(the x pos is larger than 500) I increase the width of the StretchView. (Everything works fine up till this point) Then I tried to make the horizontal scroller to automatically scroll to the end so that everytime I increase the width of the StretchView the last number coulde be seen. Here's the code: //The timer is called every sec -(void)myTimerAction:(NSTimer *) timer { NSLog(@"myTimerAction"); //...... int i = _myArray.count; NSRect rect = [self frame]; int width = rect.size.width; //The width between two number is 10 //When the x pos of current num is bigger then the scroll's width if((i * 10) > width) { //reset the width width = i * 10; [self setFrameSize:CGSizeMake(width, rect.size.height)]; //How to make it autoscroll??? //............................... } //...... [self setNeedsDisplay:YES]; }
