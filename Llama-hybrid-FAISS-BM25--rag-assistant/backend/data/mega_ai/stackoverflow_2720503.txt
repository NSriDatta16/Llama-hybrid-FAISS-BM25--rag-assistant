php menu generated from a db

I have a database with products organized by categories and subcategories. The thing is that I generate a menu by querying the categories table. Because categories are almost the same(they can change/add once a month or something), I don't think I have to query the database for each access of the web-page. Do you have a better idea for me? Many thanks! ps: I'm using the CakePHP framework, but your answer/idea doesn't have to relate to it. I just find about memcache
