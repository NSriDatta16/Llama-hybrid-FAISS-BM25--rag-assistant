Logistic Regression: the logic of testing for all threshold probabilities in an ROC Plot?

In Logistic Regression, what's the logic of testing for all threshold probabilities in an ROC Plot? I thought that in logistic regression, we're concerned with the 0.5 probability threshold, and if something is greater, we mark the outcome as 1, and if less, we mark the outcome as 0. So why test all the possible threshold probabilities? Why not just test the case for the one we're concerned with?
