The numpy documentation says: The variance is the average of the squared deviations from the mean, i.e., var = mean(abs(x - x.mean())**2) and The variance is computed for the flattened array by default This means that Numpy is not computing the variance between two arrays, but the variance of one array which is [1,2,4,2,4,8]. Note that this is by default the biased sample variance ( $\tilde{s}^2 = \frac{1}{N} \sum \limits_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2$ ) while other statistics software (e.g., R) might give you the unbiased sample variance by default ( $s^2 = \frac{1}{N-1} \sum \limits_{i=1}^N (x_i - \overline{x})^2$ ).
