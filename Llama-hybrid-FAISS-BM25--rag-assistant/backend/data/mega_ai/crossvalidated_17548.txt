I used to teach statistics to a layman by jokes, and I found they learn a lot. Suppose for variance or standard deviation the following joke is quite useful: Joke Once two statistician of height 4 feet and 5 feet have to cross a river of AVERAGE depth 3 feet. Meanwhile, a third statistician comes and said, "what are you waiting for? You can easily cross the river" I am assuming that layman know about 'average' term. You can also ask them the same question that would they cross the river in this situation? What are they missing that is 'variance' to decide "what to do in the situation?" It's all about your presentation skills. However, jokes help a lot to the layman who wants to understand statistics. I hope it helps!
