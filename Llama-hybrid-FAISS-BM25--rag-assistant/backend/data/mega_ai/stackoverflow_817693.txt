There are no conformance tests (at least officially approved) that I know of - even for 1.1. Certainly its something that would be very high value. Same goes for oAuth - they're both complex protocols and sometimes event the spec doesn't cover everything. Probably the only thing you can do right now is thorough unit testing coverage locally.
