As far as I know, there's no support in Moodle for nested blocks. On the other hand, it would probably make no sense to have it, since the "block" is a well defined stand-alone entity, embedding some very simple logic. What you may want to do is to create a new block and to use the functions from weblib.php to create the graphic elements that you need within it. If you need something more complicated, you will probably need a "module" (in Moodle terms).
