Chrome extensions are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Firefox extensions can be written with native, platform-specific C++ code, but the vast majority are XUL and JavaScript (and some XBL for the more advanced extensions). Probably the most unusual aspect of Firefox extension code compared to web-oriented JavaScript is that Firefox uses XPCOM to organize its components internally. But it is a stretch to call familiarity with QueryInterface a "skill set."
