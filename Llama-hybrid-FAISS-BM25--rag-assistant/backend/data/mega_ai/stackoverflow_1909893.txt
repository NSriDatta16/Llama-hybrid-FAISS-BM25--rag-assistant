I guess this is an actual application running on the users machine. The simplest approach I can think of is to use Java Web Start which can ensure that your application downloads jars from the internet if you update them. This includes a license which is per user (i.e. the jnlp file depends on the user downloading it including the correct jar) and that license should allow the user to work for a number of days with your application even without internet access after which a new license must be downloaded (as the JNLP file has changed for that user). Note: Be CERTAIN to change the URLs of a changed license file, otherwise the java cache may be corrupted. The license file can just contain a single class which looks at the date and says true/false to continue. It must be suitable signed to create sealed jars. More advanced schemes exist but this will work, be simple to maintain, and be a reasonable compromise between allowing free distribution and hardcore license schemes.
