Under project settings / linker / general there's a setting called "show progress", if you set it to "/VERBOSE" the linker will show you all kinds of stuff including the "/DEFAULTLIB" items it finds. This can be helpful, depending on whether the import is coming from a lib file, or not. You should also search your solution source code for a "#pragma comment(lib,...", which causes a default library to be included at link-time. If library X is something like msvcrt , then the dependency is likely coming from an external or third-party library that you're using, and the only practical way to avoid this is to add X to the "ignore specific library" option under project settings / linker / input.
