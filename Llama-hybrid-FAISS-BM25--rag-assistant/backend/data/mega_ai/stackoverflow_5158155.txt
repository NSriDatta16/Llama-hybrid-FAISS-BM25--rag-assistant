How are clojure/lisp programs modeled as a diagram?

I've tried wedging my clojure diagrams into what's available in UML, using class-blocks as the file-level namespaces and dependency links to show relationships, but it's awkward and tends to discourage functional patterns. I've also tried developing ad-hoc solutions, but I can't discover a solution that works as well as UML with, say, Java (simple directed graphs seem to work in a vague manner, but this the results aren't detailed enough). Furthermore, I'm not finding anything on the web about this. Just to be clear, I'm not trying to do anything fancy like code generation; I'm just talking about pen-and-paper diagrams mostly for my own benefit. I'm assuming I'm not the first person to have ever considered this for a lisp language. What solutions have been proposed? Are there any commonly-used standards? What do you recommend? What tools do you use?
