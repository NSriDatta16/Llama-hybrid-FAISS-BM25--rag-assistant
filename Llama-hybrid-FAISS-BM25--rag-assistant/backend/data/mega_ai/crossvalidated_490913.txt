Interpreting coefficients from ordinal regression R `polr` function

I have a dataset of patients with associated risk factors and outcomes. I am interested in the effect COPD ( hxcopd ), which is a binary variable, has on an ordinal outcome with 6 possible outcomes ( outcome ) increasing in severity (0 through 5). I will be writing out my train of thought. I am not very confident in this interpretation so I am looking for any criticisms of my thought process or ultimate intepretation. In R ( polr ) the ordinal logistic regression model is parameterized as: $$logit (P(Y \le j)) = \beta_{j0} – \eta_{1}x_1 – \cdots – \eta_{p} x_p$$ Due to the parallel lines assumption, even though I have six categories, the coefficient of COPD ( hxcopd ) stays the same across the five categories. The two equations for hxcopd = 1 and hxcopd = 0 are $$ \begin{eqnarray} logit (P(Y \le j | x_1=1) & = & \beta_{j0} – \eta_{1} \\ logit (P(Y \le j | x_1=0) & = & \beta_{j0} \end{eqnarray} $$ Then $logit (P(Y \le j)|x_1=1) -logit (P(Y \le j)|x_1=0) = – \eta_{1}.$ To perform this R, I create an unadjusted fit using the following R function: unadjfit To summarize the results: summary(unadjfit) Call: MASS::polr(formula = outcome ~ hxcopd, data = df) Coefficients: Value Std. Error t value hxcopdTRUE 0.331 0.1297 2.552 Intercepts: Value Std. Error t value 0|1 3.5431 0.0985 35.9645 1|2 3.6880 0.1015 36.3219 2|3 4.1911 0.1150 36.4485 3|4 4.8785 0.1431 34.0918 4|5 5.9261 0.2178 27.2052 Residual Deviance: 2964.116 AIC: 2976.116 The coefficient in the summary is $\eta_1$ . 1) The above statement is true, correct? I can not find a clear answer in the polr documentation. The output shows that for patients with COPD, the log odds of being category 0 (versus category > 0) is actually $-\hat{\eta}_1=-0.331$ or $0.331$ points lower than patients without COPD. 2) Could I also say "that for patients with COPD, the log odds of being in a category $\leq J$ vs. $>J$ is $0.331$ points lower than patients without COPD"? Since the coefficient $ – \eta_{1}$ represents a one unit change in the log odds when moving between the two exposures (i.e., hxcopd = 1 to hxcopd = 0 ), we can write: $$logit (P(Y \le j|x_1=1) -logit (P(Y \le j|x_1=0) = – \eta_{1}.$$ Exponentiate both sides of this equation and use $log(b)-log(a) = log(b/a)$ : $$\frac{P(Y \le j |x_1=1)}{P(Y>j|x_1=1)} / \frac{P(Y \le j |x_1=0)}{P(Y>j|x_1=0)} = exp( -\eta_{1}).$$ Which by the proportional odds assumption can be simplified: $$\frac{P(Y \le j |x_1=1)}{P(Y>j|x_1=1)} = p_1 / (1-p_1) $$ $$\frac{P(Y \le j |x_1=0)}{P(Y>j|x_1=0)} = p_0 / (1-p_0)$$ The odds ratio is defined as: $$\frac{p_1 / (1-p_1) }{p_0 / (1-p_0)} = exp( -\eta_{1}).$$ But since R does not give us $-\eta$ , but rather $\eta$ , exp(coef(unadjfit)) gives a different OR: exp(coef(unadjfit)) hxcopdTRUE 1.392349 Since $exp(-\eta_{1}) = \frac{1}{exp(\eta_{1})}$ , $$exp(\eta_{1}) = \frac{p_0 / (1-p_0) }{p_1 / (1-p_1)}.$$ From the output, $\hat{\eta}_1=0.331$ ,the odds ratio $exp(\hat{\eta}_1)=1.39$ is actually $\frac{p_0 / (1-p_0) }{p_1 / (1-p_1)}$ . 3) So a correct interpretation of the polr output is that people without COPD have higher odds of being in a category $\leq J$ vs. $>J$ when compared to patients with COPD? If I wanted to interpret differently, I could flip the odds ratio around: $$ \begin{eqnarray} exp(-\eta_{1}) & = & \frac{p_1 / (1-p_1)}{p_0/(1-p_0)} \\ & = & \frac{p_1 (1-p_0)}{p_0(1-p_1)} \\ & = & \frac{(1-p_0)/p_0}{(1-p_1)/p_1} \\ & = & \frac{P (Y >j | x=0)/P(Y \le j|x=0)}{P(Y > j | x=1)/P(Y \le j | x=1)}. \end{eqnarray} $$ Since $exp(-\eta_{1}) = \frac{1}{exp(\eta_{1})}$ , $$\frac{P (Y >j | x=1)/P(Y \le j|x=1)}{P(Y > j | x=0)/P(Y \le j | x=0)} = exp(\eta).$$ Instead of interpreting the odds of being in category $\leq J$ , we can interpret the odds of being in category $>J$ . 4) Is it appropriate to interpret $exp(\hat{\eta}) = exp(0.331) = 1.39$ as "people with COPD have 1.39 times the odds of being in category $>J$ compared to people without COPD"? 5) If I wanted to report the results of the ordinal regression in an academic manuscript, what is usually expected? I assume the OR and 95% CI. Is it customary to also report the intercepts for each level of the outcome?
