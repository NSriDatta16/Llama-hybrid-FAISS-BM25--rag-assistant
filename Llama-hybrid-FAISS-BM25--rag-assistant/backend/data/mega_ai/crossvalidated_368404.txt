Confidence intervals for autocorrelation function

Given a time series data sample I have computed autocorrelation coefficients for various lags, the result looks something like this How do I compute the confidence intervals around the sample autocorrelation curve? The reason for that is to see if another autocorrelation curve computed from samples generated by some model is within those confidence intervals.
