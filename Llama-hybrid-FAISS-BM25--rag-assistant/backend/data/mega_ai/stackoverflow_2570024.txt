How does one use dynamic recompilation?

It came to my attention some emulators and virtual machines use dynamic recompilation. How do they do that? In C i know how to call a function in ram using typecasting (although i never tried) but how does one read opcodes and generate code for it? Does the person need to have premade assembly chunks and copy/batch them together? is the assembly written in C? If so how do you find the length of the code? How do you account for system interrupts? -edit- system interrupts and how to (re)compile the data is what i am most interested in. Upon more research i heard of one person (no source available) used js, read the machine code, output js source and use eval to 'compile' the js source. Interesting.
