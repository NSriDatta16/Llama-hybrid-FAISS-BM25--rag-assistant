Linq-To-SQL Legacy Relation Mapping

I am trying to get Linq2SQL to work with my legacy database. I currently have a notes table that is generic to a few different entities and mapped m:m. Instead of mapping one relation table per entity type whoever designed this database decided to use a single relation table with a type column (as a varchar yuck!). alt text http://img130.imageshack.us/img130/326/capturefm.png How do I map Foo and Bar to have a Notes collection? Is this even possible. I am not seeing the light. I tried to have two classes FooNotes and BarNotes that inherit from RelateNotes and then mapping the Type field as the descriptor. alt text http://img130.imageshack.us/img130/3153/capture2f.png This doesn't work and I receive the below error. Bad Storage property: '_EntityID' on member 'TestLinq.BarNotes.EntityID'. I don't want to get too far down the Linq2SQL road before realising it not possible. I am not allowed to change the database much. Many Thanks,
