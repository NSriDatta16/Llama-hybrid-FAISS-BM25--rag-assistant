I echo @glen_b 's comment. Don't just fit random functions, think about it. What causes the signal to rise and fall? Examples: rate of transcription rate of translation rate of transport percent transported to your region rate of degradation Is quenching of the signal occurring due to high concentration, incorporation into a complex? Is the protein denaturing for some reason (lysozomes?) thus affecting the signal? Are there a plausible negative/positive feedbacks occurring? What are you normalizing to? Are you sure this isn't rising after ~ 2minutes? What is new about this time? This seems to be an important hint. Also many curves people fit are artifacts of averaging, there is a long history of people complaining of this in the learning literature. The correct thing to do is fit a curve to each time-series that has been derived from assumptions that people in your field will find acceptable. There is currently not enough info in your question to provide a reasonable answer. You have a nice smooth curve here, don't miss the opportunity to solve it with a series of differential equations.
