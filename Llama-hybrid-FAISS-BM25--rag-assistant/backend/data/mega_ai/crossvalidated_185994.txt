The Cost Parameter for Support Vector Machines

I am now learning about SVMs and I learned that "cost" is one of the most important tuning parameters for building the best performing model with SVMs. But i found it very hard for me to understand the concept of "cost" because it is generally defined as "the price for misclassifications". Although i can do SVMs in R and have built some fair models, it would not do me any harm if i understand the logic behind the parameter of "cost". Thanks Felix
