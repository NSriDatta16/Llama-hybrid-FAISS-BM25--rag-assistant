Question about Radio button/PHP/MySQL

I'm an engineering student and I'm developing a simple software based on HTML, PHP and mysql. I learned this topics on w3schools. I know only the basics. I tried to search about this in this website but I found questions about PHP, MySQL and HTML radio buttons which were much more complex than I need and that I could understand. Sorry for the English. (Q1) Ex: $email=$_REQUEST['email'] , in this case the input is text, if it were like a radio button for ex: sex: male or female, how would it be? (Q2) what would be the type of this field (for example sex in question 1) in the database: text, int, varchar ? Thanks for the attention
