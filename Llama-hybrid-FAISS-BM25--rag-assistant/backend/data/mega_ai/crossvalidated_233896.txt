What is the goal of a time-series model?

I recently started reading online about time series and I came up with the following definition (based on a few sources). I am trying to explain it in the simplest language possible. Can anyone suggest improvements? A time-series model attempts to explain away relationships in the data by accounting for sources of serial correlation. A good time-series model is shown by a correlogram with no bars that are above the blue line (when using the acf() function in R).
