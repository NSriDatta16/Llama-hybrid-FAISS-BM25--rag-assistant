Do "Mixed Effects Time Series Models" Exist?

Suppose I have the number weekly of hospital visits in a certain ZIP code (10 years of data) - this ZIP code has a small population in general and as a result, not that many people visit the hospital within this ZIP code. If I were to fit a basic time series model (e.g. ARIMA) to this data, I might run into some difficulties because I don't have enough data. Suppose I also have the weekly number of hospital visits at the State Level and at the Country Level. Additionally, at the yearly level - I have information on the total population and the average income of all residents within the ZIP code, the State and the Country. Furthermore, I also have information on whether a given year the President of the Country and the State Governor was a Democrat or Republican, and indicator variable for Pre-Covid/Post-Covid. Based on this information, I had the following ideas: Suppose I were to use a VAR Model - in which the weekly hospital visits in the ZIP code are modelled using weekly hospital visits from the State Level and the Country Level. The idea being that perhaps I could "statistically pool" relevant and related information to improve my weekly estimates. By doing this, am I basically creating a "Mixed Effects Time Series Model"? On top of what I just described - suppose I decide to add information to the above model on Covid and Democrat/Republican, thus making the model similar to an ARMAX/ARIMAX. From a conceptual point-of-view, is this also similar to a "Mixed Effects Time Series Model"? In general, I am not sure if these approaches that I have described above "statistically valid approaches" or if they fundamentally flawed and likely will result in model violations. Thanks!
