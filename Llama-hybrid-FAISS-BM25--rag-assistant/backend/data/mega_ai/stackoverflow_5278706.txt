I'm not sure there is a simple answer to this. We get odd exceptions all the time on our site for all sorts of reasons. Sometimes it's people not using the site the way you expect and sometimes it stuff like you mention such as user-agent edge cases etc. Basically you need to start to gather evidence and see what comes up that's unusual with these requests. So to start: do you catch exceptions in you application? If so dumping all scopes ( CGI/CLIENT/FORM/URL/SESSION ) in an email along with the full exception and emailing them to a custom emails address (such as errors@yourdomain.com ) will give you a reference you can square up to your error times and this might give you a hint as to the real issue. Hope that helps some!
