I had some time this afternoon to run a head to head comparison between netTiers and SubSonic. I used code generated using SubStage (part of the SubSonic 2.1 release) and I used RepositoryRecord as my base class. I ran the same test against the same database using code generated by .netTiers 2.2 The test was a derivative of the one that Rob Conery used in his post: http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/subsonic-scaling/ When i say derivative, I mean I just wrote 100,000 records into the database. I repeated each test on the same PC three times. I found that .netTiers accomplished the task in 90 seconds. Subsonic completed it in 104 seconds. There was no more than a one second deviation from these averages.
