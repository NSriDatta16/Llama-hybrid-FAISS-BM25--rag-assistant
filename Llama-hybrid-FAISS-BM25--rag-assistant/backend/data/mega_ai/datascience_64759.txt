You said: Yes, I already ran few feature selection algorithms like SelectKbest, SelectFrom Model, RFE, Feature Importance etc which outputs both min and max. For example - Min_bp and Max_bp. When I did a sanity check by running correlation, I was able to see that they all are correlated. In general you have 2 options. You can remove features that are not predictive for the target variable. This will include statistical tests such as ANOVA see here . Then based on the F-values you can only keep the features that have the higher F-values meaning that they have high predictive ability for the target variable. If you want to remove correlated features, for example when using a regression (you ideally need uncorrelated variables), then dimensionality reduction such as PCA can be used. In this case, the new features will not be correlated but you will not be able to project back to the original features. PCA will lead to a linear combination of the original features.
