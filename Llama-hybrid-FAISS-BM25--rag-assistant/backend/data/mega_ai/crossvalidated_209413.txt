Why is it necessary to fix a matrix diagonal and after this calculate the exponential to assess transition probabilities?

I'm learning markov chains in order to compute estimations of transition probabilities, and I found an example of the estimator construction for continuous time markov chains: http://www.rinfinance.com/agenda/2015/talk/AlexanderMcNeil.pdf (pages 10 -12) In its presentation, the author specifies that it's necessary to fix matrix diagonal and replace it by the negative of row sums without considering it's initial value: D After that, he computes estimated transition probabilities: P.hat The output is consistent because each row adds up to one so it seems it works. Although, I don't understand why it was necessary to make these two steps and would really appreciate any help.
