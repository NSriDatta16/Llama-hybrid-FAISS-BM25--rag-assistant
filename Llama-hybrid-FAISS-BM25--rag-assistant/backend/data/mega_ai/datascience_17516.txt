How to deal with string labels in multi-class classification with keras?

I am newbie on machine learning and keras and now working a multi-class image classification problem using keras. The input is tagged image. After some pre-processing, the training data is represented in Python list as: [["dog", "path/to/dog/imageX.jpg"],["cat", "path/to/cat/imageX.jpg"], ["bird", "path/to/cat/imageX.jpg"]] the "dog", "cat", and "bird" are the class labels. I think one-hot encoding should be used for this problem but I am not very clear on how to deal it with these string labels. I've tried sklearn's LabelEncoder() in this way: encoder = LabelEncoder() trafomed_label = encoder.fit_transform(["dog", "cat", "bird"]) print(trafomed_label) And the output is [2 1 0], which is different that my expectation output of somthing like [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]. It can be done with some coding, but I'd like to know if there is some "standard" or "traditional" way to deal with it?
