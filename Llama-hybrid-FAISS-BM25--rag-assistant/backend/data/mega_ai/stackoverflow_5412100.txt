SQL Index Filters - not indexing old data

If I have a table with 500m rows dating back to 2007 and everything before 2009 is rarely accessed (historical data), is it wise to apply filters to indexes to only index data after 2009? From what I see Indexes are going to be physically smaller Indexes will perform better for frequently accessed data Retrieval for older data will be slower If a sliding date is required, indexes will need to be altered (adjusting it to only show last 2 years, once a year) What am I missing? What are the negative side affects? @Ryk made me think of another issue. We are planning to partition the table(s). should filters be applied before partitioning or after?
