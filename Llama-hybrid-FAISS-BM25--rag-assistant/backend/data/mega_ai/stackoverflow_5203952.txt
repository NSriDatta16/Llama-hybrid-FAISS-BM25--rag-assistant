What is a good SQL Server strategy for copy/move database tables between two location in different networks?

What would be the best strategy for a SQL server database copy/move from a source location separated by the Internet to a destination? (preferably automated) The destination will not need to alter data but will require query access. In this case both locations are not connected by VPN. They are on different domains/networks. The frequency of getting the copy from the source will be approximately twice a month. Assuming both sites are using MS SQL Server 2008 (not Express/Standard editions). Can include strategy with differential backups if suitable Prefer to use a MS SQL Server solution rather than custom programmatic solution Initial Database size and the incremental changes might be approximately ~150MB Possible solutions I can think of: Snapshot Replication with FTP - the only problem is trying to Automate the FTP connection in retrieval. Also provides flexibility with Articles that can be chosen. But the tables require Primary Keys (PK) Log Shipping (Recovery in Standby mode) - the problem here is copying and retrieving the Transaction Logs from the folder; as they are on different networks.
