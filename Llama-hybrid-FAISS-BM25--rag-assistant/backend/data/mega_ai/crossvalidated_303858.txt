In a small discussion in the scikit-learn mailinglist, we came to the conclusion that the number of documents is indeed to few for the algorithm to learn informative topics from it. However, this is really a limitation of the Online Variational Bayes (Hoffman et al) approach which is implemented in scikit-learn for LDA (the same approach is also used in Gensim). If I split the documents into "sub-documents" with, say, 5 paragraphs each (giving ~10k of such sub-documents), the algorithm is able to find informative topics. Gibbs sampling based implementations like lda , on the other hand, handle scenarios with a small number of (large) documents better.
