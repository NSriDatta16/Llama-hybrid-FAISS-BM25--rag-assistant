You can use PCA to project your data set on a lower dimensional space (reduce the dimensionality) and then use clustering there. The usual caution about preprocessing the data (normalizing them etc.) applies. Effectively, clustering then is done on "artificial" attributes, that is, linear combinations of "real" attributes. Chances are you won't find a lot of perfect matches when you do this, so you'll need some other distance function.
