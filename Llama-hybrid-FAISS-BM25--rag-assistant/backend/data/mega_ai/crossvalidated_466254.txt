Do percent variables need to be scaled for machine learning?

I have 101 independent variables in a logistic regression predictive model. 55 variables are continuous and 46 are categorical one-hot encoded. 5 of the 55 continuous variables are expressed as percents (values ranging from 0.05 to 0.90). For the 50 continuous variables, I am experimenting with applying normalization (MinMaxScaler) or standardization (StandardScaler). I am unsure what to do with the 5 percent variables. Do I need to apply normalization, standardization, or leave the percent variables as they are without scaling them?
