The Chomsky Hierarchy is basically: Regular languages Context-Free Grammars Context-Sensitive Grammars Recursively Enumerable (Turing-Complete) Grammars LL Grammars (and parsers) are a subset of context-free grammars. They are used because regular languages are too weak for programming purposes and because a general context-free parser is O(n^3) which is too slow for parsing a program. Indeed, augmenting a parser with helper functions does make it stronger. The Wikipedia entry on LL parsers explains some of this. The Dragon Book is considered a leading textbook on compilers, and may explain further.
