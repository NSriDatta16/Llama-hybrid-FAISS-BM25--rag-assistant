How to preserve stack space with good design?

I'm programming in C for RAM limited embedded microcontroller with RTOS. I regularly break my code to short functions, but every function calling require to more stack memory. Every task needs his stack, and this is one of the significant memory consumers in the project. Is there an alternative to keep the code well organized and readable, still preserve the memory?
