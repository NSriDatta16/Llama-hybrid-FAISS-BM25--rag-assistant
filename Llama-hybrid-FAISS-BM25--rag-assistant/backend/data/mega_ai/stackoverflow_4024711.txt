Assuming you want to execute certain method according to the actual type, you can use GetMethod on the instance, and if the method exists invoke it. public void DoSomething(IService service) { System.Reflection.MethodInfo method = service.GetType().GetMethod("MySpecialMethod"); if (method != null) method.Invoke(service, null); } This way you won't have to check the type at all, just check if the method exists - kind of walking around the tree, so I hope this approach is useful. You can also use array of possible methods and iterating over them, checking each and have more elegant code this way.
