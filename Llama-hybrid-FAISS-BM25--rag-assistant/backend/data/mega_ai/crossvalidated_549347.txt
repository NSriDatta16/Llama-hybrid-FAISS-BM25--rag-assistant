PCA, test for eigen values

Let's say I have a matrix $X$ with $4$ variables and $n$ observations and I run PCA, so I compute the eigenvalues/eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix, and then I test $H_0: \lambda_1=\lambda_2=\lambda_3=\lambda_4$ , and I find that I don't reject $H_0$ . So I don't have evidence to say that there's a pair of different eigenvalues. What can I say about the estimation of the principal components $\hat{v}_i = \text{eigenvectors}\left(\widehat{\text{cov}}(X)^T\right)(X_i-\bar{X})$ ?
