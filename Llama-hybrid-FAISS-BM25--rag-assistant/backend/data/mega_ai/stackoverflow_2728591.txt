Have you tried preg_replace('/\x{2007}/u', '', $stringWithFigureSpaces); ? U+2007 is the unicode codepoint for the FIGURE SPACE . Please see my answer on a similar unicode-regex topic with PHP which includes information about the \x{FFFF} -syntax. Regarding you comment about the non-working - the following works perfectly on my machine: $ php -a Interactive shell php > $str = "a\xe2\x80\x87b"; // \xe2\x80\x87 is the FIGURE SPACE php > echo preg_replace('/\x{2007}/u', '_', $str); // \x{2007} is the PCRE unicode codepoint notation for the U+2007 codepoint a_b What's you PHP version? Are you sure the character is a FIGURE SPACE at all? Can you run the following snippet on your string? for ($i = 0; $i On my test string this outputs 61 e2 80 87 62 a |U+2007| b EDIT after OP comment: \xe2\x80\xa9 is a PARAGRAPH SEPARATOR which is unicode codepoint U+2029 , so your code should be preg_replace('/\x{2029}/u', '', $stringWithUglyCharacter);
