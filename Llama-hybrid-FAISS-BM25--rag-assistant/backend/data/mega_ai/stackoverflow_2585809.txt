I'm not personally familiar with this issue, but I was able to find a handful of similar bug reports online. What else are you doing on this page? Are you keeping focus on the page when you experience this issue? Apparently the handling of animated GIFs is pretty complicated: http://webkit.org/blog/96/background-music/ http://www.quirksmode.org/bugreports/archives/2004/12/animated_gifs_u.html https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=7320 Particularly relevant snippet from that first link: In both Safari 2 and WebKit nightlies, GIFs don’t animate unless they are being painted somewhere. If an animated GIF becomes invisible, then the animation will pause and no CPU will be consumed by the animation. Therefore all animated images in a background tab will not animate until the page in that tab becomes visible. If an animated GIF is scrolled offscreen even on a foreground page, it will stop animating until it becomes visible again. Safari’s CPU usage with animated GIFs is very good. (For a while readers of MacNN thought Safari had an “animated GIF problem” because of slowness when typing in forum posts, but that bug actually had to do with the Flash ads at the top and bottom of the page.)
