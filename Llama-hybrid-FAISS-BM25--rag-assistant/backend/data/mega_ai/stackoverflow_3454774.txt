Fix msysGit Portable $HOME location

I have successfully installed and configured msysGit Portable on my flash drive, and have used it to pull and push GitHub repos. However, I seem to always have to kludge the SSH support. Specifically, in order for SSH to find my key files, I have to follow these instructions to start a second instance of ssh-agent and then ssh-add my key every time I run git-bash.bat. Using the output of ssh -v git@github.com to debug I see that msysGit defaults to my Windows user directory to look for keys. It can't do that; I need it to look in its own directory on the portable drive. How can I force $HOME to be the program's own folder? Update for broken Vox link Instructions from this page are similar to the now-broken link I originally posted. Quoted below. Also here's the webarchive of original Vox article . However, if you try this and get: % ssh-add Could not open a connection to your authentication agent. then your session is not running under the ssh-agent. You can get around this by restarting a new shell under the agent by running: exec ssh-agent bash where you can replace bash with the shell of your choice. Once you do this, you should be able to run ssh-add to load your key for that shell.
