Meagan Fisher's talk on Designing Effective Mobile Interfaces provides a good overview. She recommends the book "Mobile Web Design" by Cameron Moll. Technology wise, I'd start by getting familiar with XHTML Mobile Profile if you're not already. As far as design goes, think thin. Snag a book with nice typography and see if you can duplicate the page layout with CSS. "Elements of Typographic Style Applied to the Web" is a good starting point for that. Phone websites are about scrolling, not complex navigation. Rhythm and spacing are important. Keep images small and your text high contrast, and you'll end up with something that loads fast and looks good.
