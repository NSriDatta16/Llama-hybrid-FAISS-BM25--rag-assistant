Are correlation-based artificial neurons considered in literature? First thing that comes to mind when I see this are Hopfield nets, which are stochastic binary neural networks. Boltzmann machines are a subset of Hopfield nets, and RBMs (Restricted BMs) are a subset which was particularly popular in the early days of deep learning. The popularity mostly stems from the fact that there is an efficient way to train these models and then assembling them to form multilayer networks. How to build practical neural-networks from them? I'm not really sure if I understood your model, but I'd look into methods that were used to stack RBMs to make deeper networks. These slides by Hinton contain nice explanation of RBMs and related concepts. Hinton also has a guide on training RBMs with more details.
