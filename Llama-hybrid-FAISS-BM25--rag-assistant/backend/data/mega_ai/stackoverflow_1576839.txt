Storing session data usually requires cookies on the client. If the bot doesn't accept cookies, it won't work. (Unless you enable use_trans_sid , which will add a session ID querystring to every URL.) Try doing the user agent check around the code that performs the redirect back to the age verification page, rather than on the age verification page itself. As an aside, don't use eregi -- it's deprecated. Use the perl-compatible regular expression functions instead.
