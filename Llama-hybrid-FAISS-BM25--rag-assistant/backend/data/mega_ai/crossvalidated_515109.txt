What to do when your training and testing data have different distributions

I am training a XGBoost regression model for predicting number of applications and the range of the target variable in train and test data set is different. For e.g: In Train data : Minimum applications = 40 Maximum applications = 1500 In test data : Minimum applications = 400 Maximum applications = 600 Obviously the standard deviation is also different for the test and train datset Hence the model is getting confused while predicting the value. Any suggestions on how should I solve this issue?
