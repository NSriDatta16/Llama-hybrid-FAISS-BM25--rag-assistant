Do Linear Regression and Logistic Regression models from sklearn include regularization?

I'm learning Data Science by enrolling on different courses, and I've recently learnt something that seems very interesting to apply when doing linear or logistic regression models: regularization . In the screenshot below, the course that I'm currently doing, shows that regularizing these models include an additional factor in the formula of the cost function (which I've circled in red). This factor helps the problem of over-fitting by adding cost when we have many input features. Now, during this course, we're creating the formulas and functions ourselves to better understand the mechanisms behind these models. However, I would prefer to continue using the functions from sklearn later. I would like to know if the LinearRegression() and LogisticRegression() models from sklearn, when trained, include (or have any parameter to make them include) regularization. Thanks everyone!
