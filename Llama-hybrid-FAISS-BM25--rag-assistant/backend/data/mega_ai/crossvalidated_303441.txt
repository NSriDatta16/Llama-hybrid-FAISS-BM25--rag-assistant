How does a p-value calculator work with only four inputs?

I see lots of online p-value calculators for conversion rate, like this one: http://www.experimentationhub.com/p-value.html How can that work, without knowing the variance/SD? I believe it's because conversion rate (i.e. the percentage of visitors to a web site who bought something) is just the average of a dummy (Boolean) variable (i.e. did the visitor buy something or not). And you can determine the variance of a dummy variable just from knowing its average, is that right? So to compute the p-value of any "rate" (e.g. conversion rate, click-through rate, etc) you don't need access to the underlying samples, just the average and count. But for anything that's a number (e.g. order size in dollars) you'd need to know the SD too.
