Cautions with sparse features

I got some sparse data for the first time and it's quite intimidating. After reading sklearn preprocessing docs it seems I should scale them with MaxAbsScaler (the sparseness is important). However, what are other recomendations for such kind of problems? Is it possible to use PCA or other kind of feature selection on this kind of data?
