Relations (tables) are sets of facts, not collections of "objects". The occurrence of an employee hitting the time clock is not an "object" by any reasonable meaning of the word, hence your inclination to add the suffix "Records" in all of your candidate names. Call it by what it represents, the event of someone hitting the clock: TimeClockHit. By the same argument, don't make your table names plural; apart from being logically incorrect, pragmatically it's a PITA to maintain a singular/plural mapping of all these names.
