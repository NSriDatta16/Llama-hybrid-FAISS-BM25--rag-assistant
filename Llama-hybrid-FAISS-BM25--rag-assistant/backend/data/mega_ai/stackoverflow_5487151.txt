Well, the problem is, that you have to initialize your object, if you want to manage the memory of it on your own. Why should you manage now the memory of title? Quite simple: Every object reference, that is stored in an Array, Set, Dictionary etc. is managed by the Array, Dictionary and Set. If you now just use this reference (by writing: "title = ...") in your cell, you will add the reference also to the cell. And now the cell is also responsible for the object-reference. So if the tableView wants to release your cells, which will happen from time to time to save memory, the cell will release your title-object. And this would cause the NSDitionary to be quite sad, since the NSDictionary wants to take care about the objects stored within itself. So you could write the following in the tableView-method: cell.textLabel.text = [article.title retain]; Or the commented lines of your own method. That means, you will "raise" the storage-level of your object up and if it gets released, the storage level itself will be decreased by one. If the storage-level will reach zero, it will be completely released (that should happen, if your tablecell is released AND your NSDIctionary) I hope i could help you a bit :)
