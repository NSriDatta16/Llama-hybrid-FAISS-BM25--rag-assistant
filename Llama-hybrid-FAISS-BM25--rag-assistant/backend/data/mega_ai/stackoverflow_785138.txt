the learning curve with most of these systems really seems to be a lot more than what should be necessary I understand. I've felt the same way when I've tried to use one. There is a lot of terminology and configuration (install, user setup, access rights etc) to go through if you only want to throw up some simple information. If I were you I'd just use a wiki . The advantage of this is you can create a flow however you want and not worry about the rules of the CMS system. And you can take it wherever you want later on. E.g. Python wiki . The two wikis I'd recommend are MoinMoin because it is very well presented (e.g. Python wiki), easy to use (full WYSIWYG editor option), customisable (CSS etc) and uses flat files (so no DB admin or hidden content in SQL). Its written in Python and I'd recommend using fastcgi or mod_python to make it really fast. If you don't fancy that, WakkaWiki is excellent. It's PHP with SQL backend though. Easy to setup and easy to grok with good features (e.g. embedding mind maps).
