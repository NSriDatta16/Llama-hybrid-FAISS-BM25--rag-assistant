New Extended WPFToolkit ColorPicker

I've been trying to get the new colorpicker from the toolkit working in my app, without success... Here is sample code that is supposed to pick up the color of the window background to populate current color, and upon new selection, is supposed to change the background color to the selected color... This is all the documentation I've been able to locate on the colorpicker... http://elegantcode.com/2010/08/15/extended-wpf-toolkit-new-colorpicker-control/
