A further question about calculating average "distance" between the corresponding content in two files

Now my program generates two data files. a.txt and b.txt Take a.txt as an example, it's content just like this: 0,0 0,1 1,0 -3,1 1,-2 1,3 ...... b.txt is similar with a.txt. Now, I hope to find out average distance between the corresponding content in a and b file. In other words, for example, if b.txt like this: 0,0 1,1 1,2 -3,1 1,-2 1,3 ...... Then the distance is calculated in this way: sqrt[square(0-0)+square(0-0)] +sqrt[square(0-1)+square(1-1)] +sqrt[square(1-1)+square(0-2)] +sqrt[square((-3)-(-3))+square(1-1)] +sqrt[square(1-1)+square((-2)-(-2))] ....... _____________ /Total number(i.e 10,000) to get the average distance between these two files content. Question: how to write a shell script which can carry out the calculation process like above? And output the final average distance? Hint: you may view two groups of coordinates are stored in two files. Need your kind help..Many many Thanks. Addition: There are about 10,000 - 100,000 rows for each files.
