Make input form read-only?

I have a bunch of forms that have a lot of fields on them. The user now is requiring that I provide a "read-only" version of every single form. I would recode every field into an ... mess, but I'm hoping for something a little more elegant. A friend suggested $(function () { $('input').keypress(function() { return false; }); }); which does part of what I want, but you can still paste into the fields and you can still delete from them.
