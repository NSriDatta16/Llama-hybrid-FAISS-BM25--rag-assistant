redis config question?

I am using redis for caching but recently I ran into a problem with the amount of memory used - had to restart my server since all ram had been consumed. It's not the biggest machine but how should I configure redis to avoid the same problem again? free -m total used free shared buffers cached Mem: 240 222 17 0 6 38 -/+ buffers/cache: 177 62 Swap: 255 46 209 I have changed the following settings: timeout 60 databases 1 save 300 1 save 60 100 maxmemory 104857600 top top - 14:15:28 up 1:19, 1 user, load average: 0.00, 0.00, 0.00 Tasks: 49 total, 1 running, 48 sleeping, 0 stopped, 0 zombie Cpu(s): 0.0%us, 0.0%sy, 0.0%ni,100.0%id, 0.0%wa, 0.0%hi, 0.0%si, 0.0%st Mem: 245956k total, 228420k used, 17536k free, 6916k buffers Swap: 262136k total, 47628k used, 214508k free, 39540k cached
