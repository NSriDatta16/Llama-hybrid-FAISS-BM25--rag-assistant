Unevenly distributed data collection can (but will not necessarily) introduce a bias. This is a type of sample selection bias and is caused when the probability of a sample being generated is related to the quantity being observed. This is easy to see with a simple example, suppose that you are collecting information on the rainfall across the region. Cities experience more rainfall than rural areas, so if you sample from city regions more frequently than other areas, then you will overestimate the amount of rainfall overall (at least if you just take a simple average across your samples). Either way, I wouldn't ever recommend throwing out data unless you have a really good reason too! In most cases, you are able to correct for the bias introduced if you understand how your data was collected. In my rainfall example, one way this could be achieved by dividing your region into a grid as you suggest, but then estimating the total rainfall in each grid segment and summing the results. In response to your edit: I think you are getting overly caught up on the data you have available to you. Whether your model will produce biased estimates due to the uneven data collection depends upon the model / estimator being used not (just) the data available to you. you will need to provide more detail about your actual model for us to have any hope of telling if this is an issue in your case. I should also correct a point i made above, as it has perhaps led to some of your confusion. The fix for the rainfall example i gave will only work if the probability for including each observation in your samples in a given grid segment becomes unrelated to the value of observation. You can easily see that this wouldn't hold if for example the grid segments still included both rural and urban areas (and may not even hold on purely rural or urban areas, this is something that requires subject matter expertise to solve).
