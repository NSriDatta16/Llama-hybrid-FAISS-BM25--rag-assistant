Singleton: Where to create instance?

Does anyone have any preferences or comments about using either ... static id sharedReactor = nil; +(id)sharedInstance { if(sharedReactor == nil) sharedReactor = [[super allocWithZone:NULL] init]; return sharedReactor; } OR: static id sharedReactor = nil; +(void)initialize { if(sharedRandomReactor == nil) { sharedRandomReactor = [[super allocWithZone:NULL] init]; } +(id) sharedInstance { return sharedReactor; } To my mind using +(void)initialize seems a lot more elegant, I am just curious what people with more experience than myself think of both approaches? gary
