assign text of a UIlabel to a text field

I am quite new to iphone development. I have a situation here. I have some labels which can be dragged across the screen. What I want is when any of these labels are dragged to some textfield and released over a textfiels UIlabel test is assigned to that text field. The crux in this is I have to check for a condition when UILabel is inside UITextfield. Can you help me to fabricate this condition. Thanx in advance
