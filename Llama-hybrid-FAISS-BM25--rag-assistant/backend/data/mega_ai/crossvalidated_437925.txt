The Master Algorithm: How the Quest for the Ultimate Learning Machine Will Remake Our World is a book by Pedro Domingos released in 2015. Domingos wrote the book in order to generate interest from people outside the field. The book outlines five tribes of machine learning: inductive reasoning, connectionism, evolutionary computation, Bayes' theorem and analogical modelling. The author explains these tribes to the reader by referring to more understandable processes of logic, connections made in the brain, natural selection, probability and similarity judgements. Throughout the book, it is suggested that each different tribe has the potential to contribute to a unifying "master algorithm". https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Master_Algorithm
