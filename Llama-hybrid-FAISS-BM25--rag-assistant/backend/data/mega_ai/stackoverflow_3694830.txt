Android activity image background size

I am a bit confused on creating an image which will be acting as a background for my activities. So, in short, my aim is that my application should be able to fit the different screen sizes. Therefore, what size in pixel should my three images be to be able to fill the screen of the device in ldpi, mdpi and hdpi? Thank you for any response.
