Variable Set has only 6 categories. My guess is that this is not enough information to appropriately estimate the variance of the random effects. Most books on multilevel modeling suggest sample sizes of $\geq 15$ for level two units. You might want to include Set as a fixed effect and estimate a simpler glm() model. Here are a few references: Maas & Hox (2005): Sufficient Sample Sizes for Multilevel Modeling ; Moineddin et al. (2007): A simulation study of sample size for multilevel logistic regression models . Stegueller (2013): How Many Countries for Multilevel Modeling? A Comparison of Frequentist and Bayesian Approaches
