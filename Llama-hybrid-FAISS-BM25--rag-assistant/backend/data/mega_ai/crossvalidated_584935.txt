First, there is no z = z_mean in the original tutorials because if you set z to z_mean, your latent variable will always be deterministic, which is not a desired property we want from VAEs. I think you;'re doing it to convert to a regular AE. Second, I am not sure what your data is, but VAE's Gaussian prior and posterior do not seem to be a good fit with your data or as you mentioned posterior collapse may be the problem. You can look at this paper to train your VAEs or implement beta VAEs . VAE's main aim is to generate new data, while AE's main purpose is to reconstruct the data. Depending on your prior/posterior, VAE could perform better or worse than the AE. Hope this helps!
