"I dont know C++, but I do know AS3, Javascript, and PHP. So I was hoping to relate some of that knowledge to C++." Oh boy, I suppose you're going to be surprised. To learn C++: Buy at least one or two very good books (see here ). Do not buy books that aren't very good. They'll teach you habits that you would have to unlearn later in order to make further progress. Expect having to do plenty of hands-on code writing with a lot of reading in between. In the first few weeks, the compiler will spit legions of incomprehensible error messages at you, your code will keep crashing, and seasoned C++ programmers looking at your code will throw up their hands in disgust. And it's always your fault. Plan a lot of time to learn. And I mean a real lot . No matter how much time you devote, it will take at least a couple of months until you upgrade from "dummy" to "novice". Imagine having to hammer at it for a couple of years in order to become a real professional, constantly reading books and articles, devoting plenty of time to newsgroups and discussion forums, learning from others, banging your head against every wall surrounding your desk. Be prepared to learn something you haven't known before at least once every week even after a decade of programming in C++ for a living. Just for a moment, imagine I might not overstate this. Edit for clarification : I have up-voted both Hunter Davis' and Elemental's answers, because they're very good, pretty much to the point, and in general the encouragement is supported by me despite my rant up there. In fact, I do not doubt that many are able to hack something together in C/C++ when given a skeleton example even if actually they don't know much of C++. Go ahead and try, there's a good chance you'll come up with a screen saver within reasonable time. But. Being able to "hack something together in C/C++" is far from "having learned C++". (And I mean very far.) C++ is an incredible complex, mean, and stubborn beast. I also consider it almost breathtakingly beautiful, but in that it probably mirrors the view from a very high mountain: It's pretty hard to get to the point where you're able to appreciate the beauty.
