The typical handwriting dataset everybody seems to use is quite ill formed for PCA and many mathematical methods. It is pixels, and obviously some of these (bottom right corner, whatever) are never really painted in any of the samples you have. Even worse, the values are discrete. This can cause all kind of artifacts. PCA now comes from the perfect world where all dimensions are continuous and just have a different amount of variance to them. And it assumes the variance is caused by importance, not by natural scale of the axes ... Now throw in that we are (probably) talking about pixel data here. For obvious reasons, we can expect neighboring pixels to be strongly correlated . Guess what PCA will do... you could as well just downsample it to a lower resolution image anyway. Consider using something else. Just working around the matrix inversion will probably not save your analysis. And maybe you can do without the dimensionality reduction, too?
