Your question is confusing, but I will try anyway: A relational database (RDBMS and not embedded) generally has very granular security features which includes login and authentication mechanisms -- the details are beyond the scope of a SO answer. Telling a DB to listen on a certain port doesn't have much to do with security (unless the port is mapped and accepting internet trafic, in which case mapping it away would prevent it to listen for trafic). In a RDBMS the relational the execution environment is your middle man, and a RDBMS will have a back-end storage structure. You generally cannot directly access the underlying engine as the execution environment does a lot of complex things -- which you cannot hope to co-ordinate with through direct access. The architecture of couch-DB is very simple compared to a RDBMS and places a lot of low-level power in the hands of the developer. -- edit: after first comment by author -- A relational database is meant to be directly accessed -- and layers in the middle are application specific architectural decisions and additions to the RDBMS. --edit: after second comment by Author -- If you want to access their RDBMS directly via the internet they need make the database port reachable, once that is done you need to use the native drivers/API of the database vendor. They may: Open up the database's port to the internet by externally mapping it (bad bad bad). Provide you with an SSH gateway which you could use to tunnel in. provide you with a VPN endpoint to which you can establish a VPN connetion from your network
