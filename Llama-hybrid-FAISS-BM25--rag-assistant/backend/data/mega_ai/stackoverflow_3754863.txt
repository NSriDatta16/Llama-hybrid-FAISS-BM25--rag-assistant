How to index different types of xml using DIH in SOLR?

I need to index 5 different kinds of xml files. They share similar structure with slight differences in each of them. example 1: 9780815341291 Essential Cell Biology,Third Edition Alberts;Bruce Bray;Dennis SCABC SCDEF 123456789 03_Mutations_Origin_Cancer.mp3 audio/mpeg Part Three - Mutations and the Origin of Cancer 123 1 example 2: 9780815341291 Essential Cell Biology,Third Edition FN:Alberts;Bruce FN:Bray;Dennis SCABC SCGHI 123456789 A subunit The portion of a bacterial exotoxin that interferes with normal host cell function. 10 My dih-config.xml is as below: I'm not quite familiar with xpath. I can't use wildcard in element name, can I? Tried it and it didn't work. Many thanks in advance.
