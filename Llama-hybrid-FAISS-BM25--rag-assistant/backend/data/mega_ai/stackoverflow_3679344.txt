If you really need a class that has the interface of NSMutableArray and your 2d array operations you probably should subclass NSMutableArray . Since this is a class cluster you also must implement the primitive operations of NSArray and NSMutableArray . These are count , objectAtIndex: , insertObject:atIndex: , removeObjectAtIndex: , addObject: , removeLastObject , and replaceObjectAtIndex:withObject: as well as any init -Methods you require. You then could implement the storage yourself or simply forward them to a NSMutableArray instance variable. But youâ€™re probably better off with a new class for your 2d arrays as Yuji suggested.
