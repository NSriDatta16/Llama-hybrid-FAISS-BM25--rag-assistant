The quick answer is that $R^2$ measures a reduction in variance, compared to always guessing $\bar y$ , no matter the predictors. What your results tell me is that the variance from always guessing $\bar y$ is so gigantic that even a huge $R^2$ value like $0.9$ or $0.99$ still does not let you get as accurate as you want or need for your application. Maybe you need $R^2>0.9999$ for your task (ten-thousand-fold reduction in variance).
