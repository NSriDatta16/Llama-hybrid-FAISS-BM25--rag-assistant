MVC - Dynamically loading Partial Views

I'm trying to dynamically load partial views into a view by passing the list of paths for the partial views I want and then calling RenderPartial on each. This seems to do the trick. The problem comes in when I try to pass the model to the partial view. Since I'm dynamically loading them, I don't exactly know which model to pass for that particular partial view. I don't want to populate every possible object and I'm considering using reflection with a config lookup for each partial view to dynamically load the model. I was also considering adding an ActionFilter which would automatically populate the right model values for me but even this implementation would have to use Reflection. Does anyone have any other suggestions? One thing I miss about regular ASP.NET user controls that I don't see in MVC. The user controls encapsulated their own logic for data retrieval whereas in MVC, the main controller needs to know about it. That means if I were to use a partial view for another controller, that controller would also have to know how to fetch the model for that partial view. Am I missing something here? Thanks.
