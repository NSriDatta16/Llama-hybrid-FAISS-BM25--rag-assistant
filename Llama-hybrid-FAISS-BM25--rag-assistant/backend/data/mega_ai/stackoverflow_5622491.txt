In a Schematron rule, how do i access the parent element of the current element?

I am using ISO Schematron to validate an XML document. The rule I have set works as required, but I want to report the name of the parent element from the context of where my assertion is fired. A sample document might contain the XML fragment: Alan Smith My Schematron rule tests that the element is only allowed to occur as a child of a element. The rule is as follows: The "br" element is not allowed as a child of the ' ' element.' When I run this rule against the fragment, the assertion is correctly fired, however I want the message to tell me that "The "br" element is not allowed as a child of the 'Name' element". Instead it actually shows "The "br" element is not allowed as a child of the 'Alan Smith' element". So the expression is actually selecting the text node and not the parent element as I expected? Can someone help explain what XPpath expression I should be using in the select statement to display the name of the parent element in my error message?. Thanks. UPDATE: I managed to achieve the desired result by removing the select statement, and replacing it with a name element as in: The "br" element is not allowed as a child of the ' ' element.' So my problem is solved, but if anyone can explain why my first attempt doesn't work, that would be very helpful.
