With something like JProfiler all you need to do is add certain parameters to the JVM. It uses JVMTI. I think you should be reading up on profilers and exactly what they can do for you. I also suggest reading up on JVMTI. The JVMTM Tool Interface (JVM TI) is a new native programming interface for use by tools. It provides both a way to inspect the state and to control the execution of applications running in the Java virtual machine (JVM). JVM TI supports the full breadth of tools that need access to JVM state, including but not limited to: profiling, debugging, monitoring, thread analysis, and coverage analysis tools. Note: JVM TI replaces the Java Virtual Machine Profiler Interface (JVMPI) and the Java Virtual Machine Debug Interface (JVMDI). JVMPI and JVMDI will be removed in the next major release of J2SETM.
