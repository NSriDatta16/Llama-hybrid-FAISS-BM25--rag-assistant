if you are interested in obtaining a HMM of the time series, then you will probably benefit from this paper about the use of HMM in the financial sector - see chapter 3. Prediction of financial time series with HMM by Yingjian Zhang. Abstract. In this thesis, we develop an extension of the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that addresses two of the most important challenges of nancial time series modeling: non-stationary and non-linearity. Specically, we extend the HMM to include a novel exponentially weighted EM algorithm to handle these two challenges. We show that this extension allows the HMM algorithm to model not only sequence data but also dynamic nancial time series.
