Setting up a user / roles management system - with multi-tenancy

Does anyone have any schema's, data models, or suggestions for creating a user / roles management system that accounts for multi-tenancy. For example, a user in organization A, may be assigned a role to a certain project, to a certain application, in organization B. Any ideas? I've been reading up on RBAC, just looking for a good example. Thanks
