(1) is incorrect, because if you run PCA on the two sets separately, you will end up with two different spaces. You cannot train a classifier in one space, and apply it to a different space. (2) is cheating. When you train a classifier, you cannot use any information from the test set. The correct way would be to run PCA on the training set, save the principal components that you use, and then use them to transform the points in your test set. This way the points in both sets end up in the same space, and you are not using any knowledge about your test set during training. Alternatively, you can use an entirely separate data set, just for computing the principal components. Then project both your training set and your test set into the space defined by those.
