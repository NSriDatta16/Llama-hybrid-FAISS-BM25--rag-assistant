Ordinary kriging example step by step?

I have followed tutorials online for spatial kriging with both geoR and gstat (and also automap ). I can perform spatial kriging and I understand the main concepts behind it. I know how to build a semivariogram, how to fit a model to it and how to perform ordinary kriging. What I don't understand is how the weights of the surrounding measured values are determined. I know they derive from the semivariogram and depend on the distance from the prediction location and on the spatial arrangement of the measured points. But how? Could anyone please make an ordinary kriging (non-bayesian) model with 3 random measured points and 1 prediction location? It would be enlightening.
