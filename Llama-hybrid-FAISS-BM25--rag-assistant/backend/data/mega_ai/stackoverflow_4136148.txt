You can't rely on font-width consistency. It's not just across browsers that it differs, but it also differs considerably across operating systems. Instead you have to create your designs to allow for some leeway in font width. For slightly better consistency, try using html 5 @font-face , which is now impemented across all modern browsers. But even then, width can't be gauranteed -- that will just guarantee that at least the font defintion is the same. Finally, you could use images for perfect consistency, but that is strongly discouraged. It's better to just allow some wiggle room in your designs.
