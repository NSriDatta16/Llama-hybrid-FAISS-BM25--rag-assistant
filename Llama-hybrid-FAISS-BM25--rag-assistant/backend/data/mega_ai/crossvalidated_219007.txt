Whats wrong with the chi-squared test? Just look at the $t = \sum \frac{(E-O)^2}{E}$ on $df = (5-1)(2-1)$. Doing the calculations countA = c(500,1500,5000,2000,1000) countB = c(100,1000,5000,2500,1400) t = sum((countA-countB)^2/countA) 1-pchisq(t,df = 4) Doing this you get a p-value resA = c(rep(1,500), rep(2,1500), rep(3,5000), rep(4,2000), rep(5,1000)) resB = c(rep(1,100), rep(2,1000), rep(3,5000), rep(4,2500), rep(5,1400)) mean(resA) [1] 3.15 mean(resB) [1] 3.41 So knowing they are statistically different and knowing that die b has a higher average you can say that die b is more likely to give a higher number over repeated trials. You could also use the frequencies to calculate the probabilities of one dice throwing higher than the other. $$P(B>A) = \sum_{N=2}^5(B=N~and~ A A) = \sum_{N=2}^5[P(B=N) P(A A) = \sum_{N=2}^5[P(B=N) \sum_{n=1}^NP(A=n)]$$ Here we get $P(B>A) = 0.406$ and $P(A>B) = 0.2645$ Here we can see that dice B has a higher chance of having a larger roll than A.
