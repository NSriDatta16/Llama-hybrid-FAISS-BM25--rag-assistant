Prediction and explanation of user rating based on multiple criteria

I'm trying to figure out a way to both predict how a user would rate a certain document, as well as an explanation of why certain documents are rated a certain way. A user is represented by: favorite topics; average length of the documents the user read; the distribution of the times of day a user reads the documents; location; age. With this information I want to: Predict how much a user will like a document (based on the document's topics, length, the time of day, etc) Get explanations like: documents with this length are usually read around this time; or, documents about these topics are usually read at these locations. I hope this question is not too broad. I just need some starting tips.
