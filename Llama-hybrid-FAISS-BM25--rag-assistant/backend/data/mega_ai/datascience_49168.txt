Padding sequences for neural sequence models (RNNs)

I am padding sequences for a GRU based classifier that I am building in Keras. I'm wondering if there's any accepted best practice for padding the leading or trailing side of the sequence. E.g. sequence = [1,2,3,4] leading_pad = [0,0,0,1,2,3,4] trailing_pad = [1,2,3,4,0,0,0] In other projects I have generally padded the leading end of the sequence as a convention imprinted on me by various blogs, course work and other examples. My question: is there any research that shows whether or not it matters which side of the sequence you pad? Or am I completely over thinking this? Any advice would be much appreciated.
