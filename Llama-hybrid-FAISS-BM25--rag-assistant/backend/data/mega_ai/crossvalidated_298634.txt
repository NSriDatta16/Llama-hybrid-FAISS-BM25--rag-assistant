With regards to convergence criteria most work is on convergence is the Total Variation (TV) distance sense. Mostly because there is a lot of probability theory worked out for TV distance. There is a nice survey paper and also on the theoretical side there is the paper by Roberts and Rosenthal that gives several theorems on convergence criteria. On the more practical side there are several papers written by Jim Hobert that provide examples of applying one of the theorems in Roberts and Rosenthal to MCMC. In general the tricky part of applying that theorem seems to be coming up with a good Lyapunov drift function.
