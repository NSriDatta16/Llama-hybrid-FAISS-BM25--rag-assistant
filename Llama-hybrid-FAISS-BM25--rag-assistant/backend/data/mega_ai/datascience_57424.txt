R package vs REST API

I have a logistic regression algorithm in R to predict irresponsible users. I need this to be as flexible as possible for any market. I would need to use the logistic regression algorithm to calculate the weights so that the model can (after training and testing) predict the irresponsible users. I am confused whether I should create an R package or use REST API to call the code and perform the algorithm. Does anyone know which one would be better?
