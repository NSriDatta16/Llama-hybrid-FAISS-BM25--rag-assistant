Still not quite understand the question, so my answer may be wrong... From my point of view, you may have 2 choices Only use a subset of feature to neural network Use all features, and get the gradient respect to all features, but only focusing on the components related to the feature you are interested in. In other words, get a subset the gradient vector.
