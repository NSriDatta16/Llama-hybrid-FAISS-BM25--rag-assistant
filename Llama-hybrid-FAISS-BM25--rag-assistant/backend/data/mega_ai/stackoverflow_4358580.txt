getting the "friendly" name for window startmenu items/shortcut files

This is curious, some startmenu items seems to resolve to a "friendly" name that's not contained in the actual .lnk file. For example: "c:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Accessories\System Tools\dfrgui.lnk" is displayed in explorer as "Disk Defragmenter", the actual shortcut file doesn't contain the real name either but links to the exe "C:\Windows\system32\dfrgui.exe"" Is this a Win32 API thing or is there a simpler way to get the "friendly" name of a file/start menu item?
