This changed on PyDev 2.0, now, instead of a run as coverage, you have to open the code-coverage view (under the window > views menu) and select the 'enable code coverage for new launches' options -- after that, any launch (regular or unit-test) will be automatically traced by the code-coverage. There's a small video with this feature (and some other things) at: http://pydev.org/video_pydev_20.html
