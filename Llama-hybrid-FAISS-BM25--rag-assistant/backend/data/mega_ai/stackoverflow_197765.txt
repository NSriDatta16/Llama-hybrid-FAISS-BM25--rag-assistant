I think when you buy third party controls you should think about the value you receive for the money you pay. There are dinosaur vendors like Telerik, Syncfusion, DevExpress, Infragistics which offer GUI with good quality and support, but they are not very cheap, because the brand costs money. There are other great WinForms suites coming from a small vendors such as ComponentFactory, DevComponents, VIBlend, Nevron which offer a good looking controls for WinForms in Office2007 style but much cheaper.
