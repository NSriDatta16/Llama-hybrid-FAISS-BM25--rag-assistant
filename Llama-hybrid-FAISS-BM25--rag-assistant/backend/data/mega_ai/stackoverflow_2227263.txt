Don't know if I'm understanding you completely but it sounds like you want access to a dynamically created Movieclip without explicitly defining it?! is that right? If so, then you could do what you have now but add a method for retrieval: public function addNewMc():void{ var newMC:MovieClip= new MovieClip(); this.addChild(newMC); } public function getMC():MovieClip { var len:uint = this.numChildren; while(len--) { var tempObj:* = this.getChildAt(len); if(tempObj is MovieClip) return MovieClip(tempObj); } return null; } You could also add a name property to the dynamically created movieclip: public function addNewMc():void { var newMC:MovieClip= new MovieClip(); newMC.name = "new_MC"; this.addChild(newMC); } you could then retrieve like this: this.getChildByName("new_MC"); Again don't know if I'm understanding your exact requirements cheers erick ;)
