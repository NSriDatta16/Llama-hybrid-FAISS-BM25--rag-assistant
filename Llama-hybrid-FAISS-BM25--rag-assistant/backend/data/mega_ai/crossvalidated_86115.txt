How to model continuous predictor variable, $x\ge0$, showing continuity "jump" at $x=0$?

I'm modeling hospital inpatient stays with a logistic regression model, and have encountered a number of predictor variables measuring # of outpatient care episodes which have an inflated number of observations at $x=0$ (sometimes over 90%). In addition, there's a discontinuous "jump" in observed y values comparing $x=0$ with $x>0$. Plotting a decile chart with $x=0$ to $10$ and looking at the proportion of people with inpatient stays within each decile reveals the following pattern as a typical example: One solution I'm tinkering with is to describe x with two component variables, a binary variable $x_1$ where $x_1=0$ if $x=0$, $x_1=1$ if $x>0$, and a continuous variable $x_2=x$. Then describe the model equation as: $\text{logit}(y)=\beta_0 + (\beta_1 + \beta_2x_2)x_1 = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_1 + \beta_2x_1x_2$ If x1=0 then logit(y) = beta0. Else if x1=1 then logit(y) = (beta0 + beta1) + beta2*x2 . However I'm unsure if this is a standard procedure for modeling predictor variables that exhibit this behavior?
