As Provost explains in 'An Introduction to ROC Analysis' , ROC averaging can be simply done by combining the scores from multiple sets $T_1, ..., T_k$ as you suggested in method (2). This is preferred to method (1) since it can be quite hard to average actual ROC curves, since the specificity (x-axis) values of the points are expected to be different. Therefore, you would need to do a lot of interpolation to average the curves. Another advantage is that the resulting curve from method (2) is smoother and approximates the AUC better, as a low number of scores tends to underestimate the AUROC (at least when calculated via the trapezoidal rule). However, one should note that an advantage of method (1) is that it enables you to estimate the variance of the AUC.
