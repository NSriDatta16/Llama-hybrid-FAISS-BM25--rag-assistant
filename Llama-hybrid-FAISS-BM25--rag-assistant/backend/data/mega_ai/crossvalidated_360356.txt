@jakes, I disagree with @anony-mousse on the statement, "You can't statistically measure which variable is more important on an unsupervised setting." This is wrong! What do you think Principal Component Analysis (PCA) does. PCA is an unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm. It works by extracting the variables that contain the maximum variance in them by doing an orthogonal transformation of the original variables. Besides, there exist scores of unsupervised algorithms that can be used for detecting and proving relationships between variables in an unsupervised setting. Again, "What is more important: shoe size, or income? Probably income, but statistics cannot "prove" this, or quantify the weights." Again, you are wrong. Statistics can prove this relationship provided how one has coded the variables and then apply an appropriate algorithm.
