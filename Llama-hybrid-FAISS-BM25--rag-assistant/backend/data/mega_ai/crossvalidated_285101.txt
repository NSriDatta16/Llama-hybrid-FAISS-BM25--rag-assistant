To solve this problem, you need two things. The first is an entity recognizer that detects terms in the text referencing locations. Since you have custom entities like "home" , a standard named entity recognizer like Apache OpenNLP will most likely not be sufficient without retraining. The second is a model that tells you which of the detected terms is the source and which the destination, e.g. isSource("home") = 0 and isDestination("home") = 1. You can try to train a classification model or a relation extraction model for this task on your own using labelled instances. But for a start I would recommend checking out MITIE , an information extraction library providing named entity recognition and binary relation extraction tools. Note that it also comes with an interactive model training tool.
