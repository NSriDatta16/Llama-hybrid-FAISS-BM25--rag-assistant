I'm afraid that the short response, as already stated, to your question is NO, you can't access the registry from client. Maybe you can resort to an activex (bounding your application to Microsoft browsers) Maybe, if your goal is just to implement some sort of user/license verification (I interpret in this way your response to my comment), you may find useful the webstorage / client side storage alternatives. As I know there are different implementation, technologies, you can leverage on. A starting point for your investigations can be http://wonko.com/post/search-pad-browser-storage
