There is not one absolutely correct method to handle this issue. Depending on dataset and algorithm used (eg NNs, SVMs) it is more appropriate in certain cases to simply add default values, but in other cases these default values can skew the results, so it is better to remove these data points altogether. Another method is to remove only the problematic features, in case there are always the same features with undefined values, and not the whole data point. In machine learning rarely, if ever, is there a one-size-fits-all method. They all depend on various parameters, including type of problem, dataset and learning method used.
