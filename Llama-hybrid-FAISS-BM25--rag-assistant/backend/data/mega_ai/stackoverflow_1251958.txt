Swing Menu that can be customized by user

Is there any framework or lib out there to create a Java swing menue that can be edited by the user via drag and drop? Added: Implementing a polished solution myself can take a lot of time. What i would like to see: display the entry while dragging, opening submenus automaticially, showing a line where the item would be placed when releasing the mouse. Actually like the windows startmenu in XP. This would take a lot of time, i am still hoping to find framework or a subclassed Jmenu with these features.
