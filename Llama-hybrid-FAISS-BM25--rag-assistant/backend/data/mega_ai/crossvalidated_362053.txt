It occurred to me after reconsidering this again after some months that the regret can be defined as a different of a (time-averaged) loss and an expected loss. Using this intuition the loss function can be anything. In particular if you only can about point estimates, consider a linear loss function. If you care about variances consider a quadratic or other loss function similarly chosen to handle variance estimates. For other scenarios similar comments apply.
