While learning about a concept , never go with only a single source , try and cross validate with different texts , to confirm any hypothesis or definition. This snippet itself is not comprehensive enough , and there should be more text supporting as to , what exactly embedding of manifold really is , and how well it should be understood to distinguish the so called "method" in this text. Generally , embedding methods even in non-linear , or higher dimension can be visualized as regularization or decision trees.
