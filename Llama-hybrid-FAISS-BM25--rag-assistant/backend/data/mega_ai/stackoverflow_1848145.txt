Flash / Actionscript: How to make overlapping sprite invisible

See image at http://reggino.kingsquare.nl/tmp/actionscriptProblem.jpg Hi there, I can't get my head around this one... I'm having two sprites, where the intersection of these sprites has an alpha of 0. I tried all the blendmodes and filters, but none of them seems appropriate. I've been puzzeling with extra layers on top of these three, masking each other etc, but that becomes a mess and makes it difficult to maintain (the text has to be dragged etc.... ). Does any of you guru's have a suggestion how to overcome this problem? There should be an easier way i think...? Thanks in advance for your help!
