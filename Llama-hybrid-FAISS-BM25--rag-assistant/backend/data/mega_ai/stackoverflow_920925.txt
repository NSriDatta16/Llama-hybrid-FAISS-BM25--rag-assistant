Visual Studio 2008 WPF designer won't load my forms

I'm trying to see a form developed by someone else (ex-employee) in Visual Studio 2008 but keep running into the following error when I try and look at MainForm.xaml (it fails to load in the designer view): Error Could not create an instance of type 'NumericTextBox'. D:\MySolution\GUI\MainForm.xaml My solution is organised something like this (shortened for brevity - it's the last line of this where the error occurs): \solution \Gui \App.xaml \MainForm.xaml \Utils \NumericTextBox.cs My MainForm.xaml looks something like this: ... ... ... Frequency (MHz): What might cause that error? Everything compiles okay but the application crashes when I run it . I was hoping the two problems might be a related issue.
