Should I pursue a PhD in Statistics?

I am trying to decide whether or not I should take a PhD program in Statistics. I am not inclined to get a position at a university after my PhD, my goal is rather to get hired by Contract Research Organizations involved in Clinical Trials, either as a Biostatistician or Statistical Programmer. At the moment, I like working with SAS so I am more inclined to become a Statistical Programmer. Would the Clinical Trials companies hire a PhD holder for their Statistical Programmer position? From what I see on the job postings, companies typically asks for Master's degree in Statistics (or sometimes even just a Bachelor's degree) for Statistical Programmer positions, but I just wanted to hear opinions of people who actually works in Clinical Trials for private companies. Thank you,
