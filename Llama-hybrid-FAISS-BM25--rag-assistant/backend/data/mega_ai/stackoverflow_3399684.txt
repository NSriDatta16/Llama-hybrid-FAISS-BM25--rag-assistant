Looking to simplify adding an attribute based on sibling's text

I would like to add a Title attribute to a row and the value is retrieved from the row's sibling which is hidden, unless clicked. I wanted to make it generic enough to handle when some screens don't have the hidden row with the text. Here is the first pass that works: $(function() { $("td.commandText pre").each(function(index) { $(this).parent().parent().prev().attr('Title', $(this).text()); }); }); Any ideas to make that more elegant? Here is an example of the HTML table I am working with: Session ID User Name Start Time End Time 174 user1 8/2/2010 4:00:09 PM Sample Text to show as a tooltip no errors 175 user1 8/2/2010 4:00:09 PM Sample Text to show as a tooltip no errors
