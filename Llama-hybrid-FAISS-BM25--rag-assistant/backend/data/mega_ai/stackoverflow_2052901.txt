If the items are strings, which are comparable... then I would suggest abandoning the idea of a Hashtable and going with something more like a Binary Search Tree. There are several implementations out there in C# (none that come built into the Framework). Be sure to get one that is balanced, like a Red Black Tree or an AVL Tree. The advantage is that each object in the tree is relatively small (only contains it's object, and a link to its parent and two leaves), so you can have a whole slew of them. Also, because it's sorted, the retrieval and insertion time are both O log(n).
