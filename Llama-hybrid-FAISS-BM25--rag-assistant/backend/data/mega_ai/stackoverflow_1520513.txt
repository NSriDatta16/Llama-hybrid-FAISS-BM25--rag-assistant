using quartz in a web app with spring

I've created a small console application to see how quartz work and it was easy to create an applicationcontext object inside the main method to get the cron run. OK now I'm in a real project managed by maven and which is using cron jobs defined in some of the modules. Each of the module has his own spring config file. I had 3 of the modules using quartz so it was setup in each of the spring config file. The web app module is the one who has the dependency of each of the modules. Now i had few concerns: should I created the applicationcontext as in the console project or it's supposed to be loaded. If yes, where am I supposed to load it. based on research on the Internet I did on line I use MethodInvokingJobDetailFactoryBean for easy unit testing. And now that I have to use the CronExpression class to test the getNextValidTimeAfter , I still don't know how to organize it properly Can anyone give me a hand. I'd really appreciate it. Thanks for reading
