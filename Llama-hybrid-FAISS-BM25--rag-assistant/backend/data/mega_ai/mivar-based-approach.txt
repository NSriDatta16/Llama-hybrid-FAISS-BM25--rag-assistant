The Mivar-based approach is a mathematical tool for designing artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Mivar (Multidimensional Informational Variable Adaptive Reality) was developed by combining production and Petri nets. The Mivar-based approach was developed for semantic analysis and adequate representation of humanitarian epistemological and axiological principles in the process of developing artificial intelligence. The Mivar-based approach incorporates computer science, informatics and discrete mathematics, databases, expert systems, graph theory, matrices and inference systems. The Mivar-based approach involves two technologies: Information accumulation is a method of creating global evolutionary data-and-rules bases with variable structure. It works on the basis of adaptive, discrete, mivar-oriented information space, unified data and rules representation, based on three main concepts: “object, property, relation”. Information accumulation is designed to store any information with possible evolutionary structure and without limitations concerning the amount of information and forms of its presentation. Data processing is a method of creating a logical inference system or automated algorithm construction from modules, services or procedures on the basis of a trained mivar network of rules with linear computational complexity. Mivar data processing includes logical inference, computational procedures and services. Mivar networks allow us to develop cause-effect dependencies (“If-then”) and create an automated, trained, logical reasoning system. Representatives of Russian association for artificial intelligence (RAAI) – for example, V. I. Gorodecki, doctor of technical science, professor at SPIIRAS and V. N. Vagin, doctor of technical science, professor at MPEI declared that the term is incorrect and suggested that the author should use standard terminology. History While working in the Russian Ministry of Defense, O. O. Varlamov started developing the theory of “rapid logical inference” in 1985. He was analyzing Petri nets and productions to construct algorithms. Generally, mivar-based theory represents an attempt to combine entity-relationship models and their problem instance – semantic networks and Petri networks. The abbreviation MIVAR was introduced as a technical term by O. O. Varlamov, Doctor of Technical Science, professor at Bauman MSTU in 1993 to designate a “semantic unit” in the process of mathematical modeling. The term has been established and used in all of his further works. The first experimental systems operating according to mivar-based principles were developed in 2000. Applied mivar systems were introduced in 2015. Mivar Mivar is the smallest structural element of discrete information space. Object-property-relation Object-Property-Relation (VSO) is a graph, the nodes of which are concepts and arcs are connections between concepts. Mivar space represents a set of axes, a set of elements, a set of points of space and a set of values of points. A = { a n } , n = 1 , … , N , {\displaystyle A=\{a_{n}\},n=1,\ldots ,N,} where: A {\displaystyle A} is a set of mivar space axis names; N {\displaystyle N} is a number of mivar space axes. Then: ∀ a n ∃ F n = { f n i n } , n = 1 , … , N , i n = 1 , … , I n , {\displaystyle \forall a_{n}\exists F_{n}=\{f_{{ni}_{n}}\},n=1,\ldots ,N,i_{n}=1,\ldots ,I_{n},} where: F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} is a set of axis a n {\displaystyle a_{n}} elements; i n {\displaystyle i_{n}} is a set F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} element identifier; I n = | F n | . {\displaystyle I_{n}=|F_{n}|.} F n {\displaystyle F_{n}} sets form multidimensional space: M = F 1 × F 2 × ⋯ × F n . {\displaystyle M=F_{1}\times F_{2}\times \cdots \times F_{n}.} m = ( i 1 , i 2 , … , i N ) , {\displaystyle m=(i_{1},i_{2},\ldots ,i_{N}),} where: m ∈ M {\displaystyle m\in M} ; m {\displaystyle m} is a point of multidimensional space; ( i 1 , i 2 , … , i N ) {\displaystyle (i_{1},i_{2},\ldots ,i_{N})} are coordinates of p
