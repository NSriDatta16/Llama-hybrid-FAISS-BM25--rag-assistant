Similarity measure between 2 semantic vectors with COLT

I'm using spreading-activation to get related concepts to a given one. If I want to calculate the similarity between 'London' and 'Paris', I get 2 vectors such as: vector for 'Paris': Paris : 1.0 City : 0.9 Capital : 0.7 France : 0.6 Europe : 0.5 ... vector for 'London': London : 1.0 City : 0.9 England : 0.9 United Kingdom : 0.8 Europe : 0.5 ... The issue is that the vectors can have different lengths. What similarity measure can be used in this situation? As far as I know the cosine measure can be applied only on vectors having the same size. I found these packages: SimMetrics: http://staffwww.dcs.shef.ac.uk/people/S.Chapman/simmetrics.html and COLT: http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/colt-docs/overview-summary.html How is it possible to use them in my scenario? Thanks! Mulone
