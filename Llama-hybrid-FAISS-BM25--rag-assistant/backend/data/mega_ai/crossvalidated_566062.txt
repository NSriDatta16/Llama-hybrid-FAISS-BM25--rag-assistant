Applying PCA to each group of features separately to use it in a predictive model

I have a large data-set with >100 features. Can I use PCA to reduce the dimension of each group of features instead of t applying PCA to the whole data-set? For example, if I have 10 demographic features and 10 work-place related features in my dataset, can I apply PCA to the demographic features, extract 2 PCs, do the same to the workplace features and do the final analysis on 4 extracted PCs? How does my described method compare with applying PCA to the entire dataset at once statistically? I only intend to use this approach for an slight increase in interpretability. Is it worth it? what are the pros and cons? The features in each feature groups are more or less correlated but not necessarily.
