I often use the width of confidence intervals as a quick-and-dirty way to determine the number of iterations needed. Let $p$ be the true coverage rate of the 95 % confidence interval when data from "Model 1" is fitted to "Model 2". If $X$ is the number of times that the confidence interval covers the true parameter value in $n$ iterations, then $X\sim {\rm Bin}(n,p)$. The estimator $\hat{p}=X/n$ has mean $p$ and standard deviation $\sqrt{p(1-p)/n}$. For large $n$, $\hat{p}$ is approximately normal and $\hat{p}\pm 1.96\sqrt{\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})/n}$ gives you an approximately 95 % confidence interval for $p$. Since you know (would gess) that $p\approx 0.95$, it follows that the width of this interval is approximately $2\cdot 1.96\sqrt{0.95\cdot 0.05/n}$. If you think that a confidence interval with width $0.1$ (say) is acceptable, you find the approximate number of iterations $n$ needed for this by solving the equation $$0.1=2\cdot 1.96\sqrt{0.95\cdot 0.05/n}.$$ In this way you can find a reasonable $n$ by choosing the accuracy that you are looking for.
