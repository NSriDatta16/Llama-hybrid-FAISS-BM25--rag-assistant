How to know when a generalized additive model need to be used for binary data?

When we have response variable that is of binary type and our interest is to know how probability is associated with covariates then we use logistic regression. But I specifically want to know about logistic generalized additive models (gam). Suppose, I have a data with binary response. How can I know whether here I need a linear or a gam logistic ? As for other data type, I can plot scatter plot of response vs covariate and if I see nonlinear pattern I can use gam. But for binary response, I can not have that choice. (Adding mgcv tag as anyone using it may have understanding on this issue).
