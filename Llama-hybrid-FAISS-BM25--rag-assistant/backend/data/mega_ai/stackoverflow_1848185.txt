Organising top level functions in a Javascript file

Occasionaly we will have a page that required some page specific Javascript functionality. I will create a javascript file called myPageName.js. The question I have is how do people organise their top level functions. I currently have 15+ top level functions defined like this function function1 (containerElement) { ...do function1; } function function2(slotActionButton) { ...do function2; } function function3(slotId) { ...do function3 } This seems wrong and I am just polluting the global namespace. I am using jQuery. What are people's thoughts? TIA Pat Long
