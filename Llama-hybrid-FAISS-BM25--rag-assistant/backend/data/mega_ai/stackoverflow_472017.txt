You would want to use __slots__ if you are going to instantiate a lot (hundreds, thousands) of objects of the same class. __slots__ only exists as a memory optimization tool. It's highly discouraged to use __slots__ for constraining attribute creation. Pickling objects with __slots__ won't work with the default (oldest) pickle protocol; it's necessary to specify a later version. Some other introspection features of python may also be adversely affected.
