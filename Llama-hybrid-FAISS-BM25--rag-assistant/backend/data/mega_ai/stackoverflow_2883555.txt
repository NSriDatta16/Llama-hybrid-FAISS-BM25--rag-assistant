With Google's #! mess, what effect would a redirect on the converted URL have?

So Google takes: http://www.mysite.com/mypage/#!pageState and converts it to: http://www.mysite.com/mypage/?_escaped_fragment_=pageState ...So... Would be it fair game to redirect that with a 301 status to something like: http://www.mysite.com/mypage/pagestate/ and then return an HTML snapshot? My thought is if you have an existing html structure, and you just want to add ajax as a progressive enhancement, this would be a fair way to do it, if Google just skipped over _escaped_fragment_ and indexed the redirected URL. Then your ajax links are configured by javascript, and underneath them are the regular links that go to your regular site structure. So then when a user comes in on a static url (ie http://www.mysite.com/mypage/pagestate/ ), the first link he clicks takes him to the ajax interface if he has javascript, then it's all ajax. On a side note does anyone know if Yahoo/MSN onboard with this 'spec' (loosely used)? I can't seem to find anything that says for sure.
