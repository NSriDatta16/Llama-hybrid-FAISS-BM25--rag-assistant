Your program does not need to do anything special apart from handling command-line arguments. When you drag-drop a file onto an application in Explorer it does nothing more than to pass the file name as argument to the program. Likewise for multiple files. If all you expect is a list of file names, then just iterate over all arguments, do whatever you want with them and be done. This will work for zero to almost arbitrarily many arguments.
