Copy CD contents from cd storage server to network share

I need to write a webapp (asp.net MVC) that copies the contents from a CD to a network share (eg. Z:\dir1). All servers are in the same domain. Process flow is as follows: - User inserts CD-ROM into cdserver1 (PrimeArray ProServer 3802 XT) - CD contents is copied to internal HDD automatically - User enters CD information in the webapp - This info will serve to construct the network share path (eg. Z:\dir1\userdata1\userdata2) - Check periodically if CD contents is copied to internal HDD of cdserver1 - Copy CD contents from internal HDD of cdserver1 to network share The parts I haven't figured out: - How to access the internal HDD of cdserver1 from asp.net (eg. //cdserver1/cdrom1/) - How to check periodically if cd contents is copied (ajax, jquery) - How to access the network share from asp.net - What about user rights (impersonation, NETWORK SERVICE account, ...) A whole bunch, I know :-) Any ideas or thoughts on this are more than welcome. Thanks in advance, Stijn
