How do quantile time series forecasts work?

My office leadership is interested adopting “quantile time series forecasting”, the idea is query the model to predict the 5th, 25th, 50th, 75th and 95th percentiles of an RV given features such as previous observations, covariates, etc. My questions are about feasibility: Are there x independent models, one for each quantile? Where does the training data come from? (Ex: only x units were sold on day, t, so there is not an observed distribution…)
