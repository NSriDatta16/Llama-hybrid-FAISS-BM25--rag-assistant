Your question has been downvoted with no explanation as to why, which is not very helpful in my opinion, as you don't get any hints on how to improve your question to get an appropriate answer. Anyway, the question as to which ICC to use depends on 3 things ( https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4913118/ ): The "Model” (e.g., 1-way random effects, 2-way random effects, or 2-way mixed effects); The "Type” (e.g., for decision-making, will you use the average of the measurements produced by the surgeon and yourself or just the measurement produced by the surgeon); The “Definition” of relationship considered to be important (i.e., consistency in measurements between the surgeon and yourself OR absolute agreement between the surgeon and yourself in terms of measurements). Please read the article and see if you can figure out what the answer is - then you can come back with a more pointed question here.
