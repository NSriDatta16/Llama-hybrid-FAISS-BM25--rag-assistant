GLSL check if fragment is on geometry

I am currently writing the positions of my geometry to the RGB channels of gl_FragColor and I would like to write 1.0 to the alpha channel if the fragment is part of geometry, and 0.0 if its empty. Is there a simple way to tell if a fragment is geometry or not? Maybe through gl_FragCoord.z ? thanks
