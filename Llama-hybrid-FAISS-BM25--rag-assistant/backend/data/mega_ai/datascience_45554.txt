ML algorithm with fixed number of inputs and variable number of outputs

I am trying to solve the following problem: Let's say I have a chess position: I encode each square as one-hot encoded vector of length 13 index 0 for empty square index 1 for white pawn index 2 for black pawn index 3 for white bishop index 4 for black bishop etc.. So, at the end I have a matrix ${M}$ with a shape 64x13, which I intend to use as an input of the model. I want to create a model able to map matrix ${M}$ to FEN representation of the position. Given the example above, FEN representation of the position is: 1b1N4/7k/4b3/8/8/8/3P4/3K4 The length of a FEN-string is not fixed. I failed to find a ML algorithm which accepts fixed number of inputs and produces variable number of outputs. What machine learning algorithm can I use in that case ? Is RNN appropriate for that task ? P.S. I do understand, that it is trivial to just write a function to map ${M}$ to FEN, but I do not want it, I want the model to learn it from data.
