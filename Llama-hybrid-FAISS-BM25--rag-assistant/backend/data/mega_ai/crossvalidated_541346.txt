Why neural network's output is not sensitive to input scale?

Recently, I read a paper about RNN and CNN. It said that due to the non-linear nature of the Convolutional and Recurrent components, one major drawback of the neural network model is that the scale of outputs is not sensitive to the scale of inputs. I am quite confused why it happens. Anyone can help me? Thanks a lot. Paper source: https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07015
