Hourly sales predictions

I have some time series (you can see its vizualization on picture above. It is hourly sales of some product. My goal is to make hourly prediction of its demand.I am confused, because at almost all points my time series is zero. Could someone suggest which algorithm and loss function should i choose to be able to predict something except zero? There is no any external regressors. Thank you a lot.
