PDO is a bit overkill because as a SaaS company we control the infrastructure and we'll be using MySQL for the forseable future, so we don't need the database abstraction. That is exactly what you should be looking out for... the NON-forseable future. What you really need to define is how flexible is your app... really... and does it need to be more flexible. If it is designed correctly, it should not be that difficult to migrate / or costly. If it truly is that difficult / costly, maybe now is the right time to make the change and do some re-factoring while you are at it. This way, when the system needs to be moved to a new faster DB platform, or updated, or improved; the change becomes more of a "drag-n-drop" replacement instead of a complete rewrite.
