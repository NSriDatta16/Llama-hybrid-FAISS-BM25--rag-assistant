Kendall correlation is significant but cross correlation is not significant

I have time series data and I am confused about the output of correlation and cross correlation. This is my data: y x1 Min. : 0 Min. :23.47 1st Qu.: 18 1st Qu.:27.28 Median : 751 Median :28.00 Mean : 1601 Mean :27.99 3rd Qu.: 1744 3rd Qu.:28.78 Max. :11692 Max. :30.78 I performed Kendall correlation analysis because the data is not linear. The output is as follows: corr.test(x1,y) Call:corr.test(x = x1, y = y, method = "kendall") Correlation matrix [1] -0.22 Sample Size [1] 849 These are the unadjusted probability values. The probability values adjusted for multiple tests are in the p.adj object. [1] 0 To see confidence intervals of the correlations, print with the short=FALSE option From what I understood about the output, there is significant correlation between x1 and y. Then, I also performed cross correlation and the output is as follows: print(ccf(x1, y, lag.max = 14)) Autocorrelations of series ‘X’, by lag -14 -13 -12 -11 -10 -9 -8 -7 -6 -5 -0.052 -0.050 -0.049 -0.059 -0.067 -0.061 -0.043 -0.047 -0.038 -0.031 -4 -3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 4 5 -0.029 -0.043 -0.043 -0.036 -0.036 -0.035 -0.036 -0.041 -0.045 -0.046 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 -0.034 -0.031 -0.025 -0.033 -0.038 -0.043 -0.038 -0.031 -0.030 From what I understood about the output, there is no significant correlation between x1 and y at lags and leads of 0-14 days. My questions are: I thought cross-correlation at lag 0 should be significant because the correlation between x1 and y is significant. But in fact cross-correlation at lag 0 is not significant. I thought it should be the same because correlation analysis is testing the lag 0 data. Please correct me if I am wrong. Another thing I suspect about the problem mentioned above is the "method" of correlation. I used Kendall correlation. But cross-correlation is using Pearson's correlation. That's why there is a difference in the significance. Does this make sense? Am I using Kendall correlation correctly in my case?
