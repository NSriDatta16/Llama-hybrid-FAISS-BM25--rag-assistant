Relation between Optimization of Hyperparameters and Marginalization (Bayesian Optimization)

I am reading slides on Tutorial for Bayesian Optimization [42/45] and came across this " Covariance hyperparameters are often optimized rather than marginalized, typically in the name of convenience and efficiency " I am trying to understand the significance of marginalization over optimization of covariance hyperparameters. Optimization is entirely different concept then marginalization, so what is the link between the two?
