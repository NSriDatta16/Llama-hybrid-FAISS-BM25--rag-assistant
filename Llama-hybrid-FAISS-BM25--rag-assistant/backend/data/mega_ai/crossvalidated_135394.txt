Let's start with a standard regression setup where you are trying to estimate the effect in a fixed-effect model when you only have a single country that received "treatment" (entering the Euro). This strategy assumes that, conditional on observables, the average of the other countries serves as a reasonable counterfactual to what your treated country would have done if it hadn't received the treatment (ie stayed out of the euro). There is likely bias in this estimate as the treatment wasn't random, but probably related to factors that also affect the outcome you care about. SCM says that instead of using all the other units, let's find a weighted average of them that looks really similar during the pre-treatment. SCM defines "similar" as having a very similar path of your outcome variable pre-treatment while having similar pre-treatment values for covariates that appear to be related to your outcome variable. The "treatment effect" is then the difference between the actual path of your treated unit and the path of the weighted average post-treatment (the weights are fixed from the pre-treatment optimization). Inference is done by permutation tests (if we invented "fake" treatments and estimated SCM on the other units that weren't actually treated, what would be typical "effects" that we would see). SCM will consistently estimate effects in some settings where the FE model would yield biased estimates (Abadie et al. show it for a general factor model, which allows for non-parallel trends between treatment and non-treated units). The main points SCM needs are: Lots of pre-treatment periods. The bias in the SCM estimate goes to zero as the number of pre-treatment period grows large in relation to the "error" in the model. Since usually SCM is used on aggregate data, the "error" is not so much sampling error but model mis-specification (inability of the synthetic control be a good counterfactual). This is sort of similar to root-N-consistency with other estimators. The unobserved factors that you worry about should have had some effect on the outcome during the pre-treatment period. This is an assumption that one needs to argue holds in your context. The synthetic control needs to match well the treated unit during the pre-treatment period. You can gauge this by looking at the fake permutations. Generally you need your treated unit to be in the convex hull of observations during pre-treatment.
