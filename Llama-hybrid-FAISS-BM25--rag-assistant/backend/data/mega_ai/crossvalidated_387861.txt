Why with glmnet I obtain different coefficients for the different categories I want to classify?

I am performing a multinomial logistic regression using glmnet. I have 7 classes of trees to predict and different predictors. What I do not understand is why when I plot the coefficents vs. log lambda in the graph it appears coefficients: Spruce fir response (where Spruce fir is one of the trees). When you ask for coefficients it gives back 7 different set of coefficients once for every class. What does it means? I hope the question is clear, I have tried to post directly an image, but apparently it posts the link. Here it is https://i.stack.imgur.com/3GAyN.png
