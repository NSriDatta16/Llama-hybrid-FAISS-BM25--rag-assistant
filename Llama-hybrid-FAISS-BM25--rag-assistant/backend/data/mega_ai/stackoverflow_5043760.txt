Magento: Prevent products without images from showing

We've just done a mass import. We have allot of products showing up without images and we need to prevent that. There not supposed to have images or show but we can't set them to "Not visible anywhere" in the CSV. So if images = 0 don't show anywhere. Any help is greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance.
