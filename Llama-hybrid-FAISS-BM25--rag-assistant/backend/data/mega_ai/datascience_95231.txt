Yes, it makes sense, and that is one of the advantages UMAP has over t-SNE. While t-SNE has no ability to operate on out-of-sample data, UMAP creates a map to the lower-dimension space that can be applied to out-of-sample data just like the PCA matrix would be applied to out-of-sample data. (Certainly we could run everything through the t-SNE algorithm and then do the data split, but that is majorly cheating. What happens when we get new observations that didnâ€™t exist when we built the model, like how Siri is supposed to be able to understand speech by people who have yet to be born when they can talk in a few years?)
