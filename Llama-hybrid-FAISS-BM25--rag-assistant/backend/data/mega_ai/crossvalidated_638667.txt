What is fundamentally different between a logistic regression and a Logit Discrete Choice model?

I'm trying to understand the difference between the two. I know there is a background random utility theory in discrete choice modeling, but I can't pinpoint, in what I've read, the difference between the logit choice model (sometimes called a conditional logit choice model, to differentiate from a nested choice model). Maybe it is something related to the likelihood equation, but I'd love some more technical clarification.
