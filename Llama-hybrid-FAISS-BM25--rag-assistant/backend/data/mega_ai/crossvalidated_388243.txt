This p-value represents the probability that ALL 54 categories have the same average survival rate vs there is at least one category that has a different one. As a general rule, you are right, the more categories you have the more likely to have one with at least different average survival rate even by pure chance! This is logical. Is there a way that you could maybe merge some of these categories together? That could make the test a bit more reliable
