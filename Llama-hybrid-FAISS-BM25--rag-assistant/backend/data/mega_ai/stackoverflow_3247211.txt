You should use one of the existing ORM(-like) frameworks out there, such as: LINQ-to-Entities (preferred, you have support for it out of the box in VS.NET) LINQ-to-SQL (not so preferred, support from MS is waning and only supports SQL Server) NHibernate (you will need third party tools for design support in VS.NET) Most (if not all) of these will allow you to specify your data source and simply drag tables to design surfaces at which point your Data Transfer Objects will be created for you, as well as the mechanisms to query and persist them back to the data store.
