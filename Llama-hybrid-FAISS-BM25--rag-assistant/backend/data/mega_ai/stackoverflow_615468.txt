Managing your code base as Stephen said is going to be a big challenge if you create equivlant methods. Your much better off extrapolating the methods into a new library, that both the web application and web service will use. Your web apps shouldn't have any data access code in them. With a web service you need to consider your clients. Who is going to access your data and from where. If for example its from a .net windows client on the same network or machine a TCP binding might be best. Or if you need to support older .net framework clients or even java clients you need to be careful about what technology you use. You will also want to choose between WCF or ASMX. Which the previous paragraph shouuld help answer.
