How can I capture which direction is being panned using UIPanGestureRecognizer?

Ok so I have been looking around at just about every option under the sun for capturing multi-touch gestures, and I have finally come full circle and am back at the UIPanGestureRecognizer. The functionality I want is really quite simple. I have setup a two finger pan gesture, and I want to be able to shuffle through some images depending on how many pixels I move. I have all that worked out okay, but I want to be able to capture if the pan gesture is REVERSED. Is there a built in way that I'm just not seeing to detect going back on a gesture? Would I have to store my original starting point, then track the end point, then see where they move after that and se if its less than the initial ending point and then reverse accordingly? I can see that working, but I'm hoping there is a more elegant solution!! Thanks EDIT: Here is the method that the recognizer is set to fire. Its a bit of a hack, but it works: -(void) throttle:(UIGestureRecognizer *) recognize{ throttleCounter ++; if(throttleCounter == 6){ throttleCounter = 0; [self nextPic:nil]; } UIPanGestureRecognizer *panGesture = (UIPanGestureRecognizer *) recognize; UIView *view = recognize.view; if(panGesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan){ CGPoint translation = [panGesture translationInView:view.superview]; NSLog(@"X: %f, Y:%f", translation.x, translation.y); }else if(panGesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded){ CGPoint translation = [panGesture translationInView:view.superview]; NSLog(@"X: %f, Y:%f", translation.x, translation.y); } } I've just gotten to the point where I am going to start trying to track the differences between values...to try and tell which way they are panning
