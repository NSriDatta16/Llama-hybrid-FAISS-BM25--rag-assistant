The simplest way would be to run predictions for all cities and collect those with the highest predicted probability for fraud. However, random forests are strong at fitting nonlinearities and interactions, so if you use an RF, I assume you expect some such effect. Thus, the impact of city may depend on the value of age . At lower ages, different cities may be hotbeds of fraud than at higher ages. So I'd recommend that you also vary the setting for age in your predictions. In such situations, I like to use the three quartiles of age observed in the training data. I am not aware of any libraries doing this, but the scripting should be straightforward. You may want to look at variable-importance in the context of random forests, which is a related but different concept.
