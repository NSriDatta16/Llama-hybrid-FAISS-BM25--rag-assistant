Qt QFileDialog QSizePolicy of sidebar

With a QFileDialog I'm trying to change the size of the side bar in a QFileDialog. I want it to have a larger width. I was looking at dir(QtGui.QFileDialog) which shows a plethora of functions/methods and dir(QtGui.QSizePolicy) which seemed like the right choice. I've not been able to manipulate the size of the side bar though. print 'sizePolicy: ', self.sizePolicy() urls = [ QtCore.QUrl("file:"), QtCore.QUrl("file:///usr/home/")] self.fileBrowser.setSidebarUrls( urls ) Returns // sizePolicy: It seems to average out the length of the names to create the width of the side bar. Anyone know a way around this? Size policy returns back a QSizePolicy object, but I don't know how to manipulate the side bar's size. Thanks!
