Unless I see an absolute need for it, then absolutely not. In my experience, most users I have come across dislike the Ribbon control because they find it hard to navigate, and they wish they had the old menu/toolbar style back. Sure it looks nice, and can be organized nicely, but in the long run I don't think its a necessity for a lot of applications. Visual navigation isn't always better.
