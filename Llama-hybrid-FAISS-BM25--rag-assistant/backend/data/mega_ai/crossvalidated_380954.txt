LSTM : multi-step multidimensional multivariate multi-site timeseries forecasting

I'm working on a project in which i'm trying to do a pollution forecasting. I googled around and found that LSTM is a good candidate for this task, however, I'm still struggling at how to adapt it to my particular problem. My problem is as follows : Features : 109 measurement stations (in the same region) : description (ex : typology, coordinates ...) 5 years of hourly data for each measurement stations : weather data (ex : temperature, pressure, humidity, precipitation ...) preliminary prediction of the target variables Target : Hourly measurements of 4 pollutants (O3, NO2, PM10, PM25) for each site Goal : Predict the daily value of each pollutant for each measurement site for the next 3 days My Questions : Q1. Multi-Site : Is it a good idea to build a different model for each measurement site ? thus, ending up with 109 models and not taking advantage of the fact that close stations tend to have close measurements. Q2. Multivariate : Should I build a NN for each pollutant ? or just one NN that outputs a vector of 4 ? Q3. Multi-step : How do you adapt the LSTM to output the prediction the next 3 days ? Q4. : Do I need to precise a time window ? I've read that LSTMs learn the timewindow by itself Q5. : Is it better to transform the data by calculating the daily average then make a daily prediction OR make the hourly prediction then calculate the average ?
