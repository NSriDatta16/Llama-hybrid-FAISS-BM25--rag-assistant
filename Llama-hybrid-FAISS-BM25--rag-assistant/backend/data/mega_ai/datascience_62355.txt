Bib number recognition using Keras

I want to implement a racing bib number recognition application (for study purposes) using Keras API. I can manage training a CNN model to detect different numbers but how to localize only specific regions from the image and make sure that this region is a bib number? Steps for this task: Digit localizer - ? Digit recognizer - trained CNN model using MNIST dataset. What solution would be the best choice for localizing only specific regions? Should I use Faster R-CNN, YOLO Framework, Semantic Segmentation or smth else?
