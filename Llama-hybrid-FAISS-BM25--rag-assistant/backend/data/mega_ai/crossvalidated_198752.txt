I believe your problem is a textbook case of longitudinal data analysis for which there is an extensive statistical methodology developed. In particular, analysis of response profiles is an approach that I would employ in this case. To motivate this, I will provide some background from Applied Longitudinal Analysis by G.M. Fitzmaurice: 1.2 Longitudinal and clustered data The defining feature of longitudinal studies is that measurements of the same individuals are taken repeatedly through time, thereby allowing the direct study of change over the time. The primary goal of a longitudinal study is to characterize the change in response over the time and the factors that influence change. (...) A distinctive feature of longitudinal data is that they are clustered . In longitudinal studies the clusters are composed of the repeated measurements obtained from a single individual at different occasions. Observations within a cluster will typically exhibit positive correlation, and this correlation must be accounted for in the analysis. Longitudinal data also have a temporal order; the first measurement within a cluster necessarily comes before the second measurement, and so on. The ordering of the repeated measures has important implications for analysis. and regarding analyzing response profiles choice: Methods for analyzing response profiles are appealing when there is a single categorical covariate (perhaps denoting different treatment or exposure groups) and when no specific a priori pattern for the differences in the response profiles between groups can be specified. When repeated measures are obtained at the same sequence of occasions, the data can be summarized by the estimated mean response at each occasion, stratified by levels of a group factor. At any given level of the group factor, the sequence of means over time is referred to as the mean response profile . The nlme R library contains a glm function to evaluate such model, giving you a longitudinal "equivalent" of Anova: library(nlme) # Model assuming the same variance for each time point gls.fit Unfortunately, in this case model estimation does not coverage (even though I changed control parameters for more convenient). I am afraid there is just too few cases in your data set to estimate parameters.
