AS2 Play Movie Clip OnMouseUp not working

My plan is to initiate part of a movie clip on mouseDown and complete it only when mouseUp has been initiated. This is for a drag and drop onto a UI element that appears only when mouse down is initiated. I have managed to do this with the following AS2 on the first frame on the timeline: stop(); slide_mc.stop(); button_btn.onPress = function() { slide_mc.gotoAndPlay(1); }; button_btn.onRelease = function() { slide_mc.gotoAndPlay(8); }; This works well for the first time, but after that it does not recognise my mouseDown, only my mouseUp. Ive have murdered google in trying to search for a similar problem! I would be so grateful if someone could help!
