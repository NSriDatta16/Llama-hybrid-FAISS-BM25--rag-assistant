You might try Herb Sutter's book Exceptional C++ ; it contains items organized like questions and is, in my opinion, very clear and very well written. I don't know if it will be directly useful for the interview, but it makes you think about aspects of the language you had never considered before. It's been a long time since I last visited it, but you might also try this site with interview questions: geekinterview.com - take a look in particular at the C++ section . All the best for your interview :)
