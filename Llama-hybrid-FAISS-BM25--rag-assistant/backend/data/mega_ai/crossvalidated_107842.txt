But be careful if the values you mentioned are your output values. If you use for example the caret package, which describes itself as "a set of functions that attempt to streamline the process for creating predictive models." So it is basically a layer on top of many different machine learning packages in R. If you use the train method and choose for example a SVM algorithm and your output values are integer values, the algorithm will handle it as a regression problem automatically and not as a classification problem. This will probably decrease the performance of the algorithm including accuracy and sensitivity. So if these values are your output or y values and your dataset belongs to a classification problem, transform the values to factors. If the values are "just" x or feature values I totally agree with Andy and you can leave them as integers. Regards
