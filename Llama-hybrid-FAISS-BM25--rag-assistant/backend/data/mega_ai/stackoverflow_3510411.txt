"It depends". The question you really need to answer first is "What do I want to use the collection for?" If you often insert / remove items on one of the ends (beginning, end) a Queue will be better than a ArrayList . However in many cases you create a Collection in order to just read from it. In this case a ArrayList is far more efficient: As it is implemented as an array, you can iterate over it quite efficient (same applies for a LinkedList ). However a LinkedList uses references to link single items together. So if you do not need random removals of items (in the middle), a ArrayList is better: An ArrayList will use less memory as the items don't need the storage for the reference to the next/prev item. To sum it up: ArrayList = good if you insert once and read often (random access or sequential) LinkedList = good if you insert/remove often at random positions and read only sequential ArrayDeque (java6 only) = good if you insert/remove at start/end and read random or sequential
