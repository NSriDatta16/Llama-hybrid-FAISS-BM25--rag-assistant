The International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI) is a conference in the field of artificial intelligence. The conference series has been organized by the nonprofit IJCAI Organization since 1969. It was held biennially in odd-numbered years from 1969 to 2015 and annually starting from 2016. More recently, IJCAI was held jointly every four years with ECAI since 2018 and PRICAI since 2020 to promote collaboration of AI researchers and practitioners. IJCAI covers a broad range of research areas in the field of AI. It is a large and highly selective conference, with only about 20% or less of the submitted papers accepted after peer review in the 5 years leading up to 2022. Awards Three research awards are given at each IJCAI conference. The IJCAI Computers and Thought Award is given to outstanding young scientists under the age of 35 in AI. The Donald E. Walker Distinguished Service Award is given to honor senior scientists for their contributions and service to the field of AI. The IJCAI Award for Research Excellence is given to scientists who have carried out a research program of consistently high quality throughout an entire career yielding several substantial results. Additionally, IJCAI presents one or more Best Paper Awards at each conference to recognize the highest quality papers.
