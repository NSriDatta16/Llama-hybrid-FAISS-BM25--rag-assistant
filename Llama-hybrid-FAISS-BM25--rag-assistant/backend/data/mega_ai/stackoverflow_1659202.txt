Loading HTML content containing inline script via jQuery

The Background I run an ASP.NET site using Graffiti CMS for a local charitable/service organization. The leaders of the organization want to start integrating a third-party back-end management system that exposes content as full HTML pages. One of the pages, the officer list, uses inline script to load pictures or placeholders (depending on whether or not there is a picture for the given officer). I've created a server-side proxy that enables loading the content from these pages using jQuery's .load() AJAX function. I can display this content fine using an iframe, but that feels really kludgy, and if the size of the content changes, I may need to alter the size of the iframe to ensure it all displays (blech!). The Problem If I create a in a Graffiti post, and use $("#divid").load(url) to load the content, the HTML content loads fine, but the inline script is stripped out, so neither the officer images nor the placeholders are displayed. The Question Understanding that the reason for the problem is that jQuery is almost certainly trying to protect against potentially bad stuff by removing the inline script before I load it into my DOM, is there a way using jQuery to grab this HTML and load it into my DOM that will preserve the script, but not open major security holes? I do trust the system from which I'm loading the content, if that makes a difference. Suggestions? I'm looking to keep this as simple as possible...anything too complex, and I'm just as well off to stick with the iframe. Thanks in advance! @devhammer
