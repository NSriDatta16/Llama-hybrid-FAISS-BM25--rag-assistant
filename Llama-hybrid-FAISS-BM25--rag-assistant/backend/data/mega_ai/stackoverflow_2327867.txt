There is only delete operator, free exist only as function. Under C++, you are encouraged to use new / delete over malloc() / free() . There is an internal "magic" in delete operator. When an array is created with new[] , the size of array is stored in the metadata at the memory block. delete[] makes use of that information. All this is of course compiler-, OS-, optimizer- and implementation-dependent.
