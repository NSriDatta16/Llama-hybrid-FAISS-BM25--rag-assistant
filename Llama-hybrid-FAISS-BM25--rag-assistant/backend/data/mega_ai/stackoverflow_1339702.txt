JavaFx Offline ability?

Recently we are looking for the possibility to use JavaFX as an offline RIA client. The idea is that user can use the netbook to work on the app with or without internet connection. With internet connection, user can interact with server through web services. Without internet connection, data and transaction will be stored on client and sync once connection is up again. Someone point me to JavaFX. After reading some spec and tutorials, I found that most of them is focusing on UI-building. So I don't quite actually know how it can handle offline storage and synchronization? Any one know more about this? Actually the requirement makes me think of Google Gears rather than JavaFX.
