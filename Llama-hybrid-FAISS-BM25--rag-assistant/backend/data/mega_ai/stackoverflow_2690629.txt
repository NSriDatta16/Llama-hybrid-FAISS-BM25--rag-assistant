C# properties issue

The other day I bumped into a little problem regarding C#'s properties. Let's say I have this setup: public class Point { public float X; public float Y; } public class Control { protected Point m_Position = new Point(); public Point Position { get { return m_Position; } set { m_Position = value; } // reorganize internal structure.. reorganize(); } protected reorganize() { // do some stuff } } This is all fine, but when it comes to usage, I could write something like: Control myControl = new Control(); myControl.Position.X = 1.0f; The thing is, my Control class won't recognize that the Position has been changed because set() hasn't been called. Is there a way to make Control aware of any Position changes?
