How to Model a time series with another using Machine Learning

I have two time-series and I need to make a model that takes the input of one of the time series to estimate the value of the other time series. I've tried a lot of different specification of ARIMA and haven't found one that works for me yet. Also, I will have to do this multiple times with different data sets and I don't want to have take time to manually specify a model each time I do this. Below is a graph of some data that I have. I need to take the green line and model the blue line. You can ignore the grey line. I have little experience with machine learning, but from what I understand, some techniques can help specify models. Any thoughts about techniques to solve this problem. FYI I have access to SAS enterprise miner.
