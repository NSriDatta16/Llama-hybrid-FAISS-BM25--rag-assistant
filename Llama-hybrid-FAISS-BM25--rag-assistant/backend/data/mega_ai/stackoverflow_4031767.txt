RAILS: paperclip and creation date based directory structure

does anyone know how I can configure my rails model, which is using paperclip for data storage, to use creation date based directories like for example in fleximage ?? At present I'm using: has_attached_file :bookblock, :path => "#{CONF['storage_path']}bookblock/:id_partition/:style.:content_type_ehas_attached_filextension" but what I need is something like this has_attached_file :bookblock, :path => "# {CONF['storage_path']}bookblock/:created_at_year/:created_at_month/:created_at_day/:c:id_partition/:style.:content_type_ehas_attached_filextension" a simple :created_at in the directory path would also help {CONF['storage_path']}/:created_at/bookblock/:id_partition/:style.:content_type_ehas_attached_filextension" Thanx in advance, Alex
