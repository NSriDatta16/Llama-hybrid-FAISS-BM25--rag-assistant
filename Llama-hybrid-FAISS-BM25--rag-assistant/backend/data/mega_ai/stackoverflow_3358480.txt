How can I specify a large number of files for an NCOVER merge operation?

I have a large acceptance test suite that runs the source application many thousands of times, creating an NCOVER report for each run. After each test, it merges the generated code coverage report into a large "master" coverage report for the whole application. My worry here is that I'm running into a Shlemiel the Painter problem, as the merge operation is parsing the large coverage file for every test. I can pass more than one coverage file to NCover.Reporting.Exe , which actually does the merge, but when I try to pass them all at once I'm running into operating system limits on command line length. Does NCover.Reporting provide some sort of input coverage report listing that I can save to a file, and have it merge all the reports in one go?
