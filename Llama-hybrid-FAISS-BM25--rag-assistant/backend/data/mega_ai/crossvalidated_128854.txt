Generalized Linear Models vs Timseries models for forecasting

What are the differences in using Generalized Linear Models, such as Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD) and Ridge regression, versus Time series models like Box-Jenkins (ARIMA) or Exponential smoothing for forecasting? Are there any rules of thumb on when to use GLM and when to use Time Series?
