Linear regression + simple integration is probably sufficient for your needs. I leave sorting out exact implementation for your DB up to you, but that follow that link to the "Estimation Methods" section, and probably use Ordinary Least Squares . Alternatively, you can always slurp your data into something like R where the details are already implemented. EDIT: For more detail: you're trying to model INCOME = BASE + SCALING*T where we are assuming that a linear model is "good" (it's probably not great, but it's probably good enough on a short time scale). For two value linear regression , you're pretty much just taking averages; follow that link to "Fitting the Regression Line" and you'll see which things you need to average ( y = INCOME and x = T ). There are some tricks you can play to simplify the calculation for the computer if you can enforce some other conditions (e.g., having equally spaced time periods + no missing data), but you'll need to math a bit more yourself first if you want to do that (and you'll be less flexible in the face of changing db assumptions).
