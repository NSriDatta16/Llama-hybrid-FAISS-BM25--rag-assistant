There isnt a good way - you need a java object that is GWT serializable. The only real solution that I can see is to write a plugin (or add to the GWT plugin) a way to autogenerate the data transfer object, perhaps using annotations in a grails domain object. A similar method is being used to autogenerate the RPCAsync interfaces in the gwt plugin - see GwtGrailsPlugin.groovy in the gwt plugin directory, line 133 or so is the start. You could hook into that (or just modify that file directly, probably easier) and insert some code to generate the data transfer files. An added benefit could be that you could granularize the data transfer object so that private data (like passwords!) dont get transferred.
