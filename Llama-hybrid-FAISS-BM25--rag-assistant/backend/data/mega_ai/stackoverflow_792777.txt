As already stated it is not required. The reason that a trailing comma is supported is that it (assuming the items are laid out one to a line) it allows you to conveniently rearrange the order of items in an enumeration using cut/paste or drag/drop, and it also allows you to comment out the last item without producing a syntax error. Omitting the trailing comma is legal but loses these code maintenance advantages. I'd forgotten but Nick is quite right. I too have exploited the trailing comma with compiler directives. Without it, the conditional code would have been a lot messier and harder to read.
