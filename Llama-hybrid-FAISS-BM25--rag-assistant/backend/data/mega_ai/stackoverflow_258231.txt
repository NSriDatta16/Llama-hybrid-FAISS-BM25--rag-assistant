Creating a NHibernate object and initializing a Set

I have a Table called Product and I have the Table StorageHistory . Now, Product contains a reference to StorageHistory in it's mappings And it works, when I retrieve an object from the ORM I get an empty ISet. What gives me a headache is how to construct the object in the first place. When I do the following: var product = new Product(); session.Save(product); the product.StorageHistories property is NULL and I get a NullReferenceException. So, how do I add items to that collection, or should I go the way to add the StorageHistory items themselves to the DB?
