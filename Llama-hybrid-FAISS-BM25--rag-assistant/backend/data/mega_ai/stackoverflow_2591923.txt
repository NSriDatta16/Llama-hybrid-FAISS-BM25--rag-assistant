I would second Zachary on not being able to really prevent people posting things for any particular reason. The best thing is to expect there to be some bad or dodgy reviews, some spam, some idiots trying to spoil it for the rest of us, but also that the majority of people are well-intentioned. Stack Overflow was built on these ideas. So: Keep a dictionary of IP addresses, and give each a rating. Limit the frequency with which a given IP can post multiple reviews, and if they try to flood the system ban the IP for an amount of time. This way, the worse they behave, the harder it is for them. Let users of the site rate each review - Amazon does this with 'was this review helpful?'. Alongside 2., keep a score for each user (publicly or privately) like the SO reputation score, and use it to limit the actions of new or badly behaved users. If your reputation is too low, you cannot rate others' reviews. Slashdot lets you choose whether to filter out low-scored responses. Let the business put forward their side of things in a special review that sits at the top of the list (and mark it as such), so that they have somewhere to say all the fluff they have to say. Take note of the principle of punishing and rewarding the behaviour, not the person. That way, people who mildly misbehave can be corrected and turned around into productive contributors, since they're often after attention anyway. Bury low-scored responses at the bottom of the list, just like SO orders answers. That way attention-seeking impulses drive users to produce good quality reviews, not post FAKE!!!!11!! Read Jeff Atwood's Coding Horror blog; and listen to the SO podcast entries in order. There is a mine of experience there.
