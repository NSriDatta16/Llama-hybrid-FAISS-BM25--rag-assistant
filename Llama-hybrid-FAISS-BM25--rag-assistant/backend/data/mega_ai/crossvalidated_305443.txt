Which one is the best LASSO model for my data (using glmnet package)?

I'm trying to fit a Lasso Regression Model to a dataset but I have been stucked in some issues. I understand that I have to fit the best model using the proper lambda. But every time I run the cv.glmnet function it gives different values for lambda.1se and lambda.min and also different coefficients, i.e, different models with differents MSE and R-Squared values. Which one should I use? Does it make sense to replicate this function 1000 times and use the average lambda or the average coefficients value?
