One elegant way to solve this is by using numpy.select . This function takes a list of conditions and a list of choices and then pick the choice where the first condition is true. An advantage is that since the conditions are checked in order, only one side of the condition for the day value needs to be checked. Assuming the input dataframe is called df : import numpy as np import pandas as pd conditions = [ df['Days'] Result: ID Ordered Days New_Columns 0 1 101565 131 4-6 Months 1 2 202546 122 4-6 Months 2 3 459863 78 0-3 Months 3 4 328453 327 10+ Months 4 5 458975 -27 Close case
