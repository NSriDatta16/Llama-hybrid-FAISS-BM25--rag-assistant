Struct seems right for this application. Bear in mind that the "need to hold onto those valueS" implies their storage on the heap somewhere, probably an array field of a class instance. One thing to watch out for is that this results in a allocation on the large object heap. Its not that clear how, if at all, this heap defrags itself, however for very long lived objects that perhaps isn't an issue. Using class for millions of these data types would likely be expensive in the shear volume of dereferencing that will likely be taking place for operations on this type.
