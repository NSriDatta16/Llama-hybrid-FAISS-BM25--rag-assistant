I had the same problem like atcrawford, but thanx to Giovanni i managed to resolve it. First, when i began this tutorial i populated the phone number from the database with some random numbers. Now when i tried to edit my existing data i received this "rule violations" because the phone number hadn't the correct form. So look in Models folder at Dinner.cs at: public IEnumerable GetRuleViolations() {//if (!PhoneValidator.IsValidNumber(ContactPhone, Country)) // yield return new RuleViolation("Phone# does not match country", "ContactPhone"); } You can see that i commented that line, so the IsValidNumber method on PhoneValidator class is never called. Or, you can enter the data for the phone number according to the regular expressions from PhoneValidator
