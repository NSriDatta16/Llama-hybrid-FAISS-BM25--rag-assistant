Good points about mathematics and integration of artists and other specialists in the team. In addition, I'd say that: Game development, to some extend, will be more hardware dependent. In many cases, games are built simultaneously to several platforms and consoles (not to mention cellphones), with different architectures. That is abstracted up to a certain extent, but developers cannot completely avoid this fact. Game development is often more performance sensitive, or at least the performance requirements are different. You're dealing with real-time experience, so a lot of time is spent optimizing those pesky fps. In many cases, game development does not care as much about reuse and maintainability. The game engine will probably be reused, but the application code base will probably not live to see v2.0. In the last stretch of a project, there is a lot of quick and dirty debugging going on. If it looks fine to the end user, there's no added value in making an elegant fix two days before the release.
