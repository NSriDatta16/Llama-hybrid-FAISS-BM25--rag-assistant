Subversion: Configure svn access through http protocol

I got a ubuntu server edition with subversion, apache2, openssh and need repositories for svn connection with/without any protocol (ssh, file:, http, https, etc). I configured a repository directory svnadmin create /path/to/repos/project Made an import svn import /path/to/import/directory svn+ssh://user@ipaddress/path/to/repos/projectFolder Configured the apache2 and restarted the server /etc/subversion/mod-avaliable/dva_svn.conf DAV svn SVNParentPath /home/svn AuthType Basic AuthName ”Your repository name” AuthUserFile /etc/subversion/passwd Require valid-user Already gave permition to the www-data sudo chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/repos However when trying to access the repository through browser I got 403 Forbidden access. How should I proceed? Thanks for the attention
