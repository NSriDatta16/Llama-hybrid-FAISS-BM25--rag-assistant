If it is possible that a person may close their browser & the steps should not be repeated, I'd consider using your DB or a cookie for the storage of steps and their corrosponding status. It's the 'in progress' and 'waiting' that are the major cruxes of your problem as you won't be able to determine their state without some type of polling. I've done similar things before and used effectively the same method you described.
