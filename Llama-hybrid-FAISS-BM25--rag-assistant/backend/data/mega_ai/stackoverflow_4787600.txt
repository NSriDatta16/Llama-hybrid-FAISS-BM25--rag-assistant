Such conversion is not possible in pure XSLT/XPath (ver. 1.0 and 2.0). The best recommendation : Never to represent a XML document or fragment as string -- this destroys the markup and flattens it to a one-dimensional text. In case it is not possible to change the value of the variable to contain real markup, then one needs to pass this variable to an extension function, that would parse the string and return back a real XML document. Another possible solution is to use the disable-output-escaping attribute , but this is not guaranteed to work on all XSLT processors and grossly violates the XSLT architectural model. I recommend to always avoid using DOE .
