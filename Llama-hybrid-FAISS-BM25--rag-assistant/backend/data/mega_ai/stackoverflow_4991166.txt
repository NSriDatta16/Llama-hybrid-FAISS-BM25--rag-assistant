Force drop as shortcut object when dragging from .NET app to Windows Explorer

I'm writing a .NET application that presents a Tree/List view of objects in the same way as Windows Explorer. These are text-based items that the user can regard as files, and I want the user to be able to create shortcuts to them similar to the way they would create a shortcut to any file. Except in this instance the shortcut would be to my application with a specific command line rather than to a file object. So I need to support drag and drop to Internet Explorer such that the drag icon looks like the Alt-drag (create shortcut) icon, and the drop operation creates a shortcut to my application with a custom command line. My question: what information do I need to supply to Windows at the start of the drag operation, so that Windows Explorer displays the correct icon and always creates a shortcut in the drop event?
