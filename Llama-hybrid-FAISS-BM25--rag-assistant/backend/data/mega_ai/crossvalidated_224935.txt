John Kruschke in Doing Bayesian Data Analysis recommends that for parameters of interest, MCMC chains should be run until their effective sample size is at least 10,000. Although no simulations are presented, I believe his rationale is that ESS > 10,000 ensures numerically stable estimates. However, I have seen that Andrew Gelman and other Stan developers recommend less (e.g. 2000 - 3000 is fine; no exact link, unfortunately, but see discussions on the Stan Google users group). Moreover, for complex models, running chains long enough for an ESS > 10,000 can be arduous!
