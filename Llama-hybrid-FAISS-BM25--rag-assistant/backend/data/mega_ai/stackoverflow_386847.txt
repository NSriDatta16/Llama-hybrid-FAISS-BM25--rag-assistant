Agile is an approach to software development: (quoted from the Agile Alliance website) What Is Agile Software Development ? In the late 1990â€™s several methodologies began to get increasing public attention. Each had a different combination of old ideas, new ideas, and transmuted old ideas. But they all emphasized close collaboration between the programmer team and business experts; face-to-face communication (as more efficient than written documentation); frequent delivery of new deployable business value; tight, self-organizing teams; and ways to craft the code and the team such that the inevitable requirements churn was not a crisis. Scrum and RUP are specific software development methods that can enable Agile software development. These methods (and others, such as XP) are not mutually exclusive, and can be combined in many ways to tailor an Agile process suitable for a particular project. This is a good article describing how these methods can be combined.
