Can I use parametric and non-parametric tests in the same publication?

I have a rather difficult dataset. One measurement is non-normal and zero-inflated and could not be transformed to normality. Thus, a glm was used. Another set of measurements requires a multivariate approach. I tried a MANOVA but the data is non-multivariate normal (confirmed with mshapiro.test() from the mvnormtest package) and I cannot achieve normality with any transformation. I also cannot find a solid answer on how to perform a multivariate glm in R. Thus, I believe I am left with the non-parametric adonis function from the vegan package (for permutational manovas). So my question is, is it a faux pas to include a parametric test (glm) and a non-parametric test (permanova) in the same publication for a single dataset? Not sure if this will help but here are the outputs of adonis and Anova(manova) of the same dataset. Significance follows same the trend. > adonis Permutation test for adonis under reduced model Terms added sequentially (first to last) Permutation: free Number of permutations: 999 adonis2(formula = data[, 4:ncol(data)] ~ Sample * Treatment, data = data, permutations = 999) Df SumOfSqs F Pr(>F) Sample 4 0.21326 4.1826 0.001 *** Treatment 4 0.13082 2.5658 0.003 ** Sample:Treatment 16 0.34364 1.6850 0.005 ** Residual 50 0.63733 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 > Anova(manova) Type II MANOVA Tests: Pillai test statistic Df test stat approx F num Df den Df Pr(>F) Sample 4 2.8008 3.6704 84 132 1.209e-11 *** Treatment 4 2.7037 3.2775 84 132 5.071e-10 *** Sample:Treatment 16 7.2608 1.7804 336 720 9.870e-11 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
