Parallel analysis is implemented for R in the paran package available on CRAN here . The basic logic behind parallel analysis is to improve upon the eigenvalue > 1 (principal component analysis) or eigenvalue > 0 (common factor analysis), by (1) recognizing that in finite data, some eigenvalues will be greater than 1 or less than 1 simply due to chance because the correlation matrix will not be a perfect identity matrix, and (2) correcting for this "sampling and least squares bias" by averaging the each of the p eigenvalues from "many" uncorrelated data sets of the same n and p as your observed data, and retaining only those observed eigenvalues greater than the corresponding mean of random data eigenvalues. You might also be interested in reading the document Gently Clarifying the Application of Hornâ€™s Parallel Analysis to Principal Component Analysis Versus Factor Analysis which is linked to within the documentation for paran .
