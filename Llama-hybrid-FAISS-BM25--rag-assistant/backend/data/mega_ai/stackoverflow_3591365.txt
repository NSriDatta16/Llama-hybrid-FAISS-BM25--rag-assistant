useing __FILE__ and locating root folder in php ? how do i do this?

lets say we have a directory. project/index.php in index.php project/config/config.php it will return like D:\Project Storage\Web Projects\www\project\config. question: is there an easy way to get the rootpath without puting it on the project folder ? ( i know this is supid but i cant stand to ask ) is there a way to get the \project\ ( root folder ) ? even if we change the folder location ? Thanks Adam Ramadhan ps* please leave a comment if you dont understand what i mean.
