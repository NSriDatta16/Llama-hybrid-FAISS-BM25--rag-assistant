I don't know if there is a tool for this already, but I'd guess would be fairly easy to roll your own by using the precompiler. Precompile your file with a set of specific #defines and the output is what the compiler sees for that platform. I reckon this is not the same as highlighting the current file, but it can be automated and integrated into your IDE, push a button get a temp file with te current edited one under specific #define. Didn't try it myself, is just an idea. PS. Yes, I had to read couple times your post to searching for where exactly is 'code coverage' involved lol.
