Merging Bayesian and frequentist models

I have two models. One is a hierarchical Bayesian model that estimates parameters $p_{i, j}$ for group $i$ and sex $j$. This model is set up hierarchically because of the inherent structure of the groups and sexes, and does not work well when the groups are estimated separately. Practically, it's set up in JAGS in R. The other model is extremely complicated and is currently optimized via maximum likelihood estimation. This model takes in $p_j$ as known parameters (as well as many other knowns) and spits out the real information that I'm interested in for a single group $i$. This model is written in R and uses optim . Generally it is not good practice to stick an estimated parameter into a model. I'd like to reparameterize the models so they're compatible with each other and merge them together so $p_j$ is estimated together with everything in the second model. My question is, practically how can I take an extremely complicated model and "add in" my Bayesian model? Could I somehow extract the likelihood value in the Bayesian model and multiply it to the overall likelihood in the larger second model?
