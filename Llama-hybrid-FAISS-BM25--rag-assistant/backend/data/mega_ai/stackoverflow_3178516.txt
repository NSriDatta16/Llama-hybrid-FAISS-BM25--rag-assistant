Better to use the form $this->Post->read(null, $sid) If you want to control retrieval of associated tables, use $this->MyModel->contain() E.g. $this->Post->contain('Testing') //(Post & Testing but not Site1) or $this->Post->contain('Testing','Site1.someValue') //(Post & Testing and Site1.someValue) I think you should also carefully reread the manual sections on http://book.cakephp.org/view/78/Associations-Linking-Models-Together & http://book.cakephp.org/view/73/Retrieving-Your-Data
