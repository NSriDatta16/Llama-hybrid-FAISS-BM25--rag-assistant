How to deal with dates in regards to database storage?

Possible Duplicate: datetime vs timestamp? I would like to know how best to store dates in the database. Do you take a timestamp in the code and save it in an INT field. Do you take a date and format it to correct format and store it in a DATETIME field? What are advantages one way or another? Any good places to read up on the subject? Thanks for you input!
