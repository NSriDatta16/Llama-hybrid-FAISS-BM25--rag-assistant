Yes, other applications--especially science applications--find it useful to spawn multiple processes. Since few super-computers run Microsoft Windows, scientists generally avoid using anything that ties them to a Microsoft platform. Nothing related to COM will help scientists leverage their enormous existing code base written in Fortran. People who choose to run IIS have generally already drunk the Microsoft Koolaid, so they have fewer inhibitions to tying themselves to Microsoft's proprietary platforms, which is why COM-specific terminology will get lots of hits related to IIS. One of the open standards for doing what you want is the Message Passing Interface. Several implementations exist and some of them run on supercomputers using Fortran. Some of them run on cheaper computers using sexier languages. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface
