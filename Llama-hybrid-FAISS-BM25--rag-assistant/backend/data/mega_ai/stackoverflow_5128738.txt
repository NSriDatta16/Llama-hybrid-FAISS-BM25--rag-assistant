Recommendations on WPF Drag & Drop library

I'm using GongSolutions.Wpf.DragDrop library now. It works with MVVM, supports multiple selections, works with TreeViews... But it has a few annoying bugs. And it has not been updated since Dec 2009. Any alternatives? Edit: Changed title for better description.
