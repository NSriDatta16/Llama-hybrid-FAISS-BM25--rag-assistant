You can't convert the pointer, you need to allocate a new string that is "char" instead of "wchar_t" the most elegant way to do this is with the ATL conversion macros because it will hide all the allocation and called to the functions mentioned in the other comments example #include #include void YourFunction() { TCHAR wszHelloTchar = _T("Hello!\n"); USES_CONVERSION; // a macro required once before using T2A() and other ATL macros // printf require a char* // T2A converts (if necessary) the TCHAR string to char printf( T2A( wszHelloTchar ) ); }
