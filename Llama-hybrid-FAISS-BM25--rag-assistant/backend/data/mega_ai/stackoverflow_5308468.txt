I honestly haven't tried. I have looked at cache/session-state, but to be frank view-state is something I've always turned off, or avoided via MVC. So I lack some of the familiarity! I suspect, however, that it is rather key-heavy; with those keys being fundamental to retrieval and not fixed. This makes it very hard to package efficiently as protobuf (which works best when the data is predictable ahead of time). My gut says "not a good fit". And then it says "meh, horrible view-state is".
