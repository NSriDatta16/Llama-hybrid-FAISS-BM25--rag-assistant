In a highly secure environment, users would be encouraged to only enter their credentials when using the Secure Attention Sequence CTRL-ALT-DEL, which is designed so that it can't be intercepted by applications. So in such an environment, even the browser challenge window for authentication would be suspect. Instead you would log on locally using the same AD credentials as you need to access the website, and would be authenticated without needing to be prompted. I'd say entering AD credentials in form fields is extremely suspect if the credentials can also be used for access to other sensitive resources. Even if the app developers are well-intentioned, it is an unnecessary security hole. For example, anyone who has write access to the web directory can easily replace the login form and capture credentials.
