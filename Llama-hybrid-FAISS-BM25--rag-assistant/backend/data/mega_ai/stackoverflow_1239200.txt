I don't have all that much to share, but I like these doxygen macros that pop up when I type /** : /** $end$ */ /** * $end$ * */ /** * \brief $end$ * * \details * * * \notes */ And this one when I type /* /** Oh, and I like this for #p : #pragma message(MESSAGE_ORIGIN " ") ( MESSAGE_ORIGIN is a macro that expands to filename and line in the way the compiler emits it, so you can click on messages in the IDE's output pane.) In a shop I worked for, we had the policy to leave remark in the code with date and author. For this, the following was useful: // $YEAR$-$MONTH_02$-$DAY_02$ sbi: $end$
