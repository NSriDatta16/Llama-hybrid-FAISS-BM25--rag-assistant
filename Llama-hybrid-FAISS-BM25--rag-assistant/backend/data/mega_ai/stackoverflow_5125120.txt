Flex Drag and Drop between AdvancedDataGrid with custom itemRenderer

I have implemented drag and drop between 2 AdvancedDataGrid, but the default behaviour from Flex displays the row data during the drag using the grid item renderer showing all 5 columns. Instead, I would like to display an icon / image or my own custom item renderer during the drag and drop. What would be the easiest way? Any example? Thanks !
