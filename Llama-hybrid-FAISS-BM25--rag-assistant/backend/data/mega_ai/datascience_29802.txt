How to compare two regression models?

Which measurement(s) should one choose to compare two regression models? After modifying a learning algorithm(specifically, a regression algorithm, let's call it M1 ) to generate another learning algorithm M2 , how to validate if the above modification is efficient? here is what I did(with 10-fold cross-validation) I choose MSE as the only measurement, at each run, for M1 and M2 , calculate the MSE of both the training and testing set. And the result shows that: average MSE of the training set of 10 runs: M2 M1 average MSE of the testing set of 10 runs: M2 M1 Question: according to the above list, can we draw a conclusion that M2 is better than M1 ? thus, the modification of algorithm M1 is efficient(at least on this dataset)? Or: Did I miss some other important measurements? Is there a rule of thumb of comparing two regression models?
