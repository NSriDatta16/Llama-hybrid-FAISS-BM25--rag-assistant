OpenMP Thread count question

So Im doing a bit of Parallel Programming of the Trapezoidal Rule for my OS class, this is a homework question but im not looking for source code. after a bit of research I decided to use each thread to compute a subinterval. using: g = (b-a)/n; integral += (func(a) + func(b))/2.0; # pragma omp parallel for schedule(static) default(none) \ shared(a, h, n) private(i, x) \ reduction(+: integral) num_threads(thread_count) for (i = 1; i in my integral function, func(x) is the function that I read in from the file. So I email my professor to ask how he wants to go about choosing the number of threads. (since they will need to be evenly divisible by N (for the trapezoidal rule) but he is saying I dont need to define them, and it will define them based on the number of cores on my machine........So needless to say Im a bit confused.
