You can override the onTouchEvent method in your View : @Override public boolean onTouchEvent (MotionEvent event) { if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_DOWN) { start_x = event.getX(); start_y = event.getY(); } else if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_MOVE) { //create the line from start_x and start_y to the current location //don't forget to invalidate the View otherwise your line won't get redrawn } else if (event.getAction() == MotionEvent.ACTION_UP) { //might not need anything here } return true; } I am assuming you want to draw a straight line from the start of the drag to the endpoint and you don't want to "doodle", but its pretty simple to modify this code to handle either.
