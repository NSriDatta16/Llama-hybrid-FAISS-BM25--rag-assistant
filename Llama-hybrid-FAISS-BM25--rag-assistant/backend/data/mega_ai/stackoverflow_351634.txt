Here's a few I use that haven't been mentioned so far: System Configuration Turn on Full Keyboard Access . Turn off Automatic Login . Give my computer a cool name . Useful Defaults Display Full Paths in Finder's title bar defaults write com.apple.finder _FXShowPosixPathInTitle -bool YES Display the Safari Developer menu defaults write com.apple.Safari IncludeDebugMenu 1 Other Software HardwareGrowler (free) Set up with the Bezel style an no dock icon (see above link for instructions). I love this little utility. AntiRSI (free) Saves you from yourself. OpenTerminalHere (free) Great mini-app that opens a Terminal in the directory of the current Finder window. MacVim (free) My favorite general purpose editor. xScope (commercial) Great tool for any kind of UI work. Xcode Configuration Place build products in ~/Build Keeps everything in one easy cleanable place, and makes inter-project dependencies work. Optionally put Intermediate Build Files in ~/Build/_Intermediate to keep it even tidier. Check 'Automatically insert a closing "}"' if it isn't already Set organization name defaults write com.apple.Xcode PBXCustomTemplateMacroDefinitions '{ORGANIZATIONNAME = "Yoyodyne Industries";}' Code Completion (I think these were the defaults in earlier versions) Check 'Show arguements in pop-up list'. Check 'Insert argument placeholders for completions'. Select 'Automatically Suggest: With Delay 0.50 seconds'
