Ah, so you want old-fashioned FORTRAN, where you'd quote by counting the number of characters in the string and embedding it in a H format, such as: 13HHello, World! . As somebody who did a few things with FORTRAN back in the days when the language name was all caps, quotation marks and escaping them are a Good Thing. (For example, you aren't totally screwed if you are off by one in your manual character count.) Seriously, there is no ideal solution. It will always be necessary, at some point, to have a string containing whatever quote character you like. For practical purposes, the quote delimiters need to be on the keyboard and easily accessible, since they're heavily used. Perl's q@...@ syntax will fail if a string contains an example of each possible character. FORTRAN's Hollerith constants are even worse.
