Converting a decimal to an English string

I have written a .NET class that converts decimal (money values) to an english readable string. 113.25 => one hundred thirteen and 25 cents. It is the amount line on checks. The code is deployed and works, but I was wondering if there was a better approach than writing a bunch of if, switch, integer division, and modulus statements. I was hoping for a more elegant solution rather than my 168 lines of grind it out code.
