Detrending time series data prior to PCA

In a recent conversation with a colleague who has much more experience in statistics, she commented that I should detrend my time series data (using a linear model) prior to undertaking PCA. I'm struggling to understand the rationale, as the reason I am performing PCA is to characterise the variability and detrending is removing arguably the most interesting variability. One argument I've read was that assumptions are violated when the data is non-stationary. As PCA doesn't consider the (chronological) order of the data it's not clear to me why this would be an issue. My questions are: 1) is it necessary to detrend my data prior to performing PCA? I suspect, yes, so my second question is 2) why? Finally, 3) what biases or problems will I generate by not detrending the data? Edit to answer the question from amoeba below. My data set describes environment variables relating to a region of ocean (e.g., temperature, salinity, NAO index, etc.). My goal is to identify modes of variability and variables associated with these modes.
