BERT Model Evaluation Measure in terms of Syntax Correctness and Semantic Coherence

For example I have an original sentence. The word barking corresponds to the word that is missing. Original Sentence : The dog is barking. Incomplete Sentence : The dog is ___________. For example, using the BERT model, it predicts the word crying instead of the word barking. How will I measure the accuracy of the BERT Model in terms of how syntactically correct and semantically coherent the predicted word is? (For an instance, there are a lot of incomplete sentences, and the task is to evaluate BERT accuracy based on these incomplete sentences.) In other words, how will I measure the distance in terms of semantics in terms of model between the two words barking and crying . Please help.
