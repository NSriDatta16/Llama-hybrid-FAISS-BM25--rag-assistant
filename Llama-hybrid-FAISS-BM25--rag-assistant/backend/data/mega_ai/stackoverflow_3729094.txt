This seems like a bad idea since there is an awful lot over and above text input that a textarea gives you for free (caret, selection, cut, paste, drag and drop, arrow key handling, etc.), but here's two things you need to do : Give your a tabindex attribute so that it may receive focus and hence raise key events; Add a keypress (not keydown ) handler to the element to capture text input. Code: var el = document.getElementById("textarea"); el.onkeypress = function(evt) { var charCode = evt.which; var charStr = String.fromCharCode(charCode); alert(charStr); };
