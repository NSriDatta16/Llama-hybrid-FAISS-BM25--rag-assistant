As you know, from $$Var[q] = Var[\sum_i w_i x_{(i)}] = \sum_i\sum_j w_i w_j Cov[x_{(i)}, x_{(j)}]$$ it follows you need only compute the variances and covariances of the order statistics. To do this, diagonalize the covariance matrix! Although this cannot be done in general, M. A. Stephens has obtained (heuristically) an asymptotic diagonalization . (The eigenvectors are Hermite polynomials.) In the spirit of PCA, limiting your calculations to the largest few eigenvalues can greatly reduce the computational effort and might produce a reasonable approximation, depending on the structure of the $w_i$. In fact, if you adjust that weight vector to be a linear combination of a small number of the eigenvectors, that will assure a simple calculation of $Var[q]$ and perhaps not cost you much in terms of the accuracy of $q$ itself. At worst, a preliminary eigendecomposition of $\vec{w}$ will then require only $O(N)$ calculations of the variance rather than $O(N^2)$.
