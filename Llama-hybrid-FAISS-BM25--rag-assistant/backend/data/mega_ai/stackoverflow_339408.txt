Thank you unthinkableMayhem for the reference. The problem with loose XAML is that the XamlReader, when invoked at runtime, can not hookup events to functions in your assemblies, nor is there a mechanism to dynamically load assemblies. The way handlers for routed events are specified in XAML is one of the biggest design flaws of WPF/XAML and makes loose XAML next to useless. The work I've done in embedding Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR) scripts in XAML is useful for both loose and compiled XAML. My intention was to make loose XAML a first class citizen in WPF by allowing routed events, commands, value converters and other XAML/WPF concepts available in loose XAML. I feel that this has been achieved (though my blogs don't mention dynamically loading assemblies, but this is straight forward). If you persist, it is possible to deploy a WPF windows application in such a way that the xaml files can be manipulated at run-time. Heck, you can dynamically generate XAML with embedded scripts - no Assembly required. Man, that's one of the funniest things I've said for a long time. Be warned though - the "X" in XAML is only a marketing term. It is not eXtensible from an engineering point of view, so expect a world of pain when you get off the path set out by Microsoft. I'll be happy to help if you go this way - contact details on my web site (www.thinkbottomup.com.au). Cheers, Dan
