Is the lack of issue tracking facilities in an open source project possibly an incentive for not participating/contributing?

When deciding whether you are getting involved in a fairly big open source project in order to contribute to its code base, how significant are the project's issue tracking facilities (i.e. tracking of bugs & feature requests) for your decision to contribute or not? There are still many non-trivial (huge code base) open source projects out there, that don't formally do issue tracking - and while some contributors may indeed still do this privately in the form of miscellaneous "ToDo" lists, I have personally found the lack of availability and established use of issue tracking to be a fairly reliable indicator for a lack of organization, structure and overall project coordination. What are other people thinking?
