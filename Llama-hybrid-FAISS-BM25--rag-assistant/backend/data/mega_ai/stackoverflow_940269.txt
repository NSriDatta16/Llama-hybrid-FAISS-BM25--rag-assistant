These menus can be heirachical no more than 3 levels deep. OK Do you allow users to do this? Not generally, but I can see cases where this might be useful. How do you store the heirarchy? In a table in the database, by user ID. You also need a column in the table to implement the hierarchy, and another table to contain the menu options and base URLs. How do you programmatically display the menu? That's a tricky one. You have to find a way to push the menu hierarchy into the page from the controller. JSON seems a likely candidate. Something from jQuery UI should be able to pick up this JSON and render a menu for you. How do you make it easy for users to create heirarchies - some sort of jQuery drag/drop? jQuery UI has a Drag-drop feature. Good Luck!
