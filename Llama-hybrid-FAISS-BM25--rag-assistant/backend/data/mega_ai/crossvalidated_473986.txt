Using definition from Wikipedia : Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, information engineering, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages [...] NLP uses machine learning for solving linguistic problems, same as medical research can use statistics, but medical research is not statistics. If you want to learn more about this field, you can check the Stanford's CS224n course lectures that were recorded and are freely available on YouTube . If you want to read about some recent research, I could recommend the blog by Sebastian Ruder from DeepMind . If you were looking for some kind of 'introductory book with code', Natural Language Processing with PyTorch by Delip Rao is nice.
