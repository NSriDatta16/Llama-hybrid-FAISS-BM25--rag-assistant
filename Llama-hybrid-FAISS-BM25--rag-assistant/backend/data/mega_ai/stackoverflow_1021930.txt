You can use Django form validation on GAE storage via db.djangoforms.ModelForm . To smoothly integrate client-side Dojo functionality with Django server-side web apps, I'd look at dojango , which does work fine with GAE (as well as without). However, dojango (currently at release 0.3.1) does not yet automatically provide client-side validation of Django forms -- that's on the roadmap for the forthcoming release 0.4 of dojango, but I have no idea about the timeframe in which you could expect it.
