LaTeX listings package: different style for constants/classes/variables

I'm using the listings package for syntax highlighting, set up with the following arguments: \lstset{ language=Java, captionpos=b, tabsize=3, frame=lines, numbers=left, numberstyle=\tiny, numbersep=5pt, breaklines=true, showstringspaces=false, basicstyle=\footnotesize, identifierstyle=\color{magenta}, keywordstyle=\bfseries, commentstyle=\color{darkgreen}, stringstyle=\color{red} } This works fairly well, resulting in: What I would like, is that the constants MIN_PIXELS and MAX_PROCESSING_TIME are styled in a different color, and the class names Rectangle , Bitmap , etc. are styled in yet another color. It would also be nice if I could get numbers colored, but that's not my main focus. Is there any way to do this?
