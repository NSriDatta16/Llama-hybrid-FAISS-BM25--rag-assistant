The concept of significance or hypothesis testing is not relevant for a whole population. Hypothesis testing is based on the assumption that you deal with a sample from a (usually) infinite population, and asks the question: what is the probability that we have drawn the sample by chance from a population that fulfills the assumptions of the null hypothesis? If this probability is low, then we reject the null. Imagine the following scenario. You measure two groups of people (for example, ten people from New York and 10 people from, say, Cracow) and find that the average height in the two groups is 1.80 and 1.79 meters, respectively, and the standard deviations are 15cm. If this is a sample from an infinite population, you will not reject the null hypothesis -- the difference is small, and we conclude that the probability of getting these results if there is no difference in reality (that is, in our infinite population) is relatively high. However, if these two groups make the full population, then there is no significance. If you have measured every person who lives in Cracow and every person who lives in New York and you find a difference in averages of 1cm, then the populations are different in their mean, full stop. We have no probabilities any more, just measurements! (-- except possibly for a measurement error). What you can do instead is to show the effect size . In the hypothetical example, one would show the difference between the groups for example using Cohen's d; that is, express the difference in standard deviations. In the example above, the difference would be 1cm/15cm = 0.0(6). How to calculate your effect size will depend on what actually is your data. The point is, I think, to ask not what is statistically significant, but what effect size is significant for you as a scientist.
