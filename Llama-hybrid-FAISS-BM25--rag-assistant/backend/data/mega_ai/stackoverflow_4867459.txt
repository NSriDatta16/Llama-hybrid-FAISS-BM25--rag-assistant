In perl, regex's and code are displayed in ascii, but if you want to embed unicode in your text, first you have to have an editor that does unicode, second you have to tell Perl your source code contains unicode (with a use utf8' pragma). If you don't want to do that you can embed (in Perl) code points in strings (regex's) with a construct like this $regex = /this is some text, this: is \x{1209} a codepoint unicode character/; It matches the character IF the data source is decoded Unicode (internalized) and contains that character. Edit - I don't think there is a unicode for canadian dollar, rather '$C', like someone said you have to escape the $ if the regex is interpolated. If you keep the $C, the character class [$C] matches $ or C, not the combination. Maybe (?:\$|\$C) would be a better anchor.
