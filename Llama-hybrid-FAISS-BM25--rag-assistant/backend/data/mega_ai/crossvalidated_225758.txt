It is defined that way! Here's the algebra. Let the values be $\mathbf{x}=(x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n)$. Denote by $F$ the empirical distribution function of these values (which means each $x_i$ contributes a probability mass of $1/n$ at the value $x_i$) and let $X$ and $Y$ be independent random variables with distribution $F$. By virtue of basic properties of variance (namely, it is a quadratic form) as well as the definition of $F$ and the fact $X$ and $Y$ have the same mean, $$\eqalign{ \operatorname{Var}(\mathbf{x})&=\operatorname{Var}(X) = \frac{1}{2}\left(\operatorname{Var}(X) + \operatorname{Var}(Y)\right)=\frac{1}{2}\left(\operatorname{Var}(X-Y)\right)\\ &=\frac{1}{2}\left(\mathbb{E}((X-Y)^2) - \mathbb{E}(X-Y)^2\right)\\ &=\mathbb{E}\left(\frac{1}{2}(X-Y)^2\right) - 0\\ &=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i,j}\frac{1}{2}(x_i - x_j)^2. }$$ This formula does not depend on the way $\mathbf{x}$ is ordered: it uses all possible pairs of components, comparing them using half their squared differences. It can, however, be related to an average over all possible orderings (the group $\mathfrak{S}(n)$ of all $n!$ permutations of the indices $1,2,\ldots, n$). Namely, $$\operatorname{Var}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{i,j}\frac{1}{2}(x_i - x_j)^2 = \frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\sigma\in\mathfrak{S}(n)} \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} \frac{1}{2}(x_{\sigma(i)} - x_{\sigma(i+1)})^2.$$ That inner summation takes the reordered values $x_{\sigma(1)}, x_{\sigma(2)}, \ldots, x_{\sigma(n)}$ and sums the (half) squared differences between all $n-1$ successive pairs. The division by $n$ essentially averages these successive squared differences . It computes what is known as the lag-1 semivariance . The outer summation does this for all possible orderings . These two equivalent algebraic views of the standard variance formula give new insight into what the variance means. The semivariance is an inverse measure of the serial covariance of a sequence: the covariance is high (and the numbers are positively correlated) when the semivariance is low, and conversely. The variance of an unordered dataset, then, is a kind of average of all possible semivariances obtainable under arbitrary reorderings.
