Models combinations

My goal is time series forecasting. I have created a number of models to make predictions. I know that forecast quality can be improved by combining predictions from different models(linear combinations of forecasts, stacking etc) So the question is : How to determine how should i subset and combine my common models? Are there some common or recommended approaches? Or it is mostly question of intuition, lack and large number of attempts?
