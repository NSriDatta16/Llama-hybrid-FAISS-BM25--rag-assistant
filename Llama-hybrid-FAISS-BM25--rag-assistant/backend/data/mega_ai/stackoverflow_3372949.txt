On the server you are deploying too is something running on port 9100? It seems like it can not find the service. Have you tried changing the base address? Typical if you deploy it on serval systems and it doesn't work on one it is configuration of the machine. I would check .NET Versions Make sure no Firewalls are set up on this machine preventing the binding Check the port you are binding is open in this case 9100 Make sure any 3rd party .dll are included in the GAC or folder if needed. Verify all the .dll and your code is up to date. I see the error message says "net.tcp://myhostname:9001/SysMonitorAgent " Did you try to replace it with the machine IP Address rather than using the host name?
