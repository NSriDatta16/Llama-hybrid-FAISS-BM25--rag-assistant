Where does the definition of the hyperplane in a simple SVM come from?

I'm trying to figure out support vector machines using this resource . On page 2 it is stated that for linearly separable data the SVM problem is to select a hyperplane such that $\vec{x}_i\vec{w} + b \geq 1$ for $y_i \in 1$ and $\vec{x}_i\vec{w} + b \leq -1$ for $y_i \in -1$. I'm having trouble to understand where the right-hand side of the constraints come from? P.S The next question would be how to show that the SVM's margin is equal to $\frac{1}{||\vec{w}||}$.
