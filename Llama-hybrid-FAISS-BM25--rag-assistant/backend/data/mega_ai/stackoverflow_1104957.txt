I would grab a copy of R , install the e1071 package which nicely wraps libsvm , and try to get good results on your favorite data sets. If you just figured out PCA, it might be informative to look at data with many more predictors than cases (e.g., microarray gene expression profiles, time series, spectra from analytical chemistry, etc.) and compare linear regression on the PCA'd predictors with SVM on the raw predictors. There are a lot of great references in the other answers, but I think there's value in playing around with the black box before you read what's inside.
