When you say you're looking for graph support, it's not clear what you mean. If you mean graph support like creating charts in Microsoft Excel, I really can't help you. This has nothing to do directly with MySQL, and has everything to do with framework, libraries, and langauge that you're using to develop your website. On the other hand, if you mean working with graphs in the edges-and-vertices sense of the term you might want to look into OurDelta which is a fork of MySQL that includes the OQGRAPH storage engine for performing graph manipulations easily in SQL.
