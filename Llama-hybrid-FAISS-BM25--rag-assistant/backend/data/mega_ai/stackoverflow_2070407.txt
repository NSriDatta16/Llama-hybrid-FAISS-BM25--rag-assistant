Implementing a cache using a java ConcurrentHashMap

I'd like to implement a simple caching of heavyweight objects in a web java application. But I can't figure out how to do it properly. Am I missing something or ConcurrentHashMap methods (putIfAbsent, ...) are not enough and additional synchronization is needed ? Is there a better simple API (In memory storage, no external config) to do this ? P.
