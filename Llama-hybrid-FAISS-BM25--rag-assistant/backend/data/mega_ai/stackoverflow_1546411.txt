URL Moniker Examples for C# (IMoniker)

I am trying to implement an URL Moniker for MSHTML that will be used to provide images from a storage (in the application) to the HTML Edit control. I have understood that to do this I must implement the IMoniker interface. I have not found any decent documentation or sample code anywhere for this. (All MSDN documentation on the subject seem to imply C++/COM programming and very deep understanding of OLE, which I can't say that I have). How would I implement an URL Moniker and the IMoniker interface in C#?
