How would I databind a Paragraph to a TextBlock?

How would I take a Paragraph object and databind them to the TextBlock for use in a DataTemplate? A plain bind does nothing, just a ToString() of the Paragraph object. The InLines property would let me add a list of TextRun's that make up the Paragraph manually, but that can't be bound to and I could really do with a binding based solution. Edited question to focus on what I really need to do.
