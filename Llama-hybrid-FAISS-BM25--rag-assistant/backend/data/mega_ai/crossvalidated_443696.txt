Can we always perform SVD on the data matrix before doing high-dimensional logistic regression?

So I'm using lasso logistic regression to classify my data. My data matrix $X$ has dimension $n\times p$ for $p >> n$ . As $p$ is on the order of a billion, I expect to face some computational challenges when trying to run lasso logistic regression. If I'm only interested in predictive performance, and I don't care about inference, is there any drawback to taking the SVD of $$XX^T=U\Sigma^2U^T$$ and then simply applying lasso logistic regression to $U$ ? As far as I can tell, all I've done is do a change of basis so that I'm only considering the $n-1$ dimensional affine space spanned by my data, and thus my classification algorithm should perform just as well. Edit It does appear that the above is correct, see the related question, Using SVD on features before SVM classification, when p >> N
