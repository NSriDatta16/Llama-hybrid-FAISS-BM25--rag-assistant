Browsers do give you lots of liberties in adding extra attributes to elements that are not specified in the HTML standard. HTML5 even allows them, see Custom attributes - Yea or nay? . Basically the custom attributes are ignored while rendering but they are added to the DOM nonetheless. When they reside in the DOM, you can access and use them however you want to.
