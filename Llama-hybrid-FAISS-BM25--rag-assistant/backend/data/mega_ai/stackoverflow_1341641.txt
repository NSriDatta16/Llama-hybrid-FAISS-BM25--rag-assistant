Honest answer: It sounds like you are either over-engineering this, or you are irresponsibly re-inventing the wheel. I want to build a loosely coupled and configurable architecture which can be reused. That's a lovely goal, but is it a requirement of this project? I'm guessing it's not a fundamental requirement, at most a nice-to-have. It seems that the business needs a dashboard with some exportable charts and reports, and you're proposing to build a platform. That's classic over-engineering. If you really need a reusable platform, it will take considerable effort and skills to build an intuitive, robust, secure, testable, configurable, maintainable reporting platform with sophisticated and trainable authoring tools. And even if you build a perfect platform, you'll have a custom system that nobody else knows . If you use an established BI/reporting platform, you can hire people who already know the technology or point people at reams of already existent training materials. In other words, it's going to be difficult and more expensive to build, which is bad, but also difficult and more expensive for the organization to use for years to come, which is worse. I routinely choose build over buy, but reporting is a known problem that has been solved well enough by commercial platforms. So, sure, that architecture sounds reasonable. And without knowing more about the requirements, it's impossible to judge: maybe you really do need to build this from scratch, but from your description "charting Application ( kinda Dashboard)", building a reporting platform sounds unnecessary, though perhaps quite fun.
