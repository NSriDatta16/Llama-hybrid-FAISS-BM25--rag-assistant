Why not stay with Java bytecode as it is and if you need a human readable form, simply disassemble it? At least your question does not make it clear why Java bytecode itself can not be the intermediary data structure used for storage. The official Java SDK release has a tool called javap that converts bytecode back into Java source. Another option for the same job would be javad .
