How to conduct meaningful comparative analysis of two data sets with different total number of values

Situational Summary: We have two data sets that present the amounts paid during individual user-sessions on two separate products. We are trying to digest the data in these sets to provide a comparative analysis of each product's performance based on the average amounts paid per session, per product. Problem: The number of values (aka user-sessions) in each set are significantly different. For example, for a particular period of time Product A might have 200 values in the set whilst Product B will have 500 values in the set for the same period. Questions: How statistically relevant is the difference in # of Values between sets, specifically when trying to determine the average pay-per-session per-product? If the answer to the above question is "very relevant", how do we go about producing meaningful observations about how the two products perform comparatively, given the data in these two sets? DISCLAIMER: I have almost zero academic background in statistics, but I have enough exposure to HOPEFULLY be able to interpret your answers well enough. In other words: forgive my ignorance.
