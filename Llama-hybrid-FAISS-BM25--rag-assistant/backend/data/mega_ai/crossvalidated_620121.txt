Conceptually, what is the bias of the standard error of an estimator?

I'm reading Muthén and Muthén (2002) to learn how to use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate statistical power in regards to the coefficients of a model that is linear in its coefficients. I understand the bias of an estimator is the difference between its expected value versus the population parameter's value, i.e., $$\huge\mathrm{E}[\hat\theta]-\theta$$ However, I don't think I conceptually understand what is the bias of the standard error of an estimator , i.e., the bias of $\sigma_{\hat\theta}$ . Here is the excerpt from page 606 of Muthén and Muthén (2002) $^{\text{see footnote}}$ : Parameter bias is evaluated using the information in columns 1 and 2 of the output. The column labeled starting gives the population parameter values . The column labeled average gives the parameter estimate average over the replications of the Monte Carlo study . For example, the first number in column 2, 0.7963, is the average of the factor loading estimates for y1 over 10,000 replications. To determine its bias , subtract the population value of 0.8 from this number and divide it by the population value of 0.8. This results in a bias of –0.005, which is negligible. Standard error bias is evaluated using the information in columns 3 and 4 of the output. The column labeled SD gives the standard deviation of each parameter estimate over the replications of the Monte Carlo study . This is considered to be the population standard error when the number of replications is large. The column labeled SE Average gives the average of the estimated standard errors for each parameter estimate over the replications of the Monte Carlo study. Standard error bias is calculated in the same way as parameter estimate bias as described previously. Thus, is it the difference between the sample-derived $\huge\sigma_{\hat\theta}$ versus what $\huge\sigma_{\hat\theta}$ would have been if the estimator could hypothetically be applied across the entire population? Expressed mathematically with an obnoxiously long subscript: $$\huge\sigma_{\hat\theta}-\sigma_{\hat\theta_{\text{if }\hat\theta\text{ were to be applied over the entire population}}}$$ Footnote: They divide the bias of the estimator by the parameter value to obtain a useful proportion, but they refer to this quotient as the bias of the estimator, which I believe is inconsistent with how most statisticians define bias , but that's beside the point of my question.
