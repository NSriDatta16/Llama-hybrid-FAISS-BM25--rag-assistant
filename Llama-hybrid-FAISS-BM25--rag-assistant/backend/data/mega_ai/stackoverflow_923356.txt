You can turn on DEBUG mode: to enable 'DEBUG' log level for TeamCity classes. To do it, edit the logs/teamcity- (server|agent)-log4j.xml file by removing all the lines containing comment. After that, DEBUG messages will go to teamcity-*.log files. Make sure the logs are rotated by default. When debug is enabled it makes sense to increase maxBackupIndex value in the relevant appender tag to 10 or even 20 files (ensure there is sufficient free disk space available). ...which I got from their docs . And then you can see what is happening.
