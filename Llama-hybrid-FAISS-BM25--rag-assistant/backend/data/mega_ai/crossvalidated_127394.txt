R forecasting, flat forecast

Iâ€™m trying to produce a hourly, daily forecast for revenue in R. I set seasonal periods to 24, for 24 hours, and 365.25 for days in a year. I attached the fit vs actual plot and the forecast produced by R. I then fit the time series with the tbats model due to the high seasonal periods. I then try and forecast 8112 periods or just under 1 year. My problem is that I keep getting a flat model$mean. However, the fitted vs actuals looks like its catching the seasonality. rev_ts UPDATE: Trying to reference your write-up here Rob: http://robjhyndman.com/hyndsight/longseasonality/ So m=365.25? And n= # of observations? Sorry I'm a current student and new to R (and modeling for that matter). Where does this take into account hourly seasonality Trying to implement your code from post using these lines of code: m=365.25 (Where does this take into account hourly seasonality) n= 25656 (number of observations, historical data) rev_fit plot(forecast(rev_fit, h=2*m, xreg=fourier(n+1:(2*m),4,m))) Any explanation on the theory and what this is actually doing? Sorry for all the questions, but I'd love to understand this more fully. Thanks!
