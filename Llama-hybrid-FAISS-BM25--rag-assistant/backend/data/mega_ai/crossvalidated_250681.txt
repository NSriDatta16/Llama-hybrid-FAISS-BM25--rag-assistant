I don't know what you mean by the general forecasting equation and I am not sure I understand your notation. Are you staying in the ARIMA realm? The AR(1) model ARIMA(1,0,0) has the form: $Y_t = r Y_{t-1} + e_t$ where $r$ is the autoregressive parameter and $e_t$ is the pure error term at time $t$ . For ARIMA(1,0,1) it is simply $Y_t = r Y_{t-1} + e_t + a e_{t-1}$ where $a$ is the moving average parameter.
