Supervised learning with tagged images

I am new to ML and looking to learn with some project. I have a medical imaging dataset where an image (image is a time series of an object so multiple images) has been looked at by radiologist and they have graded it on a scale of 1-5 for some pathology. Now, I would like to basically use this to predict the pathology on new images. I am guessing there are multiple approaches one could take to do so. Could someone point me to some methods I could try (simple to more advanced) as I would like to also learn about them. Another issue is that different images are of different sizes. Is this usually a problem for these approaches? I could try something where I can register them so that they are of the same size.
