Adding Oracle ASM disk group

I am attempting to install an Automatic Storage Management instance on an Oracle 10g install on Windows Vista. I have tried using manual ASM addition via asmtoolg and also via the interactive DBCA gui. I have created and stamped 4 2GB partitions, but ASM will not recognize these and allow me to create a disk group. I'm stuck and cannot move forward with the install.
