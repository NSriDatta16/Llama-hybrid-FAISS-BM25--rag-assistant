Can the number of epochs influence overfitting?

I am using a convolution neural network , CNN . At a specific epoch, I only save the best CNN model weights based on improved validation accuracy over previous epochs. Does increasing the number of epochs also increase over-fitting for CNNs and deep learning in general?
