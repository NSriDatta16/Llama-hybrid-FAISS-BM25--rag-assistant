Here's what I ended up doing. I haven't actually checked what kind of SQL this is generating yet, I'm guessing that it's probably not exactly pretty. I think I'd be better off doing a couple queries and aggregating the stuff myself, but in any case this works: var images = from img in db.Images join imgTags in db.ImageTags on img.idImage equals imgTags.idImage into g from imgTags in g.DefaultIfEmpty() join t in db.Tags on imgTags.idTag equals t.idTag into g1 from t in g1.DefaultIfEmpty() where img.OCRData.Contains(searchText.Text) group img by t == null ? "(No Tags)" : t.TagName into aGroup select new { GroupName = aGroup.Key, Items = from x in aGroup select new ImageFragment() { ImageID = x.idImage, ScanDate = x.ScanTime } };
