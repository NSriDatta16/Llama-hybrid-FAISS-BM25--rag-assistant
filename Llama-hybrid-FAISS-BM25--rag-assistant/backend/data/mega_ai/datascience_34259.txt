How to change the input of conv2d from gray scale to coloured image

I have CNN with Tensorflow for gray images with weights w1=[9,9,1,64], w2 = [1,1,64, 32] and w3 = [5,5,32,1] Now I want to use RGB 3 channel data instead of gray scales. Can anybody help me how to change w1, w2, and w3 for RGB images? Is it possible to use conv2d function for RGB images in Tensorflow?
