Independent variables in ordinal logistic regression

One of my IV's for my ordinal logistic regression is a nominal categorical variable with 4 categories. Most examples I see for this type of logistic regression have only binary categorical variables. I have tried with and without dummies for my 4-category independent... but I am not confident of the outcome. When I renumber the categories (switch them around as 1,2,3,4 because they are not ordered in any way, I get different parameters and p-values each time. So something is wrong.
