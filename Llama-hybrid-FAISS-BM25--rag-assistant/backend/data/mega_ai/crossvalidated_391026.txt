Log-linear regression: interpretation of RSE

AIM: To really, really understand what the model outputs mean in a log-linear regression, specifically, how to interpret the residual standard error (RSE). I have read this post but it does not specifically address RSE for log-linear models. This is the log-linear model: lm(formula = log(n_capita) ~ edu_index_percent, data = full_maps_edu) So far, to my understanding I know that the RSE is the average amount that the response will deviate from the true regression line. Great. But because I have logged the dependent variable, can I say: n_capita will deviate on average about 1.33 from the true regression line? I think that should't make sense because the response variable is logged. Should it instead be: n_capita will deviate on average about $e^{1.33}$ from the true regression line? I'm a bit confused. Please advise. Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -9.92029 0.38053 -26.1
