I think proportions is better for SVM. Reason is you transform your data from minutes, which is unbounded, to variables that fall in [0,1]. As user20160 pointed out, some durations might be significantly larger than others on average. But that's alright. You need one more normalization, this time over the columns. In R, d.bar = rpois(10, 20) d.bar[1] = 2 d.bar[10] = 4 x = sapply(d.bar, function(.d)rpois(10, .d)) tot = apply(x, 1, sum) x1 = x / tot apply(x1, 1, sum) # check x2 = scale(x1, center=TRUE, scale=TRUE)
