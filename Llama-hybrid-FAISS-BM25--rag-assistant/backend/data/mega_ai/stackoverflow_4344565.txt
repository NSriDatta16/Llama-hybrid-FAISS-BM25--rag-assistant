Start with a good book that covers control structures, etc. (two I would recommend include Head First Programming , or learning to program (which is a Ruby book). After that, try out some basic stuff to learn your syntax, control structures, logic, etc. - some good sites for this are: Project Euler Coding Dojo Code Kata (pragpub) Then, move up from there (at that point you may want more framework specific stuff - MVC, Rails, etc.). On a side note - language is largely irrelevant. I'm mentoring an apprentice developer at work now (in C# but he's also looking at some Python), and in our last coding session, we wrote very little code, but spent a ton of time chewing through edge cases in a code kata. (An addendum) Once you're past basic control structures and syntax, you're going to find the toughest parts are design, abstraction, problem solving, etc. - so for those some good ways to pick up those skills include: Getting a good mentor (even a virtual one). Looking at LOTS of code. If you are not in a dev shop, look at an opensource project you're interested in to see how other people code. Contribute to OSS Start small, and build something for yourself (I'm always partial to building your own blog site - like a Jedi has to build their own lightsaber ;) Have fun!
