From what I have found out, there are a number of advantages a dedicated DB diagraming tool has over a basic diagram-oriented tool like Visio: Support to generate a diagram from an existing database Support to generate an alter script to apply the changes you made to a diagram Support to compare a diagram against an existing database There are many others, but in a nutshell, the dedicated tools will have many more integration features that leverage the schema of existing databases, which make managing them MUCH easier, especially in a transition scenario.
