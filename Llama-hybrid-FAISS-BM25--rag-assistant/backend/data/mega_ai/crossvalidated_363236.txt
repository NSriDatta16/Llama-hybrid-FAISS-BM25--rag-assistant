Turning my comment above into an answer: Since your first PCA identifies orthogonal vectors, your second PCA should in principle do nothing (since it should basically find the same axes as the first round). But as @NickCox points out, coefficients might be reversed. However, there may be small differences in practice for algorithmic reasons.
