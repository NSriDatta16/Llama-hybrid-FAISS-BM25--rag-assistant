Feeding a layer from a deep-learnt neural network into an SVM

In http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/donahue14.pdf , it is stated: Our top-performing method (based on validation accuracy) trains a linear SVM on DeCAF6 Can you delineate in a way hopefully tenable to relative laymen, how does one plug a layer of already trained neurons (DeCAF6 in this instance) into an SVM, both what exactly does this "integration" comprise, what is the overall flow, and some intuitions to help along the way?
