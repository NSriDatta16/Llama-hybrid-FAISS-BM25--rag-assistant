You should try using the mysql LOAD DATA INFILE command instead of individual inserts. This is typically much faster. Check out the documentation: http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/load-data.html Also, if this is a table you'll never update or delete data from, you could try converting the table to use the archive engine (instead of InnoDB or any others). This engine is made for storing massive amounts of records and is very fast to insert new records. Check this out for more: http://dev.mysql.com/tech-resources/articles/storage-engine.html
