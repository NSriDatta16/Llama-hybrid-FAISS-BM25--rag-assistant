Business logic in Entity Framework POCOs using partial classes?

I have business logic that could either sit in a business logic/service layer or be added to new members of an extended domain class (EF T4 generated POCO) that exploits the partial class feature. So I could have: a) bool OrderBusiness.OrderCanBeCancelledOnline(Order order) .. or (IOrder order) or b) bool order.CanBeCancelledOnline() .. i.e. it is the order itself knows whether or not it can be cancelled. For me option b) is more OO. However option a) allows more complex logic to be applied e.g. using other domain objects or services. At the moment I have a mix of both and this doesn't seem elegant. Any guidance on this would be much appreciated!
