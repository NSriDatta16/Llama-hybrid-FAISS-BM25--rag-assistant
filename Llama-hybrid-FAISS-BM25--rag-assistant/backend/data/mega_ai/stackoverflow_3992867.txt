load several fragments at once with jquery .load()

i am loading some fragments with jquery with following code var box = $(this).closest(".product-contain").children(".title:first"); box.load(url + " .maintitle", data); var box = $(this).closest(".product-contain").children(".detail:first"); box.load(url + " .alldetail", data); (i don't want to load whole .product-contain at once, because part of it is being edited by user at the same moment) but it does 2 requests to server for same content. can i somehow do it with one request? thanks!
