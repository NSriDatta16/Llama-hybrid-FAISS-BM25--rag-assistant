How to build a supervised artificial neural network?

I am trying to build and train a machine learning data science algorithm that correctly predicts what president won in what county. I have the following information for training data. Total population Median age % BachelorsDeg or higher Unemployment rate Per capita income Total households Average household size % Owner occupied housing % Renter occupied housing % Vacant housing Median home value Population growth House hold growth Per capita income growth Winner I am new to the field and this is my first time building an artificial neural network and I don't know what to do to start (so forgive me if my question is extremely broad). What I have done so far is read the wikipedia page for artificial neural networks. What I want to do next is implement supervised learning using the training data. I would appreciate any help getting started. Please let me know if you have used any good tutorials or libraries to help build something similar. I was thinking of using the library Lasagne. A few specific questions I have as I tried to use Lasagne - What is the error I am to calculate when building an algorithm using training data? How many layers do I need and what does each layer signify?
