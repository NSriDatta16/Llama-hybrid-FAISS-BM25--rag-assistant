You are close. You need to be binding the Style property to a property of type Style though (not a string representing a static resource lookup). You have two options for storage of the style and this will determine what the property looks like. Either put the style in the pages resources or in the App resources, and then you ABC property will look like one of the following: // using page resources public Style ABC { get { return (Style) this.Resources["_myStyle"]; } } // using application resources public Style ABC { get { return (Style) App.Current.Resources["_myStyle"]; } } Where _myStyle is the value the style has for its x:Key property in the resource dictionary.
