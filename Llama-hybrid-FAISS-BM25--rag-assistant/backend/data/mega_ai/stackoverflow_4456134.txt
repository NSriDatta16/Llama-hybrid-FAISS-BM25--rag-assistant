Magento: output an attibute as a link

I want to create a per-brand, per-author, per-manufacturer navigation in Magento. So I'm trying to output an attribute as something like "mysite.com/attribute/brand/brand_name" and then I'll create a custom CMS page to display all products with this brand_name. I know how to create the link, but I don't know where to put my code! Which is the best way to get this?
