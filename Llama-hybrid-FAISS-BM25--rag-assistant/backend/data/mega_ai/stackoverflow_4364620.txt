This was a recommended approach for IE by Microsoft support http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537503%28VS.85%29.aspx#related_topics "If you have some control over the binaries being installed on a userâ€™s machine, checking the UA in script seems like a relevant approach: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Internet Settings\5.0\User Agent\Post Platform " -- By M$ support Every web page has access to the userAgent string and if you drop a custom post platform value, detecting this in javascript using navigator.userAgent is quite simple. Fortunately, other major browsers like Firefox and Chrome (barring Safari :( ), do not throw "page not found" errors when a link with a custom protocol is clicked and the protocol is not installed on the users machine. IE is very unforgiving here, any trick to click in a invisible frame or trap javascript errors does not work and ends up with ugly "webpage cannot be displayed" error. The trick we use in our case is to inform users with browser specific images that clicking on the custom protocol link will open an application. And if they do not find the app opening up, they can click on an "install" page. In terms of XD this wprks way better than the ActiveX approach for IE. For FF and Chrome, just go ahead and launch the custom protocol without any detection. Let the user tell you what he sees. For Safari, :( no answers yet
