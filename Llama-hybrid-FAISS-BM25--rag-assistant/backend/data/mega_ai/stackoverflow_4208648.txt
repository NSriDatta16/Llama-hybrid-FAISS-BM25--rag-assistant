The main reason to switch from cookies to sessions is to shift the storage location of the data from the client (cookie) to the server (session). However, the downside is that sessions often require cookies to carry the session ID along. But as Kevin has already pointed out , it is possible to implement sessions with the session ID being sent in the URL instead. However, the downside of that is that the session ID is then more opaque than when sent in the HTTP header instead.
