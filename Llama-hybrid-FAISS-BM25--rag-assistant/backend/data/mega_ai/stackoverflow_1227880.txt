The order of the elements is the responsibility of the datasource (your code), not the table view. If you want to reorder things, then you need to reorder the data structure that you use to drive -cellForRowAtIndexPath: . If you want animations, I do not believe there's a good move animation yet. The best you can probably do (easily) is to perform a deletion and an insertion. See Batch Insertion and Deletion of Rows and Sections for details on how to animate that. A few months ago I asked the UITableView developers about the general bugginess and fragility of these animations in OS2.x, and they assured me that a lot of work went into improving that in OS3. So hopefully you can just follow the documentation and it shouldn't crash anymore.
