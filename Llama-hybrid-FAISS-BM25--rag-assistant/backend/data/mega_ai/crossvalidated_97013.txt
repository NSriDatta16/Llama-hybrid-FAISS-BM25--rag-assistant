Calculating average variance extracted (AVE) in R for checking discriminant validity (Fornell-Larcker criterion)

We are using lavaan in R to calculate CFAs (confirmatory factor analyses) and SEMs (structural equation models). We now want to test whether two latent constructs can be assumed to be unrelated (discriminant validity). Refering to Fornell, C. & Larcker, D. F. (1981). Evaluating structural equation models with unobservable variables and measurement error. Journal of Marketing Research, 18, 39â€“50. we need to calculate the so called average variance extracted (AVE). I found the following R-help-mailing list post . However, I don't think the output is the AVE I need for the Fornell-Larcker criterion. Values are calculated for each item and not factors. Does anybody know how to obtain this value within lavaan or any other package? If it is not possible to automatically obtain the AVE for each construct, can somebody point out how to calculate it based on the lavaan output? Help would be much appreciated! Thanks.
