WSDL Xmlns change

I have a .NET 4.0 web service which has an targetNamespace of "http://tempuri.org" when the WSDL is generated. A client is sending me a SOAP envelope with the xmlns set to "uri:company:agent" (see sample below) My service rejects the SOAP envelope since the namespaces are not the same. abc I receive the following error: Error in deserializing body of request message for operation 'send_message'. OperationFormatter encountered an invalid Message body. Expected to find node type 'Element' with name 'send_message' and namespace 'http://tempuri.org/'. Found node type 'Element' with name 'ns1:send_message' and namespace 'urn:company:agent' My Question is as follows: I can't find where to change the namespace of my project within Visual Studio 2010 to reflect "uri:company:agent" instead of "http://tempuri.org/". I've looked extensively but any changes I make do not reflect in the WSDL.
