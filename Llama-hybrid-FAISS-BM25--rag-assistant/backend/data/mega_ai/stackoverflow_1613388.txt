Is it possible to drag and drop files from local file system into a Flex application?

I would like to know if it is possible to create a Flex application accepting the drop of local files? The aim is to only retrieve the full path/name of the file in the local file system. Google results are mainly about dragging and dropping items inside a flex application. Thank you in advance.
