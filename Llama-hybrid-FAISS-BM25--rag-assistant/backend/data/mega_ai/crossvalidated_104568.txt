To add to what Alecos said, which is very good, centering your data at zero is extremely important when using Bayesian statistics or regularization, since otherwise the data can be correlated with the intercept, which makes regularization not do what you usually want. Making the data zero mean can diminish many off-diagonal terms of the covariance matrix, so it makes the data more easily interpretable, and the coefficients more directly meaningful, since each coefficient is applying more primarily to that factor, and acting less through correlation with other factors.
