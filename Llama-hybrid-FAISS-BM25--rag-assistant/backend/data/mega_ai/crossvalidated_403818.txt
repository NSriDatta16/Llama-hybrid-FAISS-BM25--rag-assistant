You can try the SVMlight implementation of support vector machines. For me it worked blazingly fast with about 10 000 observations and several hundreds of features, giving good results. They claim it's fast for several hundred thousands of samples, too. In addition there's a Python binding for SVMlight, which I haven't tried. Using this implementation you can try different kernels (e.g. polynomial or rbf) and see if SVMs help with your classification problem. Maybe start with a subsample of your data first, though.
