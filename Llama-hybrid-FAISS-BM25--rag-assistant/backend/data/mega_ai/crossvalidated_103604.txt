clarification Johansen cointegration matlab

To my understanding the Johansen cointegration test, will test first if the time series have zero cointegrations, if rejected, the Johansen test will test for one cointegration, if rejected, it will test for two cointegrations of more.. If you cannot reject the null hypthesis for the second time in the row it means the times series has one cointegration.. I use matlab and using the Johansen test I get the following result: see pic. I think the results are weird, because you cannot reject the null hypothesis of zero cointegration, but you can reject the null hypothesis of one cointegrations.. Has someone an explanation?
