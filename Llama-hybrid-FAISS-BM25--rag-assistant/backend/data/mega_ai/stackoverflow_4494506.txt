The conventional solution is to have a " recovery agent ": one user that holds a second password that can be used to decrypt all data. Strict usage policies would apply to using the recovery password, such as putting it physically into a safe. Then, either encrypt all data twice: once with the user key and once with the recovery key; alternatively, generate a session key for every set of data, and encrypt the data only once, but the session key twice. For that to work, at least the key of the recovery agent must be asymmetric, since the private part will live in the safe, and the public key in the software. As yet another alternative using the same scheme: encrypt the user's passwords with the recovery key on password change. This is simpler to implement, but will allow to recover the passwords and not just the data, which may be undesirable.
