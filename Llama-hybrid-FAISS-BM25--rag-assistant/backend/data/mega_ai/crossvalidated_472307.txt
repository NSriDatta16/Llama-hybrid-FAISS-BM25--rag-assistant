Prediction without data

I have to do data analysis on the data of a machine in order to improve performance. The problem is that the data shows a conservative behavior of the machine. In other words, the machine is always performing at 70% of its capacity, and everything is always ok. But to improve performance, it is necessary to increase its capacity, but I don't know how the machine will work because I don't have this data. I am wondering what statistical or machine learning model should I use to predict something that I don't have the data?
