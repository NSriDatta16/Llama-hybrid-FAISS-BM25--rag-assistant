I found the MySQL module he's referring to, it was part of the DBD::mysql dist. To quote it As of Msql-Mysql-modules 1.19_10 M(y)sqlPerl is no longer a separate module. Instead it is emulated using the DBI drivers. You are strongly encouraged to implement new code with DBI directly. So the emulation layer is the reason for your performace loss. Also that the MySQL.pm was removed in 4.x line of DBD::mysql, it last appeared in 2006.
