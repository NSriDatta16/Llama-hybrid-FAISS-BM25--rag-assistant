foreign key in database

i am using linq to sql .dbml , May i know what is the best way to add foreign key constraint to the database? ALTER TABLE Staffs Add CONSTRAINT fk_Staffs FOREIGN KEY(UserId) REFERENCES Users(Id); i can write this with no problem. But when my database table increases, i have hard time to maintain the Add Constraint foreign script . Each time when i have multiple update to the database columns, then i will crack my head to update those alter table script. Could there be a simple process for this? In the .dbml, i can drag and drop the association to add the foreign key, i wonder is there a way that i can export those foreign key into script which like what i wrote above? this is good when i want to do the deployment. Or must i write the alter script and update it whenever there is changes on tables? please advice
