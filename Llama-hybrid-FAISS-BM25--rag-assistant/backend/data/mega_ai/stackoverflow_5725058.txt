How do I persist a user's profile in ASP.NET?

I am a newbie to ASP.NET - so what is the pattern to use Isolated Storage vs. Session state for web applications? I have a use case where when a user logs into the application, I need to create his profile information which will persist throughout his session. Does it make sense to store this in session or should I use Isolated Storage (assuming the client is on a Windows machine) Thanks!
