So to answer your question. I use the Google Maps API. Why? I think there are a whole lot of good reasons that make Google Maps an extremely valuable mapping solution for web developers. I realise I will probably sound like a hand waving evangelist, but here goes: Very well documented API Access to a range of excellent tile sets for your maps (topographic, satellite, road maps, terrain). Access to the Google Earth 3D plugin with very few changes to a standard Google Maps site. Constant upgrades and improvements to the API and it's features. I started working on my Google Maps project a few years ago and in that time I have seen new tilesets, the upgraded GUI controls, mousewheel zoom, Google Earth plugin ... I am sure this list will get longer. StreetView. I don't actually use this myself, but Streetview is a fantastic feature that isn't duplicated in the other mapping solutions. Extensive set of very useful tools in the API. GLog, distance calculations, GLatLngRegion etc ... GeoCoding. I recently dabbled with the GeoCoding API that Google provides and found it was very easy to use and extremely powerful. The Google Maps Group - I have asked these guys for a help a number of times and found prompt and accurate responses that rival StackOverflow. Ability to overlay tiles over the Google map tiles (GOverlay). Ability to implement entirely custom tilsets that leverage the Google Maps scaling/panning framework. Custom map themes allows you to integrate the map look and feel with your page color scheme.
