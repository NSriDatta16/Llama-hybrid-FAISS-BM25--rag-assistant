For public properties I don't think Apple recommends it, because sometimes setting a property to nil can have side effects other than just releasing the variable (KVO notifications, or a custom setter method that does something else). As for private properties, I'm not too sure. Using a property will only save you a couple of key strokes while coding, but you're also making it slightly more complex and fragile. I favour readability and maintainability over convenience to write, because you'll save time in the long run.
