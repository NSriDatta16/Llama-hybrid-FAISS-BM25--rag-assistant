I guess it depends on what you mean by giving it more importance. If only x2 is important then leave the rest of the predictors out of the model. Or create a scale from the predictors that gives much higher weight to x2. Beyond that your question doesn't really make sense (and to be honest, I don't know why one would want to do what I just suggested). Unless you're a Bayesian--then I guess you should give a prior on the coefficient for x2 with mass away from zero. If you're not a Bayesian you should probably just let the data tell you which variables are more important.
