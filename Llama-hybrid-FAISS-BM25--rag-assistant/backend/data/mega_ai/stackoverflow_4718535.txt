The way we do it, against our external customers, is when we have billed the the customer we close the incident (this can be just as well a problem or a SED-task), until then, the incident simply remains resolved. I believe you should not re-open a closed incident, that one is the books, while a resolved incident you can re-open. By the way, it would be wise to read what ITIL says about this. As said on this page : Rules for re-opening incidents Despite all adequate care, there will be occasions when incidents recur even though they have been formally closed. Because of such cases, it is wise to have pre-defined rules about if and when an incident can be re-opened. It might make sense, for example, to agree that if the incident recurs within one working day then it can be re-opened - but that beyond this point a new incident must be raised, but linked to the previous incident(s). The exact time threshold/rules may vary between individual organizations - but clear rules should be agreed and documented and guidance given to all Service Desk staff so that uniformity is applied.
