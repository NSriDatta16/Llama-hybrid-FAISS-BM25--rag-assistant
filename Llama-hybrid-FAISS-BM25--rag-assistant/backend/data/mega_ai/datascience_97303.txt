How to use machine learning to find pattern of similar regions in signals

I have a long time series signal. This signal is usually very stable, but it will change when the sensor is stimulated, and this change is usually very short. I know this can be trained using the labeled method(like neural network ,CNN, etc), but it takes a lot of time to label, this is because my change time is very short(about 4 seconds), and the change time is not much. So, I want to generate a number of signals similar to patterns using random numbers, and then use an autoencoder(or feature extraction method) to learn features before performing detection. What I want to ask is if there are any errors in my ideas or can anyone provide some ideas or opinions. Many thank! The pattern will not be obvious, but like this: My thoughts:
