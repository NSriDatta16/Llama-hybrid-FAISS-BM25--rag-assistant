Xcode Documentation Set for C++ Standard Library

I've recently began using C++ with XCode and I'm starting to miss the integrated documentation that is available for Objective-C. I know that there is a way to generate documentation sets using Doxygen, but a readily available bundle would certainly be preferable... Is there an easy way to get XCode to search at least the standard C++ library documentation?
