Something quite useful is to use Nagelkerke $R^2$, which is just a generalization of the general R^2 statistic in linear regression. Using the rms package. library(rms) model Also, you could use cross-validation. That means you test for correct predictions in your original data using a criteria (usually 1 if predict > 0.5) and then calculate a rate. (>80% is usually fine, but that depends on the study). Deviance is a generalization of the residual sum of squares, and can be used to make some hypothesis testing in logistic regression. z-value is the statistic $(B_{j}-\hat{B_{j}})/s.e.(\hat{B_{j}})$ which asymptotically converges to a $\mathcal{N}(0,1)$(Under the null hypothesis $B_{j}=0$). Significant codes are just a guide. e.g. * means the associated p -value is $
