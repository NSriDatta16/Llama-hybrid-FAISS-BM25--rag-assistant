Visual Studio for SSRS 2008 - How to organize reports into subfolders in Solution Explorer?

Right now I have a project called reports with several reports. In solution explorer it looks like this: Shared Data Sources -- DEV Reports -- Report1 -- Report2 -- Report3 I want to make it look like this and have the same structure carry over to the report manager website when I click deploy. Shared Data Sources -- DEV Folder A -- Report1 Folder B -- Report2 -- Report3 Anyone know how to do this?
