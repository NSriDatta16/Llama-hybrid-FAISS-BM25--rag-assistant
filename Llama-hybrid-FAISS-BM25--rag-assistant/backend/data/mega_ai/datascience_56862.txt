Yes, even as simple machine learning as ordinary linear least squares can do this if you use some applied cleverness. (But most would consider this quite horrible overkill). (I will assume we want to find max of abs of input vector): Select a monotonically decreasing function of absolute value, for example $$f(x) = \frac{1}{x^2}$$ Build diagonal matrix of $f({\bf r})$ . Let us call it $\bf C_r$ Build vector full of ones $\bf S$ . Build and solve equation system $(\epsilon {\bf I}+10^3{\bf S}^t{\bf S}+{\bf C_r})^{-1}(10^3 {\bf S}^t)$ Let us call result vector $\bf p$ , it will be a probability measure (sums to 1), we can reweigh it nonlinearly, for example $$p_i = \frac{p_i^k}{\sum|p_i|^k}$$ Just calculate scalar product with index vector and round.
