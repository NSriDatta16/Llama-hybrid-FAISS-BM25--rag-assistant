When processing arguments to a command, the PowerShell parser splits adjacent expressions into discrete arguments if the first fragment is a recognizable expression as is the case with $(). Because PowerShell is object-based, we try to preserve object integrity until we absolutely have to render to a string. If you want to force string expansion put double-quotes around the entire argument sequence as one of the other posters suggested. Note that an argument with a leading character like a$x will be treated as if it was a double-quoted string "a$x". This is because the leading characters are not recognized as a valid expression so we default to treating it as an expandable string. -bruce Bruce Payette, Windows PowerShell Team, Microsoft Corp.
