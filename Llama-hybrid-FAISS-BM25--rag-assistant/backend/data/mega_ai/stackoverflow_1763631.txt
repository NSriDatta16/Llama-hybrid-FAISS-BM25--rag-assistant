Easiest way would be to use the serialize function. It serializes any variable for storage or transfer. You can read about it in the php manual - serialize The variable can be restored by using unserialize So in the passing to the URL you use: $url = urlencode(serialize($array)) and to restore the variable you use $var = unserialize(urldecode($_GET['array'])) Be careful here though. The maximum size of a GET request is limited to 4k, which you can easily exceed by passing arrays in a URL. Also, its really not quite the safest way to pass data! You should probably look into using sessions instead.
