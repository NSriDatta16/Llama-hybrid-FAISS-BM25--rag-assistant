Adapted from the Grails User Guide : You can add your own configuration in grails-app/conf/Config.groovy , for example: globalCacheRefreshInterval = 120 Then later in your application you can access these settings in one of two ways. The most common is via the GrailsApplication object, which is available as a variable in controllers and tag libraries: Long interval = grailsApplication.config.globalCacheRefreshInterval The other way involves getting a reference to the ConfigurationHolder class that holds a reference to the configuration object: def config = org.codehaus.groovy.grails.commons.ConfigurationHolder.config Long interval = config.globalCacheRefreshInterval If you want to acess this configuration from a Java class, you can use: import org.codehaus.groovy.grails.commons.ConfigurationHolder; ... Map config = ConfigurationHolder.getFlatConfig(); Long interval = (Long) config.get("globalCacheRefreshInterval"); Attention for the correct type in your Config.groovy . In the case above, your configuration property must be defined as a Long: globalCacheRefreshInterval = 120L
