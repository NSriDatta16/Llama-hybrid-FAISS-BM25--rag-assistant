Auto-Regressional & Moving Average Model Formula Properties

I seeking help in understanding specific values underlying the formula's for the MA(p) model & the AR(q) model. I am attempting to implement the models (building up to the combined ARIMA model) in the programming language Java. I do not come from an overly mathematical (I'm fairly new to statistics at least) background so be gentle. Here is the formula I am using for the AR(p) model: $$X_t - μ = β_1(X_{t-1} - μ) + ... + β_p(X_{t-p} - μ) + Z_t$$ Where $X$ is the time series, $μ$ is the mean of the time series, $β$ is the auto-correlation coefficient at a specific lag, $p$ is the order of the model and $Z$ is white noise of mean $0$ and variance $σ^2$. I'm fairly certain I have the above figured out, however the term "$Z_t$" confuses me. How would I implement this in code? I understand it is "random" however what are its ranges? Surely there must be a maximum and minimum of the term $Z_t$. Is it somehow based on the variance of the overall dataset? How is the "$Z$" value calculated on implementation exactly? Here is the formula I am using for the MA(q) model: $$X_t - μ = Z_t - θ_1(Z_{t-1}) - ... - θ_q(Z_{t-q})$$ Where $X$ is again the time series dataset, $μ$ is the mean of the dataset, $Z$ is white noise with mean 0 and variance $σ^2$, $θ$ is the correlation coefficient at a specific lag and $q$ is the order of the model. Again I the same issue as the above model in regards to the "$Z$" term. Also $θ$ is also the correlation coefficient of the dataset at various different lags, correct? Any help on this matter would be extremely welcomed and if you have any questions I would more than happy to answer them. Any use of examples alongside a full dataset i.e., X = (1,2,3,4,5,6,7) would be also extremely welcomed as it helps me understand the concept much more easily. Also please try to keep the explaination as idiot proof and contained as possible.
