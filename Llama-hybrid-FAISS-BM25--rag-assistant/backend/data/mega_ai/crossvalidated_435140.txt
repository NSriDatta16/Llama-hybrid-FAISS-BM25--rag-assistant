How to understand Generative Adversarial Networks Discriminative distribution?

So I am currently studying Generative Adversarial Network and I read the paper by Goodfellow a few times now Generative Adversarial Nets and a few other papers in this field (DCGAN, CycleGAN, pix2pix, and a few others). But I have been struggling with Figure 1 in this paper and somehow it does not seem to fit in my head! This is what I currently understand: The green line is the distribution we are trying to match. The black line is the current distribution of the training image But I don't really understand the blue line! Why is it sinus-like-form in (a) and why is it a straight line in (d)?
