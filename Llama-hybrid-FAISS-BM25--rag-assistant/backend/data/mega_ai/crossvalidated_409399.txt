Often you can use permutation tests to obtain confidence intervals with appropriate coverage, under particular assumptions. For example, consider the signed rank test (which is a permutation test based on replacing the original absolute differences with their ranks). If (as is usually done), you assume a shift-alternative (along with the typical assumptions like independence and so forth), then you can produce a confidence interval for that shift; it is the set of sample-shifts (shifts of paired-differences) that would not be rejected by the test. If you instead keep to some different class of alternatives, you may be able to produce a confidence interval for the parameter in that situation; I gave an example recently. Similarly you can produce intervals for (say) a location shift in a Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test (another permutation test). [You can't produce an interval in the most general case because these tests typically work for many classes of alternatives.] Similarly, we could have a confidence interval for a population difference in means from a permutation test under a shift alternative (e.g. see John and Robinson, 1983 [1]). I presume the intent of the article is that you can't generate a confidence interval from a permutation test of means in a more general circumstance. [1]: R.D. John & J.
