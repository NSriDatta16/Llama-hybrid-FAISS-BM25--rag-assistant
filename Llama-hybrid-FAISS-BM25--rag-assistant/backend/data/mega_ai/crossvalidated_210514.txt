There are full bayesian formulations for SVMs. Why not using those?. In the case of SVM you may consider Relevance Vector Machines . kNN is not bayesian, and independent of the underlying probability distribution. How to define a prior then?. Bayesian models are generative models, that is, they model a complete pdf from which the data is supposed to be sampled from. Therefore, I find it would be more natural to consider GMM or some other more modern non-parametric technique . The question becomes then on how to determine the optimal number of components. The standard way is to sample from a Dirichlet prior, and then sample from the particular mixture obtained from it.
