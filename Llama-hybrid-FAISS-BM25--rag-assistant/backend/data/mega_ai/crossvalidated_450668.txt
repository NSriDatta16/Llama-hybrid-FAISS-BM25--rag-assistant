It doesn't make much sense to compare coefficients to p-values like you do. This has nothing to do with logistic regression in particular, the same applies to linear regression, so let us use that as an example. If the model is $Y_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x_i + \epsilon_i$ , but then you transform the predictor linearly to $Y_i = \beta_0^* + \beta_1^* (1000000 \cdot x_i) + \epsilon_i$ , then on the same data, $\hat{\beta_1^*} = \hat{\beta_1}/1000000$ . The p-values, will be identical . So trying to interpret coefficients, forgetting about the scale of the predictors, does not make sense.
