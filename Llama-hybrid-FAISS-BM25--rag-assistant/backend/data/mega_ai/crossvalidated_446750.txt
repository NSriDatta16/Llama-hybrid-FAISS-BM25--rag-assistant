It is possible for a-learning to stick in sub optimal loop just like your case where the best action to take in state A take you to state B and the best action in the state B takes you back into state A. I found two solutions for this so far: Keep track of the path you take and avoid returning to the same state or give negative reward if it returns to the same state. You can do it by keeping the whole path or some last parts of the path inside a list and then if an action take you to a state that is already traversed you give negative reward for taking that action. Design a reward system that does not allow you to return to the previous step. This is highly dependant on your problem. For example giving positive reward for a mouse that gets closer to the goal(if an action takes the agent closer to the goal give positive reward for taking that action and otherwise give negative or zero reward) prevents the mouse agent to turn around and return to previous stage.
