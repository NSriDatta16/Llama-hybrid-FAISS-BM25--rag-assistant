Is XHTML really Xtensible?

Is there any way (server- or client-side) that I can actually extend HTML to include new tags? For example, it would be cool if I could write something like a schema fragment that defined a blogpost , which contains a postname , a postauthor , a posttime , and a postcontent , and thereafter refer to blogpost in my HTML rather than resorting to the basic HTML div and p tags.
