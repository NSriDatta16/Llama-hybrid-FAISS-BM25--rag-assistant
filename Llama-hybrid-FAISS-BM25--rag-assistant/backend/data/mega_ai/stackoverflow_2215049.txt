How do I enable IPv6 support in LWP?

The following code ... my $user_agent = LWP::UserAgent->new; my $request = HTTP::Request->new(GET => $url); my $response = $user_agent->request($request); if ($response->is_success) { print "OK\n"; } else { die($response->status_line); } .. will fail with .. 500 Can't connect to (Bad hostname ' ') .. if the hostname in $url is an IPv6 only address (that is: presence of an AAAA record, but no A record). My questions are: How do I enable IPv6 support in LWP? How do I configure LWP's settings for "prefer-IPv4-over-IPv6" ( A vs. AAAA ) / "prefer-IPv6-over-IPv4" ( AAAA vs. A )?
