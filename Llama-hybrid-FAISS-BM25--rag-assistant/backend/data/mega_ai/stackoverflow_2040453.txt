Right now you are only ever checking one value instead of both, if I understand correctly. That is, if the change event of the select element fires, only the select element's value is tested, and if the change event of the text field fires, only the value of the text field is checked. However, you want both to be checked (AND), so I suggest something like this: $('.affector').change(updateRadioEnabled); function updateRadioEnabled() { var valueGiven = true; $('.affector').each( function() { if ($(this).val() == "") { valueGiven = false; } }); var radio = $('.affector:first').parents('tr').find('input:radio'); if (!valueGiven) { radio.attr('disabled', true); } else { radio.removeAttr('disabled'); } } EDIT: Notes: Community wiki is usually for questions that invite for an exchange of opinions in contrast to crisp technical answers. Your question is clearly technical. .affector:first will find the first element with the affector class and then stop searching. I often do this for efficiency (however see Brandon's comment below). Here, I simply select this element to have a starting point from which to find the radio buttons. There is probably a more elegant solution. EDIT: By the way, why is this community wiki?
