To some extent the reasoning is correct- certain cloud resources, like Azure Table storage, don't have a feature-for-feature counterpart in the non-hosted world. That said, most of what Azure does for you can be replicated with a combination of databases, queues (like MSMQ or Tibco), network filesystems, etc. NoSQL databases like HBase provide the scalability of a hosted cloud on your own infrastructure, but they will require revisiting some of the assumptions that you have made about data access. Microsoft also markets an appliance for a private cloud which replicates the Azure environment locally. In the end, the amount of effort involved in moving between the cloud and a non-hosted environment comes down to how well your code is factored, particularly in the areas of data access and interprocess communication.
