I got it working after re-doing everything and then creating an empty project with XCode and building/running it to the device. XCode showed a window asking something like: Do you want to accept the developer certificate. I pressed "Always". Only after this step I got rid of the message "A valid signing identity matching this profile could not be found in your keychain" in Organizer.
