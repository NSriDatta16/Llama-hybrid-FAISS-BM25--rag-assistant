PCA, reverse coding, TIPI questionnaire used as predictor, ANOVA vs Multiple Regression

I am in the process of analyzing a questionnaire measuring attitudes: recording as predictors 1) gender, 2) religion, AND 3) the 10-item personality inventory (TIPI, 2003); dependent variables should be the scores recorded in 4 different Likert-scale questionnaire (1=agree strongly, 4=disagree strongly). Some items are reverse-coded via the "transform"-"recode to different variables" option on SPSS, and so are the negatives in the TIPI questionnaire. 1) what type of factor analysis would be appropriate? 2) should I factor analyse the TIPI? 3) how do I continue? (very generic, I know, but I could use some serious help!)
