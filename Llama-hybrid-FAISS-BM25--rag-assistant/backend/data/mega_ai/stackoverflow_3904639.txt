The spec says there can only be one action attribute on a form. This makes sense, as the action attribute specifies the page the form data will be posted to and posting it to two different pages makes not sense (how are you to see the results from more than one page?). If you look at the DTD fragment defining the FORM element from the spec : You will see that the action attribute is a. required, b. does not have a multiple specifier, meaning it should only exist once. It is probably only by chance that this works in IE. The behaviour is not defined, and another browser might either choke on this input or decide to pick a random action attribute.
