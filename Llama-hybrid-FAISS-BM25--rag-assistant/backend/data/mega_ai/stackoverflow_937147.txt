Recurrent neural networks (of which hopfield nets are a special type) are used for several tasks in sequence learning: Sequence Prediction (Map a history of stock values to the expected value in the next timestep) Sequence classification (Map each complete audio snippet to a speaker) Sequence labelling (Map an audio snippet to the sentence spoken) Non-markovian reinforcement learning (e.g. tasks that require deep memory as the T-Maze benchmark) I am not sure what you mean by "pattern recognition" exactly, since it basically is a whole field into which each task for which neural networks can be used fits.
