Simple ACF Plots for different time series

I am trying to find which lag of variable x has the highest correlation with variable y. I know that ACF plots are for the the same time series on itself, but is there anything wrong with looking at an "ACF" plot with two different time series to figure out which lag should be regressed onto the other variable?
