Steganography is really about data hiding, regardless of whether the data being hidden, or the thing providing cover is an image. Any data format that has enough redundancy can be used. The X86 instruction set is a good example. Other places include unused portions of a file system. You are correct that in using an image to store hidden data that the low order color bits are the right place to store them. However, I would recommend against trying to correlate pixels between the images though. Most image formats offer some sort of compression from raw pixel presentations. It would be better to read the bit stream of the hidden image directly from the file system, and correlate those bits with pixels in the host image. That will require smaller host images.
