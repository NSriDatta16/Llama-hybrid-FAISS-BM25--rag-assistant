ANOVA with two factor within subjects design

So i'm currently frustrating about this method of doing a two-factor repeated measures within subject anova (AxBxS-Design). As there is no straight forward way of using a simple scipy call for my design, i was happy to find some step-by-step instructions in Keppels "Design and Analysis" book. (page 464) He uses a "simple" method of calculating the sum of squares, but i can't find this method described anywhere else. The big problem that i have right now is, that i receive a negative sum of squares for the ABS Source calculated like this. All the data is organized like this: I'm confused right now how i should proceed. I can't really find tools online that help me with my design. I'm i correct that SS_ABS = Sum(x-mean(x))? Also what is wrong with the method? I did actually recalculate a lot by hand to see if i did something wrong but can't find any errors.
