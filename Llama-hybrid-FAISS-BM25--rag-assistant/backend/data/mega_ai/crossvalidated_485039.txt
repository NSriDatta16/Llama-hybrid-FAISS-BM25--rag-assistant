I think the problem lies with the choice to use seasonal_decompose from statsmodels. It is a very naive implementation (it even says so in their documentation!) The trend component is a moving average which typically eats a lot of extra signal up and it doesn't handle multiple seasonal signals. I would look into something that handles multiple seasonalities naturally like fbProphet or some other GAM setup. For general purpose time series clustering I probably wouldn't reinvent the wheel, there are time series feature extraction libraries out there (like tsfresh for python) and a lot come with clustering as an additional feature.
