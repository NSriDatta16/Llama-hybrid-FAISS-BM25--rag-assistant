set" are often treated by engineers and computer scientists as interchangeable expressions. Subsequently Zadeh played a decisive role in developing the field of fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets and fuzzy systems, with a large number of influential scholarly papers. Unlike most philosophical theories of vagueness and unlike rival theories of many-valued logic, Zadeh's engineering approach had the great advantage that it could be directly applied to computer programming. Zadeh's seminal 1965 paper is acknowledged to be one of the most-cited scholarly articles in the 20th century. In 2014, it was placed 46th in the list of the world's 100 most-cited research papers of all time. Zadeh's peers called him "one of the most prominent computer scientists of all-time". Since the mid-1960s, many scholars have contributed to elaborating the theory of reasoning with graded concepts, and the research field continues to expand; new methods and applications of fuzzy logic are being invented all the time. Definition The ordinary scholarly definition of a concept as "fuzzy" has been in use from the 1970s onward. Criteria Radim Bělohlávek explains: "There exists strong evidence, established in the 1970s in the psychology of concepts... that human concepts have a graded structure in that whether or not a concept applies to a given object is a matter of degree, rather than a yes-or-no question, and that people are capable of working with the degrees in a consistent way. This finding is intuitively quite appealing, because people say "this product is more or less good" or "to a certain degree, he is a good athlete", implying the graded structure of concepts. In his classic paper, Zadeh called the concepts with a graded structure fuzzy concepts and argued that these concepts are a rule rather than an exception when it comes to how people communicate knowledge. Moreover, he argued that to model such concepts mathematically is important for the tasks of control, decision making, pattern recognition, and the like. Zadeh proposed the notion of a fuzzy set that gave birth to the field of fuzzy logic..." Hence, a concept is generally regarded as "fuzzy" in a logical sense if: defining characteristics of the concept apply to it "to a certain degree or extent" (or, more unusually, "with a certain magnitude of likelihood"). or, the boundaries of applicability (the truth-value) of a concept can vary in degrees, according to different conditions. or, the fuzzy concept itself straightforwardly consists of a fuzzy set, or a combination of such sets. The fact that a concept is fuzzy does not prevent its use in logical reasoning; it merely affects the type of reasoning which can be applied (see fuzzy logic). If the concept has gradations of meaningful significance, it may be necessary to specify and formalize what those gradations are, if they can make an important difference. Not all fuzzy concepts have the same logical structure, but they can often be formally described or reconstructed using fuzzy logic or other substructural logics. The advantage of this approach is, that numerical notation enables a potentially infinite number of truth-values between complete truth and complete falsehood, and thus it enables — in theory, at least — the greatest precision in stating the degree of applicability of a logical rule. Fuzziness versus uncertainty One of the first scholars who pointed out the need to distinguish the theory of fuzzy sets from probability theory was Zadeh's pupil Joseph Goguen. Petr Hájek, writing about the foundations of fuzzy logic, likewise sharply distinguished between "fuzziness" and "uncertainty": "The sentence "The patient is young" is true to some degree – the lower the age of the patient (measured e.g. in years), the more the sentence is true. Truth of a fuzzy proposition is a matter of degree. I recommend to everybody interested in fuzzy logic that they sharply distinguish fuzziness from uncertainty as a degree of belief (e.g. probability). Compare th
