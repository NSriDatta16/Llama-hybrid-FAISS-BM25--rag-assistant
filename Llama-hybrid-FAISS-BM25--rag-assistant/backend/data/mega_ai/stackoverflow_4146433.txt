If you want to do it in a simplistic way, you could leverage the DataSet class to read your xml, and then use a Data View Filter. DataSet ds = new DataSet(); ds.ReadXml(@"C:\so.xml"); DataTable dt = ds.Tables[0]; DataView dv = dt.DefaultView; dv.RowFilter = "Your Row Filter" //"MessageNumber<>4567" or construct a filter using //a helper //Bind dv to grid ?? Again once you have your data in a dataset you can do all kinds of things, like selective display of columns, I'm not sure if you wanted to filter the data from a query perspective or "hide" data from view with it still being present
