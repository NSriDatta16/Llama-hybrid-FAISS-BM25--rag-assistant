From what You are describing, You need SQLCMD utility. Connect to any server using the credentials it accepts (I usually use -E which represents windows authentication) and execute whatever scripts YOu need. If You are not trusted there, create an account with sufficient credentials. The question is: What is the trigger of this script to execute? Do YOu execute it manually, or should it fire up automatically. In this case You are bound to write some code to achieve that (not very difficult though). And You can leverage powershell built into SQL Server 2008 which can operate on objects on ANY server You can connect to (with your credentials). Look into that. It has a cmdlet Invoke-Sqlcmd which helps a TON. luke
