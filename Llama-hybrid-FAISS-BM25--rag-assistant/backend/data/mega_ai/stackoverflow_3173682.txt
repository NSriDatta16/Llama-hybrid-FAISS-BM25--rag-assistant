How to create high-resolution iphone launch image?

As per the Apple iPhone Human Interface Guidelines I have created a Default.png image which is displayed while waiting for the application to load. I created the image using the xcode organizer 'capture screenshot' feature. I am now preparing my application for the iphone 4 high resolution screen and am wondering how to create the high resolution version of Default.png. Is there a way to generate it from a screen shot like the standard Default.png image?
