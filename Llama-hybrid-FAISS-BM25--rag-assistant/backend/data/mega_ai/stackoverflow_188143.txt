I have to disagree with the recommendation of Physics for Game Developers. I found that book pretty boring, and I wouldn't call my own attention span that short. I would say the top things to get good at are vectors, using trig to manipulate them, and then on top of that foundation you apply whatever physics are specific to your current project. I'd just fire up google/wikipedia and start bouncing around the web soaking up random stuff, and when your limited attention span gets antsy, bounce again. Taking on that book is probably not going to suck you in and inspire you.
