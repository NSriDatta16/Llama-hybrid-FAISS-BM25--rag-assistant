Curious to Know what Eclipse 'Show Heap Status' does

In Eclipse (I am using 3.4 Ganymede) there is an option under Preferences>General>Show Heap Status which when checked shows near bottom of IDE like 46M of 98M and if we move the mouse over 'Recycle Bin' it says ' Run Garbage Collector '. I am curoius to know how this works.What will happen when 'Run Garbage Collector' is clicked. My enivroment set up is something like jdk6 is insatlled and IDE used for development and run in Tomcat server. So my understanding is all the objects which are run through Tomcat should be garbage collected. Is this correct. Is there a way to see what objects Eclipse identified as Garbage Cheers
