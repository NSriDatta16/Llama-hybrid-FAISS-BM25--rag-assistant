How can i find the accurcy for time series?

I have to work for the first time with time series and I have some question about this interesting field of machine learning. What I have to do: I should make a forecast for quantity for some special good in the future. I should predict, that this good is available e.g. in next week in our shop or not. My Methods are Prophet and ARIMA and fitting method by ARIMA is bfgs My Questions: 1- How can is find the accuracy of my forecasting? Does something like R2-Score for regression but for time series in scikit-learn? 2- Shall I calculate the accuracy with RMSE? I mean that should I first calculate the MSE and after that sqrt(MSE)? 3- If the answer of 2 is YES, how should be the RMSE for a good forecasting? Big or Small? 4- How can I compare the accuracy of both models together? 5- Which method is suitable for small data (400-800) univariable?
