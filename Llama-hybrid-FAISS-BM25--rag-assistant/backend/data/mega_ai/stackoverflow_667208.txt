Database schema confusion

I'm having a slight terminology meltdown as I design some classes. In Sql Server 2005, 'schema' refers to a namespace, and an organizational system for database objects. But for relational databases in general, 'schema' means the DDL design of tables, fields, etc. If I'm right about this, it explains a lot of the dissonance when I am trying to read microsoft documentation, and understand the various data access APIs. Can you explain what's going on here, is there really that much difference in the definition of 'schema'?
