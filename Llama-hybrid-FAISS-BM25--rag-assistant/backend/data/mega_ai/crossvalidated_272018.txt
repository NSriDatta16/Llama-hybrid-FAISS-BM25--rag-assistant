As noted in the comments, multivariate analysis isn't possible here. When the dependent variable is ordinal (as yours is) then ordinal logistic regression is a good starting point, at least, but it makes an assumption of proportional odds. If that assumption is violated, then the most common choice is multinomial logistic regression, but there are some other choices too, such as the partial proportional odds model. You might also try a tree, or one of the methods based on trees.
