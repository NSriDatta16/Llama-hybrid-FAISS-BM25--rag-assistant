Not the most elegant solution, but it works (in MySQL - I don't use Oracle, so I hope it works for you!): SELECT tracking_no FROM yourtable WHERE id_value = 10 AND tracking_no-1 NOT IN (SELECT tracking_no FROM yourtable WHERE id_value=10) UNION SELECT tracking_no FROM yourtable WHERE id_value = 10 AND tracking_no+1 NOT IN (SELECT tracking_no FROM yourtable WHERE id_value=10) ORDER BY tracking_no
