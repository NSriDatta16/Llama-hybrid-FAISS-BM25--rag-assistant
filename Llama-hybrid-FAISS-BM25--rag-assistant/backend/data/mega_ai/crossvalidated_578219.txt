What is the average bias in MLE of 2-component univariate Gaussian mixture model?

Imagine that you have a standard 2-component univariate Gaussian mixture model: $$p(x_i∣θ)=(1-λ)N(x_i|μ_1,σ_1^2 )+λN(x_i|μ_2,σ_2^2 )$$ $$θ=\{μ_1,μ_2,σ_1,σ_2,λ\}$$ $$L(θ;x)=∏_{i=1}^N p(x_i |θ)$$ The posterior distribution of parameters can then be obtained using the Bayes rule, and either the mean or the maximum of the posterior can be used as an estimate. If the parameters are unknown, they can be estimated by standard solutions like MLE using the EM algorithm (which for uniform priors will match the MAP). However, when the number of observations is small and the distributions are not well separated, the estimates will be biased (e.g., https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4257062/ ). The average bias can of course be estimated through simulations but is there a way to do so analytically for either the maximum or mean of the posterior (with uniform priors)? I am particularly interested in biases for the means $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ .
