How to replicate the ipod configuration screen in a iphone app?

I need to replicate the ipod configuration screen functionality, but have no idea how to do it. Let me explain : My App has several viewControllers, but only 5 are shown. When the user hits the MORE tab, it will show all the available Views . If he clicks on the EDIT button, the screen will show a bunch of tab-bar items, ( icon+title), which he can drag to the tabbar, and change it dynamically. How can i accomplish this ? My problem is not how to change the tabbar, but how to show the icons on the screen and (probably) use some drag'n'drop functionality.
