Comparison among 3 paired data sets. (paired t-test, ANOVA?)

I measured 30 samples each with 3 devices. The devices are the same make and model, just different units. How do I statistically test if the devices measurements are the same or not? If I had two data sets to compare, a simple paired t-test works great. I've read that running three paired t-tests (1vs2, 2vs3, and 3vs1) separately to draw conclusions is incorrect...the familywise error is higher than the error of the individual comparisons. But when I set-up ANOVA it doesn't pair the data by sample, it just lumps everything into a single average, and the effect of each device is lost. So what test do I use?
