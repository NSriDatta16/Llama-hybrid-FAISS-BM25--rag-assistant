There is no built-in way to ensure objects are not reused, but I can think of a number of ways you can try to encourage it. All of thse could be gotten around if the user wanted to. If the object has a single method that you call on it one time, then you can set a "state" inside the object when it's created, then you set the state to a "used" state after you call the method. This has various problems, but is a possible solution. You can force the user to "get a token" to use the object. Then, when the object is used they have to pass that token, the object then compares the token to a "used token" list and only allows it to function if it's not there. Again, the problem is that it basically only works if you have a single method you only call once. Call dispose inside the object itself, essentially destorying whatever resources you create, so a second use would throw exceptions...
