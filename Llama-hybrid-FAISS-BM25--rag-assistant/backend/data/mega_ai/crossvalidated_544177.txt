Highly Correlated Datasets - Why and What Next?

I've got three datasets (of different biological data) that are highly correlated - such that if I use the typical findCorrelation from the caret package with a cutoff of 0.99 , then 5000 predictors are removed from one with 8000, another loses 648 from 654, and the last loses 645 from around 700. My questions are these: How can I examine my data to understand why they could be highly correlated? Should I remove my data that is very highly correlated, even if it means the removal of nearly all data (a cutoff of 0.75 would remove everything, therefore 0.99 seems a better option)? And finally, if I'm subjecting my data to analysis with PLS or PCA methods do I even need to remove highly correlated features at all? Hope someone can help out, thanks for reading!
