It's not possible, really. I mean, lets consider that a given page can be shown in both English and French at the same time. Perhaps you want to get something like the request-language in JavaScript. I think something like this may be available in the user-agent string, which you can get (infact, perhaps the object has the request-language directly in it somewhere). Of course, even if you do get this, it doesn't mean the page is in that language. Given that you are the server, and you know what language you rendered in (hopefully) you can just pass this information to JavaScript via some variable.
