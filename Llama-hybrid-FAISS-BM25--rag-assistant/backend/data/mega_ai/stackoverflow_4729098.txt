How can I average number of items in our SQLite database by 24-hour period?

Trying to create a report for our support ticketing system and I'm trying to have 2 results in the report that show a rolling average of how many tickets were opened in a day and how many were closed in a day. Basically, query the entire tickets table, separate out everything by individual days that the tickets were created on, count the number tickets for each individual day, then average that number. My friend gave me this query: SELECT AVG(ticket_count) FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) AS ticket_count FROM tickets GROUP BY DATE(created_at, '%Y'), DATE(created_at, '%m'), DATE(created_at, '%d')) AS ticket_part But it's not seeming to work for me. All I get is a single result with the number of tickets created last year.
