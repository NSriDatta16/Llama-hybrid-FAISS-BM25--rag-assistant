Make tabpage not process mousewheel events (C#)

I have made a MDI (tabbed) application that uses PictureBoxes inside TabPages. The picturebox is sometimes larger then the tabpage, so scrollbars appear. It is written in C# using Windows Forms. Inside my tabpage, I capture and process mouse wheel events in the MouseWheel event (i use it to rotate some objects I draw in the picturebox). But when I have the scrollbars, when I rotate the mouse wheel, my objects rotate, but the tabpage also scrolls down. How can I make the tabpage not process the mousewheel event, and thus make it not scroll down? I want it to only be scrollable if the user clicks and drags on the scrollbar.
