Monthly realized variance, different number of observations per month

The monthly realized variance is usually computed as: $\sum_{i=1}^n (r_i-\bar{r})^2$, where $\bar{r}$ denotes the average return of the month, or as $\sum_{i=1}^n r_i^2$ (I am not sure which definition is more common). In any case, with this definition, is there not a problem in that estimates for different months cannot be compared due to a different number of observations per month? If so, how is this usually accounted for? Edit: To clarify: I have daily observations, out of which I want to calculate monthly estimates of the realized volatility.
