Is static data member typed its container type possible in C++?

I was used something like this in C# or other languages. // C#, but I can't remember correctly. Just assume like a pseudo code. class A { public int b; public A(int newB) { b = newB } public static const A a1 = A(1); public static const A a2 = A(2); public static const A a3 = A(3); } Is there equivalent of this in C++? Or any recommended way to do this? I do this for just to organize a1 , a2 , a3 within its class name.
