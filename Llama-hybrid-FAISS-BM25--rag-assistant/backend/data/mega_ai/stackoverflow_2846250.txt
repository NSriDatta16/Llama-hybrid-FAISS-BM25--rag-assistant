As Robert Harvey mentioned in his comment, this isn't usually a problem in practice. It's possible that the scrrun.dll may either not be installed or is not registered correctly on a given machine though. We've encountered both scenarios when installing our own VB6 application on customer's machines. As for scripting being disabled, we've actually run into this problem with other applications (such as Microsoft InfoPath), and got around the issue by having the InfoPath form (which needed to do some file I/O) call out to a VB6 DLL that used the WSH FileSystemObject , so if anything, you can actually work around script security problems by using the library in conjunction with VB6. As far as I know, WSH security settings apply specifically to actual scripts, not to programs that happen to use components from the scripting runtime. In fact, you can completely disable the Windows Scipt Host on your machine , and still access the WSH components, such as FileSystemObject , from a VB6 application.
