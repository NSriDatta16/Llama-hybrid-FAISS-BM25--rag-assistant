How do you interpret the cross-entropy value?

In machine learning, cross-entropy is often used while training a neural network. During my training of my neural network, I track the accuracy and the cross entropy. The accuracy is pretty low, so I know that my network isn't performing well. But what can I say about my model knowing the cross-entropy?
