There is an operator that knows about basic_ostream instances (such as cout ) on the left-hand-side and const char* s on the right. There is no such operator defined for const int* (or const int[] ). Although you are perfectly at liberty to create one. Just be sure to specify a sentinel at the end of your arrays to prevent running off the end of your buffer. The reason you see the pointer value is because there is an basic_ostream::operator which will print this.
