One can use a paired t-test . As you can see in the link, the paired t-test is a comparison of differences, and that is indeed the appropriate test to perform, under one condition. That is, one should check to make sure that the difference between data pairs is not non-normally distributed. The paired t-test calculates the average difference between samples (which is also the difference of averages, but that is actually not as relevant.) Then, that average difference is divided by the standard error to make the t-statistic. That t-statistic is then the deviation from zero difference, so looking up what that statistic means in terms of probability, gives the likelihood of no difference. If the paired differences are not normally distributed, then one can attempt to transform the data, by taking logs, square-roots, reciprocals and so forth of the original data sets to attempt to find a fairly normal difference histogram, or, one can just use a Wilcoxon signed-rank test , which, as it creates normal conditions by ranking the data, does not need normal conditions in the data itself.
