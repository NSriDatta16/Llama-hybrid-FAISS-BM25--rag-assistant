Using Eclipse C++ CDT in Linux

I want to use Eclipse to develop C++ projects on Linux. Particularly I want to modify stable and widely used open source projects using the Eclipse CDT. One of them is Intel Opencv. There are tutorials to create simple c++ projects like here: http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/opensource/library/os-eclipse-stlcdt/ . I have seen plenty of tutorials for using Eclipse CDT to write programs in OpenCv like here: http://opencv.willowgarage.com/wiki/Eclipse http://tommy.chheng.com/development/windows_development_setup.html http://tommy.chheng.com/index.php/2009/05/opencv-with-eclipse-on-windows/ However I want to use Eclipse to make changes to the OpenCv platform itself and compile it from there. I really like many of Eclipse's features like: Syntax highlighting Outline Code assist Code templates Code history etc. Would someone write a small tutorial on how one can make a project in Eclipse from the OpenCv tarball? I would use Eclipse CDT on Linux. Can Eclipse CDT recognize Makefile as it can do for Ant scripts?
