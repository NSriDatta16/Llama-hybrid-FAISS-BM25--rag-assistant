@Srihari's answer works well but pays attention to the indention of the 'return'. Currently, it is written as follows: def perf_measure(..., ...): for i in range(...): if(): ... return (FP, TN, ...) This return: "SyntaxError: 'return' outside function ". The normal indement should be: def perf_measure(..., ...): for i in range(...): if(): ... return (FP, TN, ...)
