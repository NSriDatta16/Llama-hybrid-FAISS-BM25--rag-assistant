Distribution of the average of multivariate normals?

I have seen that the sum of $n$ iid multivariate normal vectors (mean $\mu$ and variance $\Sigma$ ), $X_1+\dots+X_n$ , is distributed as a normal with mean $n\mu$ and variance $n\Sigma$ . Is the distribution of the average $\frac{X_1+\dots+X_n}{n}$ a multivariate normal with mean $\mu$ and variance $\Sigma/n$ ?
