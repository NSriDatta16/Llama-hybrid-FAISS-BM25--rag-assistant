Mishal, per your comment on CocoaFu's answer I mean whenever i launch my application at that time it will generate the different tokens for that device or not? And if it generates the different tokens than how to handle it in the proper way? This paragraph in the iOS doc is helpful in understanding when device tokens can change on a user's device, and why you fire it every time the app launches: By requesting the device token and passing it to the provider every time your application launches, you help to ensure that the provider has the current token for the device. If a user restores a backup to a device other than the one that the backup was created for (for example, the user migrates data to a new device), he or she must launch the application at least once for it to receive notifications again. If the user restores backup data to a new device or reinstalls the operating system, the device token changes. Moreover, never cache a device token and give that to your provider; always get the token from the system whenever you need it. If your application has previously registered, calling registerForRemoteNotificationTypes: results in iOS passing the device token to the delegate immediately without incurring additional overhead.
