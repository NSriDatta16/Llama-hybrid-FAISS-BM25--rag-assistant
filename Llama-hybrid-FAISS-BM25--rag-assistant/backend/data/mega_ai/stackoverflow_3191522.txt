Jquery - mousedown function with multiple class elements

Im super new to Jquery so this may be a quick one. I have a mousedown function on a class named "thumb_resize". I have multiple divs named thumb_resize. So, the first time the mousedown function gets called it works perfectly, but it breaks when I try to call it from another element. Maybe its easier if I show you: http://www.barrylachapelle.com/stuff/new_site/drag_test2.html If you grab an arrow on one of the thumbnails and drag it, itll blow the image up. If you let go it animates back to its original position. Great, happy with that. But if you try it a second time on another thumbnail it animates the first as well. Any ideas? Cheers all.
