Concerning the tool NDepend it comes with 82 different code metric, from Number of Lines of Code, to Method Rank (popularity), Cyclomatic Complexity, Lack of Cohesion of Methods, Percentage Coverage (extracted from NCover or VSTS), Depth of Inheritance... With its rule system, NDepend can also find issues and estimates technical debt which is an interesting code metric (amount of dev-effort to fix problems vs. amount of dev-time spoiled per year to let problems unfixed). All these metrics are detailled here .
