I fixed this today...sort of. Although the archives still don't show up anywhere. But I got the Archive option back by going into Build Settings for the project and re-assigning my certs under "Code Signing Identity" for each build. They seemed to have gotten reset to something else when imported my 3.X project to 4. I also used the instructions found here: http://developer.apple.com/library/mac/#documentation/ToolsLanguages/Conceptual/Xcode4UserGuide/DistApps/DistApps.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010215-CH11-DontLinkElementID_69 But I still can't get the actual archives to show up in Organizer (even though the files exist)
