Another factor you should pay attention to is application bitness. On Windows x64, your x86 build will look for the registry keys under (in regedit) "SOFTWARE\WOW6432Node\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Client", when you specify (in code) "Software\Microsoft\MSSQLServer\Client" That's a WOW64 redirection for registry keys. As Visual Studio 2010 by default creates exe in x86 mode, you should pay attention to this tip.
