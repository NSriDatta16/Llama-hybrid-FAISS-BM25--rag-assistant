You can use followig approximation (since 1 mile is much smaller than the radius of the earth) to calculate the distances from your base: dx = cos(phi_base) * (theta - theta_base) dy = phi - phi_base dist = sqrt(dx*dx+dy*dy) with: phi = latitude and theta = longitude The result is in units of 60 nautical miles if theta and phi are given in degrees. The results will be quite wrong for points that have a latitude that is much different from your base latitude, but this doesn't matter if you just want to know wich points are about 1 mile from your base. For most programming languages you have to convert phi_base to radians (multiply by pi/180) in order to use it for cos() . (Attention: You have to take special care if your base longitude is very close to 180° or -180°, but probably that is not the case :-) Use the calculated distances as sorting key to sort your points. If you have to be more exact (e.g. if you want to know all points that are about 2000 miles from your home), than you must use the formula for Great Circle Distance to calculate the exact distance of two points on a sphere.
