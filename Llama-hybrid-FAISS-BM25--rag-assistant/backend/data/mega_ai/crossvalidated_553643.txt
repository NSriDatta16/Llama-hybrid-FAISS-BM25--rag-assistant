I don't completely understand the concept of PCA analysis

First of all, PCA analysis is not something I came across in my economics studies. But, recently, I wanted to make a PCA analysis of American GDP. I started to read about the fundamentals of PCA and played around with it in R. Now, I have finally produced a result that can make one period ahead forecast. I thought: "Great - now I could use the PCA analysis and find the variables that explain most of the variation in GDP and sort them out. I want to know which variables have the most influence". For example: Does consumer spending explain more of the variation in GDP than, let's say, imports of goods and services. But then I recalled: As far as I understand, the PCA analysis takes the original variables and replaces them with latent components. So my thought is more a matter of correlation - not the PCA analysis itself. Is this problem more suited for a partial least squares regression PLS analysis?
