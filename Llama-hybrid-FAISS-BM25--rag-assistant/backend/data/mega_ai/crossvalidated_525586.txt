The plug-in estimator of Shannon entropy suffers from an inherent bias that is worse with smaller samples. See this answer and its links for details. That's particularly the case if some species were present at a zone/site in some years and not in other years, as an absent species doesn't enter the entropy calculation. So averaging individual Shannon entropy values for the 4 years might not be a good idea. If, based on your knowledge of the subject matter, you can treat the 4 years effectively as replicates, then a more reliable estimate of Shannon entropy for a zone/site would come from combining all the data from the 4 years first. Usually, the closer you are to modeling the original data observations the better off you will be. In your case, that would be the counts of members of species as functions of zone/site and other predictors, possibly handled as a Poisson regression or other count-based model. That combines information from all your data to get smoother overall estimates. Then you could use the model estimates of species counts (with their error estimates) to estimate the Shannon entropies (and their associated error estimates), instead of the individual Shannon entropy estimates with their built-in bias.
