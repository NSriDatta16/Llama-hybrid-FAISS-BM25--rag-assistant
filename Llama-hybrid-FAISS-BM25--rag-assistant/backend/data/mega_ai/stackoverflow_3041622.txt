Is it possible to query the Magento database and display product attributes outside Magento?

I am building a site that needs to display some product info from a Magento Database, but display it on another page/site outside the Magento intallation. I know the information gets displayed twice, but I would like the site to avoid content duplication and pull that same info from an only source, the Magento product database. Is this posible? Has anyone done it?
