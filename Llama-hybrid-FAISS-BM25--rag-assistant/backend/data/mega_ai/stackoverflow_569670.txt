Option 1 and 2 are not mutually exclusive and you should do both. A foreign key constraint on the organization helps ensure that your organization keys are valid. A composite primary key is the only way to achieve uniqueness, unless you want to re-key all your records, and it is also valuable for lookup performance. Alternatively, you'd have to create a new primary key column on the combined data, an identity column, for instance. Such a change would likely require more changes in other places.
