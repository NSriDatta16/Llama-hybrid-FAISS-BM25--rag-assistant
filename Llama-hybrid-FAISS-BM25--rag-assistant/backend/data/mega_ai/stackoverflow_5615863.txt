Edited (inspired by The Tin Man's suggestion) A hack will be: class String def titlecase gsub(/(?:_|\b)(.)/){$1.upcase} end end p "john mark McMillan".titlecase # => "John Mark McMillan" Note that the string 'john mark McMillan' is inconsistent in capitalization, and is somewhat unexpected as a human input, or if it is not from a human input, you probably should not have the strings stored in that way. A string like 'john mark mc_millan' is more consistent, and would more likely appear as a human input if you define such convention. My answer will handle these cases as well: p "john mark mc_millan".titlecase # => "John Mark McMillan"
