Cocoa Touch behavior for events

I have been over the iPhone Programming Guide several times regarding the behavior of when the event methods are called in an app. From what the guide says: touchesBegan is called when a finger first touches the screen. touchesMoved is called when a finger on the screen moves. touchesEnded is called when a finger lifts off the screen. The issue becomes a little clouded with multiple fingers are involved: Even with the Multi-touch Interaction flag set to NO, the app continues to call the touchesBegan method of a view that is currently tracking another touch. This seems counter intuitive to me. Is this the correct behavior? I would think that a new UITouch (even added to the current event being tracked) would not trigger the touchesBegan method. Of note, I set this flag in IB as well as programatically to make sure I wasn't missing something. Thanks, Corey
