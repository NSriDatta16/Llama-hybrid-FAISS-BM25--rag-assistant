ior. Approaches such as active learning and semi-supervised reward learning can reduce the amount of human supervision needed. Another approach is to train a helper model ("reward model") to imitate the supervisor's feedback. But when a task is too complex to evaluate accurately, or the human supervisor is vulnerable to deception, it is the quality, not the quantity, of supervision that needs improvement. To increase supervision quality, a range of approaches aim to assist the supervisor, sometimes by using AI assistants. Christiano developed the Iterated Amplification approach, in which challenging problems are (recursively) broken down into subproblems that are easier for humans to evaluate. Iterated Amplification was used to train AI to summarize books without requiring human supervisors to read them. Another proposal is to use an assistant AI system to point out flaws in AI-generated answers. To ensure that the assistant itself is aligned, this could be repeated in a recursive process: for example, two AI systems could critique each other's answers in a "debate", revealing flaws to humans. OpenAI plans to use such scalable oversight approaches to help supervise superhuman AI and eventually build a superhuman automated AI alignment researcher. These approaches may also help with the following research problem, honest AI. Honest AI A growing area of research focuses on ensuring that AI is honest and truthful. Language models such as GPT-3 can repeat falsehoods from their training data, and even confabulate new falsehoods. Such models are trained to imitate human writing as found in millions of books' worth of text from the Internet. But this objective is not aligned with generating truth, because Internet text includes such things as misconceptions, incorrect medical advice, and conspiracy theories. AI systems trained on such data therefore learn to mimic false statements. Additionally, AI language models often persist in generating falsehoods when prompted multiple times. They can generate empty explanations for their answers, and produce outright fabrications that may appear plausible. Research on truthful AI includes trying to build systems that can cite sources and explain their reasoning when answering questions, which enables better transparency and verifiability. Researchers at OpenAI and Anthropic proposed using human feedback and curated datasets to fine-tune AI assistants such that they avoid negligent falsehoods or express their uncertainty. As AI models become larger and more capable, they are better able to falsely convince humans and gain reinforcement through dishonesty. For example, large language models increasingly match their stated views to the user's opinions, regardless of the truth. GPT-4 can strategically deceive humans. To prevent this, human evaluators may need assistance (see § Scalable oversight). Researchers have argued for creating clear truthfulness standards, and for regulatory bodies or watchdog agencies to evaluate AI systems on these standards. Researchers distinguish truthfulness and honesty. Truthfulness requires that AI systems only make objectively true statements; honesty requires that they only assert what they believe is true. There is no consensus as to whether current systems hold stable beliefs, but there is substantial concern that present or future AI systems that hold beliefs could make claims they know to be false—for example, if this would help them efficiently gain positive feedback (see § Scalable oversight) or gain power to help achieve their given objective (see Power-seeking). Alignment faking Many recent AI systems have learned to deceive without being programmed to do so. Some argue that if we can make AI systems assert only what they believe is true, this would avert many alignment problems. A misaligned system might create the false impression that it is aligned, to avoid being modified or decommissioned—a tactic called "alignment faking". In 2024, researchers observ
