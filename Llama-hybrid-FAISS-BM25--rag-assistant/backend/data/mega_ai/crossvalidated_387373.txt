glmer post hoc test at each time point

I have a question about post hoc tests for glmer. I haven't been able to find a solution on this site or in the documentation. My experiment looks at repeated measures of flower counts (Total) across time (Day) on plants of 6 different genetic lines (RIL) and in 4 different treatments. The treatments are heat events at different time points (Control, Early, Peak, Late). To analyze the flower production across time, I have separated data into comparing one treatment to the control after the heat event occurred. Here is a subset of my data from this example, if that helps: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sOZi28PD5ruEFUgneB3kD1gcB0Xkx54TJNHc8XtdBxI/edit?usp=sharing head(ec.a) Plant Total Treatment Day RIL 85 2 Early 19 206 85 5 Early 21 206 85 15 Early 23 206 85 15 Early 25 206 85 29 Early 27 206 85 67 Early 29 206 m2 I would like to compare flower production (Total) at each Day for the Treatment / RIL combinations. I imagine having an output like this, and I could contrast the genetic lines too. This way I could see exactly when the control and early flower production was the same, and then if there was a specific Day when they started to produce differently. Day contrast (Treatment) 1 Control - Early 2 Control - Early 3 Control - Early ---- 39 Control - Early 40 Control - Early My problem is when I run a post hoc test, it averages Day, as shown below. emmeans(m2.factor, list(pairwise ~ Treatment|Day), adjust = "tukey") $`emmeans of Treatment | Day` Day = 30.99449: Treatment emmean SE df asymp.LCL asymp.UCL Control 0.1278923 0.3325298 Inf -0.5238542 0.7796387 Early 2.1599346 0.3294519 Inf 1.5142207 2.8056485 I've also tried summary(glht(m2, emm(pairwise ~ Treatment|Day))) and the same problem occurs. I tried to fix this by making Day a factor and running it again, but I still get the same output. Does anyone have any suggestions on how to deal with this? Thank you
