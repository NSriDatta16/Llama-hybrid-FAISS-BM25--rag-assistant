How to fit El Nino SST data (as an exogenous data) in ARIMA modeling in R

I am working on time series forecasting of monthly averaged rainfall data (from a rainfall subdivision in India) using ARIMA methodology in R. But, in order to improve the forecast result, I want to include the (time series) data from El Ni√±o Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data as an exogenous input in ARIMA model. Currently, I have the SST time series data with me, but I'm struggling with how to incorporate these data inputs as "xreg" in my ARIMA model i.e can I directly use the SST anomaly data values in "xreg"? This is my data:- ts.rain1 Training and Test sets:- data.train And the arima code:- arima2
