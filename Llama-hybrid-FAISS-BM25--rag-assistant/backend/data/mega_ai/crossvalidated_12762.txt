Measure of spread of a multivariate normal distribution

What is a good measure of spread for a multivariate normal distribution? I was thinking about using an average of the component standard deviations; perhaps the trace of the covariance matrix divided by the number of dimensions, or a version of that. Is that any good? Thanks
