How to choose operation point from precision recall curves for multi-label classification

Is there a commonly accepted method for selecting an operating point for a multilabel classifier to optimize for each of these aggregate metrics: micro averaged recall at some minimal acceptable rate of precision (for clarification on operational point selection/threshold selection for binary case: How to choose a good operation point from precision recall curves? ) micro and macro averaged f measures I've found nothing on the matter except two papers that deal with (2) : "A Study on Threshold Selection for Multi-label Classification" https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/papers/threshold.pdf "Threshold Optimisation for Multi-label classifiers" This paper goes into this matter for macro and micro averaged f1 measures. Every point on this PR Graph comes from adjusting only one of the thresholds at a time. (exponential computation in number of classes) Paper on Threshold Selection: https://pralab.diee.unica.it/sites/default/files/pillai_PR2013_Thresholding_0.pdf These sources handle problem (2) but not problem (1)
