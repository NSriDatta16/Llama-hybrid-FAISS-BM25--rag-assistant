High Cross Validation but low test accuracy on LibSVM

I am solving the problem of detecting swallowing and non-swallowing events from the audio. I labelled the data using Praat software by marking the swallowing and nonswallowing events. I trained the model using LibSVM with balanced dataset of 1841 instance of each and test with non-balanced dataset 369 non-swallow and 548 swallow events. I performed grid-search on optimal $(C,\gamma)$ and find them as $(2,0.25)$ which 5-fold cross validation accuracy as 90%, which is for total of 29 record. But when I tested the model for test data, I obtained 60% accuracy. I also tested for balanced data, but the result still not acceptable. If the model is not generalized or overfit, why cross-validation accuracy is 90% ? Any idea? How can I fix the problem?
