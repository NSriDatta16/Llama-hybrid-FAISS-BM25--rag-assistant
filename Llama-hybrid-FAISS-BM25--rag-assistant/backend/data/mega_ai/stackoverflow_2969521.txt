Creating Bordless Windows with custom visual

I'd like to create a custom window using WPF that doesn't look like the regular window. The window I want to create is similar to MacOs window, with title centered (with dropshadow effect), and controls button on left side of the window. I did create a bordless window, but some questions I have: 1 - How can I set it functionality of maximize, minimize and close buttons in XAML (if it's possible)? 2 - How can I define a window template so every new window I create have the same look and feel? 3 - Is it possible to create the Aqua maximize, minimize and close buttons using only elements from WPF (without using images)? How? 4 - How can I make the window move when dragged? Thanks for all help.
