While on most systems double will be the same speed as float for individual values, you're right that computing functions like sqrt , sin , etc. in single-precision should be a lot faster than computing them to double-precision. In C99, you can use the sqrtf , sinf , etc. functions even if your variables are double , and get the benefit. Another issue I've seen mentioned is memory (and likewise storage device) bandwidth. If you have millions or billions of values to deal with, float will almost certainly be twice as fast as double since everything will be memory-bound or io-bound. This is a good reason to use float as the type in an array or on-disk storage in some cases, but I would not consider it a good reason to use float for the variables you do your computations with.
