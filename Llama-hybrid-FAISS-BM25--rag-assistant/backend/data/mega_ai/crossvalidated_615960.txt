Why are the log odds ratios not symmetric?

I am confused about a simple point. Are the 95% CI's of a log odds ratios only symmetric when computed from a logistic regression? What if I got an odds ratio from a fishers exact test and converted it into a log odds ratio, does that guarantee symmetry? Sorry for the silly question.
