How much time do you spend in Reflector? (.NET)

As a consultant I get to toy around with many different products and APIs as the customer demands we use X and Y. I think it is great fun and I learn a lot from it. What will make a great developer over time is, in my opinion, the will to understand and learn new things. Therefore, I will always try to understand what happens "behind the scenes" when I am using 3rd party products. I spend around 10-15% of my time in Reflector to learn what the heck I'm really doing when I call method X. How much time do you spend on average? This may also apply to reading (open) source code, documentation etc.
