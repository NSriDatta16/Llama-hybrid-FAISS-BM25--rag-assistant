SetWindowLongPtr was created to replace SetWindowLong in these instances. It's LONG_PTR parameter allows you to store a pointer for 32-bit or 64-bit compilations. LONG_PTR SetWindowLongPtr( HWND hWnd, int nIndex, LONG_PTR dwNewLong ); Remember that the constants have changed too, so usage now looks like: SetWindowLongPtr(hWnd, GWLP_USERDATA, this); Also don't forget that now to retrieve the pointer, you must use GetWindowLongPtr : LONG_PTR GetWindowLongPtr( HWND hWnd, int nIndex ); And usage would look like (again, with changed constants): LONG_PTR lpUserData = GetWindowLongPtr(hWnd, GWLP_USERDATA); MyObject* pMyObject = (MyObject*)lpUserData;
