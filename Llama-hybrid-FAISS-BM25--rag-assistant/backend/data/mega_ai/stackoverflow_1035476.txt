Quote from Remus Rusanu : Your client authenticates with SQL Server, then SQL Server impersonates the client and tries to access the UNC path. That is Delegation and is implicitly forbidden. You must take the explicit steps to enable constrained delegation for the SQL Server service account. See this article explaining the details: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms998355.aspx The article is shows constrained delegation for an ASP service accessing the back end database, but in your case it would be the SQL Server in the middle accessing the back end UNC share. As an alternative, you can connect to Sql Server using Sql Authentication. That would cause Sql Server to access shares under its own account. And are you sure the bulk insert is executed under the Sql Server account? If it's a batch job, it's probably executed under the Sql Server Agent account. By default, that's system\NetworkService. Change it to a domain user with access to the share.
