Your question is difficult to answer because there is no "supervised ML algorithm". There are a large number of different ML algorithms that can be optimized in a supervised fashion, each with their strengths and weaknesses. On a very abstract level, you can define Machine Learning (ML) as a search through some space $P$ for a parameterization ($\theta$) of a given model $M$ such that $M(x;\theta)$ gives a minimal value (though not always globally) for the cost function ($\mathcal{C}$) and input ($x$). More formally: $$\arg\min_{\theta\in P} \mathcal{C}(M(\theta))$$ For supervised learning, one form the cost function can take is (given $y$ as ground truth): $$\mathcal{C}(M(x; \theta)) = ||M(x;\theta) - y||_2$$ Any search through $P$ that minimizes the cost function can fit in this framework, and thus you can claim DOE as a ML algorithm if you want. Specifically, an ML algorithm is defined by: the optimization technique employed, the model used, and your cost function. If you fill those in for DOE, you can start to compare it against other ML algorithms.
