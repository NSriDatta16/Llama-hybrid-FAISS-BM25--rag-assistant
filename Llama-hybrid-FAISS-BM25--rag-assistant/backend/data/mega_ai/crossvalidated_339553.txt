Taking measurements from an instrument whose display is always changing?

I am involved in the teaching of an electric circuits course for engineering students. We get the students to build circuits and take various measurements using our test equipment. One of the major challenges is that we need to take measurements of rather small quantities, and our instruments aren't really suited to taking these measurements. What we see is that the number we get fluctuates, typically in the last 1-2 digits of a 4 digit display. My major issue is that students tend to just take the first number they see, say it's "good enough", and write it down as "the" measurement. Is there an appropriate way to deal with measurements that are fluctuating? Is it just as simple as taking a bunch of measurements and taking the average?
