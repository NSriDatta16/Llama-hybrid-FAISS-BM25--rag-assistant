On page 4, final paragraph, Chase 2011 says: Step 5. Standardize the metric to range from1 to 1. Subtract 0.5 from the value from step 4, and multiply by 2. Step 5 represents our primary modification of the original Raup-Crick metric (other than expressing it as a dissimilarity rather than similarity), by re-scaling it to vary from 1 to 1. Perhaps if you skip this step and leave the original metric (which varies from 0 to 1), it will work with the PERMDISP2 function.
