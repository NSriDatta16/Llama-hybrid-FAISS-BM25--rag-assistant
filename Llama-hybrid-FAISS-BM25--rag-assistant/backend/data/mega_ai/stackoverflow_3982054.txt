Incorrect reference PcapDotNet.?.dll

Hello I try to use PcapDotNet dll but I can't add reference to my project. It doesn't matter which dll it is. PcapDotNet.Core.dll, PcapDotNet.Base.dll etc. I have yellow exclamation mark near this reference and can't use any methods from this dll. Ofc "using PcapDotNet.Core;" is underlined too and compiler shows me: "The type or namespace name 'Core' does not exist in the namespace 'PcapDotNet' (are you missing an assembly reference?)" Different dll I can add normally. Any ideas?
