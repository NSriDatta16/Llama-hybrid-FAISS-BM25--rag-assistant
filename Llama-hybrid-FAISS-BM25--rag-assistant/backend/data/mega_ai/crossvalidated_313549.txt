Why decision boundary differs between multinomial (softmax) and One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression for multiclass classification

Can someone please explain why the decision boundary differs between multinomial (softmax) and One-vs-Rest Logistic Regression for multiclass classification. Example shown below http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/linear_model/plot_logistic_multinomial.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-linear-model-plot-logistic-multinomial-py I was under the wrong impression that both would yield the same decision boundary and it was just that the probabilities that softmax gives are normalized and interpretable.
