When training a language model on fixed-size sequences, it is common to pad shorter sequences to the maximum length with a special token, such as . This ensures that all sequences have the same length and can be processed by the model. However, padding should not be used when evaluating the model on test data, as it may introduce artifacts that affect performance. Regarding your first question, it is true that a model trained on fixed sequences of length 4 may not be able to handle shorter sequences as well. However, the impact of this on performance depends on the specifics of the model and the data. It is possible that a model trained on fixed-length sequences will still be able to generalize well to shorter sequences. If you have a lot of shorter sequences in your data, you may want to consider training a separate model on these sequences specifically. As for your second question, including all subsequences of length 1 to 4 as training data could be a good idea, as it provides more training examples and can help the model learn to handle sequences of different lengths. However, as you mentioned, this may result in an over-representation of shorter sequences and an under-representation of longer sequences. To address this, you could try weighting the training examples based on their sequence length, or augmenting the training data with additional longer sequences. It is also important to validate the performance of the model on test data to ensure that it is able to generalize to sequences of different lengths.
