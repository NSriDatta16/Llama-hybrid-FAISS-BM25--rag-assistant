Interpretation of ECM coefficients

Say that we are regressing consumption $C_t$ on time $Y_t$ . Furthermore, suppose that both series are $I(1)$ and are co-integrated. Given this, we set up the error correction model (ECM) as follows: $$\Delta C_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 Y_t + \theta(C_{t-1} - \gamma_0 - \gamma_1 Y_t) + u_t$$ which is estimated using the 2-step Engle-Granger approach. My question is: What is the economic interpretation of $\gamma_1$ ? Surely we cannot interpret this as the marginal propensity to consume (MPC)? I interpret it as describing the long-run equilibrium of the system. However, I'm struggling to explain why this is the case, since mathematically: $$\gamma_1 = \frac{\partial C_t}{\partial Y_t}$$ which is exactly the definition of the MPC. On the Wikipedia page on ECMs , they describe $\gamma_1$ as the average propensity to consume (APC), which makes a lot more sense to, but which doesn't sit well with me since mathematically: $$\text{APC} = \frac{C}{Y}$$ and clearly that is not the definition of $\gamma_1$ since: $$\frac{C}{Y} = \frac{\gamma_0}{Y} + \gamma1$$ Could someone help me sort out my confusion?
