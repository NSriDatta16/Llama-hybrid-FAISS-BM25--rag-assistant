Using multiple fragment identifiers in a URL

I was wondering whether I can use multiple fragment identifiers in a url, sort of like this: http://example.com/videos/index.html#videos#video_2 I'm using jQuery Tools tabbing system on my index.html page, with the history plugin. This page's "Videos" tab has a flash video player and list of videos on it. Clicking on a video thumbnail loads the file into the player. I would like a visitor to be able to bookmark not just the #videos tab, but also a specific video. Am I going about it totally wrong to think having two fragment identifiers in the URL would be the way to achieve this?
