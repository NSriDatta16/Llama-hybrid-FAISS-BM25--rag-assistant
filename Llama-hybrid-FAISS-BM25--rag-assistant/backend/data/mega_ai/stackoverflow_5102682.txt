Does using the ActionBar in Honeycomb really mean i have to create an extra App?

Last week i began the honeycomb update for my app and since then the documentation has become available. One of the really big things to change in my app is the use of the ActionBar. I am a little disappointed about the following sentence from the doumentation: However, if you want to use Action Bar APIs, such as to add tabs or modify Action Bar styles, you need to set the android:minSdkVersion to "11", so you can access the ActionBar class. Does that really mean i have to create an extra app if i want to take advantage of the ActionBar or is there some way around this?
