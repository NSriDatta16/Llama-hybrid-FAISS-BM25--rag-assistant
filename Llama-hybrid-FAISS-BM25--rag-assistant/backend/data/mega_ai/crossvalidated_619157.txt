family wise error rate in highly dependent data

I was hoping someone could help with a problem in my area of Optometry. We use visual fields/perimetry to assess patients visual function. This consists of patient responses (or not) to points of light projected onto various locations on the retina at various stimulus intensities. The dimmest light seen is recorded as the threshold sensitivity at that point. Usually 40-60 separate points are tested across each patients retina and then the overall mean sensitivity is given as the average of all individual point sensitivities. My question is this: since the mean sensitivity consists of 40-60 individually tested points, should p-values associated with changes in the mean sensitivity value over time be adjusted? Currently, no correction is applied in our profession as a whole and I'm now wondering if this is incorrect. If a retinal treatment is applied then several point sensitivities will increase (in a non-independent way) contributing to the overall mean sensitivity increasing, however, should the p-value of significant gain in mean sensitivity be adjusted by a factor of 40-60? This is analagous to questions around p-value adjustment in a repeated measures design, except this isn't exactly repeated measures but separate points that are highly dependent on each other. Thank you for any thoughts on this
