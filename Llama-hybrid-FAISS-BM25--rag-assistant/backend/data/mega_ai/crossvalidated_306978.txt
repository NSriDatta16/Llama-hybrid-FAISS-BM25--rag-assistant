Neural Network Input Normalization

As I know it is recommended to normalize the input to a neural network ($\mu=0,\sigma=1$). Assuming I use a CNN that uses RGB-images as input, how do i have to normalize? Over all the data of the complete batch (at once)? Each image independent of each other? For each $x$/$y$ pair (=pixel) over the batch? For each color channel or all at once? Thank you very much -edit- Or is it sufficient to use a BatchNormalization-Layer as the first layer in the neural network?
