Interesting responses. I'm running what i'd call a cloud setup. Basically, i have one master server 15GB RAM and 1TB HDD, since the community version of MYSQl is unable to use remote files for its storage, my mysql server is ran on this server. In terms of the web server and processing there are 5 other servers running with equal specs who's sole purpose is to serve webpages for a single domain. The software on it uses apache server, i'm not sure what the software manager was called,i'll get back on that... but each server processes the same page, it is pretty much like parralel processing, fetch decode and execute. Except there are more than one servers doing the same thing. As mentioned before grid and cloud computing are both archtectural concepts. The concept is what allows companies such as microsoft, google and yahoo as well as facebook and weem.me and the lot, to run websites so fast. A perfectly good example is google, they can server pages so fast but have such a high volume of traffic. The basis of it is several server working in parralell to achieve the same goal and in doing so allows for scalability and serious computing power.
