Can I insert mean values for dummies when predicting an average person in a logistic regression model?

I have a logistic regression model with several dummy variables. I would like to predict the probability of Y for "an average person in the dataset". However, how do I do this when I have explanatory variables like "male", "education level_high", "education level_med" etc.? Can I insert an average value for dummies and use this as "an average person"? This would mean that an average person e.g. would be $0.54$ Male.. For instance, I have the following model: $Y = 0.57 -0.97$ Male $ + 1.2$ Education_level_high $+\dots$ If I want to predict Y for an average person, is it then ok to just insert averages for dummies? This would be: $Y = 0.57 - 0.97 \times 0.54 + 1.2 \times 0.76$ Or is there a better solution?
