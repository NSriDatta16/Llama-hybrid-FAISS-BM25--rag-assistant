You can technically write a GUI in C++/CLI, but I would highly discourage it. C++/CLI is good for writing .NET wrappers around native C++ and exposing it to other .NET languages, but not much else. In your case, if you're really set on using WinForms/WPF, then I would suggest using C++/CLI to create a wrapper around your C++ code and then building the actual GUI in C#. Otherwise, a C++ library like Qt or wxWidgets would also suffice for doing a "native" C++ GUI. Here's a quick introduction to C++/CLI . This is a quick-start guide for getting started with C++/CLI. Once you build a C++/CLI DLL, you can just add it as a reference to your C# project and It Just Works(tm).
