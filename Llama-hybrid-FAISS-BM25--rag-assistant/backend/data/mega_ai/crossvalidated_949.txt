When is logistic regression solved in closed form?

Take $x \in \{0,1\}^d$ and $y \in \{0,1\}$ and suppose we model the task of predicting y given x using logistic regression. When can logistic regression coefficients be written in closed form? One example is when we use a saturated model. That is, define $P(y|x) \propto \exp(\sum_i w_i f_i(x_i))$, where $i$ indexes sets in the power-set of $\{x_1,\ldots,x_d\}$, and $f_i$ returns 1 if all variables in the $i$'th set are 1, and 0 otherwise. Then you can express each $w_i$ in this logistic regression model as a logarithm of a rational function of statistics of the data. Are there other interesting examples when closed form exists?
