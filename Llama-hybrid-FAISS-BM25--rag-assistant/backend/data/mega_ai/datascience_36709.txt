Multi target classification

I am working on traffic violation data set which contains 36 columns(variable). I have two dependent variables out of this. Example id, description, age, sex alcohol vehicle violation level Accident 120 speed 28 M Yes car severe yes 122 win-tint 35 F No truck Medium no 123 left-turn 26 M No car light no 124 failure-veh 28 M No car severe yes The dependent variables are "violation level" and "accident". violation level has 3 classes -- sever medium light Accident has 2 levels -- Yes No I want to predict both violation level and accident. I think this can be multitarget prediction. Can someone help me which algorithm is good for this? I have seen some articles suggesting scikit- multiout put classification and neural network with multiple out put layers. Or Can I go ahead with two models? predicting the traffic violation level. Predicting the accidents using the violation levels. Basically I am trying to predict violation levels and then predicting how these violations contribute to accidents. Any help would be appreciated.
