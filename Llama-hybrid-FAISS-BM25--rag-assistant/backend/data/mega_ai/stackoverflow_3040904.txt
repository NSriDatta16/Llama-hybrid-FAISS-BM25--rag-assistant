Save JSON outputted from a URL to a file

How would I save JSON outputted by an URL to a file? e.g from the Twitter search API (this http://search.twitter.com/search.json?q=hi ) Language isn't important. edit // How would I then append further updates to EOF? edit 2// Great answers guys really, but I accepted the one I thought was the most elegant.
