Ruby on Rails cache: Is it possible to increase the expiration time for a cache fragment during the execution time?

I am using Ruby on Rails 3 and I would like to increase the expiration time for a cache key during the execution time. I use memcached . For example, I have Rails.cache.write("key_test", "value_test", :expires_in => 10.seconds) so that the key_test will expire in 10 seconds. In order to make available that key value for longer, what I can do? Is it possible to increase only the expires_in without to set again the value_test ? The following code doesn't work , but maybe I have to do something like this: Rails.cache.write("key_test", :expires_in => 10.seconds)
