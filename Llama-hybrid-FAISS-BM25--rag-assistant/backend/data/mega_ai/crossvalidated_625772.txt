Regarding the first question and first image: In this graph(above) if systematic error is zero then average value will be the true value! How's that possible? You are right that this isn't normally possible. In fact the observed average of measurements will not necessarily and not normally be equal to the true value, however the expected value of the average of measurements will be the true value, i.e., if you repeat taking observations and computing their average potentially infinitely often, the average of these averages will be the true value. The latter is called "measurement population mean" here to make you aware that this is not the mean of your observations but a theoretical mean of the underlying "population of measurements" assuming you could take infinitely many measurements. Furthermore this holds under certain statistical model assumptions but not necessarily always in reality, however chances are that for understanding these images these assumptions should be taken to hold. And why random error here is described with respect to measured value not to mean of measured value? The "random error" would be the difference between an actual observation/measurement and the theoretical mean of the "measurement population", i.e., between what you actually observe and the idealised mean of infinitely many observations. In the image this is indeed shown as the difference between these two.
