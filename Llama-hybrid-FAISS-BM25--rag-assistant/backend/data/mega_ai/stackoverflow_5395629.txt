Sorting Android Songs

New Android developer here; well versed in Java. I'm looking to create a playlist maker and am having trouble sorting my media. I'm following a tutorial but it does not cover how to sort the media by artist. I'd like to have a ListView of the artists and if you click an artist it expands down to show the albums by that artist, and then if you click an album it expands down to show the songs in that album. Keeping future capabilities in mind, I'd like to be able to drag and drop albums/songs. I appreciate any help you have to offer.
