Definitely possible. For example, you could use sqlite from an extension and, in that, store urls (or their hash) and any associated annotations. Then when visiting a page, check against the DB, and restore the annotations. As to how you specifically want to accomplish this is up to you. There is no shortage of ways to accomplish this. See Building an Extension and Storage at MDC.
