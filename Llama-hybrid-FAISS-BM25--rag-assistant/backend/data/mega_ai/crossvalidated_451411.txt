Is there any Forecasting algorithm or way to forecast the daily data available only on working days only(i.e Mon to Fri)?

Since My data frequency is daily but data is not available on Weekends( Sat and Sun) and Holidays.Therefore nearly 30-40 % data is missing with sequential time series. So I don't know how to deal with Non sequential time series data.
