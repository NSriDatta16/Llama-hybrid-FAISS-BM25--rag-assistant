Web client classification using Artifical Neural Network

I have a high traffic web site. I want to create software which analyses client requests on-the-fly and decide if they come from a real user or a botnet bot. For training the neural network to identify legitimate ("good") users I can use logs when there are no DDoS activity. Once trained, the network would distinguish real users from bots. What I have: request URI (and order) cookie user agent request frequency. Any ideas on how to best design ANN for this task and how to tune it? Edit: [in response to comments about the overly broad scope of this question] I currently have a working C# program which blocks clients on the basis the frequency of identical requests. Now I'd like to improve its "intelligence" with a classifier based on neural network. I don't know how to normalize these inputs for ANN and I need suggestions in this specific area.
