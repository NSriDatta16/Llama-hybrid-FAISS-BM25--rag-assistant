Ruby on Rails activerecord find average in one sql and Will_Paginate

I have the following model association: a student model and has_many scores. I need to make a list showing their names and average, min, max scores. So far I am using student.scores.average(:score) on each student, and I realise that it is doing one sql per student. How can I make the list with one joined sql? Also how would I use that with Will_Paginate plugin? Thank you
