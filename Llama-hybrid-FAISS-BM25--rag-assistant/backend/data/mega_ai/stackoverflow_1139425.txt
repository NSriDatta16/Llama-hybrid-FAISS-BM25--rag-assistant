I would like to add that the sockets can be shared on Unix/Linux via AF__UNIX sockets (inter-process sockets). What seems to happen is a new socket descriptor is created that is somewhat of an alias to the original one. This new socket descriptor is sent via the AFUNIX socket to the other process. This is especially useful in cases where a process cannot fork() to share it's file descriptors. For example, when using libraries that prevent against this due to threading issues. You should create a Unix domain socket and use libancillary to send over the descriptor. See: https://www.linuxquestions.org/questions/programming-9/how-to-share-socket-between-processes-289978/ For creating AF_UNIX Sockets: http://docs.sun.com/app/docs/doc/817-4415/portmapper-51908?a=view For example code: http://lists.canonical.org/pipermail/kragen-hacks/2002-January/000292.html http://cpansearch.perl.org/src/SAMPO/Socket-PassAccessRights-0.03/passfd.c
