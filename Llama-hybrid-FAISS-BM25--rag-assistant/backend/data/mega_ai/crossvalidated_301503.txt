Why use a train/test split with linear regression

I am using linear regression to draw a y = mx + b line between my data, I just want to know how much of a good fit line my best linear line is. So I thought I would just use clf.score(X_train, y_train) on the points I've already used to train my algorithm. I just want to see how my line compares to the average y-line. Do I need to split my data into train and test data, and then run it. Or should I just use my train data to test, beacuse it can't deviate from the line anyways? And why?
