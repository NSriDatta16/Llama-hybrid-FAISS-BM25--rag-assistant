Setting a colour scale in ipython

I am new to python and am having trouble finding the correct syntax to use. I want to plot some supernovae data onto a hammer projection. The data has coordinates alpha and beta. For each data point there is also a value delta describing a property of the SN. I would like to create a colour scale that ranges from min. value of delta to max. value of delta and goes from red to violet. This would mean that when I came to plot the data I could simply write: subplot(111,projection="hammer") p=plot([alpha],[beta],'o',mfc='delta') where delta would represent a colour somewhere in the spectrum between red and violet. I.e if delta =0, the marker would be red and if delta =delta max. the marker would be violet and if delta =(delta. max)/2 the marker would be yellow. Could anyone help me out with the syntax to do this? Many thanks Angela
