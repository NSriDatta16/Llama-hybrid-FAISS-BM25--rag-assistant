Using the hosted inference here: https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/msmarco-MiniLM-L-12-v3 I'm getting a sentence similarity of 0.58 between data customer and data provider, and 0.86 between data customer and data consumer, which seems pretty reasonable to me. If you're willing to train the model from scratch you could consider negative sampling https://www.baeldung.com/cs/nlps-word2vec-negative-sampling . Using a classifier algorithm (SVMs or k-Nearest Neighbors) for a finite number of job titles would probably be a reasonable starting point, and you could use your embeddings as a starting point. hth.
