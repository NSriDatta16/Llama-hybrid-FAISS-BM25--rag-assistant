How to ensemble classifier incorporating all features in python?

I am doing a text classification task(5000 essays evenly distributed by 10 labels). I explored LinearSVC and got an accuracy of 80%. Now I guess whether accuracy could be raised by using ensemble classifier with SVM as base estimator? However, I do not know how to employ an ensemble classifier incorporating all the features? Please note that I do not want to combine the different features directly in a single vector. Therefore, My first question: in order to improve the current accuracy, is it possible to use ensemble classifier with svm as base estimator? My second question How to employ an ensemble classifier incorporating all features?
