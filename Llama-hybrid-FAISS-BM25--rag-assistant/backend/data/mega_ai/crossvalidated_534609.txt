Confirming the dependent variable / outcome in logistic regression

I'm running logistic regressions in Python using statsmodels logit. My dependent variable is binary, 0 or 1. How do I know whether the regression is modeling an outcome of 1 or an outcome of 0 for the dependent variable? (And, therefore, whether the coefficients correspond to an outcome of 1 or 0?) For example, one of the parameters, age, has a positive coefficient of 0.03. How do I know whether age is positively correlated with outcome == 1, or positively correlated with outcome == 0? â€‹
