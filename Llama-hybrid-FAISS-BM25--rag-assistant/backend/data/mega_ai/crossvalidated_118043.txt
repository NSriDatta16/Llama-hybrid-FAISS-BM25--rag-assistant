There's actually been a good deal of research on this in recent years. A big point is "semantic resonance." This basically means "colors that correspond to what they represent," e.g. a time series for money should be colored green, at least for an audience in the USA. This apparently improves comprehension. One very interesting paper on the subject is by Lin, et al (2013): http://vis.stanford.edu/papers/semantically-resonant-colors There's also the very nice iWantHue color generator, at http://tools.medialab.sciences-po.fr/iwanthue/ , with lots of info in the other tabs.
