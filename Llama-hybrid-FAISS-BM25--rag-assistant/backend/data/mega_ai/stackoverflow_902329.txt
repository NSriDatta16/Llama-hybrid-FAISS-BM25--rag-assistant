LINQ to SQL is an ORM, like any other, and as such, it was not designed to handle bulk updates/inserts/deleted. The general idea with L2S, EF, NHibernate, LLBLGen and the rest is to handle the mapping of relational data to your object graphs for you, eliminating the need to manage a large library of stored procs which, ultimately, limit your flexability and adaptability. When it comes to bulk updates, those are best left to the thing that does them best...the database server. L2S and EF both provide the ability to map stored procedures to your model, which allows your stored procs to be somewhat entity oriented. Since your using L2S, just write a proc that takes the set of identities as input, and executes the SQL statement at the beginning of your question. Drag that stored proc onto your L2S model, and call it. Its the best solution for the problem at hand, which is a bulk update. Like with reporting, object graphs and object-relational mapping are not the best solution for bulk processes.
