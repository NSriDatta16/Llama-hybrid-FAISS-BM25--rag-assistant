Tweak machine learning algorithm in SciKit to optimize for recall

I am given a dataset to detect fraud. Something similar like this: https://www.kaggle.com/code/imgremlin/4th-place-in-fraud-detection-from-zindi The issue with SciKit machine learning algorithm is that it optimizes for accuracy, but I want lower its accuracy and optimize for recall so that frauds can be detected more accurately. The issue with the dataset is that there are much more non-fraud cases, "0", than fraud cases , "1". ~ 10 to 1 Is there a way that I can tweak the SciKit algorithm so that it optimizes for recall?
