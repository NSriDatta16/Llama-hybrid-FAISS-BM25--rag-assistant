First, try to use Joomla's path constants such as JPATH_BASE instead of $_SERVER['DOCUMENT_ROOT'] . Joomla has a lot of useful constants, check it's documentation. I've read your answer, and reading php documentation I tried to find a reason to why you need to use global keyword twice. First, Variable scope . The scope of a variable is the context within which it is defined. For the most part all PHP variables only have a single scope. (...) However, within user-defined functions a local function scope is introduced. Any variable used inside a function is by default limited to the local function scope. The variable isn't in a function scope, so that's why we thought the NULL was a strange behavior. But then I read include and found something interesting: (...) Any variables available at that line in the calling file will be available within the called file, from that point forward. However, all **functions** and **classes** defined in the included file have the global scope. I can't see any mention about the variables being global in this paragraph. So,it seens that, being cumbersome or not, your solution is the right thing to do when you want to use global variables like that. In your situation, if doing this is cumbersome, I would create a simple class. If you have just helper functions in your file, create a class Util{} with a lot of methods and $testVar as an attribute.
