Interrupted time series analysis with log transformed data

I want to conduct an assessment of the annual citation rates for a group of patents before and after a particular intervention (namely the decision of the Supreme Court in Alice v CLS Bank, which I represent with a dummy value 0 or 1). Unfortunately, from the dataset I have collected, I have a fair amount of positive skew in the raw citation rate for each patents (some patents have 100 citations, others have 10). I have tried to filter out those patents that do not have any citations. Accordingly, I have log transformed those values as follows: +------+-------+-----------+--------------+ | year | alice | citations | logcitations | +------+-------+-----------+--------------+ | 1 | 0 | 6 | 0.778 | | 2 | 1 | 3 | 0.477 | | 3 | 1 | 1 | 0.301 | +------+-------+-----------+--------------+ I then wanted to conduct a time series analysis to see whether there was a relative change in the number of LogCitations before and after Alice using the following model: model1 = lm(logcitations ~ alice, data) Is this model too simplistic for assessing the effect of the change in citations? Is there another test that I could use for assessing the effect of the time series? Thank you. EDIT: I should mention that I am attempting to measure these effects over a 20 year period. I have adopted the lm model described above because I have read that using an ARIMA model requires at least 30 data points (which unfortunately I don't have, because patents only remain in force for 20 years). EDIT: In response to Chris Haug's question below, I've added the acf and pacf values for the model1 residuals:
