How about looking into languages that are actually used for scripting in games like Python and Lua for some ideas? Both happen to be dynamically typed, and in terms of syntax, Python is very not C-like, and Lua is not terribly similar to C. Probably the reason why they are used for game scripting is the ease of embedding the language as a scripting engine, if anything else. If the language is to be designed with designers in mind, then the perhaps the requirements for the language would have to be changed in order to fit the designers needs, rather than having a language that is more easily integrated into a game.
