How does one smooth an image used as a control skin?

I'm embedding an image like this: [Embed(source="/tool_deleteUp.png")] private static const c_deleteButton_styleUp:Class; I'm using it like this: _removeButton = new Button(); _removeButton.setStyle('upSkin', c_deleteButton_styleUp); When I rotate the button, the image doesn't scale smoothly. I know the tricks one uses to scale an image loaded in an Image control, but I'm banging my head against a wall trying to figure out how to do it here. Help!
