Raphyboy, Content Deployment is a MOSS-only feature; it is not present in WSS. The PRIME API (upon which MOSS' content deployment functionality is constructed) is present in the WSS platform, so you could conceivably build your own version ... but that approach is seldom more efficient or cost-effective. As Chris hinted at, you can still perform basic export ( STSADM -o export ) and import ( STSADM -o import ) operations via the command line, and these leverage the same functionality that is present in MOSS' Content Deployment's paths and jobs. It's obviously more manual (and more work), but you could script these operations for a poor man's content deployment system if needed. I hope this helps!
