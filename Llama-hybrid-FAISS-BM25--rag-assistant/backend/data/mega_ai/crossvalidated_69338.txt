What is a quadravariate distribution?

Question: What is a quadravariate distribution? Motivation: I found a reference to quadravariate distributions in Priestley (1981) Spectral Analysis and Time Series on p325, but no definition (the author seems to think it is common knowledge). 10 minutes of googling revealed that the term gets used in quite a few papers, but I am still unable to find a definition anywhere.
