It would be good to study a standard text on logistic regression. Among other things, you are confusing full conditioning ($Pr[Y=1 | X=x]$ as the logistic model estimates) with partial conditioning ($Pr[Y=1 | X \leq x]$). But more importantly, the model you have fitted is non-stochastic, i.e., the winner is determined with certainty from the two scores.
