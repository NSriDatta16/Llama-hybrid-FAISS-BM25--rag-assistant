Verify Error launching FlurryAgent

I have a problem with the FlurryAgent.onStartSession() method. It's returns a java.lang.VerifyError when I launch my app. This app is developed using android 2.3 and I have a project added into it. This project contains the FlurryAgent.jar. When my app needs to run FlurryAgent.onStartSession() it returns a VerifyError . I only have this problem when I launch it using a 1.6 device or emulator. Do you have any idea?
