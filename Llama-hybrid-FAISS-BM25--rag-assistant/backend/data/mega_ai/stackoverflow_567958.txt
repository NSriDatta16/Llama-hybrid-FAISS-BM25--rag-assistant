IE 6 and the multiple button elements all sending their name & values

When using multiple button elements in a form, I realised that IE7 sends the innerHTML instead of the value of the button. All good I thought, I'll simply change my PHP code to this Now my old friend IE6 is going a little step further at being a nuisance. It sends all of the button elements regardless of which one I click. For example, I have 3 button elements named 'mint', 'near-mint' & 'standard'. A quick print_r($_POST) tells me that all 3 names have been submitted. I guess to remedy this will be some JavaScript, not the most elegant situation, but I can imagine that the average user still using IE6 is not bright enough to turn off their JavaScript. How can I remedy this?
