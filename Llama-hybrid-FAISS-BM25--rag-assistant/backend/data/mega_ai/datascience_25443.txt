Prediction Intervals Using XGBoost

I want to obtain the prediction intervals of my xgboost model which I am using to solve a regression problem. I am using the python code shared on this blog , and not really understanding how the quantile parameters affect the model (I am using the suggested parameter values on the blog). When I apply this code to my data, I obtain nonsense results, such as negative predictions for my target values while my target values are always over 10K. I don't understand how should this code vary according to my data and would really appreciate any help. Differences in my data to the data that is used on the blog are: My distribution is Poisson like. I have over 100 features. Note: I tried tuning the delta, threshold and var parameters, but they don't seem to have a controllable effect on the results and predictions remains nonsense.
