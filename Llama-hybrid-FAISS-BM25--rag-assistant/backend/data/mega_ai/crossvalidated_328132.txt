Data calculated per 100 inhabitants

I found data that indicate the vaccination coverage of a given vaccine in Italy in year 2014. These data are calculated per 100 inhabitants and in %. What does "per 100 inhabitants" mean? If I wanted to compare this data with other data that are instead calculated for 1000 inhabitants, should I first process them? If instead I wanted to compare them with the population of each region? Thanks
