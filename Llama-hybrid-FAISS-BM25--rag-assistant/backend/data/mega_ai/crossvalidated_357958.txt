LDA topic assignments are informative as an exploratory unsupervised exercise but they are way too imperfect to use directly as source of labels for SVM. The problem is that SVM expects one or more distinct labels that align with your conceptual understanding of the subject matter while LDA provides a statistical but thoughtless mixture of topic labels based on word co-occurrences and distributions. The most you can do is use the LDA labels as a starting point to assist you in manually creating a training dataset for SVM.
