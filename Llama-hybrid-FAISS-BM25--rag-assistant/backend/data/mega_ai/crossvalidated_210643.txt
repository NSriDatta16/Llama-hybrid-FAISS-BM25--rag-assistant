Training set, test set and validation set

In order to do a data mining work I have to find the best classifiers for my data. What I wonder is if I have to divide my data set into a training test and a test set ? I have to choose between 5 models : Naive Bayes, Neural network, K-NN, decision tree and logistic regression. My point is that if I want to know the performance of each model (by comparing errors for each model), I intended to do a cross-validation and select the best one(using MSE). So my question is, why splitting my data at the beginning if I am assessing the performance of each of the 5 models with cross-validation. I hope I am clear enough. Thank for your help in advance.
