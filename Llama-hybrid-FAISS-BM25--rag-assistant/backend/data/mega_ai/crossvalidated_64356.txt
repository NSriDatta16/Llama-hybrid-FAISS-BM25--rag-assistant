First, whether you use the covariance matrix, or the correlation matrix (equivalent to standardizing each variable before carrying out PCA on the covariance matrix), or transform the data in any other way before carrying out PCA, the results of the PCA apply to that transformed data. So you should not be surprised to see different eigensystems using different transformations; any interpretations you may make may of course be different, but are are not conflicting. If they seem to conflict you must be misinterpreting them. Second, whether it's more meaningful to express each variable as a fraction of the sum of variables for each individual is for you to decide, before thinking about principal components. If it is more meaningful, PCA on the data thus transformed may not be what you want: any one variable is expressible in terms of the other two, which are still constrained not to exceed unity in total. A scatterplot would be an obvious method to look at three variables, using barycentric co-ordinates if you like. If you still need PCA for something, Aitchison (1983), Biometrika 70 (1) discusses the issues, & gives useful transformations to use for vectors of proportions, & you may be interested in the R packages compositions & robCompositions .
