Note: I'm assuming that the UIImageView subviews display properly and that they do have non-zero centers. It's rare but sometimes the dot notation does not resolve properly. Try the old nested style of reference. NSLog(@"touchesBegan - self.powerOn.center is %@",NSStringFromCGPoint([[self powerOn] center]); If this works, then you probably have a linking problem. Check you build results for any warnings related to UIImageViews. Sometimes the linker seems to loose track of some of the nested classes. A clean all usually fixes the problem.
