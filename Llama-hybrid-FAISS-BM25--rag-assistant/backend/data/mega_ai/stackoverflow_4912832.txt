Drag and drop from jsTree to input form field

I have a jsTree of a filesystem, folders and files, and I would like to drag a file node from the tree and drop it into an input field, inserting the full pathname into the form field. Currently, when I attempt to drag any node from the tree into the form field, I get back the URL of the web page, along with a hash mark, e.g. https://example.com/# . If I change the link href of the node's data, the hash changes to the new href, but I still get the protocol and host ( https://example.com/newHref ). Assuming the modification I described is possible, how would I configure the jsTree and form to accomplish this? Thanks for your advice.
