As you correctly noticed, the probabilities we are dealing with are unnormalized . Basically, we use MCMC to compute the normalizing factor in Bayes theorem. We cannot use the probabilities because they are unnormalized. The procedure that you suggest: to save the unnormalized probabilities and then divide them by their sum is incorrect. Let me show it to you by example. Imagine that you used Monte Carlo to draw ten values from Bernoulli distribution parametrized by $p=0.9$, they are as follows: 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 you also have corresponding probabilities: 0.9 0.1 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 0.9 In this case the probabilities are normalized, but dividing them by their sum (that by axioms of probability is equal to unity) should not change anything. Unfortunatelly, using your procedure it does change the results to: > f/sum(f) [1] 0.10975610 0.01219512 0.10975610 0.10975610 0.10975610 0.10975610 0.10975610 0.10975610 0.10975610 0.10975610 Why is that? The answer is simple, in your sample each saved "probability" f appears with probability f , so you are weighting the probabilities by themselves!
