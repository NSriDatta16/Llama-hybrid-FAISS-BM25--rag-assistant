Magento. Destination folder is not writable or does not exists

Hey I'm stuck with the following problem, plz help. I get "Destination folder is not writable.." when trying to add an image to a product, but the permission for all needed folders is 777 ! I had deleted all files on server, didn`t touch DB, reinstalled Magento from scratch with new DB, and everything is OK. But when I switched to previous DB (change settings in the local.xml ) the bug appeared again. How can the DB impact the folder permissions? UPDATE: Thanx a lot, we found out that Magento jump from this method: public function getBaseMediaUrl() { return Mage::getBaseUrl('media') . 'catalog/product'; } to the following method: public function getBaseTmpMediaUrl() { return Mage::getBaseUrl('media') . 'tmp/catalog/product'; } Does anybody know why and how????
