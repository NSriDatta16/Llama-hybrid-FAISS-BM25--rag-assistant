Need Ontology of software engineering terms

I'm trying to implement a Question Answering System based on software engineering ontology. This is a [class/university?] project; it will use the java language. Can you please help me locate software engineering ontologies i.e. ontologies [or even taxonomies / folksonomies ?] that include words and concepts found in the domain of Software Engineering. Editor's note : I took the liberty of rewriting this question. It was initially poorly worded and being misunderstood was closed. Maybe it can be reopen, for it is programming related and of interest to some SO contributors. According to this dupe : the poster is looking for an OWL resource: quote, "I need software engineering ontology.owl file."
