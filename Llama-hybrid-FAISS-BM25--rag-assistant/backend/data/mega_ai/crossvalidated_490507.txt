Looking at models based on the t-distribution is potentially helpful as others wrote. However one reason to use the Gaussian assumption is that the Gaussian distribution minimises the Fisher-Information for given variance. This means that Gaussian parameters cannot be as precisely estimated as parameters of other distributions given the knowledge of the distribution . This is a good thing in the sense that using the Gaussian distribution is normally a conservative choice, as is also shown in the answer by Eoin. The larger uncertainty indicated by the Gaussian model may actually be realistic given that we don't know what the true distribution is. Note that this argument technically doesn't apply to the $t_1$ - and $t_2$ -distribution, because these don't have existing variances. However your residuals do not look quite as evil as residuals of these tend to look. If you run regressions, fitting Gaussians to heavy tailed distributions (even $t_1$ or $t_2$ ) will normally make confidence intervals and p-values larger, so if you have small p-values, these should still be reliable. It is far more dangerous to have outliers/heavy tails in the explanatory variables ("leverage points"), but as far as I understand your experiment, you don't have those.
