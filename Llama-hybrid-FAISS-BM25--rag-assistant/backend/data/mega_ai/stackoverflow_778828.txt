Your description is a bit in depth and I hope that I am following it correctly but it seems to me that you are trying to attach a click event(s) to all of the items as well as all of the items that will be created in the future. Rather than specifying the onclick event when creating the you should use the new jQuery feature that came out in jQuery 1.3+ that allows you to specify an event for every element that matches the Selector... even future elements like the ones you will be adding via json. $("p").live("click", function(){ $(this).after(" Another paragraph! "); }); http://docs.jquery.com/Events/live
