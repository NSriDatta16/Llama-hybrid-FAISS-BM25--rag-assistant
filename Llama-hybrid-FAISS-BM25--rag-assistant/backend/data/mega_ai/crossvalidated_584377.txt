How do I calculate the 95% confidence interval of a curve that depends on many parameters?

Assuming I have a curve fit that depends on 4 parameters. How would I compute the 95% confidence interval if I had many variations of this curve fit (many combinations of samples of these 4 parameters). I tried taking the 95% interval for each parameter separately, but this seems completely wrong as it gives borders that are outside of my actual fits. Here is an example of what I have. In black is the average fit and around it is all the different variations. As you can see, depending on what X value, it is not always the same curve that is "on top" or "on the bottom". Thus, I'm not sure how to compute the 95% CI. I basically have a list containing the 4 parameters for each fit.
