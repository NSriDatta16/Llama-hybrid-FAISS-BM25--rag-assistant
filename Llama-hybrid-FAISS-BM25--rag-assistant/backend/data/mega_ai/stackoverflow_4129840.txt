The java.sql.Date contains only the date part of datetime. You probably want to use java.sql.Timestamp instead. Timestamp example = new Timestamp(dateFormat.parse(activateTime).getTime()); Timestamp example2 = new Timestamp(dateFormat.parse(expireTime).getTime()); It also works like that in the average SQL database. The DATE data type represents only the date, the TIME data type represents only the time. The TIMESTAMP data type (sometimes called DATETIME ) represents the date and time. Note that your hour pattern is incorrect. With the given examples, you'd rather like to use HH instead of hh . See also the SimpleDateFormat javadoc .
