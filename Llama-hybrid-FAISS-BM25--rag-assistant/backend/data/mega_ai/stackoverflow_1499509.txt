From http://code.google.com/p/google-caja/ Caja allows websites to safely embed DHTML web applications from third parties, and enables rich interaction between the embedding page and the embedded applications. and it uses a call interception mechanism Since web applications make common use of browser APIs, e.g. the DOM APIs, that give a huge amount of control over the web page, Caja provides tamed APIs that virtualize portions of the DOM. A containing page can set up the embedding application's environment so that the embedded application thinks it is interacting with the DOM of a full page, but is in fact only manipulating a bounded portion of the containing page via a mechanism called virtual iframes. There's info on that same page about how to contact the team and get started.
