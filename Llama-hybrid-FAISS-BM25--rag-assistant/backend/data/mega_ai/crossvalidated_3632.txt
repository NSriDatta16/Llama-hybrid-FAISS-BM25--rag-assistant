Should we regress x or use logistic regression on x>5000

Suppose we need to take an action on a population with income (x) more than $5,000. Income is not observed directly. Should we use logistic regression to estimate x, or should we use logistic regression to estimate the probability of x>5000 directly? (What are the drawbacks/advantage of the methods?) Edit: Yes - by logistic I meant logistic regression. The other variables I have are Financial history, Demograpgic and Credit Bureau variables. For example, the balance, utilization, gender, # cars, house owned or not, external card balance, external # bad debts, etc. Thanks
