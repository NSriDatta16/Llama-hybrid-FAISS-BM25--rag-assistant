Gaussian process - dimensionality reduction

I saw a method for dimensionality reduction for the squared exponential covariance function (not ARD) whereby one uses a $G\times D$ projection matrix $P$ ($G I'm trying to use this in my implementation of Gaussian process regression, but I'm not sure how to get the gradient with respect to $P$ for optimization. I need the derivative of the marginal likelihood w.r.t. $P$ to maximize (minimizing the negative log marginal likelihood in actuality). Has anyone seen this method before or have any suggestions?
