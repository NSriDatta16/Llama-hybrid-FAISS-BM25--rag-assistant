Consider a set $S$ which can be partitioned to $B_{1}\cup B_{2} =S$ and $B_{1}\cap B_{2}=\varnothing$ . A Dirichlet Process can be considered as a prior over distributions. So, imagine that you have the distribution $G$ that you want to model and learn about, the Dirichlet process will place a prior on that $G$ , i.e. $$(G(B_{1}),G(B_{2}))\sim DP(H,a)$$ where $\mathbb{E}[G(B_{1})]=H(B_{1})$ , where $H$ is the mean of the Dirichlet process. For example, you could say that the distribution $G$ that you are interested in is centered around $H=Normal(0,1)$ . Now in the case were you have obsrveded samples $X_{1},X_{2},...,X_{n}$ you update your prior $DP(H,a)$ , to $$DP(\frac{a}{a+n}H+\frac{1}{a+n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{x_{i}},a+n)$$ Now the posterior mean over the distribution at $G(B_{1})$ will be $$\mathbb{E}[G(B_{1})] = \frac{\frac{a}{a+n}H(B_{1})+\frac{1}{a+n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{x_{i}}(B_{1})}{\frac{a}{a+n}H(B_{1})+\frac{1}{a+n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{x_{i}}(B_{1}) + \frac{a}{a+n}H(B_{2})+\frac{1}{a+n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{x_{i}}(B_{2})} \\ =\frac{a}{a+n}H(B_{1})+\frac{1}{a+n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\delta_{x_{i}}(B_{1}) $$ In a similar way you can calculate the rest. A really good book that you can read is the "Bayesian Nonparametric Data Analysis" of Peter MÃ¼ller.
