Relationship between standard deviations of partitioned subsets and the standard deviation of the whole set?

Let's say we know the standard deviation of a set of data. Furthermore, that set of data can be partitioned into subsets, and we know the standard deviation for each subset of that partition. What's the relationship between those standard deviations and the one for the whole set? Is it simple, like an average, or more complicated?
