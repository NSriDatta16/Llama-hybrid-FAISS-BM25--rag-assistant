Differences between a frequentist and a Bayesian density prediction

What are some essential differences between a frequentist density forecast/prediction and a Bayesian posterior for an outcome of a random variable? Of course, there will be differences in how they are obtained (via frequentist vs. Bayesian estimation), but I am interested in differences in addition to that. E.g. from a user's perspective, given a frequentist density forecast/prediction vs. a Bayesian posterior, should I treat them differently in any essential way?
