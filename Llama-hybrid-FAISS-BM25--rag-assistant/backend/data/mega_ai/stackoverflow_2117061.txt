They're both pretty much the same as far as I know. WP has more plugins, it's easier to install themes for it and it's more popular. It's got a worse security record though. Textpattern is also robust, customisable and has decent plugins (though not as much as WP). It doesn't have the easy drag/drop theme installation as does WP (last time I checked anyway) but has a better security record in general. I personally find the whole look a little more tasteful than WP which seems to try too hard but that's just a personal opinion. Drupal is heavier, more customisable and a different beast from WP and textpattern. Your needs would be different if you wanted that. All of them do decent SEO by default as far as I know. Alteast I know that WP and Drupal do it well. TP too from what I remember. You should just ask the outsourced developer for concrete reasons why to use TP instead of WP. Engineering reasons, tradeoffs, pros, cons, statistics, numbers. Make it clear to him that you're not going to let the project hinge on his personal preferences.
