multilevel logistic regression via maximum likelihood in R

I want to develop a mixed effect logistic regression in R using likelihood function and compare the results (estimated parameters) with the output of glmer function. I couldn't find a good material for the likelihood formulation. So, just explain my panel dataset and put the code I have written for simple logistic regression. My panel dataset is "try" and the response variable is "happy" which is binary and has two levels (yes=1 or No=0). I have started with adding one independent variable (x) to model. I have Ã¯d" column in my data which shows the observations who belong to same individual (observations are nested within individuals). Here is the code for binary logit model without random effect. How can I add random effect for id column to my code and get same results as glmer gives. my data is something like: happy x id 0 1 1 0 2 1 0 1 2 1 1 2 0 1 3 1 2 3 0 1 2 0 1 3 1 1 3 . . . . . . 'LL %mutate(p=1/(1+exp(-b_00-b_11*x))) data %mutate(loglik=happy*log(p)+(1-happy)*log(1-p)) return(-sum(data$loglik))}' I want to write the code with same results as below function: model = glmer(happy~x+ (1 |id), data=try, family = binomial)
