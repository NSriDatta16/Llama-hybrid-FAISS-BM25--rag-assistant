Stationarity of time series with product of white noise time series

Is the time series $\{Yt\}$ given by $Y_{t} = Z_{t} - \frac{1}{2}Z_{t-1}Z_{t-2}$ With $Z_{t} \sim{N}(0\,1)$ , weakly stationary? I do not know how to check if the above stated formula is stationary? I am struggling how to interpret the product of the same white noise time series with different lag?
