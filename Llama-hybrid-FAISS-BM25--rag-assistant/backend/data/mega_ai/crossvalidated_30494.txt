No, for several reasons. The Chi square statistic cannot take into account the ordered nature of your response. It will be very difficult to incorporate the longitudinal (before and after) nature of the data into an appropriate cross tab; and if you could, it would only show that there had been a change, not the direction of the change. I would consider calculating the change in each student's score between the pre and post test. This would give you an ordinal rating between -3 and 3 for each of them against the five variables (plan, implementation, testing, precision, and translate to flowchart), Then look for statistically significant evidence that on average this rating is positive. This approach has a lot in common with a paired t-test if you want to look at the literature.
