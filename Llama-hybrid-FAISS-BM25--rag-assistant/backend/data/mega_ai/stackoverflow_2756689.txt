Proxy Authentication Error while calling FedEx webservice

I am trying to call the FedEx tracking webservice. Currently I am running the sample application provided by FedEx itself (Added my test account number and other details). When I run the application, I get the following error: The remote server returned an error: (407) Proxy Authentication Required. I am inside a proxy at my organization and I tried provided the proxy server details to the webservice client using the WebProxy class as: trackService.Proxy = WebProxy.GetDefaultProxy(); and also by providing the proxy server details as: trackService.Proxy = new WebProxy("IP",8080); But I still keep getting the same error!! Could somebody help me how to resolve this problem? Thanks in advance, Regards, Abdel Olakara
