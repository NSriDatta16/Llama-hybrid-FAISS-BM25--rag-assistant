Not sure why this didn't occur to me last night, but I was pretty tired. Heres what I decided to do: struct AbilityData { // Stuff CUtlMap ExtraData [MAX_ABILITY_LEVELS]; char **DataKeys; } Thats what my abilityData struct now looks like, and it now works, but now I want to reorganize it to be like: struct AbilityData { // Stuff CUtlMap ExtraData; char **DataKeys; } Because it makes more sense that way, but then I run into the same problem that I had before with the char array. It almost seems like to me it might just be best to ditch the whole map idea and make it like: struct AbilityData { // Stuff int *ExtraData; char **DataKeys; } Where ExtraData is now also a dynamically allocated array. The only problem with that is that I now have to get my data via a function which will loop through all the DataKeys, find a matching key for my input string, then return the ExtraData associated with it.
