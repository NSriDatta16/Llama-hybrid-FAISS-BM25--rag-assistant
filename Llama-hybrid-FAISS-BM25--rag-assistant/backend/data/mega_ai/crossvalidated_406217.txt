It seems to me that a regression model might be adequate in your case. In the regression model, the outcome $y$ is the dependent variable and you have several independent variables $x_j$ , the treatment variable $x_1$ and the other variables that may act as confounders (variables that may also affect $y$ besides $x_1$ ). The choice of model depends on the characteristics of your data, I'll present two examples. One of the simplest regression models is the linear regression , where the outcome $y$ is modelled as a linear combination of the independent variables $x_j$ . If the effect of the treatment $x_1$ is statistically significant, you could infer that treatment affects the outcome. However, it seems to me that the outcome $y(t)$ is a time series and there might be a memory effect, i.e., $y(t+1)$ is related with $y(t)$ . In this case, it might be more appropriate to look into more complex models, like the autoregressive integrated moving average - ARIMA model.
