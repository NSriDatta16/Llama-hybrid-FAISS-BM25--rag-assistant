Memory protection is enforced in hardware, typically with a minimum granularity on the order of KBs. From the Wikipedia article about memory protection : In paging, the memory address space is divided into equal, small pieces, called pages. Using a virtual memory mechanism, each page can be made to reside in any location of the physical memory, or be flagged as being protected. Virtual memory makes it possible to have a linear virtual memory address space and to use it to access blocks fragmented over physical memory address space. Most computer architectures based on pages, most notably x86 architecture, also use pages for memory protection. A page table is used for mapping virtual memory to physical memory. The page table is usually invisible to the process. Page tables make it easier to allocate new memory, as each new page can be allocated from anywhere in physical memory. By such design, it is impossible for an application to access a page that has not been explicitly allocated to it, simply because any memory address, even a completely random one, that application may decide to use, either points to an allocated page, or generates a page fault (PF) error. Unallocated pages simply do not have any addresses from the application point of view.
