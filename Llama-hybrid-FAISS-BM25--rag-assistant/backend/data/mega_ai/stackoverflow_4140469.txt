*This should be a comment, not an answer, but it won't fit into that little box, so I'm putting it here. Don't hold it against me :-) Anyways, to continue somewhat onto @steabert's comment on his answer. OpenMP and MPI are two different things; one rarely gets to choose between the two since it's more dictated by your architecture than personal choice. As far as learning concepts of paralellism go, I would recommend OpenMP any day; it is simpler and one easily continues the transition to MPI later on. But, that's not what I wanted to say. This is - a few days back from now, Intel has announced that it has started supporting Co-Arrays , a F2008 feature previously only supported by g95. They're not intending to put down g95, but the fact remains that Intel's compiler is more widely used for production code, so this is definitely an interesting line of developemnt. They also changed some things in their Visual Fortran Compiler (the name, for a start :-) More info after the link: http://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-compilers/
