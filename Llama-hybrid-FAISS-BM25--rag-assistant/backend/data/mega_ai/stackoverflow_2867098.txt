jquery sidebar menu

I'm looking for a jQuery plugin sidebar menu with horizontal collapse/expand and hopefully drag-n-drop resize. It would nice if it take the following list for menu options: option 1 sub-option A option 2 option 3 Does anyone have recommendations or suggestions? I like the approach of jQuerySideBar Plugin but would prefer something a little simpler and more flexible.
