Rob, I understand the documentation the same way that you do. I noticed that it is also possible to swap the MergedDictionaries like so, and still receive the same runtime exception: From the documentation under "Merged Resource Dictionaries" : In terms of the lookup sequence, a MergedDictionaries dictionary is checked only after checking all the keyed resources of the ResourceDictionary that declared MergedDictionaries. Then, each of the dictionaries within MergedDictionaries is checked, in the inverse of the order that they are declared within the MergedDictionaries property. In other words, the retrieval logic from within the collection of merged resource dictionaries is last in, first out. It seems like you can override certain Keys defined in ResourceDictionaries by including them in this order, but you're not able to reference a style from one dictionary defined before another in the lookup sequence. This is frustrating and not intuitive. I guess this would be useful if you had a collection of "blue" styles and wanted to override them with a set of "orange" styles for a different client. You would accomplish this by including the orange keys below the blue keys in your MergedDictionaries collection, so they are found first in the Resource lookup sequence. Anyways, I share your frustration and hope for a feature like this at some point in the near future.
