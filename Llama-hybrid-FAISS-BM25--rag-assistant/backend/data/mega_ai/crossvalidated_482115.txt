Transformation of time series into and from images using recurrence plots

It is possible to transform time series into images (recurrence plots) as shown here . However, I wonder if it's possible to transform a recurrence plot back to time series? In particular, I need to determine the ranges of time series that the red-colored area (see image below) refers to. Is it possible to estimate? For example, light color may refer to a peak in time series or something similar... Any comment and recommendation will be highly evaluated. Thanks in advance.
