How does an individual feature affect predictions in neural network classification problem?

In the literature, I've come across statements like People with higher income and with long working hours are more likely to be diagnosed with chronic diseases such as stroke . The above-mentioned study (Page:8), explores the association between Behavioral Habits and Chronic Diseases using ANN. As I'm new to ML, I am unable to figure out how to make such conclusions with feature study in neural networks or other machine learning techniques. Is there a way to quantify the likelihood in ANN similar to logistic regression wherein regression coefficients give the change in the log odds of the outcome for a one unit increase in the predictor variable? Currently using Azure ML studio
