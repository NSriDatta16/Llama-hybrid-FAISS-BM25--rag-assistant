Fix for background-position in IE

I get this problem in IE7 when running a piece of code that uses jquery and 2 jquery plugins. The code works in FF3 and Chrome. The full error is: Line: 33 Char: 6 Error: bg is null or not an object Code: 0 URL: http://localhost/index2.html However line 33 is a blank line. I am using 2 plugins: draggable and zoom. No matter what I do to the code it is always line 33 that is at fault. I check the source has update via view source but I feel this could be lying to me. $(document).ready(function() { $('#draggable').drag(); $('#zoom').zoom({target_div:"draggable", zoom_images:new Array('tiles/mapSpain-smaller.jpg', 'tiles/mapSpain.jpg') }); }); Essentially what I am trying to do is recreate the Pragmatic Ajax map demo with jQuery. It would appear that the second line of this snippet is causing the trouble: bg = $(this).css('background-position'); if(bg.indexOf('%')>1){ It seems to be trying to select the background-position property of #draggable and not finding it? Manually adding a background-position: 0 0; didn't fix it. Any ideas on how to get around this problem? I tried using the MS Script Debugger but that is nearly useless. Can't inspect variables or anything else.
