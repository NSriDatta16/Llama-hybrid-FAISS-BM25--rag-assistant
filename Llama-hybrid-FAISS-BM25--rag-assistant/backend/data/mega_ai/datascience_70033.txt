State of the Art/Research 2020 of Time Series Forecasting/Prediction

Im looking for the state of the art/research of time series data for forcasting/prediction. As far as im aware it is Extrem Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) or LSTM (neuronal networks) or are there other algorithms/models/methods which achieve good results. I have a very small dataset less than 1000 data points. my guess/results are that LSTM has way to less data and XGBoost is the better alternative but im fairly new to forcasting so maybe im missing a method/model.
