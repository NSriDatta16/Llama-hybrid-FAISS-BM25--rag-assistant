Robert's last xsl:variable is good for getting a result tree fragment containing the matching text values, but unless (as he suggests) you use EXSLT or MS extensions to XSLT 1.0 to convert the RTF to a node set, you can't get a count of the matching text nodes. Here is the XSLT stylesheet I mentioned in my prior response that recurs over the sample input document I gave to give a count of text nodes in set 1 for which a node in set 2 matches part or all of it: Not particularly concise, but because XSLT does not let programmers assign new values to already-defined variables, recursion is often necessary. I don't see a way in XSLT 1.0 to get a count of the sort requested by Zack using xsl:for-each .
