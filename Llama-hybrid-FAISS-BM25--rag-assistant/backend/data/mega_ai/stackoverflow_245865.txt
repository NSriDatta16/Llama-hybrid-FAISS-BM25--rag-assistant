Relying on the GC 'works' in most instances. The classic exception is when you have a resource heavy interaction - in that instance it is best to explicilty dispose. obvious eg. using (var conn = new SqlConnection(connString)) {} 'Using' blocks are definitely the cleanest and most robust method of ensuring that objects are disposed of correctly. 'Using' blocks can be leveraged with any objects that implements IDisposable.
