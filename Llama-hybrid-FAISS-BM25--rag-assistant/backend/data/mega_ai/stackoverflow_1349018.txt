It sounds like you might be building layer-upon-layer of fix it code to a deficient design or process. If you are getting the username-password dialog for every image from the same directory, I initially suspect: htaccess is somehow misconfigured. Can you show us what you have? The user-agent isn't sending the authorization header. Look at the HTTP requests to verify that you see an Authorization header. Also look at the response status. Is it 401 or 403? If you are trying to access resources at different paths, are you using a different realm for every folder? The credentials only apply to the realm that presented the challenge. If you access another realm and you have to start over. How are you specifying that in your htaccess? Some other things that could help us: What sort of authentication are you using? Basic, Digest, something else? Are you using a custom authorization handler?
