You should be able to set up a renderbuffer that has a texture backing it using code like the following: // Offscreen position framebuffer object glGenFramebuffers(1, &positionFramebuffer); glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, positionFramebuffer); glGenRenderbuffers(1, &positionRenderbuffer); glBindRenderbuffer(GL_RENDERBUFFER, positionRenderbuffer); glRenderbufferStorage(GL_RENDERBUFFER, GL_RGBA8_OES, FBO_WIDTH, FBO_HEIGHT); glFramebufferRenderbuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0, GL_RENDERBUFFER, positionRenderbuffer); // Offscreen position framebuffer texture target glGenTextures(1, &positionRenderTexture); glBindTexture(GL_TEXTURE_2D, positionRenderTexture); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MIN_FILTER, GL_LINEAR); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_MAG_FILTER, GL_LINEAR); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_S, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE); glTexParameteri(GL_TEXTURE_2D, GL_TEXTURE_WRAP_T, GL_CLAMP_TO_EDGE); glTexImage2D(GL_TEXTURE_2D, 0, GL_RGBA, FBO_WIDTH, FBO_HEIGHT, 0, GL_RGBA, GL_UNSIGNED_BYTE, 0); glFramebufferTexture2D(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, GL_COLOR_ATTACHMENT0, GL_TEXTURE_2D, positionRenderTexture, 0); Switching buffers is as simple as using code like this: glBindFramebuffer(GL_FRAMEBUFFER, positionFramebuffer); glViewport(0, 0, FBO_WIDTH, FBO_HEIGHT); You can then render to that buffer and display the resulting texture by passing it into a simple shader that displays it within a rectangular piece of geometry. That texture can also be fed into a shader which renders into another similar renderbuffer that is backed by a texture, and so on. If you need to do some CPU-based processing or readout, you can use glReadPixels() to pull in the pixels from this offscreen renderbuffer. For examples of this, you can try out my sample applications here and here . The former does processing of video frames from a camera, with one of the settings allowing for a passthrough of the video while doing processing in an offscreen renderbuffer. The latter example renders into a cube map texture at one point, then uses that texture to do environment mapping on a teapot.
