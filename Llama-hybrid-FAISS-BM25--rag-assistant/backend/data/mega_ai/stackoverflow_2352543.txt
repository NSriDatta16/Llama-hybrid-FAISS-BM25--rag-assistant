Implementing Recursive Comments in PHP/MySQL

I'm trying to write a commenting system, where people can comment on other comments, and these are displayed as recursive threads on the page. ( Reddit's Commenting system is an example of what I'm trying to achieve), however I am confused on how to implement such a system that would not be very slow and computationally expensive. I imagine that each comment would be stored in a comment table, and contain a parent_id, which would be a foreign key to another comment. My problem comes with how to get all of this data without a ton of queries, and then how to efficiently organize the comments into the order belong in. Does anyone have any ideas on how to best implement this?
