Can you connect to the database in question with the credentials in question (all the stuff in database.yml)? "mysql -u your_user -p" from the command line? When you installed the mysql gem did it properly build the native extensions? What happens when you gem install mysql --force (to re-install it)? Does it look happy? Have you ever done this before? Is the problem as likely to be a lack of experience with rails/mysql or both? Or is this old hat and you just can't figure it out this time? If the former, the tutorial in the pragramatic agile web development with rails is quite good (as is the rest of the book). Hope something there helps.
