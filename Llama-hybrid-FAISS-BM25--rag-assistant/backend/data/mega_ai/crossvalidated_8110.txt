The coefficients in the logistic regression represent the tendency for a given region/demographic to vote Republican, compared to a reference category. A positive coefficent means that region is more likely to vote Republican, and vice-versa for a negative coefficient; a larger absolute value means a stronger tendency than a smaller value. The reference categories are "Northeast" and "urban voter", so all the coefficients represent contrasts with this particular voter type. In general, there's also no restriction on the coefficients in a logistic regression to be in [0, 1], even in absolute value. Notice that the Wikipedia article itself has an example of a logistic regression with coefficients of -5 and 2.
