Rewritepath and IIS Integrated Mode

I have big issue with url-rewriting for IIS 7.0. I've written simple module for rewriting for my NET3.5/IIS7 web application. Here is a part of the code. public void Init(HttpApplication context) { context.BeginRequest += new EventHandler(context_BeginRequest); } void context_BeginRequest(object sender, EventArgs e) { HttpApplication app = sender as HttpApplication; if (app.Request.Path.Contains("pagetorewrite.aspx")) HttpContext.Current.RewritePath("~/otherpage.aspx"); } And I register my module in web.config : Under IIS 7.0 (Vista) using Classic ASP Pipeline it works perfect, but when I change pipeline mode to Integrated, then it stops working. There are no exceptions, errors and anything in debugger/events/logfiles - only message in a browser that page was not found. The stragnest thing is that pagename looks like mispelled or merged from parts of original page and rewrte-to page. I've deployed my code at another computer (also vista -but x64- and iis 7.0) and it works perfect in both modes. It looks that there's an configuration issue or what?
