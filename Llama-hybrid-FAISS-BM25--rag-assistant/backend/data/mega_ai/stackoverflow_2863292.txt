One simple metric would be to take all n*(n-1)/2 substrings in each string, and see how many overlap. There are some simple variations to this approach where you only look at substrings up to a certain length. This would be similar to the BLEU score commonly used to evaluate machine translations. In the case of BLEU, they are comparing two sentences: they take all the unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, and 4-grams of words from each sentence. They calculate a version of precision and recall for each, and essentially use an average of those scores.
