Gradient Boosting: When to stop doing manual feature engineering?

As an example Let's assume we do have feature-columns $X_1$ and $X_2$ and $X_3$ and target $Y$, and it just so happens that $Y$ is the noisy spearman correlation of the three features. Would it help if you manually added the spearman correlation as a fourth feature? Or will gradient boosting 'learn' this anyway and adding it manually is not needed? In general Are there general rules of thumb which kind of feature engineering helps gradient boosting and which doesn't? When should one stop adding features? Is there a maximum number of features (dimensionality) where gradient boosting starts to lose effectiveness?
