What test can I use to prove there is an upward trend in time series of ratios assesment in R?

I have a database where experiments are stored. Each experiment has a flag, which says that it was properly registered. I am trying to show with a statistical test, that there is a trend in time that experients are increasingly properly registered (ratio column; rising from 56% in 2006 to 72% in 2011) > print(ascii(c,include.rownames=F,format='nice'),type='org') | year | all_experiments | properly registered | ratio | |------+-----------------+---------------------+-------| | 2006 | 6431 | 3604 | 56.04 | | 2007 | 7013 | 3990 | 56.89 | | 2008 | 8285 | 4899 | 59.13 | | 2009 | 7523 | 5063 | 67.3 | | 2010 | 7296 | 5210 | 71.41 | | 2011 | 7243 | 5243 | 72.39 | What statistical approach should I use to prove it. Do I do take just the percentages, plot them and show that I can fit a line through the data and point to the slope of that line: how do I do that? Is it enough? Is there any more complicated test which takes into into account the numbers behind the percentages, and how would I do it? I also need to compute the analysis within R so a generic help is useful but also hints to what commands to use within R would be best. The data partitioned by year come from the same dataset and were produced like this: a = ddply(s1b,.(format(First.Received, "%Y")) ,.fun=function(x) nrow(x)) b = ddply(s1b,.(format(First.Received, "%Y")) ,.fun=function(x) nrow(subset(x,properly_registered==1))) ...
