ANTLR: Parsing 2-digit numbers when other numeric literals are also possible

I'm writing a grammar for a moderately sized language, and I'm trying to implement time literals of the form hh:mm:ss . However, whenever I try to parse, for example, 12:34:56 as a timeLiteral , I get mismatched token exceptions on the digits. Does anyone know what I might be doing wrong? Here are the relevant rules as currently defined: timeLiteral : timePair COLON timePair COLON timePair -> ^(TIMELIT timePair*) ; timePair : DecimalDigit DecimalDigit ; NumericLiteral : DecimalLiteral ; fragment DecimalLiteral : DecimalDigit+ ('.' DecimalDigit+)? ; fragment DecimalDigit : ('0'..'9') ;
