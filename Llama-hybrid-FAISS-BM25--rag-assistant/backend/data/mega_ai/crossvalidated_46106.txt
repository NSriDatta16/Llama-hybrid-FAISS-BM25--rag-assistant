How do I find fields related to a class in a naive bayesian classifier?

I've built a naive bayesian classifier which classifies a binary category (either in or out). I have a number of variables which the classifier gets trained on v1, v2, v3, v4, v5, etc. How do I identify which variables contribute more or less to the overall classification? EDIT: I'm still working on this problem, but I think I've found an appropriate answer. Information gain ratio. Wikipedia says: "Information gain ratio is between 0 and 1, cf. ordinary information gain". [1] Which seems like exactly what I want. I can calculate IGR, and then use that to weight each feature. I also get a very intuitive list of which features are related to my target class, which I can use to make decisions in the real world.
