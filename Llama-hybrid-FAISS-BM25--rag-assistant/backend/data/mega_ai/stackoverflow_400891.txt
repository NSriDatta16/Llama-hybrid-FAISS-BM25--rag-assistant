Is it possible to constrain the height of an Infragistics grid?

I've tried Infragistics on this but they don't seem to understand what I am asking and it takes days to get an answer so please help! I need to place an Infragistics web grid into either a div or a table cell. The grid must size to fit the div or cell. If there is too much data to display, I need the grid to do its magic and add its own scrollbars. So far I have achieved this using javascript and resizeing every time the browser window resizes. Unfortunately when refreshing the page (using AJAX), the grids resize themselves to their default sizes for a second before correcting but this is not acceptable to the customer (or me for that matter). It is irritating that width=100% works but height=100% does not. I find that it just extends out of the div or table (not even resizing the div, just expanding out of it). I have tried the KB article that sets the height and width to 100% and the frame custom rules to table-layout:auto but this doesn't work. UPDATE I created a test project with a 500px tall table, two rows (each 50% height) and two cells per row to give a 2 x 2 grid. If I set the Infragistics grid height to 100% within a cell, it fits perfectly until you bind it to data. It then extends, making the table more than 500px high. I tried putting a 100% x 100% div in one of the cells and the grid in this. Then the table stays the correct size but the grid grows in height by the size of a row and extends out of the div and the cell :-( I am starting to wonder if the Infragistics web controls are as good as they should be. They certainly don't seem to be as good as the Windows versions.
