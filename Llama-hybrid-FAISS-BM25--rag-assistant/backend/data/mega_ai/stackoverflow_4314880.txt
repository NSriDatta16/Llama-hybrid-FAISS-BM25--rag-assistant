Don't do that. The event log is not designed for such an activity: It has a maximum size. When the maximum size is reached, it can overwrite events or stop logging, depending on settings (recent Windows can also archive the log and start a new one). If events are not overwritten, they can fill your partition or block other applications until the logs are manually cleared. The event log is not a general logging facility. It should be used to report errors, situations that needs attention, and even informative reports, but not every little bit of information one has to write somewhere. If you have heavt log needs, use your own log facilities and report issues - if any - in the event log with a "pointer" where to find detailed data if needed. NOTE: if really the event log is needed, at least the application should use its own log destination, not one of the standard ones (application or even worse system). This way it won't impact other applications operations, and won't "hide" other application events "flooding" the log with its events, making more difficult to spot the others without looking for them.
