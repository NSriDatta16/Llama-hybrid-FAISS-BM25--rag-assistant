If you need to display the actual users currently logged in, you're better off using a column in your users mysql table to track the current login state, and doing a periodical request via a cronjob, and store that info in a .txt file so that you can do the query just once for all logged in users and share the result by including it in your rendered html. The other method (reading inside the session folder storage) is possible but more complex and probably less effective, although i haven't done any benchmarks. It just feels very hacky.
