I don't have a huge amount of experience with Ruby on Rails, or MVC work in general, but I think you're going about it the right way. You generally want a model object (and by extension, database table) for data-oriented resources... That is, your models should correspond to your "nouns". Your controller's actions are your "verbs", and to me it makes perfect sense to categorize them how you like. In this case, I would say that putting a bunch of "verbs" under financials , which interact with two model object types as needed, makes sense IF AND ONLY IF it makes sense to you for you to organize it like this. (Bear in mind that you can also evaluate how well organized and intuitive the corresponding URLs feel to you, though I'm sure most MVC purists would add that you should never just rely on examining the URLs!) So in summary, I think you're doing everything right here, as long as it makes sense to you. Yes, you'll have to write your views and controller actions yourself, though you can start using ruby script/generate controller financials action1 action2 [...] ; that at least gives you skeletons of the view files and empty controller actions.
