During the latest WWDC10 they made a point of encouraging developers to use the more current LLVM compiler. I forget the exact tract that they covered it in detail - one of the "new in Xcode". Basically they suggest using LLVM-2.0 when possible, otherwise LLVM-GCC and to avoid GCC alone completely.
