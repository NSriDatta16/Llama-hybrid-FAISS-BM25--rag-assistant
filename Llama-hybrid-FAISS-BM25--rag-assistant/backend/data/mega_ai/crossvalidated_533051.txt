Sequence learning from farm operations data

I need to generalize a single sequence from N sequences entailing farming tasks/operations and ultimately plotting it on Gantt chart. There are a total let's assume N sequences = n (total fields) * t (number of years) Which ML/deep learning algorithm can learn from N sequences and create a single sequence that best represents overall data. Each field has tasks/operations occurring in a sequence eg. A,B,C and respectively requiring t days (duration variable). # Sequence for field 1 in year 2019 field1 = pd.DataFrame({"task name": [A,B,C], "start": [pd.Timestamp("2019-04-09 12:00:00"),pd.Timestamp("2019-05-01 12:00:00"), pd.Timestamp("2019-06-03 12:00:00")], "end": [pd.Timestamp("2019-04-14 23:37:56 "),pd.Timestamp("2019-05-06 00:06:25"),pd.Timestamp("2019-06-04 00:08:13")], "duration": [6 days, 6 days,2 days,]}) Similarly there are other N sequences for each n fields. Tricky part of the problem: 1. Data is not homogenous, since fields belongs to different farmers and differ in farm size. Minority of tasks are varying across fields My final objective is to plot a Gantt chart of a single sequence that best represents/indicator of sequence of tasks and its respective duration for a crop used by a farmer.
