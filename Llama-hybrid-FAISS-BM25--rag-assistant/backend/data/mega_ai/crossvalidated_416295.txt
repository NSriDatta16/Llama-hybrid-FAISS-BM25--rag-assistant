Stepwise linear regression is a method wherein the features are selected one by one (if starting with no variables and slowly adding to the model) or removed (if starting with all the variables) so that the model is improved. It is a greedy algorithm where it finds the best solution at that particular step but does not find the over all best solution. I am fairly new to Data Science. Let me know if I'm wrong.
