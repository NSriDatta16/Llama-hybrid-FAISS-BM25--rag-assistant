I don't know of a good summary document or great example code, but a Bing search for "F# XElement" (consider also with "site:stackoverflow.com" or "site:hubfs.net") seems to provide some good leads. Briefly, I think the .Net APIs for XML already have good stuff here, so it's just a matter of leveraging them from F#.
