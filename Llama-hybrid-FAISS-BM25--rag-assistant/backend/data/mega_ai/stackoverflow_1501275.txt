If you want an actual pop-up button for the toolbar item, set an NSPopUpButton as the toolbar item's view. In Interface Builder 3.2.1 (I don't know when this ability was actually introduced), you can drill down to the toolbar in the hierarchical list of objects in the nib window, and drag a pop-up button from the Library palette into the toolbar in the list. IB will wrap the button in a toolbar item for you.
