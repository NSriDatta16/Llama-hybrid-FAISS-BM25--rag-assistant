Since it is possible to format a CNN as an MLP the best we could possibly do with an MLP is the same as the we could possibly do with a CNN. To see this, take a trained CNN and copy it's weights once for each input pixel (and channel if using multiple channels). Repeat this process with subsequent layers. Now we have an MLP that is equivalent to the CNN.
