If you are doing the analysis for serious research projects, I would recommend not to remove any questions. As you said, "The questionnaire has been used for several years." That means they seem to work pretty well previously. Unless you have evidence that these questions are not valid measurement items, keeping them would be better. Another reason is that you have 30 questions falling into 7 major categories. That is to say, on average each category (I would like to call it a subconstruct) only has around 4 questions/items. Removing questions from your current pool might lead to some subconstruct having not sufficient number of items to accurately measure them. Generally it is hard to accurately measure a construct with just 2 or 3 items (usually Cronbach's alpha would be low). You need to take into account how the question removal would impact your measurement model. I would say having a valid measurement model is much more important than reducing the number of questions. I only recommend you to remove some subconstructs (categories) if they are not very relevant to your analysis. Not all the categories are equal. Only keep those that are important to your study. In this way, you can remove questions associated with those unimportant categories and at the same time still be able to build valid measurement models for those important categories. Technically speaking, you can conduct a pilot study to collect data with all questions. If you already collected the full data in a previous study, it would be fine to reuse the old data. Then use factor analysis in statistics packages such as R to see if some questions are not highly loaded to their categories. For an example, refer to https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/factor.html . For those questions having small leadings (
