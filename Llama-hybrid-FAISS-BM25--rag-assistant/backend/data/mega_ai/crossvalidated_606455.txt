I'm only familiar with the general outline of Callaway and Sant'Anna's approach so I can't say anything definite about this. However, the other main approach that's arisen in response to this problem is to simply run two regressions, the first utilizing untreated observations to estimate (impute) group and time fixed effects, and the second to estimate the average treatment effect after the group and time effects previously estimated are subtracted from observed outcomes. This approach is briefly discussed in the paper you reference. It's been independently proposed in a few different papers (all referenced by Chaisemartin and D'Haultf√¶uille). Gardner (2022) offers a very intuitive outline of the idea. I'd recommend you start there.
