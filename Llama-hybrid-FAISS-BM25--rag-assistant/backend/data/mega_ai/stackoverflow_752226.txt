You have the answer already. Don't open such a huge dataset in a ClientDataSet (CDS). Three million rows in a CDS is a huge memory load (depending on the size of each row, it can be gigantic). The whole purpose of using a CDS is to work quickly with small datasets that can be manipulated in memory. Adding that many rows is ridiculous; use a real dataset instead, or redesign things so you don't need to retrieve so many rows at a time.
