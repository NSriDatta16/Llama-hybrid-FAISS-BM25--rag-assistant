How to use ordinal logistics regression with random effects, ability to assess model fit, and test multiple hypotheses?

I am trying to perform an ordinal logistic regression in R and have recently attempted to use clmm2() function from the ordinal package. Unfortunately I've come to a roadblock. How do I assess model fit? How do I test multiple hypotheses by comparing AIC values of multiple models if I also need to assess the proportional odds assumption? The data I'm dealing with: The ordered response variable is the consistency of bird food availability. We asked respondents to give us the percent days food was available for each season. I then bucketed it into none, pulsed, constant. So I have four rows for each respondent, making respondent a random variable in the model. I have multiple predictors: season, age, etc.
