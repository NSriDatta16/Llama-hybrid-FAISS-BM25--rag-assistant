Reading binary file from sdcard using Stream classes in android

Can anybody have any idea how to read a binary file which resides in sdcard using Streams, like Inputstream , CountingInputStream or SwappedDataInputStream ? I am using these three streams to read a file which is currently in the Resources folder , but now I want to move that file in sdcard but I cannot change these stream because I have done so much work on it and I cannot roll back my work. I am doing it this way but its giving me FileNotFoundException . I need your help please. AssetManager assetManager = getResources().getAssets(); final File folder = new File(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory() + "/map"); boolean success = false; if(!folder.exists()){ success = folder.mkdir(); } else { Log.i("folder already exists", "folder already exists"); } try { iStream = assetManager.open(Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory().getAbsolutePath().concat("/map/map.amf")); } catch (IOException e) { // TODO Auto-generated catch block e.printStackTrace(); } cis = new CountingInputStream(iStream); input = new SwappedDataInputStream(cis); Thanks a lot for any suggestion.
