Creating a custom capture window in Cocoa

I am trying to make a custom transparent bordered window(without tittle bar) to capture a part of the screen.This window should be resizeable from the bottom right corner area,and could be moved by dragging any of the border lines.This window should be such that, it could also be moved over the apple menu. I am very new to Cocoa, Can you please suggest me some guide or tutorial to understand creating custom windows and the event handling in custom window. I have seen the example given in the link below and it was pretty helpful,but I am not able to understand the whole code. http://cocoawithlove.com/2008/12/drawing-custom-window-on-mac-os-x.html Please give me pointers to how to make such a window or what all to refer to have sufficient knowledge to be able to do it. Thanks :)
