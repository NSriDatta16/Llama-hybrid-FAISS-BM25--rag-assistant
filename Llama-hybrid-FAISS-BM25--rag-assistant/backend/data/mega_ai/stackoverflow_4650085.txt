Bertaud, I think you are getting ahead of yourself a bit. You really need to understand the basics of immutability before you write any more code. (i.e. "variables" do not vary : you can only assign a value to them once.) I suggest you read the free online guide "Learn You Some Erlang For Great Good", at http://learnyousomeerlang.com/ . The section that covers the basics of variables is http://learnyousomeerlang.com/starting-out-for-real#invariable-variables .
