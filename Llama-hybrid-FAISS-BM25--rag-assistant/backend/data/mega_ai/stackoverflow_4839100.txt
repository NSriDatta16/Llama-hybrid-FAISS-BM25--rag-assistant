Another question might be: Why shouldn't Java allow control characters in its identifiers? A good principle when designing a language or other system, is to not forbid anything without good cause, since you never know how it might be used, and the less rules implementers and users have to contend with, the better. It is true that you certainly shouldn't take advantage of this, by actually embedding escapes into your variable names, and you won't see any popular libraries that expose classes with null characters in them. Certainly, this could be abused, but it isn't the language designers job to protect programmers from themselves in this way, any more than by forcing proper indentation or well-chosen variable names.
