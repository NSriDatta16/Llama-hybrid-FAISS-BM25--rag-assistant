trigger config transformation in TFS 2010 or msbuild

I'm attempting to make use of configuration transformations in a continuous integration environment. I need a way to tell the TFS build agent to perform the transformations. I was kind of hoping it would just work after discovering the config transform files (web.qa-release.config, web.production-release.config, etc...). But it doesn't. I have a TFS build definition that builds the right configurations (qa-release, production-release, etc...) and I have some specific .proj files that get built within these definitions and those contain some environment specific parameters eg: qa.web ... production.web ... I know from the output that the correct configurations are being built. Now I just need to learn how to trigger the config transformations. Is there some hocus pocus that I can add to the final .proj in the build to kick off the transform and blow away the individual transform files?
