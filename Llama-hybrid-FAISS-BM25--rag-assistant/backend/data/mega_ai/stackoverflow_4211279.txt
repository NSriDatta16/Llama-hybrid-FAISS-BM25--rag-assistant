It's likely that AJAX is extensively used for the first URL , while the second URL does not use AJAX to load important content (instead using conventional web page loading). Roughly speaking, by AJAX I mean that JavaScript code is used to load new sections into the page without reloading it entirely, leading to a "smoother" user experience. Two URLs differing only in what is after the # are actually on the same page (but can be almost like separate pages in terms of navigation), as JavaScript code can insert one of these "hashes" into the back/forward/reload history of the web browser when a user clicks on a "link" (or bookmarks the page). It can also detect when the user clicks the back button by monitoring what is known as onhashchange , loading the correct page accordingly. Note that since this is the same HTML page, the part of the URL after the # (called the "fragment identifier" by official specs) is not sent to the server until the application's JavaScript code makes the AJAX request. Why is it #! instead of just # though? The former is what Google has recently pushed to improve accessibility of such pages to search engines , which do not completely support JavaScript (or not at all). It is how if someone uses such a link in a web page, Google's crawler can follow it , because it recognizes the character sequence and rewrites the URL in a standardized manner (so the server gets all necessary information to send the page to the crawler without using AJAX).
