iid time series through different time scales

How can I show that if a time serie is iid at the scale 1 day, it is also the case at the scale 2 days? More precisely, I am considering financial returns. I have iid daily returns $$r_{t,1d}=\frac{p_t}{p_{t-1}}-1$$, how can I justify that the 2 days returns such as $$r_{t,2d}=\frac{p_t}{p_{t-2}}-1=(1+r_{t-1,1d})(1+r_{t,1d})-1$$ are iid ?
