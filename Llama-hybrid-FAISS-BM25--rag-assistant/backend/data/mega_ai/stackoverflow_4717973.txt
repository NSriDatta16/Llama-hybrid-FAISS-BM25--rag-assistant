In our application we currently use Com4J for COM Control Access, but we noticed that some ActiveX controls have poorly implemented dispatch functions (if I understood this correctly), so we have to choose for each control if we use: Com4J to access it directly A VB6 Wrapper to the COM control, in which the COM control is referenced, but we have to expose wrappers for the methods we call, and call those from Com4J or, for OLE embedding The SWT COM Brigde. I worked with Jacob before, but it seemed to be very unstable (at least for the ActiveX controls I tried some time ago).
