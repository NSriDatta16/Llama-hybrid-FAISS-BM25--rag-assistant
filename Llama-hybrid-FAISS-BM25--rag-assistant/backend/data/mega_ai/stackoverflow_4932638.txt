RavenDB or SQL Server 2008 Filestream

A project I am working on at the minute involves taking a massive set of results stored in a file and doing calculations based on those results. I have been looking at using either RavenDB or using the SQL2008 with the Filestream as the storage for the results. I am not sure which technology would be best suited to my problem. Has anyone any views on which of these approaches is best for massive storage and possible searching of results?
