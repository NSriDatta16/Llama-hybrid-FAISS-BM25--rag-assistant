can a model outperform on test data then on training data

I am training Deep Neural Networks on a classification problem. N while choosing the no of epochs, I get below graph : So my question is that this case neither comes in high bias and nor in high variance. The error rate of training set is high then the test set. Is that even possible? And what do we infer from this graph (like how we would have done for the reverse case ) in terms of bias and variance?
