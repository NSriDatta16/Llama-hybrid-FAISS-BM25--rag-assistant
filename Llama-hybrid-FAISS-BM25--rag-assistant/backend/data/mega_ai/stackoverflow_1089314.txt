Dialog Units are based on properties of the font used by the dialog. A horizontal dialog unit is equal to 1/4th the average width of the current font. A vertical dialog unit is equal to 1/8th the average character height of the current font. I'd recommend using method 2 (MapDialogRect() for a 4 x 8 dialog) to figure out how many DLUs 800x600 corresponds to on your output display then make a reference form equal to that size. You can later use that reference form while you're designing. p.s.-I'm glad Visual Studio no longer emphasizes dialog units since they were always a pain to deal with.
