Facebook application disabled due to suspected phishing activity. Where did I go wrong?

New applications need to use OAuth 2.0 I used the code from this blog for authentication: http://kartiklad.com/ $redirect_url = 'http://url-of-site-for-canvas-app.com/authorize/'; $oauth_url = 'https://graph.facebook.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=' . $client_id . '&redirect_uri=' . $redirect_url . '&type=user_agent&&display=' . $display . '&scope=' . $scope; I created a folder called authorize and redirected the user here to exchange the session token. Then once the 'code' parameter is not empty the app code starts getting executed. The thing is that the above code in the blog worked like a charm. My app almost got to the point where it could have gone viral. Almost 100 new users everyday and suddenly I get this notice saying it is suspected of phishing activity. This is the official link: http://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/ NOTE: My app asks for user permission in the beginning and once the user logs in the result gets displayed automatically on his wall and a photo gets uploaded into the photo album. I asked for all the necessary permissions before the user got into my app. Maybe this has something to do with it? I saw another popular app doing this with no problems.
