There are hidden problems with permutation tests, the first and foremost being their reliance on choosing the “correct” statistic to permute. With heavy tails in the data distribution, the sample mean has problems with overly influential observations, and permuting the data doesn’t fix that. Using a likelihood ratio $\chi^2$ test or a Bayesian regression model implies that you have thought about the choice of the raw data model, and such thinking may involve transforming Y in a certain way. For example if Y has a log-normal distribution, one computes the mean and SD after taking log(Y), and the mean of Y on the original scale is estimated by anti-logging a function of the estimated mean and SDs of the logs.
