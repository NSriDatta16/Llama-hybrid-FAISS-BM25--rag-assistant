An inherent inconsistency in interpreting the indirect effect in a mediation analysis?

Disclaimer: I am well aware that correlation and causation are different things, yet I will here write "A causes B" to keep it short. This is in any case completely unrelated to the point I try to make. Assume that we are interested in the effect of variable $X$ on variable $Y$ , through a possible mediating effect of $M$ (all variables are assumed continuous here for simplicity). The indirect effect of $X$ on $Y$ is defined as the product of $a$ , the slope in the regression $M \sim 1+Y$ , and $b$ , the slope of $M$ in the regression $Y\sim 1+X+M$ . Now one would like to naively interpret this prodct $ab$ as follows: a change of $X$ by $+1$ induces a change of $M$ by $+a$ , which in turn induces a change of $Y$ by $+ a\times b$ . However, this interpretation is wrong , because under classical assumptions (especially no interaction between $X$ and $M$ with respect to the DV $Y$ , and a linear dependence of $\Bbb E (Y)$ on the predictors), the slope $b$ is the change in $Y$ when $M$ increases by $1$ and $X$ is kept constant . It is an "average simple effect", or simply the simple effect when there is no interaction, of $M$ on $Y$ controlling for $X$ . So on the one hand we have $X$ increasing by $1$ causes $M$ to increase by $a$ which causes $Y$ to increase by $a\times b$ and on the other hand we have the claim that increasing $M$ by $a$ induces an increase of $Y$ by $a\times b$ requires keeping $X$ constant . This is contradictory and goes to show that the naive interpretation of the indirect effect $a\times b$ is wrong. What would be a more satisfactory interpretation of it then?
