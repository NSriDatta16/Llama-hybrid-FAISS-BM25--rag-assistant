Convolutional layers without pooling

I am studying the CNN architecture of the AlexNet, and I have seen that it has convolutional layers without pooling in between: but I don' understand why this is done. Wouldn't be better to have something like CONV - POOLING - CONV - POOLING , and so on, instead of CONV - POOLING - CONV - CONV -CONV - POOLING? Why is this done? Thanks in advance.
