I remember a database repair tool you could download from Varien. Yeah, checked it. It still exists: Link I used that tool about a year ago with Magento 1.3.x and was able to repair a database with it successfully. I do not know, if it can be used for 1.4.x, though. They unfortunately do not state for which versions the tool can be used. Maybe it's stated in the source code. EDIT: If MySQL reports an error number 1005 from a CREATE TABLE statement, and the error message refers to error 150, table creation failed because a foreign key constraint was not correctly formed. Similarly, if an ALTER TABLE fails and it refers to error 150, that means a foreign key definition would be incorrectly formed for the altered table. You can use SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS to display a detailed explanation of the most recent InnoDB foreign key error in the server. Source: dev.mysql.com
