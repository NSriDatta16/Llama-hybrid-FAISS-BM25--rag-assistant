Typical flow for a program like ls would be Opendir on the current path. Readdir for the current path. Filter the entries returned by the OpenDir through filter provided on the command line. So typically O(n) This is the generic flow, however there are many optimizations in place for special and frequent cases (;like caching of inode numbers of recent and frequent paths. Also it depends on how directoy file are organized. In unix it is based on time of creation forcing to read every entry and increasing the look-up time to O(n). In NTFS equivalent of directory files are sorted based on name.
