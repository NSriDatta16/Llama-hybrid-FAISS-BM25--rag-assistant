What is the best way to detect and store the timezone the client of a web app is in?

I have a multi-timezone web application that stores all of the datetime values in UTC in the database, when actions happen on the server, I can easily convert the time into UTC. However, when a client enters a time or time span, what is the best way to detect and store it? I am currently doing the following: Get the value of Date.getTimezoneOffset() (javascript) Post that to the server-side code via the ICallbackEventHandler on Page. Store that value in the session On any subsequent request, calculate the output/input datetime value using the client's timezone. Regardless of the actual implementation, this seems like an in-elegant solution. Does anyone have a better method?
