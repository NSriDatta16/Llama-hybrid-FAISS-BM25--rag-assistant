For my first MVC/NHibernate project, I started with Sharp architecture and looking back I think it was a mistake: Too Many New Things : You're already learning a LOT with just MVC and NHibernate, and adding in all of the sharp architecture technologies (design by contract, specific testing patterns, IOC, etc) only complicates things. No Abstraction : Sharp architecture does not really abstract or hide away anything (like rails does). In the end, you still need to learn all the technologies that it uses, and there is a lot of up front knowledge/reading required. I found myself stopping a lot to look up a technology concept. Confusion of Tech : I began getting confused about which technologies were part of MVC and which were part of sharp architecture. I would see an attribute above a method and wonder which framework it came from. All that said, I think sharp architecture is a GREAT example of how to use all of these technologies together, but I wouldn't start it without already knowing them.
