If the previous moving average and the new heading are different by more than 180 degrees, add 360 to whichever is smaller. Then mod by 360 when storing the new moving average. So (without precise math): HDG MA 350 350 355 353 0 356 (because 353 - 0 > 180 so adjusted HDG is 360) 5 359 (likewise) 10 2 (likewise, then 362 is new MA, mod 360 to normalize) 350 356 (because 2 - 350 My hope is that this works and is more efficient than the trigonometric method described in Averaging angles (credit to Mark Ransom for referring to that).
