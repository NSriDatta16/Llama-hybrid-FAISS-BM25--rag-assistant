Since this is a dynamic webapp you need to set the appropriate http headers which will "kill" any browser or proxy cache. The usual recipe is: response.setHeader("Cache-Control", "no-cache"); //HTTP 1.1 response.setHeader("Pragma", "no-cache"); //HTTP 1.0 response.setDateHeader("Expires", 0); //prevents caching at the proxy server That way, going back to the login screen should fetch the page from server. And if your server side logic is correct, you will redirect the user to his home page or dashboard since he is already logged in.
