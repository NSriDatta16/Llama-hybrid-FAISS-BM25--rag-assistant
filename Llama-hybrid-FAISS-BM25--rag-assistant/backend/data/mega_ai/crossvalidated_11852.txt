One could use a non-parametric version of ANOVA: this is called the Kruskal-Wallis test. It is based on ranking all 17 results and computing the mean ranks within each group. The mean rank of 2.0 among the controls is obviously smaller than any other mean rank (which range from 7 to 12). However, the test p-value is only 0.0937 (based on a chi-squared approximation). Within each group (including the control), the SDs are approximately one-half the means (the "trend" in the figure). This suggests (and justifies) basing the analysis on the logarithms of the concentrations, for which the group SDs will be approximately stable. This provides 11 degrees of freedom for estimating variation, so having just two or three measurements per group is not a limitation. This observation (that using logarithms may stabilize the residuals) is important in its own right, because it indicates how best to make estimates, how to carry out future analyses on continuations of this experiment, and supports the perception that the standard deviation of the control measurements really is relatively small. (That otherwise is a weak conclusion because there are only two control measurements.) Regression (or equivalently, ANOVA) of the logs against the group identifiers has an overall p-value of 0.0521 (using an F-test with 5 and 11 degrees of freedom). This is suggestive but not quite low enough to be taken as "significant" by most journals. However, this is a two-sided test, whereas your hypothesis is one-sided. A crude adjustment is to halve the p-value to reflect this and report the result as "significant" with p approximately equal to 0.026. Because this crude adjustment is merely an approximation, you might drive the point home with a permutation test . Returning to the idea of a non-parametric analysis, we ask for the chance that the average rank of the control measurement is 2.0 or less under the null hypothesis that all 17 results were randomly associated with the 17 measurements. This is equivalent to the control having either the first and second or the first and third smallest concentrations out of the 17. The chance of the first event is $\binom{2}{2}/\binom{17}{2} = 1/136$ and the chance of the second event is the same, for a total chance of $2/136$, or 1.47%. You could even conservatively characterize the results as "all the control concentrations were among the lowest three." The chance of this is $\binom{3}{2} / \binom{17}{2}$, equal to 2.2%. In any case you have a significant result for $p \lt 0.022$.
