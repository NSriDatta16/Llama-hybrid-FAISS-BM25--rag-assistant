Some of the confidence intervals for binomial success probability $p$ are derived from asymptotic expressions and they should not be expected to work well for small $n.$ As an example, suppose I observe $n=15$ binomial trials and find $X = 1$ Success. The Wald CI, based on an asymptotic argument, uses point estimate $\hat p = x/n = 1/15.$ Then the 95% Wald CI is of the form $\hat p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\hat p(1-\hat p)}{n}}.$ Thich computes (in R) to $(-.06,0.19),$ which goes outside the interval $(0,1).$ [Among statisticians who are somehow fixated on use of the Wald interval, this inappropriate result might be reported as $(0, 0.19),$ which is not exactly true and does nothing to help the poor overall performance of the Wald interval for small $n.]$ n = 15; x = 1 p.hat = x/n CI.w = p.hat + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(p.hat*(1-p.hat)/n) CI.w [1] -0.05956701 0.19290034 By contrast, the 95% Agresti-Coull CI 'shrinks toward 1/2' to get more accurate coverage probability. (It is mentioned in one of the more recent Comments of @NickCox.) It uses the point estimate $\tilde p = (x+2)/(x+4)$ and a 95% CI is of the form $\tilde p \pm 1.96\sqrt{\frac{\tilde p(1-\tilde p)}{n+4}}.$ This interval is $(-.01, 0.32).$ It goes very slightly outside $(0,1)$ and the procedure overall comes closer to 95% coverage of $p$ than does the Wald interval. [The appending of 2 Successes and 2 Failures to the data may seem strange, but is a 'trick' that happens to make the Agresti interval closer to the somewhat more accurate Wilson interval. The trick works only for 95% CIs because it conflate 1.96 with 2.] n = 15; x = 1 p.est = (x+2)/(n+4) CI.a = p.est + qnorm(c(.025,.975))*sqrt(p.est*(1-p.est)/(n+4)) CI.a [1] -0.006065414 0.321854887 The Jeffreys CI is based on a Bayesian argument, but has very good frequentist properties. For most $n$ and values of $p,$ it comes closer to giving 95% coverage. For 95% coverage, this interval uses quantiles $.025$ , and $0.975$ of the distribution $\mathsf{Beta}(x+.5, n-x + .5).$ If you have access to software it is easy to compute, as shown below. The result is $(0.01, 0.27),$ which is usually close to the Agresti interval and, for out example, entirely contained in $(0, 1).$ [The Bayesian argument starts with a beta prior distribution which has support $(0,1)$ and thus cannot possibly give results outside that interval.] n = 15; x = 1 CI.j = qbeta(c(.025,.975), x+.5, n-x+.5) [1] 0.007290218 0.271751314 Suppose that $n = 15$ and $p = 0.1.$ Here is a brief simulation showing the probabilities that 95% CIs due to Wald (94%), Agresti (55%), and Jeffreys (0%) have negative lower confidence limits. [On average the lower confidence limits for the three types of CIs are about $-0.03, 0.01, 0.02,$ respectively.] set.seed(2020) n = 15 x = rbinom(10^6, n, .1) p.hat = x/n lcl.w = p.hat - 1.96*sqrt(p.hat*(1-p.hat)/n) mean(lcl.w Note: The Project Euclid article linked by @NickCox is somewhat similar to Brown, Cai, and DasGupta (2001), "Interval estimates for binomial proportion," Statistical Science, 16, 101-133.
