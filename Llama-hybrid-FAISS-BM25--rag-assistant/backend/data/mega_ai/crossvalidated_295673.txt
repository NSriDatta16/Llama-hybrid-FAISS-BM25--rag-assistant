Adjusting for age or age^2 in logistic regression

I'm doing a study where I'm comparing patients who are alive+event-free after 10 years of follow-up ('healthy survivors') compared to those who are not, using logistic regression to describe determinants of these healthy survivors. It makes sense that age at baseline is a major determinant that decides how big your odds are for being a healthy survivor, and I want to make sure that all determinants are adjusted for age. For example, I want to look at systolic blood pressure. This is my output. > model summary(model) Call: glm(formula = healthysurv ~ systbp + age + gender, family = "binomial", data = data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.1595 -1.0334 -0.6239 1.0547 1.9183 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) 4.312298 0.402830 10.705 I think adjusting for age^2 might be better, as I think the effect of age may be more important in the upper range than in the lower range, so I've also constructed this model and compared it using anova . > model2 summary(model2) Call: glm(formula = healthysurv ~ systbp + pol(age, 2) + gender, family = "binomial", data = data) Deviance Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.7634 -1.0799 -0.4986 1.0001 2.2235 Coefficients: Estimate Std.

If it is, it would mean that age^2 is indeed better to use for adjustment since the p-value for the anova is And am I even correct in assuming that age^2 is a good way to adjust my model? Additional question: Could I use the AICs of the models in this case?
