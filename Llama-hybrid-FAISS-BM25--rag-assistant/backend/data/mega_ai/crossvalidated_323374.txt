How is Bayesian Network specified?

I want to generate a random Bayesian Network (with about 500 variables), and then pull about 500 samples from it. What is the standard "recipe" for a Bayesian Network that will let me do that. Will starting off with $V^2$ binary matrix representing the network's connections be enough?
