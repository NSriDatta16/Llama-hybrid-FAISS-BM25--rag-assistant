If you use the VS designer (drag and drop), you will be able to add a Delay Activity into your workflow. The Delay Activity requires a Duration value which is basically a TimeSpan. For example, if you wanted to have a 5-sec delay you would need to assign Duation the following TimeSpan object: New TimeSpan(0, 0, 5); //0 hours, 0 minutes, 5 seconds Hope this helps!
