According to pcap_open_live (3): DESCRIPTION pcap_open_live() is used to obtain a packet capture handle to look at packets on the network. device is a string that specifies the network device to open; on Linux systems with 2.2 or later kernels, a device argument of "any" or NULL can be used to capture packets from all interfaces. But it seems it's deprecated now, you should use pcap_create(3)
