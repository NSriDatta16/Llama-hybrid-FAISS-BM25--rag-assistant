The AJAX request is asynchronous, meaning that IsSwap will return before the response to the AJAX request. Whatever you need to do based on isSwap , you should do in the success handler of your AJAX request. UPDATE : This last paragraph is incorrect about it working, but worth noting about synchronous not being recommended: Alternatively, you could make the AJAX request synchronous (by adding async:false to the AJAX options) and keep it how you have it - however I wouldn't recommend this as your browser will 'freeze' whilst it waits for the response.
