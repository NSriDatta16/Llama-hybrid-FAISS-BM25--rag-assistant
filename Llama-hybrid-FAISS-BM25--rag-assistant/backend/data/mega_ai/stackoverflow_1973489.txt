I'm using pdf-writer gem in ruby. While drawing a table, i need to set the shade_color and shade_color2 of table so that the rows get the alternate shade and shade2 colors. Can anyone tell me how to set them? Like table.shade2 = Color::RGB::Magenta But i have a hexa vaue like 989898. Now, how to use this. Any help is appreciated. Thanks
