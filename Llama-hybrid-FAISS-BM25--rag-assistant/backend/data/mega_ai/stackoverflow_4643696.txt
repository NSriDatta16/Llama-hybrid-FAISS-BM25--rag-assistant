Google OAuth - how to reuse access token

I am a little confused how to use Google OAuth. From what I understand, the process is this: Get request token Authorize token Get access token I can do all these steps successfully with the PHP library "oauth-php". However, I cannot figure out how to re-use the access token retrieved in the third step! NOTE: I am using oauth-php's "Session" storage. There is a "mysql" storage option, but I cannot use this as my DBA is very strict on mysql stuff. I have tried this code (which I think would be logical), but to no avail: $this->_store->addServerToken( $this->_oauthOptions['consumer_key'], // our consumer key 'access', // the request token's type $accessToken, // the request token '', // token secret - is blank (we're using OpenID + OAuth) 0 );
