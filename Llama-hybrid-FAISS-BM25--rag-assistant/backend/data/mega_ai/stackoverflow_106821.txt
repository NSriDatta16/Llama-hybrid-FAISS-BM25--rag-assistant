It's a good question. We grew our own organically, and I suspect the best way is just that. There's a bit "It depends..." in there. We put out tests in the same project, in a sub-namespace called "UnitTes" Our test classes mirror the logic class, in order to simplify keeping track of where the tests are in relation to what they are testing Classes are named like the logic class they are testing, methods are named for the scenario they are testing. We only write tests for the public and internal methods (test are in the same project), and aim for 95% coverage of the class. I prefer not to distinguish between "unit" and "intergation". To much time will be spent trying to figure out which is which...bag that! A test is a test. 100% is too difficult to achieve all the time. We aim for 95%. There's also diminishing returns on how much time it will take to get that final 5% and what it will actually catch. That's us and what suited out environment and pace. You're milage may vary. Think about your envivonment nad the personalities that are involved. I look forward to seeing what others have to say on this one!
