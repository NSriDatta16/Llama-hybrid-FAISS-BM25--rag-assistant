What is state of the art in gradient free neural network learning, esp. for images?

I've been recently looking into gradient free learning of neural networks. However, most of the techniques I've found seem to be only applied to toy problems, which I assume means they're infeasible for more "demanding" scenarios, such as MNIST digit classification. Also, I've been unable to find survey papers or sites on the subject. Is there a good resource to learn about gradient free learning and seeing what SOTA is capable of?
