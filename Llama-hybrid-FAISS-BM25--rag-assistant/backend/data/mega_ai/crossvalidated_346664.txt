You are perfectly fine to use the OLS Method. I would just recommend utilizing robust p-values to show that your variables are still significant and running Bruesch-Pagan, Durbin-Watson and ADF tests against your results to further show the model is solid. No one model is ever better than another, it all depends upon the context of the utilization of the model. The approach I have shared is current and common practice across the financial industry.
