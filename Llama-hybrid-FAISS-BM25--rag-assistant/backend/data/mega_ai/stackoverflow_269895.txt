ReturnNumber is not a method - instead, it represents a method group containing all methods with the name ReturnNumber but with potentially different arity-and-type signatures. There are some technical issues with figuring out which method in that method group you actually want in a very generic and works-every-time way. Obviously, the compiler could figure it out some, even most, of the time, but a decision was made that putting an algorithm into the compiler which would work only half the time was a bad idea. The following works, however: someCollection.OrderBy(new Func (ReturnNumber))
