What you are describing is adaptive MCMC if your proposal distribution depends on the history of the chain, and is thus time dependent. There is a lot of theory about ergodicity of adaptive mcmc. There are essentially two main conditions: Diminishing Adaptation: The adaptation on the proposal distribution should diminish as a function of $t$. Containment: The time to stationarity remains bounded in probability. This is more of a technical condition and often difficult to check. You can find a variety of references on this: These and these set of slides go into some detail about adaptive MCMC. This is the paper that obtains the above conditions. Here are some examples of adaptive MCMC.
