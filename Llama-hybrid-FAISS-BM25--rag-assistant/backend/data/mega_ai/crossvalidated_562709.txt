Log of the odds in Logistic Regression

In simple logistic regression i noticed that many researcher neglect the constant part of the logistic regression equation. Log(odds) = a + b Gender (say that 0 = Female and 1 = Male) So the log of the odds of cancer when the case is male is b ... and odds of course is exp(b) but shouldn't the log of the odds equals b + a? because log(odds) = a + b x 1 = a + b
