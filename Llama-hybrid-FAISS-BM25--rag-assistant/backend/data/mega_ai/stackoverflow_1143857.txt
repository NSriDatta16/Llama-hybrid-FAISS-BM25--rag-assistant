I understand what you're doing, but you don't really give us enough information to give a good answer. you ask is it ok to maintain this amount of data in client side?? But you don't really tell us how much data you're working with. Personally, I think you'll be fine. Storing moderate-to-large amounts of data will impact RAM which isn't a huge concern these days - the real performance issues with JavaScript come when you start doing really CPU-intensive stuff, like a lot of DOM interaction, large iterations, and recursion. Oh, and I would probably encourage you to create variables in the frame's scope like this top.varname = null; as opposed to parent.parent.parent.eval( 'var varname;' );
