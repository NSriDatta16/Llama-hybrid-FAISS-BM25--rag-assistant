Absolutely. It's virtually impossible to use CSS layout techniques in HTML emails. So...code like it's 1998. Use tables. It's painful, but it's the only surefire way to get HTML emails to display properly and consistently. Make sure you set cellpadding, cellspacing, and border on every single table. Nest them if you must. colspan and rowspan are your friends. Use shim .gifs in empty cells. If it's a bad practice for regular webpages, you should probably be using them in e-mails. Don't design for anything wider than 600 pixels. Since webmail services' CSS can be overwritten by CSS inside of the e-mails, they tend to disable it. Inline CSS is smart. Font tags are smarter. Forget about doctypes, , , or . Don't rely on background images - if you must use them, have a background color backup. Avoid spammy-sounding terms. Don't talk about Viagra, porn, or knockoff watches - it'll probably get spam-filtered. Send text-only alternative using the "Multipart/Alternative" MIMEtype. Debugging is a bear. The testing list we use at my place of business: Outlook 2003, Outlook 2007, Outlook Express (from XP), Thunderbird Mac and Windows, Eudora, Mail.app, Entourage, Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, AOL, AOL Webmail, and Hotmail. Webmail clients tested in both IE6 and the latest Firefox version. It may be worth cooking up a script to automatically send emails to test addresses at all the services for testing. Good info about specific support at Campaign Monitor's site . They also have more practical guidelines . And here's a list of e-mail client usage .
