calculate the transition probability matrix (1 and 2 order) for the occurrence of wet, dry and neutral spells during different seasons

I have a time series of dry, wet and neutral conditions for 4 seasons during 60 years (240 conditions). My data has text file format with 3 columns (year, season and rainfall conditions). How can I do markov chain by R. I want to calculate the transition probability matrix for the occurrence of wet, dry and neutral spells during different seasons. Please inform me about R commands are suitable for my need.
