Since Eclipse RCP is based on OSGi, you can use also check the OSGi 4.1 documentation on handling native code. I believe the Eclipse guys have started to recommend the OSGi approach, but I can't remember where I saw the recommendation. I've used Malaxeur's suggestion with using fragments and filters. The actual layout inside the fragment/bundle doesn't matter, though I'd create a separate lib directory if I had more than one library. The OSGi 4.1 specification is here .
