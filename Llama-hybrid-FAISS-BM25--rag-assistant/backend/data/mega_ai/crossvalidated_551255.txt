If I understood the question correctly, both the methods will yield the identical estimate of covariance. Suppose you use the $k^{th}$ batch to compute covariance (assuming zero mean) $$COV_k = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^ky_i^k$$ , and, subsequently, the average of $b$ covariances $$COV=\frac{1}{b}\sum_{k=1}^{b}COV_k$$ $$COV=\frac{1}{b}\sum_{k=1}^{b}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^ky_i^k$$ $$COV=\frac{1}{nb}\sum_{k=1}^{b}\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_i^ky_i^k$$ Notice that the last equation is your second method of computing the covariance.
