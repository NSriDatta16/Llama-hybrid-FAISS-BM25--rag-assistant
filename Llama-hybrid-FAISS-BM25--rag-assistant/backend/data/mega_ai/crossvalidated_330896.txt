Correct formula for converting the ARIMA MA(1) coefficient to the exponential smoothing $\alpha$ parameter?

Two crucial sources for time series analysis differ in a critical formula for equivalence between simple exponential smoothing (SES) and ARIMA(0, 1, 1). From Hyndman's F:PP : $\theta_1 = \alpha - 1$ and from R. Nau's Statistical Forecasting : $\theta_1 = 1- \alpha$ Can someone help me understand the apparent discrepancy?
