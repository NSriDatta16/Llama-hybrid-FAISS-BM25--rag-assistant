Artificial intelligence is an immense field with many subdisciplines. The particular library you'll want will almost certainly be a function of what you're trying to do. Are you trying to do some sort of machine learning (regression, for example)? Then you'll probably want to find a library containing state-of-the art classifiers, like neural networks, SVMs, boosted decision trees, k-means classifiers, etc. Are you trying to develop robot control systems? Then you'll probably want to look into particle filters, Kalman filters, probabilistic road maps, etc. Are you trying to do computer vision or speech recognition? Then you might want access to signal processing libraries in addition to the aforementioned machine learning tools. Are you trying to have the computer play a game? Then you might want libraries for minimax, UCT (my personal favorite!), or Monte Carlo simulation. In short, there are a huge number of libraries out there. Identifying what particular problem you want to solve will be the first step toward finding one appropriate for your uses.
