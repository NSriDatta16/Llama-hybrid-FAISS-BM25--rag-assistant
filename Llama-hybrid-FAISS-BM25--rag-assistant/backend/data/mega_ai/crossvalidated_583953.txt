Time series methodology to predict sales

Today I dont want to go deep in the math but mostly be sure I understand the correct methodology. My goal is to predict sales in 50 different stores. For each store I know the number of products sold by categories (e.g of category: grocery, book, clothes...). I have got additional information like holiday day, weather ... From my understanding I need to have a 2 steps process. First, check if additional variables are correlated with sales. For example does weather affect sales, does holiday have an impact... Then I can start modelisation. Since I have different stores and different products types, I will need to use a multivariate times series model that will have, as minimum input: store and product type. In case I have found correlation with other variables, for example weather, I will add this to the model too. Am I right?
