I am assuming that you have labeled training data from which you could estimate, for instance, the probability that if there is a car in frame $t$ then there would also be a car in frames $t-1$ and $t+1$? It's not entirely clear to me why you would "want to treat the neighboring frames as granted whether the middle frame is valid or not". After all, your procedure should better work on all frames in a consistent manner. If you treat $t-1$ and $t+1$ as fixed and move from frame to frame, then you'd have to treat all frames as fixed. But perhaps I am misunderstanding you on that point. Another note: using a (Markov) model for $P(C_{t+1}\vert C_{t})$ is probably more convenient than your middle frame variant. That all being said, I'm not at all an expert in neural networks. If you want to tackle this problem in a somewhat pincipled manner, then you have to look into time-series modeling.
