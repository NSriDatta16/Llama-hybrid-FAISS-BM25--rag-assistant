Propagation of uncertainty through an average

I have a set of distance measurements that are all accurate to +/- 0.01 M . {1.00,2.00,3,00} We can obtain the distance moved between measurements by saying {2-1, 3-2} its trivial to see we moved 1M each time. My question is this. If you want to know the average distance moved, how you you carry the +/- 0.01M through the average. I would like to report the Average Difference +/- the uncertainty. How do I calculate the uncertainty? (My real data is more messy than this).
