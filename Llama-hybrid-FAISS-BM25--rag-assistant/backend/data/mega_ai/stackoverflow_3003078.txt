While not quite as elegant, Report Builder 1.0 coupled with a model of the datast can possibly provide a solution. The table/data structure can be defined in the model to provide drag and drop placement of columns into a grid (one example - it does charts also), and you could define the Dimensions via the use of Filters. Best part is it is free and comes with MS SQL. More info on Report Builder
