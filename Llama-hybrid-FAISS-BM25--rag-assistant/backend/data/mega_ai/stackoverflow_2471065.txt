Alternatively, you could just do a find and sub -[NSSortDescriptor initWithKey:ascending:] then add the appropriate release statement. It's more cumbersome to implement but far less fragile and error prone than altering the class itself. That is especially true if you've never done that before. You'll probably spend more time coming up to speed on the override than you would just doing the find.
