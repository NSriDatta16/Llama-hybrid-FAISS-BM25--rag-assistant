Probability of hitting state i

I have just started learning Markov chain and I have no idea how to solve this question An ant walks along the edges of a cube, starting from the vertex marked 0. Upon reaching a vertex, the ant continues to edges incident to this vertex, with equal probability for each. There are 2 spiders at two vertices marked α and β waiting for the ant. What is the probability that the ant will reach to the spider vertex α? What about the vertex β?
