jeditable accidentally triggering on Draggable on nested items

I'm using jquery-ui's draggable for drag-and-drop, and jeditable for inline editing. When I drag and drop an element that's also editable, right after it's dropped jeditable kicks in and pops into 'edit mode'. How can I disable this behavior? Edit - the problem happens because of netsting - see this example . I also added draggable to the mix to make the example more realistic (the actual real problem is in this site that I'm working on) Note - even though this question has an accepted answer because of the bounty rules, the problem is still not resolved for me.
