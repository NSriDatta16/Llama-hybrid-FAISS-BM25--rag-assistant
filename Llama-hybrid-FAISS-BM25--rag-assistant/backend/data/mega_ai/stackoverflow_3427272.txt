I'm not sure if this totally encapsulates what you're trying to do, but it sounds like an open source project like JavaScriptMVC may be useful to you. This open source framework lets the controllers handle event delegation and provides some of that separation that you're looking for. It also leverages jQuery under the hood. The site is a little hard to navigate (or at least find a lot of concrete information) but the intro video is useful (12 minutes in length). Hope this helps! Good luck!
