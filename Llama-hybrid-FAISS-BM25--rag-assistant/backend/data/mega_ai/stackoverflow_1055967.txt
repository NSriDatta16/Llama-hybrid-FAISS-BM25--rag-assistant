I'll be extremely pragmatic here: It depends on the amount and the complexity of the new markup. If you need to return a elaborate piece of HTML, it's always better to write it in the server side and returning it as data, it's also easier to maintain. Building complex HTML in the client side usually is cryptic, even with the use of modern js libraries. On the other hand, if your extra markup is small, then you can create it with js. I've never done anything with ASP.NET AJAX, but having a asp.net page, a rails view, or a JSP with only a small fragment like Row Updated its confusing. Let the code speak to you, If you're fighting against javascript code to create markup in the client side, maybe it should go in the server side. Lastly: don't worry too much about the size of HMTL vs JSON, and if you do, benchmark the requests to see if the difference isn't negligible.
