No. There are many situations where a statistic can be approximately normally distributed without the related variables (e.g. the outcome variable) being normally distributed. In the case of logistic regression, I think the z-statistics are based on the fact that maximum likelihood estimates are approximately normally distributed with covariance matrix equal to the inverse of the fisher information (google it). Clearly the outcome variables is not normally distributed (it's a binary variable). So, the z-statistics you see are the coefficient estimates divided by the (square root of) the correspond entry of the fisher information, which should be approximately standard normal if the true coefficient is zero.
