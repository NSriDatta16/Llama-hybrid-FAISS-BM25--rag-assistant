Assuming that you have a has_many and belongs_to relationship between the two models, you can try using the (very handy) MySQL GROUP BY clause, which is supported in Rails: @hall_of_fame = Business.find( :all, :joins => :ratings, :group => 'business_id', :order => 'AVG(ratings.rating) DESC', :limit => 10 ) If you want to add the average rating, you can include it in a :select parameter, as such: @hall_of_fame = Business.find( :all, :select => 'businesses.name, AVG(ratings.rating)' :joins => :ratings, :group => 'business_id', :order => 'AVG(ratings.rating) DESC', :limit => 10 ) Naturally, if there are no conflicting column names between the tables, you can safely remove the leading "businesses." and "ratings." from both the :select and :order parameters. You may want to create a method with this code in your model instead of having it in the controller, but that's up to you.
