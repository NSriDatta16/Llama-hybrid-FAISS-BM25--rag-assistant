John Galt, The only way to do what you want is using HttpWebRequest. Here is good example of a Class that do what you want. I've made to send image and form values to picassa serve sometime ago (I know I could use Picassa API, but I did it for fun). You only need to pay attention to the ' SendPhoto ' function to get hints on what you have to do to make HttpWebRequest to do the work.
