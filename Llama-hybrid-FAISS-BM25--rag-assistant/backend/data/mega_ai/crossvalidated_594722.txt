How to deal with imputation of large continuous intervals of missing data in time series?

Imagine you have a dataframe of historical sensory data measurements, such as temperature and energy consumption, recorded every 15 minutes for 2 years . What would be the most appropriate way to deal with entire chunks of missing data? Imagine an entire week or two are missing , there are no points in between, and we want to avoid dropping records or using unrealistically simple methods like linear regression or backfilling, the imputation should try and recreate the missing records based on the rest of the known time series history . What methods could I use? Thank you very much.
