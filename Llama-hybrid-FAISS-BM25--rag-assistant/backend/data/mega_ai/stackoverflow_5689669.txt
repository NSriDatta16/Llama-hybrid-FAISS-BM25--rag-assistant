How to change save path

I am created xml docs, but they are by default saving to the project folder in netbeans projects. I have a file path that I need them to be saving to instead: public static String XML_DIR = "c:/Users/ericrea/Desktop/413final"; Here is the code I have written so far, I tried using the f.renameto() method, but it won't accept a string file location: DOMSource source = new DOMSource(testDoc); File f; f=new File(emp.getId() + ".xml"); f.createNewFile(); PrintStream ps = new PrintStream(f); StreamResult result = new StreamResult(ps); TransformerFactory transformerFactory = TransformerFactory .newInstance(); Transformer transformer = transformerFactory.newTransformer(); transformer.transform(source, result);
