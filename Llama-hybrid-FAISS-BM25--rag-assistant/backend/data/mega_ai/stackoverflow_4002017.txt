Here are some starters: Berkeley 2006 Spring: CS 61A The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs MIT: 6.001 Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs Berkeley 2006 Spring: CS 61B Data Structures Berkeley 2006 Spring: CS 61C Machine Structures Stanford: programming methodology Stanford: programming paradigms I picked spring semesters because they are longer iirc. Here are some courses that are more advanced (and less dry). Stanford: natural language processing Stanford: machine learning Stanford: introduction to robotics
