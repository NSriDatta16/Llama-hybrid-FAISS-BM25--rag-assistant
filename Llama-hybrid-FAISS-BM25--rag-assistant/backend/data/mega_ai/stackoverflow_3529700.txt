Beamer Presentation: Sneak in slides for each bulleted element

So, I am doing a presentation using Beamer. In my earlier presentation, I used the list elements auto unhiding one each time. : http://www.slideshare.net/scorpion032/building-pluggable-web-applications-using-django/38 using the following code: \begin{frame} \begin{itemize}[ ] \item Admin Interface \item Generic Views \item Testing Tools \item Sessions \item Authentication \item Caching \item Internationalization \item RSS \item CSRF protection \item File Storage \end{itemize} \end{frame} from http://github.com/becomingGuru/gids-django-ppt/blob/master/contents.tex What I want right now, is the ability to sneak-in a few slides for each of these entries. Is there a simple direct easy way to do it? Or should I consider using sections and displaying section titles? The problem with that approach is that, there will be way too many sections and given that I am displaying the sections on top bar, there might not be enough space for that. Also, how do I display the contents page, with the current section highlighted for each section. PS: Question mirrored on TeX, LaTeX and Friends
