Setting up CRON job in Magento

There are plenty of tutorials out there for setting up cron, and I think I've done it correctly, but for some reason it isn't working. I have also created a controller class to test the model and it's working correctly. Here's my config.xml: 0.1.0 VPS_Export_Model VPS_Export_Helper standard VPS_Export vpsexport */5 * * * * vps_export/observer::exportProducts My Observer.php file is: And my test IndexController.php file is: exportProducts(); } } ?> If I point my browser at http://my_server/vpsexport/index I see the proper output from the echo statements and the message gets printed to the log, so I know the model is properly configured. However, cron is not having the same results. If I run cron.php manually, I get no errors, but it still doesn't seem to do anything. Any thoughts?
