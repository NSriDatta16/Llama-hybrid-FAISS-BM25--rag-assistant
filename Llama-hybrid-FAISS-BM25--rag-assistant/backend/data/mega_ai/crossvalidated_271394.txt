Expectation of the log of a ratio of two lognormal random variables with additive constants

I have two independent lognormal random variables $X$ and $Y$ with known means and variances. I would like to know the expected value and the variance of $\ln\big((X+1)/(Y+1)\big)$. If there is no exact solution, is there a means of approximation? I have tried a Taylor expansion on $\ln(X+1) - \ln(Y+1)$ as suggested in an answer to the question Expected value of a natural logarithm . Unfortunately, the Taylor expansion does not provide a good estimate for one of the lognormal random variables I am working with. To provide more detail on the problem and in particular the failed Taylor expansion, I have $X=\exp\big((m-Z)/v\big)$ where $Z$$\sim$$N(\mu,\sigma^2)$ with constants $m>0$ and $v>0$. This implies: $E[X]=\exp\big(\frac{m-\mu}{v} + \frac{1}{2}(\frac{\sigma}{v})^2\big)$ and $V[X]=\Big[\exp\big((\frac{\sigma}{v})^2\big) - 1\Big]\centerdot\exp\big(2\frac{m-\mu}{v} + (\frac{\sigma}{v})^2\big)$. If I run a simulation where I set $\mu=9024$ and $\sigma=600$ to generate a large sample of $n$ random variates of $Z$, and using R code mean(log(exp((m - Z)/v) + 1)) to take the average of the $n$ by $\ln(x+1)$ variates with $m=8900$, $v=400$, by the central limit theorum I get $E\big(\ln(X+1)\big)\approx0.7784$. However, plugging those values into the Taylor expansion I get: $E\big(\ln(X+1)\big)\approx\ln(E[X] + 1) - \frac{V[X]}{2(E[X]+ 1)^2}\approx-0.8577$.
