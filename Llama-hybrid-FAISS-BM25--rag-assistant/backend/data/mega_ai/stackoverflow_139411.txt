Is a Gantt Chart larger than a single page ever useful?

I've worked on a few projects managed through the use of a Gantt chart. Some of these have has a massive number of tasks and the project manager spends all their time wrestling with MS Project instead of making good choices. I can see the point if there are a number of separate teams working towards something (e.g. legal, IT, marketing) to manage a project overall. Has anyone participated in a software development project that has used a Gantt chart with any success?
