How do I set an ImageViews source programmatically in Android?

I am making a compound ui element that takes an Object (a player) and I want to pick the corresponding image for the team this player plays for(the player object has a string value for its image number. I have the images in the resources folder of my project. How do I specify the correct source for each player. Is it a case of writing a huge number of if's and elses (checking the string value) and using res.getDrawable(R.drawable.no1) etc or is there a more elegant solution where I can use a string in some way to specify the path to the source?
