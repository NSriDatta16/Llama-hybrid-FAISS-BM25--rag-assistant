Is the composite hypothesis really the primary interest? For example if one cell line consumes 10 percent of 100 (hence 10) and the other line consumes 20 percent of 50 (also 10) then you null hypothesis would be true even though the routes are very different. It may be the most interesting to start with 2 separate tests, one comparing the 2 lines on fraction entering and the other comparing on glucose consumed) and see if they differ on either measure. These tests would fit into the more traditional t-test framework directly. If you are really interested in comparing the products, then you may want to switch to a Bayesian analysis where you can estimate your parameters of interest, then just multiply them together and look at the posterior(s) and credibly/compatibility intervals for the difference (or ratio) of your 2 products (as well as looking at the individual means).
