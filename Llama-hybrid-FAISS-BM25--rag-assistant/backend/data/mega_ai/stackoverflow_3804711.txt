Why do you want to know the actual density? It's Android's business. But I'm sure there is a way to retrieve this information. For development I put everything in the hdpi-folder. I also could put everything in a general Drawable Folder. At the time u publish u can decide if u want to provide already downscaled resources for ldpi and mdpi. However, thats not necessary. Update: Retrieve actual density with this class and best practices Update 2: I found a 25 min video from Motorola discussing all those issues: Working with multiple screens
