Is it necessary to restrict Entity Framework access by singleton?

Within the realm of Entity Framework, if I have 2 seperate classes leveraging a data model, do I need to ensure that there is only 1 reference to the entities object (singleton or similar)? In other words, in the scenario below, is there any danger? public class Foo { public void DoSomething() { using (MyEntities entities = new MyEntities()) { //use _entities in some fashion here } } } public class Bar { public void DoSomething() { using (MyEntities entities = new MyEntities()) { //use _entities in some fashion here } } } Thanks.
