Python: I'm not allowed to raise exception. Are there other elegant python ways?

My work place has imposed a rules for no use of exception (catching is allowed). If I have code like this def f1() if bad_thing_happen(): raise Exception('bad stuff') ... return something I could change it to def f1() if bad_thing_happen(): return [-1, None] ... return [0, something] f1 caller would be like this def f1_caller(): code, result = f1(param1) if code Are there more elegant ways than this in Python ?
