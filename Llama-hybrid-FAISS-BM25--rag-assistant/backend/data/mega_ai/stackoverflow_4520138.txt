Storage/database solution for a custom POP3 Client?

The POP3 client is an homework assignment at one of my courses. It has to be done in Qt from scratch. Target platform: Linux (Ubuntu). What solution would you recommend when it comes to mail storage ? Since it is a homework assignment it has to be done "right"... P.S. For now I think I would go with plain text, each message in a separate .txt and another file as an index. I'm not sure how this will be handled when the folder with the messages will get really big.
