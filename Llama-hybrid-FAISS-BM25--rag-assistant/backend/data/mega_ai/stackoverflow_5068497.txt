database table design for some unknown data

So, not having come from a database design background, I've been tasked with designing a web app where the end user will be entering products, and specs for their products. Normally I think I would just create rows for each of the types of spec that they would be entering. Instead, they have a variety of products that don't share the same spec types, so my question is, what's the most efficient and future-proof way to organize this data? I was leaning towards pushing a serialized object into a generic "data" row, but then are you able to do full-text searches on this data? Any other avenues to explore?
