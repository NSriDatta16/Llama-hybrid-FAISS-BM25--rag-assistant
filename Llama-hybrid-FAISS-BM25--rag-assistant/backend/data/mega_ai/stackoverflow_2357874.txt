What is the most elegant way to deal with sourced files that themselves source (relative) source files in VIM?

I am editing a file like /path/to/file.txt with vim, hence the current directory is /path/to . Now, I have a directory /other/path/to/vim/files that contains sourceA.vim . Also, there is a sourceB.vim file in /other/path/to/vim/files/lib/sourceB.vim In sourceA.vim , I want to source sourceB.vim , so I put a so lib/sourceB.vim into it. Now, in my file.txt, I do a :so /other/path/to/vim/files/sourceA.vim which fails, because the sourcing system is obviously not prepared for relative path names along with sourcing from another directory. In order to fix this, I put a execute "so " . expand(" :p:h") . "/lib/sourceB.vim" into sourceA.vim which does what I want. However, I find the solution a bit clumsy and was wondering if there is a more elegant solution to it. I cannot put the sourceA.vim nor sourceB.vim into vim's plugin folder.
