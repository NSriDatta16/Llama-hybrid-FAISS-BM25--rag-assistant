Based on your description, other appropriate forms for your model would include nonlinear growth or diffusion models. These are models like those used in the analysis of new products, tech innovations, movie ticket sales as well as the spread of diseases and contagions. The underlying process can range from simple, sigmoid-shaped Gompertz curves and loglets based on Fisher-Pry transformations to sophisticated Bose-Einstein processes. Good discussions of these issues can be found here: http://phe.rockefeller.edu/current/areas/about/Diffusion%20of%20Social%20Phenomena http://www.amazon.com/Hollywood-Economics-Uncertainty-Routledge-Contemporary/dp/0415312612/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1446043976&sr=8-1&keywords=hollywood+economics Also and specifically with respect to the statistical issues and challenges involved in maximum likelihood estimation of the unknown parameters, Jack Weiss' Lecture Notes at UNC are an invaluable resource. He includes plenty of references to R modules as well: http://www.unc.edu/courses/2008fall/ecol/563/001/docs/lectures/lecture27.htm
