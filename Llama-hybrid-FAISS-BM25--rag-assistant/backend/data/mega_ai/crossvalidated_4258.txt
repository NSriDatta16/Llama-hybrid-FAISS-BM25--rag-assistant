Can I semi-automate MCMC convergence diagnostics to set the burn-in length?

I would like to automate the choice of burn-in for an MCMC chain, e.g. by removing the first n rows based on a convergence diagnostic. To what extent can this step be safely automated? Even if I still double check the autocorrelation, mcmc trace, and pdfs, it would be nice to have the choice of burn-in length automated. My question is general, but it would be great if you could provide specifics for dealing with an R mcmc.object; I am using the rjags and coda packages in R.
