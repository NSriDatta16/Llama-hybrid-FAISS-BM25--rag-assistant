It sounds like you are looking for a robust test of the difference between two measures of location. You are right that using the mean poses all sorts of problems, not least of them extreme outliers. Research in recent decades has shown that comparison of means, relying on large sample properties, is much more problematic in many real-life situations than had been appreciated. A good alternative is a comparison of 20% trimmed means. A percentile bootstrap around a mean with at least 0.2 trimming is "one of the most effective methods for obtaining accurate probability coverage and achieving relatively high power" (p.336 of Wilcox 2012, Modern Statistics for the Social and Behavioral Sciences , CRC Press, thoroughly recommended). There are straightforward implementations available in R. For example, consider the mixed log-normal distributions in the R code below. x1 is generally much bigger than x2, but x2 is contaminated with 20 very large values that blow the mean out of the water. Either the median or the trimemd mean give a much better sense of the general centre of location. > x1 x2 x2[sample(1:1000,20)] combined tmp row.names(tmp) tmp x1 x2 Mean 35229 1282017 TrimmedMean 25077 5992 Median 22454 3896 > qplot(value, data=combined, log="x") + facet_wrap(~variable)
