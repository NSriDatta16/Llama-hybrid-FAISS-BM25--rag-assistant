What is the difference between Multiple Correspondence Analysis and Principal Component Analysis result?

Several articles I've read stated that MCA and PCA both work as "reducing dimensionality" tools but MCA is used for categorical variables and PCA is used for numerical variables. But is there any difference with the result both methods produce? I have never used MCA nor PCA before so my knowledge is limited to only this. Let's say I have 9 variables, all of them are about power over deciding different types of expenditure in the household but with the same 5-point likert scale (1: least power to 5: most power). Then I run both MCA and PCA (PCA passed the Bartlett Sphericity Test & KMO Measure) and obtain the predictor variables. If I generate a variable that is the sum of all responses from 9 variables (that should amount to maximum of 45) and run a twoway scatterplot with the MCA predictor and PCA predictor separately, I got a graph that looks like this: the sum of response variable and PCA graph has positive relationship, while sum of response variable and MCA has negative relationship. My question is: is this normal? Should MCA and PCA results be similar? How do I interpret both results?
