When I first started developing FF Extensions, I made heavy use (although mainly as a lurker) of Mozillazine forums . Great people, great knowledge. In regards of Experts Exchange, I hate to state the obvious, but they do have their answers all the way at the bottom of the page, as long as you come from Google. That's what you meant by "hide the answers", right? I believe Chrome didn't work like that but it seems like they recognize Chrome's user agent too now.
