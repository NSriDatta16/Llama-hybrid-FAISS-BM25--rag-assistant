First, you need to look into values, I am not sure what is the type unemployment variable here. Let's assume it contains two values 0 and 1 where 0 mean employed and 1 is unemployed. And economic growth is a continuous variable with real values. So you can use Logistic regression to find if the economic growth resulted in employment or not and then compare the previous employed state for this. This would work if the unemployment variable is categorical. If you provide more insight into the data, I can provide a better answer.
