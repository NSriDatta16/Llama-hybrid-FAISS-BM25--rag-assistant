Live Demo (updated) The only change from my last demo: I changed top: 3 to top: 3px . See here for why that was required: (in short, you forgot the px ) absolute positioning not working with XHTML? Live Demo Add position: relative to div.progressBarEmpty ? I'm not entirely sure what it's supposed to look like, but it does now look vaguely like a Gantt chart . If this isn't quite right (as I suspect is the case), it's probably just a matter of adding a few more properties, so let me know what's wrong with it.
