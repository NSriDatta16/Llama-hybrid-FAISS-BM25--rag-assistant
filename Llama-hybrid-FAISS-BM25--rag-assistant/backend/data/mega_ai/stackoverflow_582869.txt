Perhaps there's some sort of a ' beforedrag ' event you can bind to? It would be easier to add the class to an element before the user actually starts dragging it, rather than during. If you're using jQuery UI, there's a ' start ' event on draggable you can use: http://docs.jquery.com/UI/Draggable#events
