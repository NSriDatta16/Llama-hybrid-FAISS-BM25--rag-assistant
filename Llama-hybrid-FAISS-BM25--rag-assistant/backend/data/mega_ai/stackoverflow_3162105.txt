The issue should not even exist. You should adopt a more elegant idiom of writing your malloc 's as ptr = malloc(N * sizeof *ptr) i.e. avoid mentioning the type name as much as possible. Type names are for declarations, not for statements. That way your malloc s will always be type-independent and will look consistent. The fact that the multiplication by 1 is superfluous will be less obvious (since some people find multiplication by sizeof(char) annoying).
