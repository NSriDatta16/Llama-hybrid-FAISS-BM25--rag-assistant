You should not be referencing Python dictionaries by index. Python dictionaries order of storage of items is arbitrary and denoting it by index is bound to fail. Instead you use reference it by keys whenever it comes to dictionaries. When it comes to Ordered Dict, the standard libraries collections.OrderedDict does not seem to provide index method, but, there are certain OrderedDict odict , where you can reference elements using index.
