Sampling from a distribution which results in heteroskedasticity

I have a pretty basic model whereby using a monte carlo approach I am seeking to recreate the monthly stock market returns over the last 30 years. Using the actual monthly returns of an index, I have created an empirical distribution from which I plan to draw random returns for the monte carlo simulation. After examining the actual monthly returns of the index, I noticed that the data is stationary and does not have autocorrelation (as per an ADF test and autocorrelation plot), however it appears to display conditional heteroskedasticity. Is there any way to randomly draw from the distribution such that the resulting time series will display conditional heteroskedasticity? Here's a plot of the returns Here's a plot of the squared residuals
