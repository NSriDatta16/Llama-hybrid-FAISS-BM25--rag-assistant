If you drag an integer field onto the table it generates a sum by default. This is not always what you want - e.g. when the field is an Id or a status code that is the same for all rows shown. Right-click the " > " and bring up the "Expression..." dialog. Replace "Sum" with "First" - e.g. =Sum(carID.value, "datasetname") becomes =First(carID.value, "datasetname") If the values are the same in all rows, then the first value will do. If not, there are also other functions like Last, Min, Max.
