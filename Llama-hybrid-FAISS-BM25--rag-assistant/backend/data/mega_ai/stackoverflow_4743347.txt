Sorry but you cant do this, its good to know that Delphi provide such facility but may be Visual Studio doesn't do this because at the end of the day this may lead to a mess of linked files. Visual studio likes to organize related files in the same project or solution. If you want to have your earlier class available then as mentioned above you have only two options. 1) Simply copy the existing .cs file in your project directory (By Right click on project -> "Add existing item" -> choose the class ) 2) Add the Project in your solution (Right click on Solution -> Add -> Add Existing Project... -> Select the project file from File Browser) and then Add the class refrence (Right click on project -> "Add reference" -> In Projects Tab Select your Project). It will automatically make a reference to the .dll. 3) And last option is to compile your class in a .dll and then add the refrence to it in your Project. Good Luck
