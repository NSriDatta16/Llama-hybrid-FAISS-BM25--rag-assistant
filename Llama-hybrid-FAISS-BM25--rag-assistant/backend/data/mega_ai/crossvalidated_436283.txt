EarlyStopping in combination with GridSearchCV f√ºr hyperparameter tuning?

I want to find the optimal hyperparameter (dropout rate, learning rate, number of epochs) for training an CNN-architecture. Does it make sense to integrate EarlyStopping already in GridSearchCV? Or should EarlyStopping only be used for the final model? Can you make recommendations?
