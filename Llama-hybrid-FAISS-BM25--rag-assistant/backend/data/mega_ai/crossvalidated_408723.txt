How to analyze time series data and mark if single data is seasonal or not seasonal

I have data set as shown above. It has daily sales data for 4 different product for almost a year. I aggregated the sales of product for each day into the following format: I plotted sales of 4 product as per date and got this: From the plot, it is clear that there is some recurring pattern (fall during sept and raise in common months) in purchase behavior. I want to know how to pin point a single data and classify the sales seasonal or non seasonal.
