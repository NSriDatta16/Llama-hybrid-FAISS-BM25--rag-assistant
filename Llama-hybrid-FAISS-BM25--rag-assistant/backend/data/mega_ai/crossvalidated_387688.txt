The usual convention is for parameters to be given lower case Greek letters, and their range is usually denoted with the corresponding upper-case Greek letter (e.g., you have a random variable $\theta$ with range $\Theta$ ). You will occasionally run across the use of the upper-case Greek letters to refer to random variables, but it is rare. Also, bear in mind that in Bayesian statistics you generally don't need to capitalise any of your random variables, because in that methodology, anything appearing in the main argument of a distribution is random, and anything appearing as a conditioning variable is known. For this reason, many Bayesian books and papers are written without capitalising any of the variables.
