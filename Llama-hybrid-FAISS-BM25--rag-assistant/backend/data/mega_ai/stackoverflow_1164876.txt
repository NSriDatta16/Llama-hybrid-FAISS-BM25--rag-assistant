Helpful as @Aaron's suggestion is, it is a bit tedious. I tried it out. In my case the copied plugins just wouldn't show up in the UI. Correcting the file permissions didn't help either and I gave up. Frustrated, I looked around for other resolutions to this bug and found one on the Eclipse wiki that can help you replace p2 with the original Update manager in Ganymede. I tried it out and it works. There is also an automated script available for download that does the same. I think this is a good solution till the issues with p2 get resolved. You can read more about how to do this here . Note: Works only for 3.4.x. It says that it will not work with 3.5 since p2 is tightly coupled with other components of 3.5.
