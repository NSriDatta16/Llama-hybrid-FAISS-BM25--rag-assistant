Read some of the newer follow-up articles, such as: Houle, M. E., Kriegel, H. P., Kröger, P., Schubert, E., & Zimek, A. (2010, June). Can shared-neighbor distances defeat the curse of dimensionality? . In International Conference on Scientific and Statistical Database Management (pp. 482-500). Springer Berlin Heidelberg. and Zimek, A., Schubert, E., & Kriegel, H. P. (2012). A survey on unsupervised outlier detection in high‐dimensional numerical data. Statistical Analysis and Data Mining, 5(5), 363-387. If I remember correctly, they show the properties of the theoretical distance concentration effect (which is proven) and the limitations why reality may behave very different. If these articles aren't helpful, ping me and I recheck the references (just typed what I remembered into Google Scholar, I didn't download the papers again). Beware that the "curse" does not say the difference of distances to the nearest and farthest neighbors approaches 0; nor that the distances would converge to some number. but rather that the relative difference compared to the absolute value becomes small. Then random deviations can cause neighbors to be incorrectly ranked. In this equartion, don't ignore the fraction, expected value, and $d\rightarrow\infty$: $$ \lim_{d \to \infty} E\left(\frac{\operatorname{dist}_{\max} (d) - \operatorname{dist}_{\min} (d)}{\operatorname{dist}_{\min} (d)}\right) \to 0 $$
