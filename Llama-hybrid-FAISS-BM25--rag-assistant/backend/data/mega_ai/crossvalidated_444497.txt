Overdispersion is a phenomenon that often applies to binomial-like data ( $y$ successes out of $n$ cases with $n>1$ ), but it cannot apply to binary data. If $y$ is binary (1/0) and $E(y)=p$ then it must be that var $(y)=p(1-p)$ . There is no mathematical possibility that the variance can be any greater or less than that given $E(y)$ . If your response variable DCyn is binary (Yes/No) then it is impossible for it to be overdispersed (or under-dispersed) so the use of quasi-binomial models does not seem meaningful to me. A similar point has been made before on this forum: Overdispersion in logistic regression Binary data can, on the other hand, be correlated within groups, which is what a mixed model tries to estimate. If the binary observations are positively correlated within groups, then the data would in fact be overdispersed if aggregated into binomial observations by group. To fit a GLMM you would need to specify the family argument to glmer , which you have not currently done. From the code you give, you are fitting a Gaussian linear model to binary data, which is not at all appropriate. You don't appear to have fitted a binary or a quasi-binomial model, so trying to compare them is a bit moot.
