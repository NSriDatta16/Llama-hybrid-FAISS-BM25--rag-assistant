I'm sorry to tell you that your colleagues are correct. Let the population size be $N$; $X_i$ be the number of trees in plot $i$ and $Y_i$ be the number of trees in plot $i$ Let there be $n$ plots in the sample (here $n = 4$) and let $x_i$ $y_i$ be the sample counts of trees and of Then the fraction of all trees in the population with diameter $ $$ R = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^NY_i}{\sum_{i=1}^NX_i}= \frac{Y}{X} $$ Plots with no trees contribute zero to both numerator and denominator and do not affect the calculation. This is a ratio . The sample totals of trees and trees $ ratio estimator , Your solution does not estimate $R$. Let $M$ be the number of plots in the population with trees; and let $m$ be the corresponding number in the sample. You are estimating the following average of plot-specific fractions: $$ R^* = \frac{1}{M} \sum_{i=1}^M \frac{Y_i}{X_i} $$ This will not be equal to $R$ unless all plots have the same number of trees. To illustrate the difference in what the two solutions estimate: suppose only two plots in the population have trees. In one plot, $X_1 = 1000$ trees and $Y_1 = 500$; in the second $X_2 = 10$ and $Y_2 = 0$. The actual fraction of trees with diameter $ Note that $R$ can be expressed as an average of the $\dfrac{Y_i}{X_i}$, but it is a weighted average, with weights proportional to the the number of trees in the plot; i.e if $W_i =\dfrac{X_i}{\sum_i X_i}$, then $$ R = \sum_{i=1}^N W_i \frac{Y_i}{X_i} $$ Ratio estimators are covered in every sampling text e.g. Lohr, 2009, Chapter 4, Cochran, 1977. Chapter 6. There are formulas for standard errors, but they require a sample size (number of plots with trees) that exceeds 30 (Cochran, 1977, p. 153). Added: There are situations in which $R^*$ would be the proper target parameter. Suppose that the sampling units are people and that the target parameter is the average fraction of decayed teeth per person . This is $R^*,$ with $X_i$ the number of person $i$'s teeth and $Y_i$ the number decayed.
