Finding brief repeated patterns in a time series

Suppose I have a series of events, each of which is an element of {-1, 0 1} with a known distribution. Events happen in approximately continuous time. My dependent variable is the sum of the series. The series appears to be a random walk, perhaps with drift. However, an angel has appeared to me in a dream, or maybe the ghost of Karl Pearson, and told me that there are rare unobservable events that affect the observable events in a uniform way. However, the angel did not tell me what the pattern was, only that it is rare and of short duration relative to the length of the series. Most of the statistics I have learned is econometrics, i.e. one form or another of regression model, and does not seem to apply to finding patterns in data which are not constant functional relationships between variables or between variables and time. Is there one or more commonly used technique for finding such patterns? Would this fall under the heading of unsupervised learning?
