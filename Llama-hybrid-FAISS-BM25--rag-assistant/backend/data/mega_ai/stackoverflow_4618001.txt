The book "Hello, Android, Introducing Google's Mobile Development Platform" gives a nice explanation of the life cycle of android apps. Luckily they have the particular chapter online as an excerpt. See the graphic on page 39 in http://media.pragprog.com/titles/eband3/concepts.pdf By the way, this book is highly recommendable for android beginners!
