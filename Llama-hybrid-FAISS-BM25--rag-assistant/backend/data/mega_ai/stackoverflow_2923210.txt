Conditional compilation and framework targets

There are a few minor places where code for my project may be able to be drastically improved if the target framework were a newer version. I'd like to be able to better leverage conditional compilation in C# to switch these as needed. Something like: #if NET40 using FooXX = Foo40; #elif NET35 using FooXX = Foo35; #else NET20 using FooXX = Foo20; #endif Do any of these symbols come for free? Do I need to inject these symbols as part of the project configuration? It seems easy enough to do since I'll know which framework is being targeted from MSBuild. /p:DefineConstants="NET40" How are people handling this situation? Are you creating different configurations? Are you passing in the constants via the command line?
