Modeling a time series without trend or seasonality

I am dealing with a dataset that has different input data with a different behavior but I am getting confused as I can not find any trend or pattern in my data. I checked seasonality and found nothing. I checked the literature for data that does not have trend and seasonality, but I do not know exactly what is the proper treatment for prediction and interpretation of the results. What is the solution when the data is like this? I also plotted a heatmap correlation matrix and to me, this matrix says that I am dealing with data that are not correlated. Am I right about these two concepts? If so what should be done as further steps? If you think the figure is not good to be pasted in the question please do not downvote and just let me know, I will promise to solve it. Thanks.
