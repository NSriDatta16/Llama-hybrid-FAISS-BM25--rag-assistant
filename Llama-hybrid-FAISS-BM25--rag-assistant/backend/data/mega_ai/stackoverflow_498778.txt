How to save a particular, mutable "order" into a database

Suppose I have some objects, and I want the user to be able to reorder them in any way they wish, say, by dragging them around. So I'd have Cheese Muffins Milk And then the user drags 'milk' to the top, making the new order Milk Cheese Muffins Is there a best practice how to store the order of these objects in a database? The naive approach would probably be to just store a numerical value called "order" for each object, but this seems like too much hassle to me, because you'd have to shuffle the order-values around most of the time.
