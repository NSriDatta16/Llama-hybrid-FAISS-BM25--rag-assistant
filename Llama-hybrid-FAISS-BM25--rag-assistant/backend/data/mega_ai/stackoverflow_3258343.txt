Can somebody tell me what is wrong with the code in this page? The layout does not work properly in Safari browser

I do some work on on old tables based site. It is being replaced but I would like it to work for now. One of the pages in question is http://www.gdsofusa.com/marantec_garage_door_openers.html . When this page (and some others) is viewed in Safari 5.0 (7533.16) and probably others, the page content is off to the right. I just need to fix this since about 15% of the traffic is Safari. Please help!
