You have found that each individual continuous independent variable (IV) has at most a weak correlation with the dependent variable (DV). This does NOT mean that many IVs in combination will not explain much of the variance in the DV. Especially since the IVs are weakly correlated with each other, meaning that they may be contributing independent explanatory power. Two other important factors that may help you: 1) Interactions between IVs may be important in explaining variance in the DV. 2) Your correlations ignore all the information contained in the categorical variables - which might be substantial. Depending on your goals, a standard regression approach should be fine in this case; regularisation would probably be a good idea given your limited data. If you want to use a ML technique, random forests might work fine too, though again data limitation might be an issue.
