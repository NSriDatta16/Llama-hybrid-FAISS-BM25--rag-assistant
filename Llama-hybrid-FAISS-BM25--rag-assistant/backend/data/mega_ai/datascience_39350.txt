Your workflow is correct and you are doing a type of transfer learning where only the last layer is fine-tuned. Image embedding widget calculates features that are the activations of a penultimate layer of Inception-v3, VGG or Painters network. All of those networks are trained on the different set of images. VGG and Inception-v3 are trained on ImageNet dataset and Painters network is trained on the set of artworks. In the transfer learning you are implementing with the workflow you fine-tune all of the connected classifiers for your images.
