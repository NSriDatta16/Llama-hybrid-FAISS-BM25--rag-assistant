I'm not sure this is any more elegant than what you already have, but how about: Split the trimmed input by spaces Do a TimeSpan.TryParse on the last piece If this succeeds, check that the value of the resulting TimeSpan is non-negative, and less than a day Do all that in addition to DateTime.TryParse on the string as a whole and you should have more confidence that there is a time component specified.
