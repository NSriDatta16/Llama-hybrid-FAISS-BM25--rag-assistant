Custom UIButton + subviews = no events

Basically I have a custom UIButton and this custom button contains subviews. If I add those subviews to my UIButton, then the button stops responding to event changes. I.e if I tap on it it doesn't respond to the selector. I have everything set as userInteractionEnabled . I also tried adding touchbegan and this is working. If I remove those subviews, the UIButton works again. How Do I get the tap events from the button?
