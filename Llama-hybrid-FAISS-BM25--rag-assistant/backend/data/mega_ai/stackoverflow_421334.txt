There's also LogicT (backtracking monad transformer with fair operations and pruning). It has good value to AI Search algorithms because of its constructs for fair disjunctions, for example, easily enabling computations that succeed an infinite number of times to be combined ( interleaved ). It's usage is described in the ICFP'05 paper Backtracking, Interleaving, and Terminating Monad Transformers
