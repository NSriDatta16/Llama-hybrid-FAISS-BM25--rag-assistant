Some times in time series models, you do not want to extract a subset of the time periods because you want to preserve the original structure in the time series. For example, you might be willing to cut out the first half but you might not be willing to cut out 50% of the data randomly chosen because you would then lose the correlation structure. One example is for particle filtering models. That being said, many time series methods deal with a low number of observations which would not make them "big data".
