How to determine the lifetime?

I want to determine the average expected lifetime of devices of which I have data. This data comprises ~4500 generators of which ~3800 died and the others are still alive. Furthermore, I have information of their production date and end of life, thus giving me a period of successful operation. Or, respectively, the time until they died. Meanwhile, I'm aware of some methods, especially Weibull analysis and survival analysis (I think they are quite connected or maybe even part of each other.. Idk). Could you please point me towards a meaningful direction, resp. which method(s) make(s) sense to dig deeper into?
