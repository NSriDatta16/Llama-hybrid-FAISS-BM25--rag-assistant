How to estimate variance of underlying noise?

I am a beginner to Machine Learning in Python. I have been given set of corresponding values for y and x such that y is a polynomial of an unknown degree in x. Additionally, in the provided data, Gaussian noise of zero mean and an unknown variance has been added, so the y values that are given to me are actually y=f(x) + E (where E is the added Gaussian noise). Is there a way to find the variance for this underlying noise(for instance, any in-built function in python)? Any help would be appreciated.
