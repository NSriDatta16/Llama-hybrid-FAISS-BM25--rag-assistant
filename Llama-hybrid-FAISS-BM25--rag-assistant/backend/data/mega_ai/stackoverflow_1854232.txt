Adding to the RageZ's answer, based on your comments to it: If you don't have an IP address, machine name, or UNC path name, you don't know where the server IS, so you won't be able to connect to it. You'll need an address of some kind. If you can log into the server, you should be able to get its address. Is it on a web host or something? Are you having to get through firewalls?
