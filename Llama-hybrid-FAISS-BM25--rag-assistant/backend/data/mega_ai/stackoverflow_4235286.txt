A resultSet is not the typical means for updating through JDBC. (Normally insert, update statements are used.) There is a paragraph in the tutorial link that you posted that explains the default result set is read only. It says: The default ResultSet concurrency is CONCUR_READ_ONLY. Note: Not all JDBD drivers and databases support concurrency. The method DatabaseMetaData.supportsResultSetConcurrency returns true if the specified concurrency level is supported by the driver and false otherwise.
