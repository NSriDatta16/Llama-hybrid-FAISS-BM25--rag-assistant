Explanation of Mathematics for Retrofitting Word Vectors

The code from this paper on Retrofitting Word Vectors with Semantic Lexicons works really well. The method works with the output of any embedding model. I am trying to understand the mathematics. How is the update rule developed and what is the colon notation used? Any pointers to intro resources on helping to understand the math would be appreciated.
