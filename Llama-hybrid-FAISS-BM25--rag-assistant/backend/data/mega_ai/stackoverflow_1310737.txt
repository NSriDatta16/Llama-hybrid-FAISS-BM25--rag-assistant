People use non-IDE editors like Vi(m) for coding due to the following reasons, They are non-distractive and allows you to concentrate on the job. They do not clutter you screen area and offers you more code space They are faster They have better/faster/cooler text manipulation at the stroke of the finger You happen to move your hands out of the keyboard less to hold the mouse, drag it here and there and click. They also have the flexibility to support other tools like debugger, document viewer, etc. They also have ways to get things like code folding, etc. For a normal programmer whose ideal work cycle is sit, write code, test, debug, more code, test debug, etc., vi offers a simplistic yet powerful environment to get the work done faster and more efficiently. For someone who had years of using some IDE, it might be like using some prehistoric tool, but once they have been through the initial days, then there is no looking back. They'd feel like there isn't any better thing.
