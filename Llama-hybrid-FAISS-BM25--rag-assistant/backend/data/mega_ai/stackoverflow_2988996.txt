http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/helloJavaWorld/vignettes/helloJavaWorld.pdf will show you how to leverage the rJava package and some minimal Java code to use external Java packages. The Stanford NLP parsers have API documentation which you could use to create a wrapper in Java. I am trying to use the NLP parsers from Stanford from R and once I have usable code, I'll b glad to share it with you here.
