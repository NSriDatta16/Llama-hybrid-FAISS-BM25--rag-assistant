The KFold is used to estimate the performance, not to tune the hyper-parameters. Therefore, you should use the full dataset, and it does not cause data leakage. The test is always performed on a holdout set. Repeating this procedure multiple times is just Repeated KFold. Note that KFold CV is different than time series CV, and it assumes no temporal dependency between the samples.
