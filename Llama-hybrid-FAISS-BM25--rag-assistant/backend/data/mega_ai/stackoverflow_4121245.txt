wow, I'm dumb. I just realized I'm setting the playheadtime to the current position in an onEnterFrame. Then in the onRelease I don't remove that reference so it's just going to constantly set the playhead time to the point at which i've dragged the scrubber's position. need a delete this.onEnterFrame in the slider_mc.onRelease.
