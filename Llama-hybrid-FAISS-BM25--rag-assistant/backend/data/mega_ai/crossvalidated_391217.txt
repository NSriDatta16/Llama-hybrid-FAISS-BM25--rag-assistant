Can MCMC algorithm estimate partition function (normalizing constant)?

Importance Sampling can estimated the normalizing constant by averaging the weights (the ratio of unnoramlized distribution and importance distribution). Is there anyway that MCMC algorithm can estimate the normalizing constant as well?
