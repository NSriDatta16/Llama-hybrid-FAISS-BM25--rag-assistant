I'll add a couple of index types BITMAP - when you have very low number of different possible values, very fast and doesn't take up much space PARTITIONED - allows the index to be partitioned based on some property usually advantageous on very large database objects for storage or performance reasons. FUNCTION/EXPRESSION indexes - used to pre-calculate some value based on the table and store it in the index, a very simple example might be an index based on lower() or a substring function.
