There is a distinction between what I would call legal and moral responsibility in this case. As an analogy, suppose you see a man with poor eyesight walking towards a cliff edge, blithely unaware of its existence. As far as your legal responsibility goes, it would in general not be possible to successfully prosecute you if you fail to warn him and he carries on walking, falls off the cliff and dies. On the other hand, you had an opportunity to warn him -- you were in a position to save his life, and you deliberately chose not to do so. The average person tends to regard such behaviour with contempt, judging that you had a moral responsibility to do the right thing. How does this apply to the question at hand? Simple -- the callee is not "legally" responsible for the actions of the caller, stupid or otherwise, such as passing in invalid input. On the other hand, when things go belly up and it is observed that a simple check within your function could have saved the caller from his own stupidity, you will end up sharing some of the moral responsibility for what has happened. There is of course a trade-off going on here, dependent on how much the check actually costs you. Returning to the analogy, suppose that you found out that the same stranger was inching slowly towards a cliff on the other side of the world, and that by spending your life savings to fly there and warn him, you could save him. Very few people would judge you entirely harshly if, in this particular situation, you neglected to do so (let's assume that the telephone has not been invented, for the purposes of this analogy). In coding terms, however, if the check is as simple as checking for NULL , you are remiss if you fail to do so, even if the "real" blame in the situation lies with the caller.
