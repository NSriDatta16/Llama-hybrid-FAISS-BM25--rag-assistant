Linear and non-linear dependence in a single DS model

I have a dataset with parameters (features) a , b , c , etc. We need to develop a model to predict a (our target). b is correlated with a significantly (85%) and I suspect linear dependence. c is a measurement of b in another depth, so it has a high correlation with b and a good correlation with a . Also, there are a bunch of other parameters (numerical features) whose dependence of a is non-linear (from background knowledge and box plot analysis). These features don't have a high correlation with a but have an effect on a . I am building a model to predict a based on the knowledge above. I think that a multi-linear regression cannot be a good idea because of non-linear dependencies. On the other hand, b is a strong predictor of a and depends on a linearly. Therefore, I need to ensemble both linear regression and other methods (e.g., random forest) in a single model to have advantages of both.
