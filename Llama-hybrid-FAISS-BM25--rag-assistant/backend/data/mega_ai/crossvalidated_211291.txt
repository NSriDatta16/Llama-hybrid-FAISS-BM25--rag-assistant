Neural Networks - Difference between one dimensional layer vs multi-dimensional layer

Please take a look at these Neural Network architectures: I can understand the architecture of Hidden Layer in Net-2 : you add 12 Neurons to your hidden layer... What I can't understand is the 2-dimensional hidden layers in Net-3, Net-4 and Net-5. What exactly is a multi-dimensional hidden layer and how can it be implemented? is it an array of 1-dimensional hidden layers? or something else? Thank you...
