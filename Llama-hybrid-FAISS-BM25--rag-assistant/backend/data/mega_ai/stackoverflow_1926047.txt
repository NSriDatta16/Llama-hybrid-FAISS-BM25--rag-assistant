The upside-down A symbol is the universal quantifier from predicate logic . (Also see the more complete discussion of the first-order predicate calculus .) As others noted, it means that the stated assertions holds "for all instances" of the given variable (here, s ). You'll soon run into its sibling, the backwards capital E , which is the existential quantifier , meaning "there exists at least one" of the given variable conforming to the related assertion. If you're interested in logic, you might enjoy the book Logic and Databases: The Roots of Relational Theory by C.J. Date. There are several chapters covering these quantifiers and their logical implications. You don't have to be working with databases to benefit from this book's coverage of logic.
