Wrapping -- don't break up paragraphs

I have a pretty standard page layout where there's an image floated to the left, and then some information to the right of it, that consists of 1 line headers (bold) and 1 line of data underneath each header. I want the data to flow around the image, but is there any way I can stop the data from breaking from the header that goes with it when it wraps? I.E. only wrap between a line of data and the next header. Seems simple, but I haven't been able to come up with a way to do it! Edit: here is a jsfiddle to illustrate my situation (cool site!): http://www.jsfiddle.net/qYcX5/ See the last paragraph is broken apart from its header. BTW, on the actual page I'm building, the length of paragraphs on the right and the # of items will vary, so I can't arbitrarily decide to clear the data at a certain point and always have it look right.
