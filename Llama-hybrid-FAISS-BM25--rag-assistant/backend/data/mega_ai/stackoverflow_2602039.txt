The C and C++ standards say "initial element" and "first element", meaning the same thing. If I remember to be unambiguous, I say "initial", "zeroth", or "first counting from zero". But normally I say "first". That banana stuff is either a humorous exaggeration or a bit bonkers (I suspect the former - it's just a way to explain 0-indexing). I don't think I know anyone who would actually say "first" to mean "index 1 of a 0-indexed array" unless they had first said "zeroth" in the same paragraph in order to make it clear what they mean.
