How do I determine which variables contribute to the 1st PC in PCA?

Given the coefficients of PC1 as follows for each variable (0.30, 0.31, 0.42, 0.37, 0.13, -0.43, 0.29, -0.42, -0.11) which variables contributes most to this PC? Does the sign(+/-) matters or considering the absolute value is enough?
