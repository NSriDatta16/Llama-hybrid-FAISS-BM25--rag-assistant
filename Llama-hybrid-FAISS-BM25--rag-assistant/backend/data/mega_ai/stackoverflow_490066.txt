Interesting question. This gets somewhat involved. You were not super specific about exactly what you mean by "application that disables a core" and exactly what it does, but I presume from your question and the comment to another that this application is disabling the core in a OS kernel friendly way. So, normally when OS X is running, there are many different possible threads/processes (I'll say threads from here on out) that are competing for CPU resources in the scheduler. When both cores of your Core 2 Duo processor are enabled, the kernel has the ability to be running two threads simultaneously - rotating both cores through everything that needs to run. When you disable one of the cores, the kernel is going to drop back to only dispatching work to a single core. Of course, this doesn't change the amount of work that needs to get done....it just cuts your potential execution performance in half. You might not think this matters if your cores were averaging less than 50% busy, right? Well, it does matter in many circumstances and the reason is latency to execute stuff. If there is only one thread runnable at any time, then the second core is always useless, even if it still enabled. However in any situation where two or more threads become runnable....it is possible to take advantage of both cores and if one of them is disabled then the work to be done on the second thread can't even start until the previous thread executes for awhile and then gets swapped out. Assuming two threads with equal work to be done, clearly it is going to take twice as long for the second thread to get to completion compared to the dual core case. You may not notice this, depending how much work we are talking about here, but clearly the latency (responsiveness) at least in theory is going to be cut in half. Clearly, as the system loads up with more and more threads that need to run or threads that have more work to do, it will become progressively more obvious that everything is running - in effect - at half speed. That was all pretty straight forward. So what does this mean relative to heat dissipation and battery life? Do you come out ahead here or not....because point in fact while you might be inclined to think you are drawing half as much power per unit time, work is in fact taking twice as long to complete. The conclusion here is that disabling a core, in the end, will have very little if any impact on overall battery life because the OS and the CPU are already working together to throttle back the clocks and effectively shutdown a core that is not needed. That is, there is really little to no overhead in having a core in the waiting ready to be used when you need it. In fact, a system might actually have shorter battery life with only one core is used because all the other devices on the motherboard have to stay active longer as the CPU is taking longer to get the needed work done. Relative to heat dissipation, the effect is similar. Clearly, the peak heat dissipation in terms of WATTS is dramatically cut down with only one core....because only one of two cores is actually active. However, again, that core will be running longer and the net total energy output (JOULES or WATT SECONDS) will be approximately the same...which is again why your battery life is largely unaffected in the one core vs. two core case.
