Cook's distance for GLM

In Applied Logistic Regression by Hosmer, Lemeshow and Sturdivant (2013), the formula for Cook's distance in a logistic regression is given as, $$\Delta\beta_j = \frac{r_{sj}^2h_j}{1-h_j}$$ where $r_{sj}$ is the (internally) studentised residual for observation $j$ , and $h$ is the leverage value. However, in R I believe the Cook's distance for logistic regressions is adjusted by the number of parameters, $p$ , in the model (including the intercept), i.e. $$\frac{r_{sj}^2h_j}{p(1-h_j)}$$ Could someone confirm which is the correct version and why there is a difference?
