Perform linear regression after box plot. Is that possible?

I am currently investigating a dataset with a visible linear relationship between the considered variable (Look at the red dots in the figure). However, the linear regression results are not good due to the data's extreme variance (look at the y-axis). For the sake of clarity, these values are correct. They are not outliers. I then divided the dataset into groups, considering the variable on the x-axis, and I calculated each group's average value (using a boxplot method). Finally, I applied a linear regression on the average value I got from the boxplots, obtaining good results. The question is: is that procedure possible, or could it be considered like “cheating”? Moreover, is it possible to quantify or explain how this is different from doing the regression directly on the scatter plot, and not the binned averages?
