If you are not getting any errors, then probably you are already fine. Restart the emulator just to be sure. Rebuild the project and run it. It takes a few seconds(takes about 20 on mine) for the emulator to start ans show the app. It may also be deployed, but tucked inside the menu. So, drag open the menu bar where you see the applications such as Alarm etc. There you should see your own application too. Just click it to open it.
