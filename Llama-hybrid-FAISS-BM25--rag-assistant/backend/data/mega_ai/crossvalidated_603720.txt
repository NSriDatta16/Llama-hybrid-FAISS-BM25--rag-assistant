Same variable importance scores for SVM, KNN, and NB classifiers (R CARET )

I am comparing some ML classifiers (RF, KNN, SVM, NB, and XGBOOST). After training these classifiers, I extracted variable importance scores from each of these models using varImp function in CARET. I noticed that the variable importance scores for SVM, KNN, and NB are exactly the same. I am wondering, how is this possible. Any help on this will be highly appreciated. Thanks in adavance.
