If you are looking for pre-built powerful extensible functionality then checkout SharePoint. Plugging in and extending the API can be a bit challenging, but its got great default functionality, a powerful web designer, and powerful - configureable workflows. I lived with the Microsoft SharePoint book by my side, it has details that you will not find on MSDN that often are critical to achieving your goals (I had the 2007 edition, but I'm sure the 2010 is gonna be great too). On the other hand (or dont have a few grand in the budget), you can go straight to the WF framework and customize to your heart's extent. Once again, from my firsthand experience this framework is also challenging, but the basics can be easily accomplished in visual studio with a nice design based drag-drop UI.
