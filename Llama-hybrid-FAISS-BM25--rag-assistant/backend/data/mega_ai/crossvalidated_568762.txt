When to convert an ordinal variable to a binary variable?

I have seen some people convert their ordinal variable to a binary one, especially in the public opinion literature. For instance, when there is a four-scale question with responses including "Strongy agree," "Agree," "Disagree," and "Strongly disagree," some authors simply code "strongly agree" and "agree" as 1, the two other responses 0. Then they use a logistic regression model to analyze their data. I am not sure why they simply don't use their ordinal data with an ordered logistic model. When do we need to convert our ordinal data to binary one?
