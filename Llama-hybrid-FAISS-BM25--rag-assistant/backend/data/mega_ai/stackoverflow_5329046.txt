Java Multi-line regex to replace multiple instances in a file

OK, so I have been searching for hours about my problem but nothing seems to come up. So here's my code snippet followed by the problem: Pattern forKeys = Pattern.compile("^ \\s* Deviation .*? ", Pattern.DOTALL|Pattern.MULTILINE); Matcher n = forKeys.matcher(""); String aLine = null; while((aLine = in.readLine()) != null) { n.reset(aLine); String result = n.replaceAll(""); out.write(result); out.newLine(); } let's just assume the undeclared variables are already declared.. my point is, my RegEx (and maybe the matcher also) is not working properly. I want to erase the parts with the " Deviation *any character/s here* " included in the ff lines: Deviation Average Deviation sample words I think my problem is the use of repititive operators (how to traverse line breaks, tabs, etc), but I can't seem to find the correct expression. Any ideas? Thanks in advance.
