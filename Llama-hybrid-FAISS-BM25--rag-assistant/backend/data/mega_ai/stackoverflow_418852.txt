I generally have a Files table that stores files more generically. Then in your other tables, you could have a column for each image (file) which is just a reference into the files table. Your files table would have all the normal stuff like ID, Filename, Size, type, etc. Then yes, you'd just join into it to get what you need for whatever query you're running. In case there is any doubt--I'd strongly discourage you from storing files directly in the database. I don't think that's what your after but if anyone else gets that idea--just don't do it!
