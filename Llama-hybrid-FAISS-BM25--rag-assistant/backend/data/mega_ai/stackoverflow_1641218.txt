Wireless mesh network based on cheap consumer routers

I wanted to know if any such system already exists for the average open-source user. With all of the net neutrality arguments around and with the cost of broadband likely to go up in the future. It seems like a good idea for an open-source protocol that allows standard consumer routers to operate together and form a mesh network with other consumer routers close by. Likely possible that with enough nodes in close enough proximity and a good abstraction we could get something good going.
