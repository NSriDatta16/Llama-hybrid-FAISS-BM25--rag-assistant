CV problem in LIBSVM

I am using LIBSVM for regression problem. Based on the codes provides in their FAQ, the grid search is like this: bestcv = 0; for log2c = -1:3, for log2g = -4:1, cmd = ['-v 5 -c ', num2str(2^log2c), ' -g ', num2str(2^log2g)]; cv = svmtrain(heart_scale_label, heart_scale_inst, cmd); if (cv >= bestcv), bestcv = cv; bestc = 2^log2c; bestg = 2^log2g; end fprintf('%g %g %g (best c=%g, g=%g, rate=%g)\n', log2c, log2g, cv, bestc, bestg, bestcv); end end with the codes above I always got the worst results, then I changed to the following and everthing works well. bestcv = inf;... if (cv In my sense cv is a score, more is better, and should be less than 1(100%). But in my case cv becomes like error, less is better, and some are bigger than 1. It's so weird, maybe I did something wrong? or can I keep my codes and results like mine?
