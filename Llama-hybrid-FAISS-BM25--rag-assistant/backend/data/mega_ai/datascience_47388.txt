Including identifier in machine learning model as feature vs separate model for every identifier

I am new to machine learning and i am building a model to predict number of customers for the model branch at specific hour/season/other feature. I know it will be bad idea to pit id( branch_id in my case) into model but customer count in this case hugely depend on which branch it is so i cannot exclude it. I can think of two solutions, i am not sure which one is right and what is the best practice. Create dummy variable(one hot encoding to avoid wieghing one id more than other) for all branch ids,but since i have 600 unique branch ids my features will go up-to 600+rest_of_features . Learn a separate model for each of the branch(600 models), i am not sure if it is right approach and also i am not very familiar with this approach and it will be very time consuming. Looking for the suggestion Example of the data is below +-----------+------+-----------+-----------+-------------------+ | branch_id | hour | feature_2 | feature_3 | Count of customer | +-----------+------+-----------+-----------+-------------------+ | 1 | 12 | .. | .. | 19 | | 1 | 01 | .. | .. | 25 | | 2 | 23 | .. | .. | 14 | | 2 | 01 | .. | .. | 5 | +-----------+------+-----------+-----------+-------------------+
