You should either look into a source control system (Git perhaps?) or into a file storage / syncing / sharing service like DropBox . DropBox would allow you to access code snippets from wherever you are and works really easily (just drop a file into a folder). If you need versioning and branching you're going to have to look into a source control system. Since you have a server at home, that should be no problem.
