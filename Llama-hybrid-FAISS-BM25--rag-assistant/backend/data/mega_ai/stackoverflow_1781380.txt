utf8 with Mysql-5.0.88, ruby 1.8.7, rails 2.2 and snow leopard?

I'm just starting with the depot application in the Pragmatic Programmer's Rails book. When I try doing a rake db:create RAILS_ENV-'development' after creating a rails application, I get the following error: Couldn't create database for {"encoding"=>"utf8", "username"=>"root", "adapter"=>"mysql", "database"=>"depot_development", "pool"=>5, "password"=>nil, "socket"=>"/tmp/mysql.sock"}, charset: utf8, collation: utf8_general_ci (if you set the charset manually, make sure you have a matching collation) My my.cnf looks like this: [mysqld] character-set-filesystem=UTF8 character-set-server=UTF8 default-collation=UTF8_general_ci default-character-set=UTF8 [client] default-character-set=UTF8 [mysqldump] default-character-set=UTF8 What am I doing wrong?
