I have been using java and only recently began learning Apple's Obj-C framework. An alternative to scrolling and row-breaking is using a "grid" layout with 1 row and n columns, where n is the number of buttons. Each cell has a fixed size. And you will have to resize your buttons (the subviews) in your superview's setNeedsLayout: method to whatever width you need such that all buttons fit the row. See java's GridLayout class.
