Can features that are the same in every sample contribute to learning?

For simplicity, let's say that I am monitoring 4 sensors for an ongoing metric. The first column is the sensor ID and the second column is the sensor type . [ [ [0, 0, 0.123], [1, 0, 0.456], [2, 1, 0.789], [3, 1, 0.555] ], [ [0, 0, 0.987], [1, 0, 0.654], [2, 1, 0.321], [3, 1, 0.666] ], [ [0, 0, 0.591], [1, 0, 0.824], [2, 1, 0.760], [3, 1, 0.888] ] ] If the first two columns are always the same values, will a CNN or an LSTM be able to learn from these columns or are they just redundant? In my mind, the sensor ID could correspond with a postion on the map where different metrics are observed. Or the sensor type could correspond with some sort of sensitivity in the metric. But am I just kidding myself if they are the same in every sample? I don't want to provide unnecessary dimensionality to the model.
