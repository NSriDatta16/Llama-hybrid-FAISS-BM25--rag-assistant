If you want it to work well, yes, you need to do a feature transformation. PCA or LDA work well. PCA will take a collection of input vectors (in this case, your vectorized images) and find the Eigenfaces that span the set of inputs. Then, during testing, you project your input vector (i.e., image) onto this set of Eigenfaces and use the resulting coordinate vector as your feature vector. For more information, see [ Turk and Pentland, 1991 ]. My personal experiments using this basic PCA method on the PIE database were successful.
