Since you make sure to put your instances.add(this) at the end of the constructor you should IMHO be safe to tell the compiler to simply suppress the warning (*) . A warning, by its nature, doesn't necessarily mean that there's something wrong, it just requires your attention. If you know what you're doing you can use a @SuppressWarnings annotation. Like Terrel mentioned in his comments, the following annotation does it as of NetBeans 6.9.1: @SuppressWarnings("LeakingThisInConstructor") (*) Update: As Isthar and Sergey pointed out there are cases where "leaking" constructor code can look perfectly safe (as in your question) and yet it is not. Are there more readers that can approve this? I am considering deleting this answer for the mentioned reasons.
