Find relationship in two time series datasets

I have two datasets: Ingested ingredients at a point in time e.g. | 24/04/2016 11:56:33 | Tomatoe | | 24/04/2016 11:56:33 | White rice | | 24/04/2016 14:34:01 | Mars Bar | Symptoms | 24/04/2016 12:45:05 | Flatulence | | 24/04/2016 14:34:01 | Stomach Pain | Could anyone point me in the direction of how I could find relationships between these two datasets. I can see 2 things which may be important The proximity of the cause to the event (if a symptom arose a minute after the ingredient was ingested it seems unlikely to be the cause. That a symptom isn't an event at a singular point in time and may slowly get worse, then slowly get better. Any suggestion or links to resources would be appreciated. BTW I'm not a mathematician. Thanks
