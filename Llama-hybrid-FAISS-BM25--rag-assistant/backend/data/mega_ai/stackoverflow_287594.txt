Insert into multiple database tables using Linq, ASP.NET MVC

I have a rather simple scenario where I have two tables in which I want to add data. They are managed with primary key/foreign key. I want to add new data into TABLE A and then retrieve the Id and insert into TABLE B. I can certainly do it with a stored procedure, but I'm looking at trying to do it using Linq. What is the best approach ? I can certainly get the ID and do two separate inserts but that doesn't certainly seem to be a very good way of doing things. db.Table.InsertOnSubmit(dbObject); db.SubmitChanges(); Int32 id = dbOject.Id; //Rest of the code Any way to elegantly do this?
