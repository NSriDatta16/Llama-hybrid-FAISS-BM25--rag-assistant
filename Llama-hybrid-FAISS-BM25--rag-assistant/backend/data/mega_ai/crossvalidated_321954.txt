Issue with calculating probability from a binary logistic regression

Response variable: detection/non-detection of voles, 0/1 data Explanatory variable:survey events/day where predator present number of days = 12 range of events = 13 Coefficients/logits = -1.145, -0.132 In order to convert this to the probability of response variable = 1 I was trying this: P(vole detection=1) = p = (-1.145 - 0.132 * predator events) My issue is what do I put for "predator events" Would it be correct to put the range, 13? I hope this data is enough to give an idea of what Im trying to do, please let me know if it isn't adequate Many thanks
