How should I move a WPF Window using MVVM?

This is probably overkill on the MVVM pattern but it's new to me and I'm interested to see if it is possible. If I attach to the MouseMove event for a Window and do DragMove, I can move a bordeless window. Can I achieve this by some other method in MVVM or should I just accept adding this code to the Window's codebehind?
