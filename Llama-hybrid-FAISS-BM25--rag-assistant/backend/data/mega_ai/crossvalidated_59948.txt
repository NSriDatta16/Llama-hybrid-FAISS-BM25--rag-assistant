I study subpopulation so huge that chi-squares test insists it is not representative. How do I get confidence intervals for my population?

I want to get results about population A. But all I can study is subpopulation C of B, where B is a subpopulation of A (that is, C $\subset$ B $\subset$ A). Each member of A is classified into one of the groups G1, G2, G3 and G4. Selection from A into B is not random, but selection from B into C is random, although some members of B have better chances to be selected into C. To test if subpopulation C is representative of A, I constructed the "contingency" table ... A B C Total? G1 9817678 621718 90196 10,529,592 G2 1280567 191298 30799 1,502,664 G3 426856 79707 11000 517,563 G4 9817678 701425 87996 10,607,099 Total 21,342,779 1,594,148 219,991 23,156,918 ... ignoring my doubts about column "Total?". For example, grand total 23,156,918 is pretty meaningless, since there are only 21,342,779 physically distinct members. And, of course, for such huge populations the chi-squares test insists that B is not representative for A, and C is not representative for B. d Am I applying the wrong statistical test here? Now, if I would randomly sample 100 members from A, B and C, and get the "average" numbers for G1 - G4, the chi-squared will be pretty confident that C is representative of B: d.r100 It feels wrong that the more data I process, the worse my representativeness becomes. After all, if studying "subpopulation C" will fetch me the answer for "population A" plus-minus mere 2-3%, it will be fine. But how do I estimate my confidence intervals for "A" if all I can study is "C"?
