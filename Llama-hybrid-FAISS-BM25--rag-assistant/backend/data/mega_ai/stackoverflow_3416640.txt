Thanks Don/iWasRobbed, they did have expiring provisioning profiles which they deleted, and they did attempt a sync afterwards. The app still wouldn't appear when dragged into iTunes so I had them come into the office, when connecting their iPhone to my computer Xcode indicated their OS version 4.01 was not supported by my current SDK(s) (only up to 4.0!). Downloaded Xcode 3.2.3 again with SDK 4.01 and their iPhone status light switched from a yellow to green light and built.
