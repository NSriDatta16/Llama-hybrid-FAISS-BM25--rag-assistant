I suspect this is the result of fitting a logistic regression to binary data and computing the residuals. I can recreate a similar plot by doing so These sorts of residuals aren't super useful, as the quantity $Y - \hat{Y}$ for logistic regression isn't a nice distribution unlike linear regression. There are a bunch of other types of residuals you can look at (See Frank Harrell's Regression Modelling Strategies ) but I prefer the deviance residuals.
