how to properly validate a Random Forest classifier model?

I have read in the webpage given by the creators of the RF model the following: "The out-of-bag (oob) error estimate In random forests, there is no need for cross-validation or a separate test set to get an unbiased estimate of the test set error. It is estimated internally, during the run..." For what I know because of the way it works a RF then there is no need to use CV, but I was surprised to read that there is no need of a test set either. In that case if I want to make a classifier using RF, for example a benign or malign tumor classifier, with a dataset of n samples, is it not needed to use a separate test set and I can run the model with all the dataset? For instance in the scikit library of Python appears the following example: >>> from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier >>> from sklearn.datasets import make_classification >>> X, y = make_classification(n_samples=1000, n_features=4, ... n_informative=2, n_redundant=0, ... random_state=0, shuffle=False) >>> clf = RandomForestClassifier(max_depth=2, random_state=0) >>> clf.fit(X, y) RandomForestClassifier(...) >>> print(clf.predict([[0, 0, 0, 0]])) So, if I do not separate in a train and test set or use CV because there is no need of that, then how can I validate a model based on RF?
