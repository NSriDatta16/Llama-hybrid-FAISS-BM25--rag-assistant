Comparison of explaned variances in PCA

I computed a PCA and am interestet in the explained variance of the first unrotated component. The same procedure was used in a previous study. Question: How do I test whether the two explaned variance ("mine" and the one from the previous study) differ significantly? Note: Procedure and input variables are the same, samples are independent and differ in size.
