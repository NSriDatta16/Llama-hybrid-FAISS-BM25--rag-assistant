How should I organize my Flex application?

I'm currently a .NET developer, but I'm starting to work with Flex a little bit and I've found the community to be great. There are a lot of great resources out there, but one of the issues I'm running into conceptually is how to organize a flex project. Coming from the standpoint of a "traditional" ASP.NET web application I'd create folders of related pages, controls, CSS, JavaScript, etc. What's the best pattern for organizing a flex application? I like using the code behind pattern with my MXML files, but these aren't really "pages" per se, so how do you keep from just dumping everything into the root of your src folder?
