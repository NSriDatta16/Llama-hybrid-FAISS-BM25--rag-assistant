So your problem is that you have labeled data, and unlabeled data. Look at 1st answer: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/19170603/what-is-the-difference-between-labeled-and-unlabled-data : There are many active areas of research in machine learning that are aimed at integrating unlabeled and labeled data to build better and more accurate models of the world. Semi-supervised learning attempts to combine unlabeled and labeled data (or, more generally, sets of unlabeled data where only some data points have labels) into integrated models. So you have to google for semi-supervised learning. This is way of state-of-the-art. My way(without reading about semi-supervised learning so much), is to do unsupervised learning on whole data, to get clusters of similar cases. Then use humans(doctors) to describe clusters - is this cluster kidney disease or not?. Then you have data for supervised learning. And you can learn whatever you want Bayesian/LinearRegression/SVM classifiers.
