Sure, you can get this somehow working by calling the compiler with a given String, and then you probably need a custom classloader. However Scala is a static language, so it will never be as convenient and elegant as in Ruby or other dynamic languages. [Edit] I never tried it, but I found this link: http://scala-programming-language.1934581.n4.nabble.com/Compiling-a-Scala-Snippet-at-run-time-td2000704.html
