The test statistic $z_i$, calculated from the sample as a counted fraction, though it may well be a sensible measure of discrepancy with the null hypothesis, will not have a standard Gaussian distribution ($z_i$ is restricted to $Â±\frac{1}{2}$, whereas around 60% of standard Gaussian variates fall outside that range). Continuing your approach seems likely to end up with Mood's Median Test , or something similar. However, predicting the probability of an event from continuous measurements is what logistic regression was invented for. Advantages include being able to use more than one of those measurements in a predictive model, not having to make assumptions about their distribution, & being able to model non-monotonic relationships with the response.
