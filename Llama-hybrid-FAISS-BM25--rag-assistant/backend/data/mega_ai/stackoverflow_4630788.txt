Looks like bill of material information to me. Embedding this in Java classes as static data seems to be terribly rigid to me. It's far more natural to store it in a relational, hierarchical, object, or graph database. The other problem is that the code to process this will be a spaghetti forest of if/then/else or switch statements to process. It's hard to overstate just how wrong-headed this appears to be. You might get an answer that will allow you to proceed, but this can only end in grief.
