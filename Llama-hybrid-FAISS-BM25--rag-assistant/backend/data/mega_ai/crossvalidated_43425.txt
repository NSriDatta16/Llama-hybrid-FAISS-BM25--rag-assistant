You can do this in a GLM framework with a log() link function or with a poisson regression model instead of transforming $q$. Both of these will handle the log of zero issue very well. However, getting the time series aspect of the problem right might be a challenge in this framework. For example, you might have shocks to demand that persist from day to day. I am not sure why you need to transform $p$ since it is presumably greater than zero at all times. Unfortunately, the elephant in the room is probably endogeneity . Unless you have a very unusual case, you are not identifying the price elasticity. I would bet dollars to donuts that your price coefficient will be positive. Take a look at these lecture notes to get an idea of what's going wrong.
