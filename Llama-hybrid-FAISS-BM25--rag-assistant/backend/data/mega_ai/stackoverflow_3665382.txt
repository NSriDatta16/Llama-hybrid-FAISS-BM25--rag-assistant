Firefox with firebug extension - the Net panel contains pretty much anything you could want to inspect network traffic. Chrome has something very similar builtin (no extension needed), but has slightly better tools to benchmark the performance, along with an audit tab that firebug doesn't have. Both are good. You might also want to try opera dragonfly which is a little different, but just as useful as those 2.
