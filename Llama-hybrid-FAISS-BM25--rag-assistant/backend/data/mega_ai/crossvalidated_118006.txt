Multilevel logistic regression with a random slope(s)

I would like to specify a two-level logistic regression model with random intercept and random slope. Dependent variable : hospitalization (1) or no-hospitalization (0). Independent variables : age, number of drugs used, comorbidity, others... Multilevel structure : patients clustered within hospitals. Hospitalization rate varies across different hospitals. The goal is to identify variables in the model that explain the largest part of variation in hospitalization rate. I have two questions: Can I run several models each time allowing for random intercept + random slope including all other variables as fixed. I would like to have a look at the size of variance that is explained by each patients' characteristic, but when i add several random slopes model does not converge. When I specify the random slope then the intercept variance is inflated. How can I interpret that?
