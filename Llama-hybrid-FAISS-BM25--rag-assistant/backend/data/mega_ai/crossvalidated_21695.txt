Statistically back-calculating: Markov Chain?

I would like to calculate the value of bacteria on 4 surfaces $i=\{1..4\}$. A person touches some of those 4 surfaces at random and a count is made on their finger after each surface contact ($x_i$). Someone lost the bacteria count ($x_i$) after each surface but I do know the total count (X) on a persons's finger after they've touched a number of surfaces. I also know which ones and in which order. What I know: Final bacteria count on a person's finger: $X$ Transfer efficiency from surface to finger: $PT_i=\displaystyle \frac{\text{Finger contact area}}{\text{Area of surface}_i}\frac{1}{\gamma_i}$ where $\gamma$ is a surface dependent constant. The number of times the person touched a particular surface: $h_i$. If I had surface counts $C_i$, the summation of bacteria is linear: ie $\begin{eqnarray} h_1C_1PT_1&=&x_1\\ h_2C_2PT_2&=&x_2\\ \vdots\quad &=& \quad \vdots\\ h_iC_iPT_i&=&x_i \end{eqnarray}$ such that summing over all surfaces $i$ the total count x is: $\displaystyle \sum_i h_iC_iPT_i=\sum_i x_i=X$. Can I back calculate $C_i$, without $x_i$ even statistically or probabilistically? Best regards.
