In my app I want the user to either be able to click a button browse for a file use NSOpenPanel, and specify the allowed types or drag and drop it into the application and have it open the image. How can I do this? Which method would be easiest or do you recommend? subclass NSDocument, and associate the document type with the image mime-type; this association is made in your app's plist resource. unless you have special needs, you can use CGImage and/or NSImage apis to open the image.
