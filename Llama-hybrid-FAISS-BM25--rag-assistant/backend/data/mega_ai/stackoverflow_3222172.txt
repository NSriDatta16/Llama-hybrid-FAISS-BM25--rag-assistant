First of all, yes, you should be using [super selected] if you want it to perform the default behavior for the menu item, rather than just copying the contents of the superclass' function. In the case of the CCMenuItemLabel, which is what you copied, calling [super selected] will allow the label to "do its thing" with respect to the visual effects it does when selected. This allows you to concentrate on what YOU want to do. As to why your sprite cannot be seen, and what the "undeclared" error might be, it's hard to say without seeing the code. One problem might be that you said you are subclassing CCMenuItem, but are pasting in CCMenuItemLabel code. Have you tried just watching ccTouchesBegan and ccTouchesEnded directly on your button sprite? Might be more straightforward than trying to force CCMenuItem to do something it wasn't really designed to do... Failing that, look into "virtual joysticks" and you should get some good sample code.
