As pointed out earlier foreign keys would be nice in this place. But regarding question 1 you could perhaps run the changes within a transaction from the MySQL prompt. This assumes you are using a transaction safe storage engine like InnoDB. You can convert from myisam to InnoDB if you need to. Anyway something like this: START TRANSACTION; ...Perform changes... ...Control changes... COMMIT; ...or... ROLLBACK; Is it acceptable to have any downtime? When working with PostgreSQL with databases >250Gb we use this technique on production servers in order to perform database changes. If the outcome isn't as expected we just rollback the transaction. Of course there is a penalty as the I/O-system has to work a bit. // John
