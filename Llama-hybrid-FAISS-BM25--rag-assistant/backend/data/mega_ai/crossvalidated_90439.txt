Generating a categorical variable from an imputed variable

I am using multiple imputation to impute a continuous variable ($X$) with $\approx30\%$ missing values. I have a question regarding the generation of a new categorical variable ($Y$), starting from this imputed variable. I want to use $Y$ as an independent variable in a logistic regression model instead of $X$ (I understand I'm losing information by doing this). This is an example of how the categories in $Y$ would work: $$ Y = \begin{cases} 0 &{\rm if}\ \ \quad\quad\quad\! X As imputed values vary between each set, I end up with a (not that much) different number of cases in each category of $Y$ on each imputed set. Is this an appropriate approach if $X$ was imputed?
