question about inter-process messaging

Hi I am implementing an IM-server-like application in Erlang. I used one agent process for each client connecting to the server, and the agent process is responsible for sending the messages to a message gateway, which in turn sends the message to another agent process. It seems that erlang inter-process messaging is implemented as tcp connections. So there will be one connection for each agent process to the gateway. Does this mean that the number of agents on a single machine will never exceed over 65,535 due to the restriction of port numbers? Thanks in advance!
