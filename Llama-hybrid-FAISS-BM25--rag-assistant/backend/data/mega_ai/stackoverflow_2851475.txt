You can use eval to do something close: foo=fooDefault bar=barDefault for arg in "$@"; do eval ${arg} done This version doesn't bother with a leading dash, so you would run it as: myscript foo=newvalue That said, a couple of words of caution. Because we are using eval, the caller can inject any code/data they want into your script. If you need your code to be secure, you are going to have to validate ${arg} before you eval it. Also, this is not very elegant if you need to have spaces in your data as you will have to double quote them (once for the command line and a second time for the inner eval ): myscript foo='"with sapces"'
