IPostBackEventHandler RaisePostBackEvent not triggered on asynchronous postback

I have designed a custom user control, basically a button, that implements the IPostBackEventHandler interface, and obviously defines the RaisePostBackEvent(string eventArgument) method, where I do some processing, basically I trigger other events. By default, when clicked my control will execute __doPostBack its client id for a full page refresh, and of course RaisePostBackEvent is triggered. However, I want to be able the use the control to refresh an update panel, so from client side I use the __doPostBack method with the ID of the update panel and an additional argument. The problem is that RaisePostBackEvent is not triggered. I know i could look in Page.Request.Params["__EVENTARGUMENT"] and do whatever I need, but I would really like something as simple and elegant as IPostBackEventHandler so as to have all the logic in my control. Long story short, how can I trigger RaisePostBackEvent in case I have an asynchronous postback? Or is there another interface that with similar functionality?
