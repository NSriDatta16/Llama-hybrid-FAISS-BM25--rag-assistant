I don't really believe svm's would fit here as the features used in this classifier are numerical and hence, are not easy to be interpreted. What about Naive Bayes? It can serve as a binary classifier and at the same time you can "see" which features contribute to the class decision... What type of features do you have? nominal, ordinal, numerical, ...?
