Are insignificant variables included in calculation of predicted probabilities?

When calculating the predicted probabilities in a logistic regression model, do we consider all the variables or just the significant ones? For eg: Let's say my model has: dependent variable Y and 3 dependent variables Xi out of which coefficients of X1 an X2 are significant whereas X3 is not significant. So for calculating the the predicted probabilities will I use just X1*beta1 + X2*beta2 or include X3*beta3 as well?
