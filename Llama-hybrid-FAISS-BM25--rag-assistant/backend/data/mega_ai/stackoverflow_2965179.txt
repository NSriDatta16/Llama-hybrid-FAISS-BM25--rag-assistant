Help on choosing which SQL Server 2008 scale-out solution to pick (replication, ...)

I am currently crossing the jungle of SQL Server scale-out technologies like replication, log-shipping, mirroring... I have the following constraints on my choice: I want the read-only load to be spread accross the primary and the secondary (mirror, subscriber) server Write load can be sent directly to the primary server The solution should be nearly maintainance free. Schema changes should just replicate to the secondary server (attention: replication has some serious constraints here as it seems) Written data should be accessible very quickly (in under 1s, but better would be instantaneously) on the secondary server On server failure I can tollerate up to one hour of data loss easily. I am more concerned with easy scalability Here are some options for what I could pick: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb510414.aspx . Any experience you could share?
