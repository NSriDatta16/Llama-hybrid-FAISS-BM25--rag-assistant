Is short vector length in PCA problematic? Why are my points so far from my vectors?

I am using PCA to examine the relationships between environmental factors of a couple of different types (physical properties, concentrations, relative abundance of genes). I have log-transformed the data, which I think solved issues with scaling. However, when I run the analysis, the points (locations) are very far from one another, making interpretation of the vector relationships difficult. When I zoom in, I can clearly examine the relationships between vectors but lose a couple of my points (the top left Quality Drain sample for instance) Why are my points so far apart? I assume my points/observations are flying apart because they are simply different from one another but I am concerned that my short vector length may be an issue that is stemming from something I don't understand or am making a mistake.
