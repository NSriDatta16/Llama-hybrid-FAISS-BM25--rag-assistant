You can read the first several pages of the paper: "A Tail of Two Projects: How 'Agile' Methods Succeeded After 'Traditional' Methods Had Failed in a Critical System-Development Project" that Robert Bedoll wrote about agile methods at Boeing and published for XP/Agile Universe 2003 here , on Google Books. Here's a summary: We adopted the following principles: Rapid prototyping of designs, with immediate customer feedback Continuous involvement of the customer Weekly production releases: Follow our standard development cycle (requirements - design – code – test - release) but compress it from formal releases every three months to formal releases every week. Start simple and keep it simple Evolve the tool to follow the evolving business process Provide a one to three week cycle time for new feature introduction Maintain a small development team Produce abbreviated versions of our standard design documents.Let the prototyping drive the design documentation. Retain our SEI (Software Engineering Institute) Level 2 rating. It looks like there's a draft " not yet been formally approved by Boeing for publication " in .doc format here , that explains the principles in more detail. I'm not not a lawyer and don't know if there are legal implications if one were to read that draft. You can buy the whole published paper as a .pdf here and probably other places.
