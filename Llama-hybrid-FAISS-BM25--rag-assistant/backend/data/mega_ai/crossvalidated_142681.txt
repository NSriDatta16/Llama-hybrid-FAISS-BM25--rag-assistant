Thank you for your comments. I have removed the pseudo MLE chi square from the print function for principal because it clearly leads to confusion. I have added the root mean square off diagonal residual because this is probably a more useful estimate of goodness of fit. I have retained the fit of the model to the off diagonal elements. As everyone will recognize, PCA is not trying to optimally fit the off diagonals but most users act as if that is what they want. I continue to report them empirical chi square. This based upon the size of observed residuals and is not MLE based (nor does it need to be). I will try to document how the various stats are estimated a bit more clearly in the next release of psych (coming soon).
