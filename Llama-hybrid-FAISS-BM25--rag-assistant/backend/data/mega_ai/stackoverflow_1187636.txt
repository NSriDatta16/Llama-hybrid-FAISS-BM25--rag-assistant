Can I add a WCF DataContract to a complex type?

I have a complex data type, including a number of functions, as well as the usual get and get methods. My life would be considerably easier if I could use WCF so my client can also use this data type. Do I Ignore all the operations, putting [DataMemeber] only where needed. Put the class in question in a shared library assembly for both client and server to access. Thanks, Roberto PS. I realise that the question is probably not as well worded as it could be.
