Maybe using the WebBrowserObject could be a solution. This is embedding an Internet Explorer inside a form, so, you can set an html page as default one for it and show your Adobe AIR application. http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa752085(v=vs.85).aspx I'll check if there's another way of doing that, but this is acceptable if you don't need to communicate your forms application with the AIR one.
