Stationarity of ARMA-like time series

It is well known that for $X_t \sim ARMA(p,q)$ where $\phi(B)X_t = \theta(B)Z_t, Z_t\sim WN(0, \sigma^2)$ , if $\phi(z)\neq0$ in the unit circle, $\{X_t\}$ is stationary. Now assume $\{Y_t, t=0, \pm1, ...\}$ is a stationary time series. $\phi(B)X_t = \theta(B)Y_t$ . If $\phi(z)\neq0$ in the unit circle, is $\{X_t\}$ still stationary? This question is from Brockwell Problem 3.4. I think we should go from the definition of (weak) stationary, but found it hard to calculate the expectation and acvf of $\{X_t\}$ . How could we prove it? By the comment from @Zhanxiong , the original question is that $\{X_t\}$ has a stationary solution. It's clear that $\mathbb{E}(X_t)$ can come from one of the root of $\phi(z) = \theta(\mathbb{E}Y_t)$ . But how can we define the acvf $\gamma_X(h)$ to let our solution of $X_t$ stationary?
