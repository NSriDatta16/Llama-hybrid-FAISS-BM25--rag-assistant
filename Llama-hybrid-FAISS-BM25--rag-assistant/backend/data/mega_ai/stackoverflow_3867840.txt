PHP implode array to generate mysql IN criteria

I have a function like the following: public function foo ($cities = array('anaheim', 'baker', 'colfax') ) { $db = global instance of Zend_Db_Adapter_Pdo_Mysql... $query = 'SELECT name FROM user WHERE city IN ('.implode(',',$cities).')'; $result = $db->fetchAll( $query ); } This works out fine until someone passes $cities as an empty array. To prevent this error I have been logic-breaking the query like so: $query = 'SELECT name FROM user'; if (!empty($cities)) { $query .= ' WHERE city IN ('.implode(',',$cities).')'; } but this isn't very elegant. I feel like there should be a better way to filter by a list, but I am not sure how. Any advice?
