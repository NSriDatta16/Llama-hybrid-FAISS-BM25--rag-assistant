Yes, it may very well make sense to do feature selection after PCA. PCA often yields a small number of components that explain a large fraction of variance in the data. Discarding the low-variance components and keeping only the high-variance components for future analysis can offer good a good balance w.r.t. the bias-variance tradeoff. In fact, PCA is often used precisely for that.
