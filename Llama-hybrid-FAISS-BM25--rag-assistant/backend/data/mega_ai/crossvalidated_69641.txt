Separating effects of foods and of food components in nutritional epidemiology

I have data on average long-term intake of common foods of a medium/large cohort (n=500+). It was assessed semi-quantitatively (that is, interval-censored). From these about 100 food items and their rough intake frequency I have, using a food database, calculated each cohort member's average intake of about 150 food components as weighted sums of the food intakes. Now I'd like to relate time-to-event data on my disease of interest in this cohort to dietary behaviour. The problem is that since the components are weighted sums of the foods, some foods and some components are highly correlated. Often, the components are more significantly associated with my outcome, but I'm uncertain whether this really reflects their health impact. The foods can be expected to have been assessed with quite some error, probably inducing some regression dilution bias, which should be alleviated in the components as they are kind of an average. Is there something that can be done about this from a statistical point of view?
