The data looks like you would know in which positions the numbers are supposed to be. In this case it's probably better to explicitly convert the data at these positions instead of just converting anything that looks like a number: ls = ['batting average', '306', 'ERA', '1710'] ls[1] = int(ls[1]) ls[3] = int(ls[3])
