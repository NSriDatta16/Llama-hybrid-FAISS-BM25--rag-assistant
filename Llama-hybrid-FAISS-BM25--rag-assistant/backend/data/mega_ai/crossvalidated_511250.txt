Dominant variables and percentage of explained variance in PCA analysis

A long time i'm using PCA for exploratory data analysis and i was sure that it is Ok if the first principal components explain a high (90% and even higher) percentage of data variance . Recently i've found information that it's not good when the first few principal components explain a such high percentage of variance and it may be an analysis artefact because of dominance of the several variables. Could you clarify for me please which percent of explained variance by the first principal components (e.g. 2-3 ones) is apropriate in PCA analysis and which percent may indicate the presence of dominant variables in the data?
