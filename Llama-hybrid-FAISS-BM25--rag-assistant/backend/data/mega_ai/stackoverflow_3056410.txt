PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol "end-of-file" in simple update block

The following Oracle statement: DECLARE ID NUMBER; BEGIN UPDATE myusername.terrainMap SET playerID = :playerID,tileLayout = :tileLayout WHERE ID = :ID END; Gives me the following error: ORA-06550: line 6, column 15: PL/SQL: ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended ORA-06550: line 3, column 19: PL/SQL: SQL Statement ignored ORA-06550: line 6, column 18: PLS-00103: Encountered the symbol "end-of-file" when expecting one of the following: ( begin case declare end exception exit for goto if loop mod null pragma raise return select update while with I am pretty much at a loss. This appears to be a rather simple statement. If it helps any, I had a similar statement that performed an INSERT which used to work, but today has been giving me the same message.
