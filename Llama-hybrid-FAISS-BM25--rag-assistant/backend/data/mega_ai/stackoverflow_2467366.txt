Line breaks in "NSString"s returned from PList don't work

I've seen this post: NSString: newline escape in plist but I'd like to know if there's a way to pragmatically render \n line breaks. I'm currently using: decisionText.text = [NSString stringWithFormat: (@"%@", [replies objectAtIndex:(arc4random() % [replies count])])]; Which randomly grabs a String from the replies array. The array was loaded from a plist like so: replies = [[NSMutableArray alloc] initWithContentsOfFile:[[NSBundle mainBundle]pathForResource:@"AdviceList" ofType:@"plist"]]; What am I missing? The answer can't be to manually enter line breaks. That's not programming! (Sounds like word processing to me.)
