Decreasing importance of trees in XGBoost

On the XGBoost site, it is stated: "XGBoost mostly combines a huge number of regression trees with a small learning rate. In this situation, trees added early are significant and trees added late are unimportant" ( https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorials/dart.html ). AFAIK, the weight applied to each tree's output is the learning rate, which is identical for each tree. When they say that trees added late are unimportant, are they saying that the weights applied to the outputs of these trees are smaller? Or that they're unimportant from an interpretive perspective because they're fitted on the residuals of residuals of residuals of residuals, etc... ?
