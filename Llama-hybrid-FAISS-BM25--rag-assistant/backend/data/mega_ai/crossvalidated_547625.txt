If you don't average but take the individual values, you will have a problem with dependence, because results for the same participant will be dependent, and this is not taken into account by the test. Not good. This problem goes indeed away by averaging results for each person, but this loses a lot of detailed information (I'd still prefer it if there were no other options). It would be appropriate to set up a model with a random effect for each participant, but you'd need to learn a bit about mixed effects models (of which this would be pretty much the simplest case).
