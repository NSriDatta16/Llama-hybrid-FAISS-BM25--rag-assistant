Your best bet would be reading research papers that use those models for some task. I assume that this task will most often be classification. I know of one book about applications of BNs: Bayesian network technologies: applications and graphical models . Mittal, Ankush and Kassim, Ashraf, 2007 , IGI Concerning Markov networks, you can look for applications using Markov logic . ML is some modeling language for Markov networks, and there exist some applications, for example: Goal-based person tracking using a first-order probabilistic model T Geier, S Reuter, K Dietmayer, S Biundo - Proceedings of the Ninth UAI … Workshop, 2012 Event modeling and recognition using markov logic networks .
