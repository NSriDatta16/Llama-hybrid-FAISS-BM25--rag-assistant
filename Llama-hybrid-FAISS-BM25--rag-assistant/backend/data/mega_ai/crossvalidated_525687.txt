This Cross Validated answer suggests that (quote): "For data point x your SVM calculates decision value d in the following way:" d "If d>0 then label of x is +1, else it's âˆ’1." So I believe that the answer is thus. Given you have a trained C-SVM model object model from kernlab (your svmPoly caret method trains kernlab SVMs), and you want to predict the class of a single new datapoint x_new : x_mat If d > 0 then the prediction is one class, otherwise it is the other class. I'm pretty sure this is correct but not 100 % sure so I would appreciate any comments from those who are more knowledgable.
