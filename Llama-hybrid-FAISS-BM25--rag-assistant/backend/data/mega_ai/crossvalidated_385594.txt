You can use any of the correlation or feature importance measures. If you didn't prepare your data well, it's most likely the one of highest range anyway... For example random forests can be useful at identifying the relevant features. But even a single decision tree can be helpful already. For correlations, you better use Spearman etc., and need to experiment with the ordering of clusters, as a cluster could be between others in any order. I'd give each cluster a rank after sorting their means, and then try to correlate the element ranks with the cluster ranks.
