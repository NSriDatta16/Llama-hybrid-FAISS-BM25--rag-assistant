Flagging bad time series behavior (Pattern Recognition and Outlier Detection)

I want to get some opinions on how to approach the following problem to do with detecting "unhealthy" behavior in time series data (either using a statistical/analytical model or ML/DL, I do not have a preference). I want to be able to detect "healthy" or "unhealthy" (so this could be framed as a classification problem) based on the following definitions. Healthy: https://i.stack.imgur.com/WsGll.jpg All lines follow the same pattern moving in tandem with minimal cross/overlap with one another. Unhealthy: https://i.stack.imgur.com/xky5D.jpg In the first two images, the behavior is obviously unhealthy as some of the colored lines are straying away from the rest of the pack. However, there will be some edge-cases as seen in the third picture where some lines to cross over slightly and/or flat-line. You can see the red one in particular does not keep going down and has a bit of an uptick toward the end. The plotted curves are essentially temperature over a time period. One idea was tracking gradients of each temperature line over time and comparing it with the rest. But curious to know what else I could try?
