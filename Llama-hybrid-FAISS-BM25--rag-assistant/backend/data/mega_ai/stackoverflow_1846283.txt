Even if it was possible, one problem with the semantics of an MI-based solution to the specific problem you raised is what happens on the markup side? The Render() method that generates the markup would run first in one class, and then in the other? That's probably not the behavior you want when both classes generate entire pages. If you're open to solutions that are outside of the language itself, there are several elegant options in ASP.NET that will address the type of issue you raised (changing the actions taken during an event in the page life cycle). For example: Page Adapters Control Adapters Custom user controls HttpModules Master Pages Tag mapping The best choice will of course depend on the details of your application. In case it's helpful, I cover those options in my book, including sample code: Ultra-Fast ASP.NET .
