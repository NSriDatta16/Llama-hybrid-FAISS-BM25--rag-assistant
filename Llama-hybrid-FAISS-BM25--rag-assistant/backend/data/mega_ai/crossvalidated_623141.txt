I think neither of you is correct. You can do a PCA on any set of data, even random noise. But, for random noise, it won't give you anything. But you talk about having it "make sense" which is sort of vague, but OK. Your friend says one variable is a linear combination of the rest. You say it need not be linear. But ... there need not even be a relationship with one variable vs. the rest, and it need not be a "linear combination". Any time some of the variables are correlated, PCA can give you sensible results. And some of the variables may not be related to the others at all.
