XML loves recursion. It's a lot of work to lay out the nodes one-by-one or into some gigantic table grid -- your data format is heirarchical and your processing method should be as well. Yep. Tried it. I'm just having trouble getting my mind around the best way to do it. I could use tables. I could use css. Absolute positioning. But nothing I come up with in HTML is really working for me. XSLT is pretty good at transforming xml into html. the following xslt transforms your xml into a series of nested divs and tables. I'm using a table to get each colleague group aligned. seemed like the easiest way. To preview, save the xslt from http://pastebin.com/f6597d519 Add to the top of your employees xml, and open in a browser. In practice, you may want to transform on the server to avoid compatibility issues. To do that in C#, see How to apply an XSLT Stylesheet in C#
