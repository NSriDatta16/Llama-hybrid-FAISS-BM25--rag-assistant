When you call the anonymous function to get the value for "foo", the this variable will be referencing the window object. Same goes for the anonymous function you call for "foo2". Thus, you're trying to extend the window object. Is that really what you want to do? edit what Firefox seems to be tripping over is the attempt to copy the "sessionStorage" attribute of window . Try adding this line: var test = window['sessionStorage']; and you'll get the exact same error.
