Since you are using standardised mean differences the estimate is on that scale. So it states that the larger studies had SMD which were on average 0.2398 greater than the smaller studies. Your interpretation is more like what you would get if you had a different sort of measure on a log scale and had then converted them back to the original scale like odds ratio, risk ratio and so on. As you might expect with few studies your estimates have very wide confidence intervals. By categorising study size you are assuming that all studies with fewer than 14 participants share the same underlying value of SMD which is different from all the other studies. A less restrictive and arguably more plausible model is to fit study size as a continuous moderator variable.
