Cutoffs to consider for survival tree

In an tree based algorithm a criterion is measured at certain cutoffs for the variable. This cutoffs are the candidate split points for that variable. How does one come up with candidate split points for a variable in a survival tree? More specifically say, when you are using the log-rank test statistic between the left and right split samples as the criterion. I am currently using only those cutoffs in the variable which correspond to failures. Nothing specific is mentioned in "Regression Trees for Censored Data" by Mark Robert Segal.
