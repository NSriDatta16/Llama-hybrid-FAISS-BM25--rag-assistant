What is the name of this type of stratifed sampling?

I am not sure what this specific type is called so I will describe what I did in Excel. This was employee data: Sample size is prescribed. Example: n = 100 (though the population N = 10000) Sort entire population (N) by by two fields, for example Organization and Employee Type , and get percentages out of total by each of these stratum. Apply these percentages to get a random sample that is representative of entire population. For example if 10% of the population comes from Organiziation/Employee type stratum "Operations/ Engineer" than you should have 10 "Operations/ Engineers" in your sample of 100. By the way, I did ask a similar question in Super User but there I more specifically asked what package and function to use in R to do this.
