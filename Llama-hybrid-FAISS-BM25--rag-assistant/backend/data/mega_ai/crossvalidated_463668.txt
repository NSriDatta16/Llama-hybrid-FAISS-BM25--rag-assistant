There are many references for using QMC within MCMC. For instance, Sequential quasi-Monte Carlo: Introduction for Non-Experts, Dimension Reduction, Application to Partly Observed Diffusion Processes by Nicolas Chopin & Mathieu Gerber A Quasi-Monte Carlo MetropolisAlgorithm by Art B. Owen & Seth D. Tribble Quasi-Monte Carlo methods for Markov chains with continuous multi-dimensional state space. Math. Comput. Simul. 81(3): 560-567 (2010), by Rany El Haddad, Christian LÃ©cot, Pierre L'Ecuyer, & N. Nassif If the purpose is in using MCMC towards drawing correlated uniforms to then invert them into correct marginals with some unknown degree of correlation, I do not see the reason for doing this, as the correlations at the uniform and transformed variates level are not controlled. A copula approach would at least control the correlation for the uniforms.
