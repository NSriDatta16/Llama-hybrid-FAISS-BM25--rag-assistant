Put two "Value mapping" (Label them "Incoming" and "Default") on the map and drag the output from both to your destination (you will get a warning at compile time). Put a "Logical NOT" on the map (Label it "NoValue"). Put a logical evaluation (Existence, IsNil, Length) that suits your need, to evaluate if you have an incoming value, and drag your source field to it. (Label it "HasValue") Drag the result to the "Incoming" and the "Logical NOT". Drag your source field to the "Incoming". Drag the output from "NoValue" to "Default". Add a constant parameter to "Default", by double clicking and insert new parameter, that is your default value. Hope you understand this mess :)
