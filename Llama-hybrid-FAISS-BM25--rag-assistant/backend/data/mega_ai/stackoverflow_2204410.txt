Make idea-generating agents. The other agents rate the ideas, and either try and steal the ideas that they like, or kill the people with good ideas. Embed some moral code into them so that some types of agents won't be compelled to steal but will try and invent new ideas if one of theirs conflicts with another. At the end, you can see what types of agents succeed, what kind of ideas are generated, and what is better for society (i.e. agents with high moral code or agents who steal ideas and implement fast). It will be a hilarious way to possibly model life and the most effective combination of moral/immoral agents to create a productive and efficient society.
