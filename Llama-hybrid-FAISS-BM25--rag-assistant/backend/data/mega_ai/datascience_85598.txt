Artificial Intelligence It's a general idea to attain human-level intelligence using machines. This is more of a pursuit of human-kind i.e. an ongoing journey. It goes back to 1950 when Alan Turing devised the Idea of the Turing test. Machine Learning This is an approach where the program(model) is automatically built using the data. This approach is unlike the traditional programming approach. $\hspace{2cm}$ Deep Learning A recent state of the art approach using a deep neural network enabled us to analyze very large and complex data e.g. Images/Text . On Venn Diagram - AI > ML > DL but Neural Network should be used interchangeably with Deep Learning Data Science Data Science will not fall into the above Categorization. The above categorization is more on the evolution of AI but to describe Data Science, we should look into the flow of data from Capturing to Reporting. Modeling is just one step in the process. Data science is an interdisciplinary field focused on extracting knowledge from data sets, which are typically large (see big data).[6] The field encompasses analysis, preparing data for analysis, and presenting findings to inform high-level decisions in an organization. As such, it incorporates skills from computer science, mathematics, statistics, information visualization, graphic design, complex systems, communication, and business Wikipedia
