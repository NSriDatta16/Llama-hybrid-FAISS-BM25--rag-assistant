Hiding a Regression Model from Professor (Regression Battleship)

I'm working on a homework assignment where my professor would like us to create a true regression model, simulate a sample of data and he's going to attempt to find our true regression model using some of the techniques we have learned in class. We likewise will have to do the same with a dataset he's given us. He says that he's been able to produce a pretty accurate model for all past attempts to try and trick him. There have been some students that create some insane model but he arguably was able to produce a simpler model that was just sufficient. How can I go about developing a tricky model for him to find? I don't want to be super cheap by doing 4 quadratic terms, 3 observations, and massive variance? How can I produce a seemingly innocuous dataset that has a tough little model underneath it? He simply has 3 Rules to follow: Your dataset must have one "Y" variable and 20 "X" variables labeled as "Y", "X1", ..., "X20". Your response variable $Y$ must come from a linear regression model that satisfies: $$ Y_i^\prime = \beta_0 + \beta_1 X_{i1}^\prime + \ldots + \beta_{p-1}X_{i,p-1}^\prime + \epsilon_i $$ where $\epsilon_i \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ and $p \leq 21$. All $X$-variables that were used to create $Y$ are contained in your dataset. It should be noted, not all 20 X variables need to be in your real model I was thinking of using something like the Fama-French 3 Factor Model and having him start with the stock data (SPX and AAPL) and have to transform those variables to the continuously compounded returns in order to obsfucate it a little more. But that leaves me with missing values in the first observation and it's time series (which we haven't discussed in class yet). Unsure if this is the proper place to post something like this. I felt like it could generate some good discussion. Edit: I'm also not asking for "pre-built" models in particular. I'm more curious about topics/tools in Statistics that would enable somebody to go about this.
