Gaussian Processes and Identification/Identifiability Issues

I'm looking for references of Gaussian Processes and identification issues that may occur. For example, in Kennedy and O'Hagan's (2001) Bayesian Calibration of Computer Models , we have $$y_i=\eta(x_i,\theta)+\delta(x_i)+e_i$$ where $\delta$ has a gaussian process prior, and $y_i, x_i$ are observable data. Then, on the discussion of this paper, several researchers point to the potential lack of identifiability when we try to estimate $\eta$ and the process governing $\delta$ , even when have $e_i=0$ (which we don't). The response/answer of the original authors to this is to rewrite the previous equation as $$y_i=\eta(x_i,\theta)+\epsilon(x_i)$$ and simply say that these components are intrinsically well-defined as in any regression problem... Why is that?Also, this doesn't seem to truly answer the criticism... Someone told me that the same identification issue would happen if, instead of considering a Gaussian Process, we were considering a random effect. Is this true? any references?
