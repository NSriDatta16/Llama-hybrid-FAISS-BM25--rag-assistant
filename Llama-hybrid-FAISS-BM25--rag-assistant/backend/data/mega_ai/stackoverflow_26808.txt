A little preparation helps: All my code is kept organized in one single directory (with categorized sub-directories). All email is kept in various PSTs. All code is also checked into source control at the end of every day. All documents are kept in one place as well. Backup: Backup your code, email, documents as often as it suits you (daily). Keep an image of your development environment always ready. Failure and Recovery If everything fails, format and install the image. Copy back everything from backup and you are up and running. Of course there are tweaks here and there (incremental backup, archiving, etc.) which you have to do to make this process real.
