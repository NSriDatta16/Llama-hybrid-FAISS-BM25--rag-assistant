1) It does require RTTI. At least if you are using it on polymorphic classes...which is really its purpose. 2) If you don't have RTTI on the dynamic_cast can't check to see if the object you are casting is actually an object type you are casting to. This is the difference between dynamic_cast (essentially) and static_cast. Static_cast does not check this, and thus is less 'safe' but faster. Thus if you have no RTTI, it CAN'T do a dynamic cast when you're downcasting Upcasting is safe because you can determine types at compile time, and thus you can upcast with dynamic_cast to the base class. 3) dynamic_cast downcasting is for polymorhpic types (eg types with a virtual function in them), and thus if the class isn't polymorphic its not going to work. So if CBase doesn't have a virtual function you can't use dynamic_cast with it. Same reason as 2 for the upcasting. I think you should read a bit on what the different casts are for. http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/typecasting/ 4) Yes it will compile it as inline.
