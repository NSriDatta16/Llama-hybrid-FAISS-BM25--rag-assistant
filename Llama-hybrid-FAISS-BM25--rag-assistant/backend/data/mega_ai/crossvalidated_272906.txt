Pretraining / fine-tuning works as follows: You have machine learning model $m$. Pre-training : You have a dataset $A$ on which you train $m$. You have a dataset $B$. Before you start training the model, you initialize some of the parameters of $m$ with the model which is trained on $A$. Fine-tuning : You train $m$ on $B$. This is one form of transfer learning. So you can transfer some of the knowledge obtained from dataset $A$ to dataset $B$. See my Machine Learning Glossary for this and more terms explained in very few words.
