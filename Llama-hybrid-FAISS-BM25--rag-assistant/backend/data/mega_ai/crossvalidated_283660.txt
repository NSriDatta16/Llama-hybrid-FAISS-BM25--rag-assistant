As has been stated, more detail on your study would be helpful. With that being said, commodity prices (in general) tend to show more stationarity on the whole than other assets such as stocks or currencies, i.e. with commodity prices, there tends to be less of a trend and more of a zigzag pattern. In this regard, you should test your data for stationarity using a stationarity test such as Dickey-Fuller or Phillips-Perron. Then, a commonly used tool to implement time series forecasting of such models would be ARCH models (Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity). These could be run in R using libraries such as rugarch or fGarch. You might find the following paper helpful - EGarch models in particular (exponential GARCH) was found to be superior to ARIMA and GARCH models in forecasting international cotton prices given the ability of such a model to capture asymmetric volatility patterns. Again, all depends on your data, but the above might be helpful as a starting point.
