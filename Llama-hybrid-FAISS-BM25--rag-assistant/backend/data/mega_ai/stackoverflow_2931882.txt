Ok, I found a solution for my problem. I changed the file that creates the 'image' field type. The file is located at /lib/Varien/Data/Form/Element/Image.php. When you look at the code you see the last function is to get the key 'name' from the given data array: public function getName() { return $this->getData('name'); } So I thougth what if i make another function to get a 'path' index: public function getPath() { return $this->getData('path'); } Next, when you go the function _getUrl(), which get's the preview URL for the uploaded image, you need to change it the following (only add the function getPath() before '$this->getValue()'): protected function _getUrl() { return $this->getPath().$this->getValue(); } I don't think this is the most elegant way to fix this, but it satisfies my needs for this project. I hope my solution is working for other people if they face this problem too...
