jstree once loaded removes other ui (jqueryui.js) settings on page

i have an issue with jsTree and the issue is as follows: I have draggable divs with resizable ability on my page basically you can sort them and resize them Then i added a jsTree to the form which retrieves values using ajax and populates the tree using xml_data plugin The issue is once the tree is loaded then the divs are not resizeable anymore and cannot be dragged around. When looking at the html rendered markup after everything has been loaded i can see that className no longer has "ui-resizable" has anyone come across this bizarre problem? thanks in advance for kindly assisting me. Best Muzi Simple Tree Code $("#jsTreeDiv").bind("loaded.jstree", function (event, data) { alert("TREE IS LOADED"); var arrTmp = [90, 91]; //loop thru all item in tree if edit if (arrTmp.length > 0) { $("#jsTreeDiv li").each(function (i) { var $curItem = $(this); if ($curItem.length > 0) { for (var i = 0; i Simple Div markup [ Data Col Name 2 ] [ Data Col Name 2 ] Code when DOM is ready $(".Cols-01 li").each(function (i) { var $Div = $(this).find("div.ColContainer-01"); $Div.resizable(); //make each div resizable }); $(".Cols-01").sortable(); //make ul list sortable //then load tree
