iPad Simulator not receiving touch events outside of iPhone's 320x480 frame

-(void)touchesBegan:(NSSet *)touches withEvent:(UIEvent *)event{ UITouch *touch = [touches anyObject]; gestureStartPoint = [touch locationInView:self.view]; NSLog(@"test x:%f",gestureStartPoint.x); NSLog(@"test y:%f",gestureStartPoint.y); etc.. Srangely, I'm not receiving any log statements if I click outside a 320x480 frame (starting from upper-left corner). Elsewhere in touchesBegan I call other methods passing in the touch and these weren't responding, so put these NSLogs in. What do I have to do to receive touch events from the full 1024x768 view?
