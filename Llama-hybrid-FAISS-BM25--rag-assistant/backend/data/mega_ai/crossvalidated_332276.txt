How do Frequentist vs. Bayesian views of probability lead to their different treatments of data/hypotheses?

I have read that a key difference between Bayesians and Frequentists is their treatment of probability. Frequentists treat probability as the frequency with which something will happen over the long run. Bayesians treat probability as a measure of their confidence in the outcome of a single event. I've also read that Frequentists consider models to be fixed, and data to vary; while Bayesians consider models to vary and data to be fixed. How exactly do the different treatments of probability lead to these different views of data/models? And then, the crux of my question is, why do these different views allow Bayesians to talk about the probability of a hypothesis being true given some data, while Frequentists are restricted to talking about the probability of data being true given some hypothesis?
