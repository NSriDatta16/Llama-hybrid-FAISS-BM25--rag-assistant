Is it possible to tell if one activation function is better than the other one based on their graphs?

I am attempting to formulate my own activation function. However, I'm new to neural networks, am not yet ready to test it, but would want to know if I already landed on a better activation function than my benchmark before pushing through for a successful study. These are their graphs. Mine is in green and the benchmark is in purple. Is it possible to tell which one is better based on these graphs? Thanks!
