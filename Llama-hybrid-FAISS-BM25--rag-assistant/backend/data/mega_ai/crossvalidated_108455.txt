How to : a brief intro to scaling and rescaling data ( inputs) for supervised learning algorithms

I understand the concept of scaling and that it improves results in SVM's and NN's. however I would like to find somewhere where is is explained, in easy "layman's terms" terms. of how it is done. I would rather it not be Wikipedia as I am using it for my masters thesis. Thanks in advance!
