Is a chi-square test for independence appropriate on a contingency table where one category is the unsupervised learning cluster?

I have a data set that has been partitioned into four clusters by executing a clustering algorithm that used principal components from a principal component analysis (PCA). I then make a contingency table where the two categories are the cluster it belongs to and a feature from the original data set that was not used in the PCA. The feature is called "letter" and has possible values of a, b, and c. Is it appropriate to perform a chi-square test for independence on this contingency table? My reservation is that the clusters are based on the sample and are not fixed for each data point. I have other "big picture" reservations as well. I'm rather new to data analysis, and I'm wondering if I'm taking an unsupervised learning technique too far, when I should be performing a supervised learning technique where I use my principal components to predict the "letter".
