It might be that you're pulling a lot of libraries with your app. Most of them get initialized before execution is handed over to your main(). Check for any non-standard libraries you're linking against. EDIT: A very straightforward solution would be to create a new project and just link the libraries you're using one by one, checking memory usage each time. Even though it's an ugly approach, you should find the culprit this way. There's probably a more elegant solution out there, so you might want to spare some time googling for (free) memory profiling solutions.
