Logistic Regression with categorical variables correlation

I am running a logistic regression with multiple variables. When I add variables to my model the odds ratio estimates decrease. When looking at colinearlity there are some variables that have .3 or .2. All independent variables are binary so this seems like it is bound to happen. Since some odds ratios on their own are for example 2.8 but then when put into the model with other variables they shrink to 1.1 should the odds ratio in the model be used or should I simply pull up cross tabs and do the odds ratio for the independent variables all separately? My other question is that when adding more variables the odds ratio decreaes a bit but the model c statistic increases which seems to be very important.
