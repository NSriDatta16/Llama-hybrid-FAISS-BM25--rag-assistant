What's causing this weird Windows Phone Emulator crash?

I am trying to debug my Windows Phone 7 app, and I am getting the following error upon launching the app in the emulator (via VS2010 debug): Unable to start program '\Windows\tashost.exe\' The drive cannot locate a specific area or track. Any ideas as what may be causing this? The most recent change I made was adding functionality to save game data, via the IsolatedStorageFile . However, it was working for a while with this functionality in there.
