This is a well-known problem of quantile regression. Your best bet is to forecast full predictive densities, then extract the quantiles of interest from the predictive density at each future time point. Unfortunately, standard forecasting methods like ARIMA or ETS do not model heteroskedasticity. Depending on your application, you may want to look at (G)ARCH, or perhaps at methods that account for heteroskedasticity and can be made to work for time series, like negative binomial regression.
