Changing stylesheet for a partial

I have a Movie class in my Rails app, and I have a "_movie.html.erb" partial that displays the movie's title, its overall rating, and a brief summary. I want a stylesheet to apply to this particular partial, but nothing else in my app. How do I do this? In case it helps, I don't want to do some type of CSS classing on the partial instead, because the stylesheet is a huge, gargantuan mess that's not created by me and that may be updated in the future. (For example, let's say that the partial is trying to mimic the way RottenTomatoes displays a movie.)
