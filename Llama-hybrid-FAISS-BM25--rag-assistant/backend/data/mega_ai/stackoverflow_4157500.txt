Drupal - Organic Groups Invite - automate process

Currently when one invites anynomous users to join an Organic Group on a Drupal site, the email that gets send out, only contains a link to the Organic Group. But then because the user is anonymous he will not be able to access the group unless he first registers. So what happens presently is the user gets an emaila to join a group, clicks on the link, but then gets the access denied page. Is there a way to automate the process, so that the user gets directed to the registration page, and after registering gets redirrected to the group that he was invited too. Either to then automtically become a member, as he was already invited or to then manually join. thanks Charles
