Is it possible to simulate intersecting 'droppables' in jQuery UI?

Say I have a draggable with width 2x that needs to be dropped on an area with width 3x, either at the leftmost or rightmost end (leaving a gap of x on the other side). So for instance I have a draggable div that is being dropped on a tr with three child tds, and can either be dropped simultaneously on the 1st and 2nd td, or 2nd and 3rd td. Can anybody think of a way to achieve this effect with some sort of trickery on top on jQuery UI or will I need to work at a lower level? User feedback is important here - hovering over the 1st and 2nd tds should be conveyed to the user in some way that appears different to hovering over the 2nd and 3rd tds.
