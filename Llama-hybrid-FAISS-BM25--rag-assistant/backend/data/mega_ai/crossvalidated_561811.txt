Can we calculate the standard deviation of a large number of average data?

I am calculating the Value at Risk (VaR Formula=Deposits Initial balance * Volatility of deposits (standard deviation of returns of the deposits) * Critical Value of a probability distribution * Square root of time) of a data on the deposits in a bank and the volatilities through the standard deviation are the following: Daily volatility (average) 2016: 7% (Annualized 108 %) Daily volatility (average) 2017: 73 % (Annualized 1163 %) Daily volatility (average) 2018: 5% (Annualized 81 %) Daily volatility (average) 2019: 10 % (Annualized 163 %) Daily volatility (average) 2020: 9% (Annualized 142 %) Daily volatility (average) 2021: 13 % (Annualized 210 %) To reduce the VaR, we calculate the standard deviation of the logarithm of deposit returns. I was wondering if that could be done? It did reduce my VAR but I'm not very sure, if you can average the logarithm of the returns of the deposits.
