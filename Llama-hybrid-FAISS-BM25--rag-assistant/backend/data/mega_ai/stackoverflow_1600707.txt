A simple way of doing extrapolations is to use interpolating polynomials or splines: there are many routines for this in scipy.interpolate , and there are quite easy to use (just give the (x, y) points, and you get a function [a callable, precisely]). Now, as as been pointed in this thread, you cannot expect the extrapolation to be always meaningful (especially when you are far from your data points) if you don't have a model for your data. However, I encourage you to play with the polynomial or spline interpolations from scipy.interpolate to see whether the results you obtain suit you.
