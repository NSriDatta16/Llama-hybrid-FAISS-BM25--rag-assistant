send/recv ethernet frame on windows using C++

is there any windows library / kernel-mode driver (with usermode API) in C/C++ which I can use to send/recv ethernet frame without IP (only use mac address). I heard about winpcap, is there any lighter library or wrapper to winpcap which has simple open(), close(), send(), recv() function?
