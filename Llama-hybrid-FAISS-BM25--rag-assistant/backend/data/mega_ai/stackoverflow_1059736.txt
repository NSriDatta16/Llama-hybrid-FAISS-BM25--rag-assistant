Format - I would say .PNG from experience, though .ICO may suit your needs depending on the source and size of your original graphic. Storage - They would be resources in the project, most likely created under a folder structure. They can then be accessed through the XAML. Referencing - It depends on the architecture of your application. In the most basic solution you would have a style that would set the image source property of your toolbar (implementation depends on your control). Each toolbar would implement a style resource. Hope that helps!
