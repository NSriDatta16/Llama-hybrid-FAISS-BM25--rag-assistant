We could compute the team performances based on an ELO ranking system. If you are considering non-complete competitions (each team has not seen exactly all of the other teams) then such a scheme would be more fair. One such ELO ranking derived system could be fitting a logistic regression model to the points scored. Aside from its use to fairly decide on a winner in a non-complete competition, one can also use such a system to come up with a better ratio for the points of a win:draw which is currently 3 in soccer. We can add this ratio as a parameter in the fit and find out which ratio maximizes the likelihood. That ratio would be a balance that makes the score of a match more 'predictable' and more inline with the difference in the two team abilities.
