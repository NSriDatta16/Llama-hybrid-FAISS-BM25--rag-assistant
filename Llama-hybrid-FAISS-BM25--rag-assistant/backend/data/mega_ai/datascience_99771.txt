Since you mentioned after one hot encoding, you get 90 features, I would advise against dropping the less occurring values. 90 features is considered less for a ml algo. If for example your dimensionality increases upto 400-500 features or more, only then consider dropping less frequent values. Also first consider feature engineering to reduce the no of features in your data. This is the most effective and non invasive way to reduce dimensionality. After that consider feature selection and/or PCA. Only then consider dropping the less frequent values as dropping them will result in loss of valuable info.
