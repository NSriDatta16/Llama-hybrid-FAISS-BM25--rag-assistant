Logistic regression: Sample size for emmeans comparisons

I conducted a logistic regression with a 3-levels categorical predictor in SPSS using the GENLIN procedure. As I am interested in the pairwise comparisons between all three predictor levels, I used the /EMMEANS subcommand, SCALE=transformed, and obtained log OR which I could then transform into OR. However, I am wondering how to to a proper a-priori sample size planning/power analysis. Let's say the minimum effect size between two levels that I am interested in is OR = 2.5 - how can I derive the required sample size in the next step? Any input is highly appreciated.
