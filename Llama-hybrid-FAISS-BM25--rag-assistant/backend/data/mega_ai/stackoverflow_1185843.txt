My general trick for ensuring things compile 64-bit (or 32-bit, mutatis mutandis) is: CC="gcc -m64" ...other environment... ./configure ...configure arguments... This treats the C compiler (add CXX="g++ -m64" if you need C++ too) as a 64-bit compiler by virtue of the ' -m64 ' argument. It may or may not be elegant - it is what I use on both Solaris and MacOS X. There can also be package-specific options to the ./configure script that control this (occasionally override this); use ' ./configure --help ' to see whether this is so. The problem looks to be that the libtool was set up as a 32-bit system. Before changing to the 64-bit build, make sure you've run ' make distclean ' to get rid of all the debris - or remove the build directory altogether and re-extract the material from the tar-ball. Run the configure process as shown - the chances are decent that will be sufficient.
