Regular Expression to find the start end of a list in HTML

I have a TextBox in a webpage that i'm using javascript to parse and modify to format for HTML. 90% of it works really well, the last main thing i'm trying to be able to support is copying and pasting from a word document. I got it mostly completely, i just am kinda stuck on finding list and wrapping them in a UL tag.. So, using regular expressions, i'd like to find the list in this text: paragraph goes here goes here list item 2 list item 3 another paragraph and wrap the section with a tag. my regexp foo isn't that good, can someone help? ----- update ----- While I appreciate all the feedback basically indicating that I need to start from scratch with this issue, I do not have the time to do that. I completely understand that regex is not the ideal way to handle HTML formatting, but how I am using it now, it will handle most of what my users are looking to do. I only need a subset of HTML tags, not a full HTML editor. The source of my content will be a user copying and pasting from a word document (about 99.9% ) of the time. i use regex to insert HTML tags into plain text. for the lists, i find the bullet character MS word inserts into it's copied text and replace that with the tag. I just want to make it more user friendly to wrap the tags with a tag. I'll look into being able to end my tags properly, so.. assuming they're properly ended, what would be the regex to wrap my list items with a tag? thanks!
