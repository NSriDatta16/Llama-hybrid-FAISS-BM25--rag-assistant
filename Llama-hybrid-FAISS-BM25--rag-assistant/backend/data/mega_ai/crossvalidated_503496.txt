How to code non-exclusive variables for logistic regresion

I have a question about logistic regression in R. I want to study the influence of certain comorbidities in patients in predicting deceased status(Y/N). So far, I formatted all my comorbidities(17) into dummy variables having 'none' as the reference variable. When I see logistic regression tutorials, it all seem to code categorical variables as exclusive, while mine are not, meaning one person might have up to 10 different comorbidities. Taking the idea from a few posts I have seen, I would have a category named comorbidities, and then repeat each subject ID for each comorbidity present and then let R code the dummies. Would logistic regression be the correct way to approach this situation? Would I have to group the comorbidities in a way that a subject can only have one and only one comorbidity and none for the others?
