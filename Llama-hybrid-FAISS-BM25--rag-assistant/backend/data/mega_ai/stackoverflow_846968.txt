Mixing Swing and SWT isn't the best thing to do, but if you have no options, it's not a terribly difficult beast to slay. Just try to enforce some rules/standards throughout your code. eg. keep all dialogs in Swing (don't use a mix of both if there is no reason to), use naming conventions to differentiate between Swing and SWT components, etc.. Make sure you're well aware of the way that Swing and SWT components are handled by the OS/JVM before you start tackling any complex UI issues. One thing to watch out for is drag and drop between Swing and SWT components. It's a bit tricky, but particularly so if you start throwing in custom data types.
