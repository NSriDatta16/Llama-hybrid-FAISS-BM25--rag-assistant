I've done this in the past using the send-a-patch method. However, it becomes difficult to reconcile the changes later. I now use Git, and it definitely helps with this situation, it's a very natural thing to do. I can have a cow-orker pull specific commits from my repository and help work on them. We can each make commits, then I can pull the commits from their repository, use git rebase -i to organise everything, and proceed from there.
