Using CacheListener with GAE

I store instances of Domain objects in GAE's memcache using the javax.cache API. I'd like to be notified as soon any instance is evicted due to storage limitations or anything else. Is a CacheListener the solution for that? Is GAE calling CacheListener.evict(Object o) when it's removing instance?
