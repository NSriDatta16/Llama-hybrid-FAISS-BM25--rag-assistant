rsExecutionNotFound error in SQL Server Reporting Services

I have a SQL Server Reporting Services 2005 installation that has worked great for a few years now, but has been giving me occasional glitches recently. I'm using the default reporting services website instead of embedding reports into my application, which has proven a very efficient way to deploy the reports. The OS is Windows Server 2003 and the reports are being viewed on IE8 running XP. It's not a big deal. Refreshing the browser brings the report right up each time. I guess it might be a cacheing issue. It does scare users, so it would be nice to squash this bug. Any ideas? Server Error in '/Reports' Application. Execution 'j0cnbcqzv5lxg1imzqouqxya' cannot be found (rsExecutionNotFound) Description: An unhandled exception occurred during the execution of the current web request. Please review the stack trace for more information about the error and where it originated in the code.
