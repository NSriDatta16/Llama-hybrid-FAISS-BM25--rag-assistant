Short Answer While it could be possible to do something like this, in many cases you are probably better off forecasting time series using a more manual approach. Long Answer The approach you describe is similar to what is seen in the machine learning community where a tremendous amount of focus is put on model selection and parameter estimation. For example, there are countless papers on how to optimize a neural net to attain strong results on the ImageNet dataset. Part of the reason there is such an emphasis on this, is that in the research process it is important to compare your model to other models on benchmark datasets. To make sure your results are comparable to others' reported results you cannot manually bring in outside information to improve your model's performance. While this automatic-forecasting approach is not wrong per se, in the time series setting often the most important step in an analysis is bringing in exogenous variables to help explain a time series. For example, if one is attempting to forecast a time series of average house prices in New York, what would matter most in forecasting is determining what factors influence house prices (e.g. population growth, interest rates, unemployment) and then coming up with a reasonable forecast of these variables to inform your forecast of house prices. The time dependence of the residuals (which is what most traditional statistical methods attempt to model), while still important to consider in the model, would be likely be far less important in improving a forecast than the selection and forecasting of the aforementioned exogenous variables.
