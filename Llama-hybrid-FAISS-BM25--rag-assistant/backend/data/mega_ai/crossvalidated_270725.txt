Since you have ~800 categories as the classification variable, in my understanding, the accuracy of the classification can be increased by better models than ridge regression model alone. Neural networks with multi layers can be more adept and also you can build an ensemble of models to arrive at the final classification. The text data can also be used to group together based on association metrics to arrive at a class variable based on association of text. Another variable can be the clustered variable containing products which can be clustered together. These two pieces of information can help the final model delineate the products much better before assigning them to a particular category. Hope it helps and all the best :)
