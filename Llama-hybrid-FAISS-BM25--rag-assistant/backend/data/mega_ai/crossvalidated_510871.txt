Metropolis Hastings for Poisson Distribution

Studying Bayesian Inference and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, I am facing a self study question on a MCMC approach to a Poisson distribution with parameter $\lambda$ . Using R, my code is: ### Parameters # observation x First step is to find the posterior distribution for Poisson with parameter $\lambda$ through a prior distribution and likelihood distribution. After some calculations, I got to find my posterior distribution as a Gamma with parameters alpha $(x+a)$ and beta $(b/(b+1))$ . ap Then, the last step is to perform a MCMC simulation. I am doing 5000 iterations with initial value 20. inter = 5000 MCMC I am not sure if my approach is correct: I am trying to simulate a proposal for the acceptance through a binomial distribution. Then, I do the ratio between the first value of my MCMC and the proposal.
