Alternative to logistic regression

With this synthetic data set (the relationship between survival/death and the factor x) (plotted in the below figure as blue points), I would like to know how the survival probability depends on the factor x. I don't think logistic regression is the right tool for this data set because I think it can only give a monotonic function as its estimation while for this synthetic data set, I expect a different relationship (the red line in the below figure is my expectation). I wonder what is the best statistical tool here? generalized additive model?
