Regression problem with several samples per response (dependent variable)

I have an image dataset in which there is a response $Y$ (dependent variable) for each image. There are about 1000 images, and accordingly 1000 response variable Y per image. My question is how should I define the independent variables since each image contains several pixels but there is only one response value per image. Should I take the average of the color band values (red, green, blue) of all the pixels in one image and consider that the independent variable for that image? This will produce three independent variables and one dependent variable per image. However, if I just take an average over all pixels, I may lose or leave out some information, such as the variance. Is there a machine learning algorithm better than simply taking the average for this type of problem?
