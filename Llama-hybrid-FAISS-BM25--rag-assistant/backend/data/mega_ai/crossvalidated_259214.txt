Logistic regression is a special case of a Generalized Linear Model (GLM). In this particular case of binary data, the logistic function is the canonical link function that transforms the non-linear regression problem at hand into a linear problem. GLMs are somewhat special, in the sense that they apply only to distributions in the exponential family (such as the Binomial distribution). In Bayesian estimation, the Beta distribution is the conjugate prior to the binomial distribution, which means that a Bayesian update to a Beta prior, with binomial observations, will result in a Beta posterior. So if you have counts for observations of binary data, you can get an analytical Bayesian estimate of the parameters of the binomial distribution by using a Beta prior. So, along the lines of what has been said by other, I don't think there is a direct relation, but both the Beta distribution and logistic regression have close relationships with estimating the parameters of something that follows a binomial distribution.
