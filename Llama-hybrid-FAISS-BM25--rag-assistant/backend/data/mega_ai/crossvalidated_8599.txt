An ARIMA model is simply a weighted average. It answers the double question; How many period (k )should I use to compute a weighted average and Precisely what are the k weights It answers the maiden's prayer to determine how to adjust to previous values ( and previous values ALONE ) in order to project the series ( which is really being caused by unspecified causal variables ) Thus an ARIMA model is a poor man's causal model .
