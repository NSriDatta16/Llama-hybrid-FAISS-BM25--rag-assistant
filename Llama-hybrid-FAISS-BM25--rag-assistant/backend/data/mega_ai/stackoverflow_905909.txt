[NT Batch]How to get directory from user inputted file?

I need to know how to extract directory information from user inputted file, consider this code as example: ECHO Drag and drop your .txt file here, after that press Enter: SET txtfile= SET /P txtfile= ECHO. CD %txtfile% ofcourse that didn't work since i didn't extract filepath from %txtfile% and here the sample output i want: C:\> Drag and drop your .txt file here, after that press Enter: C:\somefolder\somesubfolder\somefile.txt C:\> Press Enter to continue... C:\somefolder\somesubfolder\> notice it have change it working directory
