How to estimate the correlated individual components from a sum, for a random process?

Assume that there are $N$ realisations of five individual, random variables$X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, $X_4$ and $X_5$, which in general could be correlated . We define another random variable $S=X_1+X_2+X_3+X_4+X_5$. Now, for a given $S$ generated from the same process, the individual components of which are unknown, how will we find the best (MMSE) estimates of $X_1$, $X_2$, $X_3$, $X_4$ and $X_5$? PS: I had posted a related question, where the individual components happen to be independent, here . A Bayesian approach was suggested for that problem.
