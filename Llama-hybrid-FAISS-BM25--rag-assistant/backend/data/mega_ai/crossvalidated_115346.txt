First, let's try to simulate some data with a similar structure of your problem's data. My understanding from your description is that we have something like this: Say we have 4 schools with 8 subjects in each school, thus a total of 32 subjects. Each subject is posed with 3 tasks (one from each group), thus a total of 96 observations. As we have 6 different tasks, we will ask 16 times each task (6*16=96), so 32 tasks from each group (32*3=96). n.schools Now let's try a GLMM model as the one you propose: library(lme4) > glmer(success ~ age + gender + group/task + (1 + group/task | school/subject), family=binomial) Error: number of observations (=60) So what does this mean? In general, you need your mixed effects model to be identifiable, and one of the conditions for this to happen is $\sum_{i=1}^N (n_i-k) >0$, where $k$ is the number of random effects. In the case of balanced data, this can be written equivalently $N n_1 > N k$ or $n_1 > k$. In other words you need to have less random parameters than the number of observations in each cluster/group, subject in your case. This cannot be the case if you add the group/task term in the random part. What group/task or school/subject means in the formula? This is simply an equivalent way of writing group + group:task so you actually have group and its interaction with task . So the last question doesn't actually makes sense. The same principle is used when you put this term as a grouping factor in the right part of (1 | ...) which actually translates to (1| school) + (1 | school:subject) hence the one factor nested within the other. So, I suggest you read Chapter 2 from Bates book and pay extra attention to model specification . It is really important to define what actually makes sense to include as fixed or random effects and what the grouping factors will be. This depends on how you designed the study and what you want to extract from your models.
