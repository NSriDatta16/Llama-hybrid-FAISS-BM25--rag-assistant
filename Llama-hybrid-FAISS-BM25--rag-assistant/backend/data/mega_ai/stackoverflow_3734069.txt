This is not as simple as it seems! There is a mis-match between your C++ program (which presumibly is long running otherwise why would it need controlling) and a typical web program which starts up when it receives the http request and dies once the reply is sent. You could possibly use one of the Java based web servers where it is possible to have a long running task. Alternatively you could use a database or other storage as the communication medium:- You program periodically writes it current status to a well know table, when a user invokes the control application it reads the current status and gives an appropriate set of options to the user which can then be stored in the DB, and actioned by your program the next time it polls for a request. This works better if you have a queuing mechanism avaiable, as it can then be event driven rather than polled.
