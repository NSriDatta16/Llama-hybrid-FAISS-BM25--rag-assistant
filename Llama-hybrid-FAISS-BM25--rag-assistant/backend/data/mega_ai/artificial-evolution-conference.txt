The Artificial Evolution | Evolution Artificielle (EA) Conference is a peer-reviewed research conference on evolutionary computation and related areas of natural computing held every two years (until recently in odd-numbered years). It originated in France and every EA conference has been held there until recently (see history below). Proceedings of EA are published by Springer-Verlag in their LNCS series. Origin Artificial Evolution was originally initiated as a forum for the French-speaking evolutionary computation community, and the first conference, organized by fr:Jean-Marc Alliot, Evelyne Lutton, Edmund Ronald and Marc Schoenauer, was held in Toulouse in 1994 under the name Evolution Artificielle. It was, until recently, the only EA conference held in an even year, and the only one with proceedings not published by Springer (they were published by Cepadues). History In 1995 The Artificial Evolution Association (L'association Ã‰volution Artificielle) was formed to encourage exchanges and meetings in artificial evolution and evolutionary computation. After the initial meeting in 1994 (see origin above) it has been involved in the organisation of the Artificial Evolution conferences from 1995 to the present day. In addition to the Artificial Evolution conferences it has organised other activities (see Artificial Evolution Association below). The Artificial Evolution conference became an international conference in 1995 in Brest, under the name Artificial Evolution. Due to its strong relevance for the French-speaking research community it is still also described as Evolution Artificielle (French for Artificial Evolution) and uses the EA abbreviation on conference websites and in the titles of proceedings volumes. The table below shows where Artificial Evolution conferences have been held and cites their proceedings and websites. It should not be surprising that conference websites are not usually maintained for the length of time that conference proceedings are available. The table shows the number of the conference proceedings in the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) series (with the exception of the first conference, see origin above, where the conference proceedings were published elsewhere). The reference to each conference proceedings gives the full title of that volume in the Springer LNCS series. The ISBN of each title is to the paperback volume, an eBook is also available by purchase or subscription. Format Artificial Evolution conferences are single-track conferences taking place over three days (as the program of AE 2024 in Bordeaux in diagram form shows), to enable substantial engagement between participants. Although all Artificial Evolution conferences have been organised from France, and from 1995 by the Artificial Evolution Association, itself based in France, all presentations are in English, the lingua franca of the modern computer science research community. Papers submitted to the conference are peer-reviewed, and the resulting papers are available in the conference proceedings available at the conference. A selection of the best papers from each conference are edited into a volume of the Springer Lecture Notes in Computer Science, available after the conference. While it may seen misleading to list the Springer LNCS volumes under Proceedings in the table of Artificial Evolution conferences above, Springer publications are more accessible and more durable following the conference, and they form part of a series (Lecture Notes in Computer Science) with high credibility in the academic and professional computer science community. Plenary speakers Plenary speakers are invited to each Artificial Evolution conference. The table below shows plenary speakers where indicated in the online program. Although most Artificial Evolution conferences are held in France and thus some plenary speakers reflect the importance of computer science research in that country (Belson, Fekete, del Moral), other plena
