You randomly draw a card, and after replacing it, you draw another. Let A be the event that the card is a club; let B be the event that the card is red. What is Pr(A|B)? That is, what is the probability the second card is a club, given the first one was a red card? Are the two events independent? Let's interpret this paragraph for you. I believe the problem you are having is one of English. Specifically, the word given is not quite what you think it is. You ought to interpret the word given to only mean that if I tell you that A has happened, now what are the chances that B will happen. You have a deck of 52 cards You pull one out, it is a red card, you put it back in. (the text specifically says, "and after replacing it") You pull out a new card (from the same 52 card deck) What are the odds this new card is a club? In some cases, the first activity might limit the sample size for the second event. In this particular case, it does not.
