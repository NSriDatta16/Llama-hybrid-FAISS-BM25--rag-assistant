Stop UIWebView from "bouncing" vertically?

Does anyone know how to stop a UIWebView from bouncing vertically? I mean when a user touches their iphone screen, drags their finger downwards, and the webview shows a blank spot above the web page I had loaded? I've looked at the following possible solutions, but none of them worked for me: http://www.iphonedevsdk.com/forum/iphone-sdk-development/996-turn-off-scrolling-bounces-uiwebview.html http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=619534 How do I stop a UIScrollView from bouncing horizontally?
