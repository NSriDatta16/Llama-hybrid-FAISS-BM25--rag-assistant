HttpOnly cookies on google app engine java

Anyone know how I can use httponly cookies for sessions and cookies on the app engine? In the javadoc for the Cookie class, http://java.sun.com/javaee/6/docs/api/javax/servlet/http/Cookie.html#setHttpOnly(boolean) , there is a setHttpOnly method. I get a compiler error when trying to use it when developing for app engine though. The method was introduced in the Servlet 3.0 spec, so its pretty new.
