Adding Parsekit To An Xcode Project

I am trying to add the Parsekit framework to my OSX Xcode project. I've never added a 3rd party framework before and I can't get it to work right. I dragged the included Xcode project into my 'Groups & Files' pane and chose to Add it to my project. I then dragged Parsekit.framework underneath the Link Binary With Libraries heading. Then I double-clicked my target app and added Parsekit as a Direct Dependency. I also added libicucore.dylib as a Linked Library (as it says to do this on their site). Finally, in the Build settings tab of my target info I set the Header Search Paths to /Users/path/to/include/directory and the Other Linker Flags to -ObjC -all_load . Running this as a debug build work fine with no errors. However, when I build my app to release and then try to run the executable created, the app fails to load with the following error message: MyApp cannot be opened because of a problem. Check with the developer to make sure myApp works with this version of Mac OS X. Here is the dump from the crash reporter: Process: MyApp [11658] Path: /Users/Garry/Programming/Xcode/Mac/MyApp/build/Release/MyApp.app/Contents/MacOS/MyApp Identifier: com.yourcompany.MyApp Version: ???

Any idea what that is?? I am developing with Xcode 3.2.2 on an Intel MBP running 10.6.3. Many thanks for any help offered. Edit: New problem! Many thanks to diciu for your suggestions - initially I thought they had solved the problem. However, I copied the compiled app over to my wife's Macbook (Intel, running 10.6.3) but it won't launch. Instead I get the following error message: You can't open the application MyApp because it is not supported on this type of Mac. In the Build settings of MyApp, I have Valid architectures set to i386 x86_64 so it should work. What could this be caused by? Edit: Problem solved I had inadvertently checked the Build active architecture only flag in the Build settings. Unchecking this fixed my problem. Many thanks!
