Why use XML as a storage format?

Possible Duplicate: When is it OK to use an XML file to save information? What's up with everything using XML as a storage format for configuration files such? I'm asking because [name retraced] framework has an XML configuration file to store database credentials, and the particular application that's built upon the framework has some menus stored as an XML fragment in a database... it's not like we'd share database credentials or or menu structure with others, or even data that would be consumed by multiple services. It's all internal/specific to this app. A coworker said that XML is an easily-readable format for humans... but I don't think that's true. password foobar123 in an INI file is easier for a human to read than foobar123 . Then he said about parsing, but INI files have been around for ages so I'm sure there's a library or two for parsing them. I could see the logic behind using it as a data export method, because then whatever the app produces can be consumed by other services in a straightforward manner, but for internal stuff I just don't get it. Someone please enlighten me.
