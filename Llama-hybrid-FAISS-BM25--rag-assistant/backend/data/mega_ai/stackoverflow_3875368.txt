Using RakNet source with Code::Blocks on Ubuntu

Hey Forum, So i'm trying to find out how to use the source files from RakNet with Code::Blocks, in Ubuntu. All the tutorials on the internet are for windows, or use windows ".lib files". I need to find a way to get this working but I'm getting very discouraged since this is my third day in a row that has been without result. If anyone can help me at all I would greatly appreciate it. Thanks in Advance, Dan Chevalier
