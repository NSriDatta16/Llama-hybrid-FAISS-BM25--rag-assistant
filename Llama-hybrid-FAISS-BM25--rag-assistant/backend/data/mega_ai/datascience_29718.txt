Like suggested in one answer on this SO question , you could use elastic matching with Levenshtein distance to your task. Levenshtein distance obeys triangle inequality and is therefore a metric distance. Use of elastic matching was suggested for time series data comparison. Levenshtein distance works with characters data. There is an implementation of elastic matching and Levenshtein distance calculation in Python. To put them together you most probably need to build your own implementation.
