Dimensionality and Manifold

A commonly heard sentence in unsupervised Machine learning is High dimensional inputs typically live on or near a low dimensional manifold What is a dimension? What is a manifold? What is the difference? Can you give an example to describe both? Manifold from Wikipedia: In mathematics, a manifold is a topological space that resembles Euclidean space near each point. More precisely, each point of an n-dimensional manifold has a neighbourhood that is homeomorphic to the Euclidean space of dimension n. Dimension from Wikipedia: In physics and mathematics, the dimension of a mathematical space (or object) is informally defined as the minimum number of coordinates needed to specify any point within it. What does the Wikipedia even mean in layman terms? It sounds like some bizarre definition like most machine learning definition? They are both spaces, so what's the difference between a Euclidean space (i.e. Manifold) and a dimension space (i.e. feature-based)?
