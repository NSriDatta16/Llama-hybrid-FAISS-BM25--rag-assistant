Summing three lexicon based approach methods for sentiment analysis?

I'm doing sentiment analysis using a lexicon based approach and I have a bunch of news headlines that needs to be categorized as negative, positive and neutral or within a scale ranging from -1 (very negative sentiment) to +1 (very positive sentiment). I'm considering using three different methods: TextBlob, Vader (Valence Aware Dictionary and Sentiment Reasoner) and LIWC2015 as I have access to it. This would lead to three predicted sentiment of each headline. I hove two question: Which are the pros and cons of this technique? And, once runned the 3 analisys, how can I melt all them into a single metrics? Is standardize/normalize the 3 metrics and averaging them a good solution?
