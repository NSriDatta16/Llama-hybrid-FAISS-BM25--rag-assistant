Ensure temporary storage of card holder data meets PCI-DSS requirements?

We have to be sure that this temporary data will be persistent and that deletion is compliant with the DoD's security standards (wiping data on the disk / avoiding storage on the disk). I thought to store the data encrypted with the RIJNDAEL 256 algorithm + a crafted secret into memcache but I'm afraid of data loss / corruption. I thought as well to MySQL and the memory heap storage engine but I don't know the reliability of the thing so far. Any thoughts on the subject?
