Reporting Services 2008 - The report server installation is not initialized

I am trying to set up Report Server 2008 on a separate machine to the Reporting Services databases which are on a SQL Server 2008 R2 machine. I configure everything in the Reporting Services Configuration Manager (identical to a set up we have working on a different pair of servers). The database connection test works fine, and the final "Progress and Finish" and screen shows "Success". However when I browse to the report server I get the error: "The report server installation is not initialized. (rsReportServerNotActivated)" I have seen a number of solutions online for this but they suggest using the Initialization tab on the Reporting Services Configuration Manager to initialize it. Or alternatively to use the rsactivate command. Now in 2008 I can't seem to find either of these so I'm a bit stuck. When I use the Reporting Services Configuration Manager I get the following errors in the Event Viewer: The application domain WindowsService_1 failed to initialize. Error: Microsoft.ReportingServices.Diagnostics.Utilities.ReportServerNotActivatedException: The report server installation is not initialized. at Microsoft.ReportingServices.Library.ConnectionManager.b_ 2() at Microsoft.ReportingServices.Diagnostics.RevertImpersonationContext.<>c _DisplayClass1.b__0(Object state) at System.Security.SecurityContext.Run(SecurityContext securityContext, ContextCallback callback, Object state) at Microsoft.ReportingServices.Diagnostics.RevertImpersonationContext.Run(ContextBody callback) at Microsoft.ReportingServices.Library.ConnectionManager.GetEncryptionKey() at Microsoft.ReportingServices.Library.ConnectionManager.ConnectStorage() at Microsoft.ReportingServices.Library.ServiceController.ServiceStartThread(Object firstStart). followed by: The application domain WindowsService_1 failed to initialize.

Is there another way I can initialize the report server installation?
