I don't think you can statistically analyse all the responses to the same thread (article?) because: for parametric statistics, you're going to have a lack of independence in later answers to the questions (i.e. they are going to be influenced by earlier answers), which violates assumptions for a number of methods, and for non-parametric statistics (e.g. decision tree), you're possibly going to produce a model with inflated estimated accuracy due to the correlation between responses in the same thread - and longer threads may have proportionately more comments that are similar (thinking of Reddit here as an example). Can you take a random sample of answers across all the threads, only one answer per thread (just randomise which answer is selected, e.g. the 3rd, 15th, etc) and then model using the predictors you suggest in your third paragraph, and include the answer number as another predictor? You may wish to think about how you wish to specify the current opinion, e.g. binary positive/negative, scale of positiveness, etc, as that will suggest which technique(s) are open for you to use.
