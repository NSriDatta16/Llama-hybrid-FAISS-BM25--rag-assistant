A great way to measure the variability in this instance would be to partition the total variance between within days and between days. For within groups variance, the first step is to find the "Sum of Squares Within:" Find the mean of the day 1 measurements, Subtract this mean from each measurement, Square each of these subtractions Add of all of these squares Repeat this procedure for each day Add up all of these sums In other words: $SS_w=\sum\limits_{j=1}^g$ $\sum\limits_{i=1}^{n_j}$ $(y_{ij}-\overline{y})^2$ Then, find the "Sum of Squares Between." You need the "grand mean" for this, which is the average of all observations. Next follow a similar procedure as for $SS_w$, but use the grand mean in place of the mean and the group means in place of the measurements: Find the grand mean, Find the mean of each group Subtract the grand mean from the mean of each group, Square each of these subtractions, Sum up all of these squares. In other words: $SS_b=\sum\limits_{j=1}^k$ $(\overline{x_j}-\overline{\overline{x}})^2$ Because you have equal groups (3 measurements per day), you do not have to adjust $SS_b$. If the groups are unequal, you need to adjust $SS_b$. Finally, partition the variance. For the proportion of within groups variance, also known as error variance: $e=SS_w/SS_w+SS_b$ The more interesting is between days variance, also called effect size or $\eta^2$ ("eta-squared"): $\eta^2=SS_b/SS_w+SS_b$. If $\eta^2>0.15$, then you have data suited for a true longitudinal analysis. Given that you've said you don't have much statistics experience, longitudinal analysis using multi level modelling or ARIMA models might require more work than you want.
