The short version is: use type="file" , base64-encode the file, and put it inside a CDATA block. I originally found an explanation at this link: http://techblog.floorplanner.com/2010/02/15/restful-uploading-of-files-using-xml/ That link appears to have died, so I recommend checking out the Internet Archive copy of the blog post: http://web.archive.org/web/20100825030057/http://techblog.floorplanner.com/2010/02/15/restful-uploading-of-files-using-xml/ Also linked from that post is a gem that implements an encoder for files posted to Rails as XML: https://github.com/nragaz/encoded_attachment
