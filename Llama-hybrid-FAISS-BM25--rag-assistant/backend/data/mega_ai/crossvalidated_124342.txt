Is backpropagation algorithm same for both full-connected and local-connected neural network?

Is the backpropagation (BP) algorithm the same for both fully-connected and locally-connected (or partially-connected) neural networks? I know how to use BP for a fully-connected network, but I don't know how to use BP for a locally-connected network. How would I calculate the derivative for those links which are not connected, is there any documentation for this?
