How to draw independent samples from an MCMC output

I am using simulated data to compare different multiple imputation methods, one of which uses MCMC. As I am comparing various methods on simulated data, I will run the algorithm on thousands of datasets in a loop. I hope to draw M approximately independent samples to impute, in a way that is computationally efficient. I plan on running various chains from each of the scenarios to determine what the burnin period needs to be, and then applying the same period to each chain in the loop. I have three ideas, and wonder which is best, and what others think on the length of the chain required? Sample a long chain for burnin + M*IAT + 1 (Integrated Autocorrelation Time) iterations. Then discard the burnin and sample M draws at random from the remaining iterations. Same as 1, except thinning the chain in some way, for example choosing the 1st, (1 + IAT)th, ..., (1 + M*IAT)th iterations to sample from. Running M independent chains of length burnin + IAT and choosing the final iteration to sample from. It's worth saying my current estimates are something like: burnin = ~ 20, IAT = ~ 6, M ranges from 5 to 40 depending on the scenario
