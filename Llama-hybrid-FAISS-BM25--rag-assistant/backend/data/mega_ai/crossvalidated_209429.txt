How and what do I train in my Convolutional Neural Network

I have been trying to research and implement a convolution neural network in c++, and I think I understand the basic architecture of it. My problem is that I am incredibly confused as to what is supposed to be trained and how I can train it. Some sources say that the filters themselves must be trained and others say that you should train the activation function at the very end of the network. I feel like you would need to train both of these things, but how can I train two separate things at once? How do I know when I am finished training the filters, and can move on to training the activation at the end? I am very confused about this, so any help at all would be beneficial! *note that I have absolutely no formal experience with machine learning, so forgive me if there are gaps in my knowledge.
