First things first. have you tried running this without the feature selection algorithm ? because the number of features seem to be quite less. Next, try a different classification procedure for the weekends and the weekdays because the underlying pattern may be quite different for the two values. Third, try the logistic regression and the single hidden layer backpropagation neural net as well just for the sake of comparison. P.S : before you try any of this, just plot the data and see if there is any pattern there. you have the luxury of working with less number of variables.
