Currently I have decided after doing some reading and research that the best way to go is to store everything in objects using objects literals: var files = {}; // Add loads of data And then storing them using JSON.stringify() : localStorage.setItem('myFiles', JSON.stringify(files)); This makes good practice because it store large amounts of information that is easy to store and access. Also it prevents from getting confusing when to use the simple way of adding key-value pair information in localStorage and when to use the localStorage.setItem(key, value) function
