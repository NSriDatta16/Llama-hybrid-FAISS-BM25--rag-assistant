Change the value of a text box to its current order in a sortable tab

Edit: I have solved this by myself. See my answer below I have set up a nice sortable table with jQuery and it is quite nice. But now i want to extend it. Each table row has a text box, and i want i am after is to, every time a row is dropped, the text boxes update to reflect the order of the text boxes. E.g. The text box up the top always has the value of '1', the second is always '2' and so on. I am using jQuery and the Table Drag and Drop JQuery plugin Code Javascript: $(document).ready(function () { $("#table-2").tableDnD({ onDrop: function (table, row) { var rows = table.tBodies[0].rows; var debugStr = "Order: "; for (var i = 0; i HTML Table: Product Order Pol Evo Kal Lok
