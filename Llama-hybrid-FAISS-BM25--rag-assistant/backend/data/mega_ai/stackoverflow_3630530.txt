How to terminate program in C++

When I exit my C++ program it crashes with errors like: EAccessViolation with mesage 'Access violation at address 0... and Abnormal Program Termination It is probably caused by some destructor because it happens only when the application exits. I use a few external libraries and cannot find the code that causes it. Is there a function that forces immediate program exit (something like kill in Linux) so that memory would have to be freed by the operating system? I could use this function in app exit event. I know that it would be a terrible solution because it'd just hide the problem. I'm just asking out of sheer curiosity, so please don't give me -1 :) I tried exit(0) from stdlib but it didn't help. EDIT: Thanks for your numerous replies:) I use Builder C++ 6 (I know it's outdated but for some reasons I had to use it). My app uses library to neural networks (FANN). Using the debugger I found that program crashes in: ~neural_net() { destroy(); } destroy() calls multiple time another function fann_safe_free(ptr), that is: #define fann_safe_free(x) {if(x) { free(x); x = NULL; }} The library works great, problem only appears when it does cleaning. That's why I asked about so brutal solution. My app is multi-threaded but other threads operate on different data. I will analyze my code for the n-th time(the bug must be somewhere), thanks for all your tips :)
