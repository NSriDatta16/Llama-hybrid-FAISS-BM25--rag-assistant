how to get the one entry from hashmap without iterating

Is there a elegant way of obtaining only one Entry from HashMap, without iterating, if key is not known. As order of entry of entry is not important, can we say something like hashMapObject.get(zeroth_index); Although I am aware that there exist no such get by index method. If I tried approach mentioned below, it would still have to get all the entry set of the hashmap . for(Map.Entry entry : MapObj.entrySet()) { return entry; } Suggestions are welcome. EDIT: Please suggest any other Data Structure to suffice requirement.
