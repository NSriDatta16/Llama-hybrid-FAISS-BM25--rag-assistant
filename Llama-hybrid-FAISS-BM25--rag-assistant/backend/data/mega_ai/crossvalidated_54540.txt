The answer is no, LOF is not appropriate for your problem. LOF is an unsupervised outlier detection method. Now, the features you select and the distance metric you pick for your graph naturally determine part of what it means for a point to be further from its neighbors than they are from each other, but at the end of the day, what you need to do is just train a good ol' supervised classifier. Someone suggested SVM, you might also look at boosted trees, random forest, neural nets, logistic regression, etc.
