Error Message in lme() :Error in MEEM(object, conLin, control$niterEM) : Singularity in backsolve at level 0, block 1

I have a dataframe called "cleaned", which consists of about 300,000 rows and 13 variables. Except the dependent variable, all variables are categorical and have multiple levels ($\geq2$). The dependent variable is numeric and takes values ranging from -1,500 to 3,296, mostly positive. Here is a summary of the dataframe: > summary(cleaned$SumOf1st.Yr.Cash) Min. 1st Qu.
