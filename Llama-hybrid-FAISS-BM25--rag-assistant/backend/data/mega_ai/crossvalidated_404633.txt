Understanding the Cullen and Frey plot

I would like to figure out which distribution fits my data best. Here is the histogram of my data : I used the fitdistrplus package in R to try to find the best fit for my data. To get an idea of which family distribution to fit, I did this: library(fitdistrplus) descdist(my_data, discrete=FALSE, boot=500) I get this skewness-kurtosis plot : With these summary statistics : min: 23 max: 1989 median: 184 mean: 228.8346 estimated sd: 165.6273 estimated skewness: 1.706379 estimated kurtosis: 11.31023 So apparently no distribution is a good candidate for the data. How to interpret this plot ? Does this mean that my data is a mixture of several distributions ? EDIT : This distribution represents DNA fragment lengths obtained from an experiment. My aim is to be able to simulate the result of this experiment by simuating the resulting fragments. (i.e a simulated fragment is defined by two positions in the genome seperated by a distance D). I assume that the fragment length distribution observed from the real experiment can be described by a density function or a mxiture of densities. I am looking fo the best function from which I could sample values of D for my simulations. To note, I am using only a sub sample to fit a distribution. We generate millions of fragments. I work on subsample of 500.000 fragments.
