Using bag of words for finding similar sentences doesn't (at least shouldn't) work well because you don't capture any semantics. Two phrases having the same meaning but with totally different words will not be similar. If they fall into the same cluster, I believe it'll be by chance. In order to capture meanings, you should use something like word-embeddings, where each word is mapped to a $K$ dimensional space and similar meaning words tend to be closer. Thus, when you construct numerical vectors for phrases (one simple way, by averaging the embeddings of each word in the sentence), and then apply a clustering algorithm.
