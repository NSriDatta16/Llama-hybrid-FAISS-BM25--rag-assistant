Yes, the C# compiler itself is a prime example, csc.exe . While overall trend on Windows is to build GUI based apps, there are a lot command line tools out there, especially in the world of development (Compilers, Unit Testing Tools, Code Coverage Tools, Code Analysis Tools, etc). Typically you won't see command line applications built for non technical users. The advantage of simple command line tools is that they can be mixed and matched in ways that the original authors may have never anticipated so long as they understand a common medium of exchange, usually plain text. The *nix world has thrived on this principal, but as I mentioned above, this is partly due to the fact that until only in the last few years or so, usually only technical inclined people used those operating systems and were comfortable using command line tools. GUI applications tend to be much more rigid in design, you're usually limited to only the functionality the author of the application anticipated. The flip side is they tend to be easier to understand and use intuitively.
