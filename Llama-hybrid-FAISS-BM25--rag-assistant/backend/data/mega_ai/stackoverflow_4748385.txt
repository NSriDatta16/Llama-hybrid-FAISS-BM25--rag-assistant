I solved this problem using the Workspace tab in the build definition. My solution file references projects that are outside of the current project, such as a $/Common project. For an automated build to work, the workspace on the build agent needed to be correctly mapped. Looking at the error generated, I could determine where the folders were expected to be. So my Working Folders has a few different projects listed in it, with the Build Agent Folder being the location on the Build Agent computer, not my local computer (that threw me for a loop). Everything is built on the build agent, and then copied to an output directory.
