Best ML models for long term time series forecast

I have a project to make a long term prediction (like 5 years) of electricity production by types of power plants (solor, wind, coal, nuclear etc.). I have access to time series data in MW [megawatts] for days, weeks, months and years since 2010 until now. What would you say are the best ML models for such task? Can you possibly refer me to some good resources regarding this topic you found helpful? Thanks a lot.
