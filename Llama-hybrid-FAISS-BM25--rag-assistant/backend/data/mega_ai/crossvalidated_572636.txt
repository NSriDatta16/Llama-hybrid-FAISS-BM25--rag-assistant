Understanding neural network outputs in terms of causal models?

When an ML model (neural network or a regression etc.) is built, is there any way of understanding the logic of the model, i.e., the relationship between the covariates and output in terms of data-generating models, i.e., structural causal models, and therefore understanding the causal relationships rather than the distribution of observed variables, i.e., the weights/beta coefficients of each covariate to the output? Typically in a business setting, root cause analysis is a common topic of discussion and the use of causal discovery/inference would help to answer such questions however neural networks lack this type of interpretation and inference. Has there been any progress in attempting to use machine learning to create accurate SCMs from output data of neural networks etc?
