I'm posting this as an answer but really its more of a comment on Jon Erickson's answer (I don't have the reputation points to comment yet). 18 months later this is still a bug in IE and I just wanted to elaborate on the 'how to run something outside of the drop function' part by suggesting setTimeout() I am solving the problem by passing an anonymous function that removes the element to setTimeout(). Depending on your snap or reversion settings you might want to also consider hiding the draggable. $(".droppable").droppable({ drop: function(event, ui) { // do something interesting here... // now get rid of the draggable $(ui.draggable).hide(); setTimeout(function(){$(ui.draggable).remove();}, 1); } });
