To see if there are special characters in your file, Try the -b or -q options to ls, assuming solaris 8 has those options. As another solution to deleting the file you can bring up the graphical file browser (gasp!) and drag and drop the unwanted file to the trash. Another solution might be to move the one file to a different name (the one without the unknown special character), then delete the special character directory name with wildcards. mv msheehan temp rm mshee* mv temp msheehan Of course, you want to be sure that only the file you want to delete matches the wildcard. And, for your particular case, since one was a directory and the other a file, this command might have solved it all: rmdir msheeha*
