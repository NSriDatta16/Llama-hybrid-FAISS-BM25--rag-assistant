Creating AJAX Rich Mobile Site?

I'm thinking about creating a mobile website that's rich in AJAX and Jquery functionality. So from the phone, a user can experience capabilities such as: drag and drop, "loading..." images, dialogs that fade in and fade out, drop shadow dialog boxes, dynamic resizing of dialogs etc... When the mobile website first loads, it will probably load a 500kb index.html page with the necessary CSS and jquery files. But from that point on, any call to action will load html content asynchronously (that is, when a person clicks on a link like "view next 10 search results", only the search results DIV container is re-painted after an AJAX call) so that it minimises data transfer. My goal is to create an application that offers a rich user interface while satisfying the following criteria: 1) is responsive 2) limits the amount of data transfer 3) to serve the widest audience of smart phone users without having to develop with N different frameworks: objective C for iphone, java for blackberry, ? for android, ? for windows mobile Will the AJAX rich mobile site approach I mentioned meet my requirements?
