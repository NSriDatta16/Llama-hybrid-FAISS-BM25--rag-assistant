A Question from textbook "Learning with Kernels"

I am reading the book " Learning with Kernels: Support Vector Machines, Regularization, Optimization, and Beyond (Adaptive Computation and Machine Learning) ". I finished the first chapter and didn't notice any approach taken by the authors, but I assume according to the material in the first chapter it is a frequentist approach. So my question is from the people who has read the book or know about it. Am I right about this assumption?
