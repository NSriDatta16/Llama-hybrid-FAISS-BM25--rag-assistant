Alternatives to LINQ To SQL on high loaded pages

To begin with, I LOVE LINQ TO SQL. It's so much easier to use than direct querying. But, there's one great problem: it doesn't work well on high loaded requests. I have some actions in my ASP.NET MVC project, that are called hundreds times every minute. I used to have LINQ to SQL there, but since the amount of requests is gigantic, LINQ TO SQL almost always returned "Row not found or changed" or "X of X updates failed". And it's understandable. For instance, I have to increase some value by one with every request. var stat = DB.Stats.First(); stat.Visits++; // .... DB.SubmitChanges(); But while ASP.NET was working on those //... instructions, the stats.Visits value stored in the table got changed. I found a solution, I created a stored procedure UPDATE Stats SET Visits=Visits+1 It works well. Unfortunately now I'm getting more and more moments like that. And it sucks to create stored procedures for all cases. So my question is, how to solve this problem? Are there any alternatives that can work here? I hear that Stackoverflow works with LINQ to SQL. And it's more loaded than my site.
