The answer is in the source code for the blog post: https://github.com/groverpr/Machine-Learning/blob/9963e59823fe0ff18cc8e1b2657b71c01f133193/catboost/utils.py#L25-L27 They re-fit the target encoding using the entire training set, before making out-of-sample predictions. Note that they also fill missing values with the global mean of the target. Edit: I wonder if it could be useful to average together the results of the K encodings, rather than re-training a single encoding on the entire dataset.
