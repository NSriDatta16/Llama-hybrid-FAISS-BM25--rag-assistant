Optional relationship in Hierarchy

I have a hierarchy Area -> Zone -> Sector where Zone is optional i.e. a particular Sector may belong to an Area but the user may not want to break down at the Zone level. Additionally Sectors are not the same as Zones, they have different properties and Zones are effectively a collection of Sectors Sectors have other entities related further down the hierarchy as well. What I'd like to know is what's the best approach to modelling this in a database? I've done this before in a similar scenario and used a dummy Zone entity to then allow storage of the Sectors. Anybody got any better ideas? Thanks, Mark
