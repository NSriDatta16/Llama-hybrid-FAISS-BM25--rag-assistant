Is the prediction algorithm absolutely the same for all linear classifiers?

Is the prediction algorithm absolutely the same for all linear classifiers and linear regression algorithms? As known, any linear classifier can be described as: y = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + c There are two broad classes of methods for determining the parameters of a linear classifier (generative and discriminative): https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_classifier Linear Discriminant Analysis (or Fisher's linear discriminant), Naive Bayes classifier Logistic regression, Perceptron, Support vector machine Question: Is it true that linear classifiers differ only in the Learning algorithm, but do they do the same during Prediction y = w1*x1 + w2*x2 + ... + c ? If I used one method for Training (for example SVM with linear kernel function), then can I use other method for prediction (for example Perceptron) with the same output result? And can I do the same, if I used SVR (Support Vector Regression with linear kernel function) for Training, then can I use Perceptor as linear regression method for Prediction value?
