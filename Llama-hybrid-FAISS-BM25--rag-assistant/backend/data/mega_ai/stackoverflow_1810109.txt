Parsing a string which represents a list of tuples

I have strings which look like this one: "(8, 12.25), (13, 15), (16.75, 18.5)" and I would like to convert each of them into a python data structure. Preferably a list (or tuple) of tuples containing a pair of float values. I could do that with eval("(8, 12.25), (13, 15), (16.75, 18.5)") which gives me a tuple of tuples, but I don't think naively evaluating external information would be a wise decision. So I wondered what an elegant pythonic solution might look like.
