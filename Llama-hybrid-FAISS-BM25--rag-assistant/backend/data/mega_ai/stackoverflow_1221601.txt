Embedded analog of CouchDB, same as sqlite for SQL Server

I like an idea of document oriented databases like CouchDB. I am looking for simple analog. My requirements is just: persistance storage for schema less data; some simple in-proc quering; good to have transactions and versioning; ruby API; map/reduce is aslo good to have; should work on shared hosting What I do not need is REST/HTTP interfaces (I will use it in-proc). Also I do not need all scalability stuff.
