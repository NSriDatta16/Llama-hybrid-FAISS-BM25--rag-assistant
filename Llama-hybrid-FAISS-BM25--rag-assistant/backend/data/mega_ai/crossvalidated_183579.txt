A few suggestions: Wrt (#1), you have a mixture of scales and information. Therefore, K-means (which assumes continuously distributed information only) is not an appropriate technique. Depending on the mixture of scale types you may want to consider traditional PCA (for continuous data only) vs an approach that integrates an unsupervised mixture of scales such as correspondence analysis or latent class PCA. Latent class models are another approach to clustering but are supervised and presume the existence of a response or target variable, which you may not have available. In terms of your concern with (#2) "equal weighting" and pre-processing of the various features in your data (e.g., communication), you can create a separate dimension for each one either using judgement or based on a principal components analysis to collapse and combine the features appropriate for each. To obtain results that are weighted and representative, I wouldn't oversample. Consider developing a weight factor instead. The general rule of thumb is not to weight the algorithms while factoring or clustering your data, but to weight the final results of those algorithms. There are lots of ways to weight your data, one approach is to use an IPF (iterative proportional fitting) model based on the marginals of each factor used.
