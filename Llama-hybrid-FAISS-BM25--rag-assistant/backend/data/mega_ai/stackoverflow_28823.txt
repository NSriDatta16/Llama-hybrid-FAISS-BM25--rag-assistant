XML => HTML with Hpricot and Rails

I have never worked with web services and rails, and obviously this is something I need to learn. I have chosen to use hpricot because it looks great. Anyway, _why's been nice enough to provide the following example on the hpricot website : #!ruby require 'hpricot' require 'open-uri' # load the RedHanded home page doc = Hpricot(open("http://redhanded.hobix.com/index.html")) # change the CSS class on links (doc/"span.entryPermalink").set("class", "newLinks") # remove the sidebar (doc/"#sidebar").remove # print the altered HTML puts doc Which looks simple, elegant, and easy peasey. Works great in Ruby, but my question is: How do I break this up in rails? I experimented with adding this all to a single controller, but couldn't think of the best way to call it in a view. So if you were parsing an XML file from a web API and printing it in nice clean HTML with Hpricot, how would you break up the activity over the models, views, and controllers, and what would you put where?
