JavaScript - Is it possible for two user-agents to communicate without server interaction?

The web is built around the idea of user-agents talking with servers. However, I'm wondering if there is some way (websockets perhaps?) that two user-agents (once introduced by a server) could talk directly with themselves. Is this possible? What kind of problems exist? User agents often site behind firewalls, so I would expect that the main problem is that unrequested traffic from user agent A to user agent B would be blocked since user agent B didn't make any requests to A.
