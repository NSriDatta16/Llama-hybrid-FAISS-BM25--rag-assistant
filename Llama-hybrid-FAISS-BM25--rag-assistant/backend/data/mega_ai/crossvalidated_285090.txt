I'd like to stress again the incorrectness in part of the accepted answer. The wording of the question lead to confusion. The question have Average and StdDev of each month, but it's unclear what kind of subset is used. Is it the average of 1 wind turbine of the whole farm or the daily average of the whole farm? If it's the daily average for each month, you can't add up the monthly average to get the annual average because they do not have the same denominator. If it's the unit average, the question should state We can say that in the average year each turbine in the wind farm produces 10,358 MWh,... Instead of We can say that in the average year the wind farm produces 10,358 MWh,... Further more, The Standard deviation or variance is the comparison against the set's own average. It does NOT contain any information regarding the average of its parent set (the bigger set which the computed set is a component of). Short answer: You average the variances; then you can take square root to get the average standard deviation. This is wrong. You can do normal math operation with averages (without involving the elements' data) because they share common denominators. NOT the case with variance nor standard deviation The image is not necessarily very precise, but it conveys the general idea. Let's imagine the output of one wind farm as in the image. As you can see, the "local" variance has nothing to do with the "global" variance, no matter how you add or multiply those. If you add the "local" variances together, it will be very small compare to the "global" variance. You cannot predict the variance of the year using variance of 2 half year. So, in the accepted answer, while the sum calculation is correct, the division by 12 to get the monthly number means nothing. . Of the three sections, the first and last sections are wrong, the second is right. Again, it's a very wrong application, please do not follow it or it will get you into trouble. Just calculate for the whole thing, using total yearly/monthly output of each unit as data points depending whether you want yearly or monthly number, that should be the correct answer. You probably want something like this. This is my randomly generated numbers. If you have the data, the result in cell O2 should be your answer.
