If you wish to see an in-depth discussion of Singletons, the various policies about their lifetime and the thread safety issues, I can only recommend a good read: " Modern C++ Design " by Alexandrescu. The implementation is presented on the web in Loki, find it here ! And yes, it does hold in a single header file. So I would really encourage you to at least grab the file and read it, and better yet read the book to have the full-blown reflection.
