The hosting of ActiveX controls is a right royal pain. Basically, outside of some very thick tomes, there is no easy documentation on how to write a correct ActiveX host from scratch. Start by taking a peek at webhost here: http://www.mvps.org/user32/ This was my experiment in creating the least amount of framework that could still host a shell.explorer ActiveX control. The "core" API function to get you started down this road of madness is OleCreate - this will create a control given its CLSID, and a pointer to an IOleClientSite implementation thats going to be the, well, site for the control and some kind of IStorage implementation.
