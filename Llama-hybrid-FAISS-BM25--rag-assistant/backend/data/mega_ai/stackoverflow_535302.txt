If you pass in dsSubTable as a DataTable then you can use it directly in a from blah in dsSubTable. But it feels like your abusing Linq. The power of Linq is that it is not Sql, so why are you writing a method that instead of string concatenating Sql together, you're building up a Linq expression. Linq allows you to think of your data in terms of Sets and that's what I find really powerful about it. I encourage you to think about what you are trying to accomplish when you call 'doQuery' and encode those queries as first class operations.
