In IIS7, you can do this either declaratively in your web.config, or programmatically. The programmatic solution requires a simple HttpModule that's registered to run for all requests in Integrated mode, where you look for the URLs that you're concerned about. Then call: context.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.NoCache); FWIW, you may want to consider disabling client-side caching only, while enabling server-side caching, by using HttpCacheability.ServerAndNoCache . Also, if you add a query string on the image names, you will prevent server-side caching by http.sys. In case it helps, I cover techniques like these in detail in my book: Ultra-Fast ASP.NET .
