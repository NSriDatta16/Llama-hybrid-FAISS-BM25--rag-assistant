Another advantage of Access being a COM application is that you can create an .NET application to run and test an Access application via Automation . The advantage of this is that then you can use a more powerful testing framework such as NUnit to write automated assert tests against an Access app. Therefore, if you are proficient in either C# or VB.NET combined with something like NUnit then you can more easily create greater test coverage for your Access app.
