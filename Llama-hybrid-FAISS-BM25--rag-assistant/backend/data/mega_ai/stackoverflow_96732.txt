Embedding one dll inside another as an embedded resource and then calling it from my code

I've got a situation where I have a DLL I'm creating that uses another third party DLL, but I would prefer to be able to build the third party DLL into my DLL instead of having to keep them both together if possible. This with is C# and .NET 3.5. The way I would like to do this is by storing the third party DLL as an embedded resource which I then place in the appropriate place during execution of the first DLL. The way I originally planned to do this is by writing code to put the third party DLL in the location specified by System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location.ToString() minus the last /nameOfMyAssembly.dll . I can successfully save the third party .DLL in this location (which ends up being C:\Documents and Settings\myUserName\Local Settings\Application Data\assembly\dl3\KXPPAX6Y.ZCY\A1MZ1499.1TR\e0115d44\91bb86eb_fe18c901 ), but when I get to the part of my code requiring this DLL, it can't find it. Does anybody have any idea as to what I need to be doing differently?
