PC-lint/Flexelint are very powerful and useful static analysis tools, and highly configurable, though sadly not free. When first using a tool like this, they can produce huge numbers of warnings, which can make it hard to differentiate between major and minor ones. Therefore, it is best to start using the tool on your code as early in the project as possible, and then to run it on your code as often as possible, so that you can deal with new warnings as they come up. With continual use like this, you soon learn how to write your code in a way which confirms to the rules applied by the tool. Because of this, I prefer tools like Lint which run relatively quickly, and so encourage continual use, rather than the more cumbersome tools which you may end up using less often, if at all.
