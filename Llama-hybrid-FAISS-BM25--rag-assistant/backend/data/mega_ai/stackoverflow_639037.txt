Infragistics UltraGrid: how to remove default selection of first row

I have put an UltraGrid on a WinForms user control. I have tweaked some settings so I can use the grid as a read-only multi-row select table. But there's one problem: by default the first row appears to be selected. But the Selected.Rows property is empty, and also the ActiveRow property is null . So the row appears to be selected, but it actually isn't, making it impossible to remove the selection. I'm sure there must be a setting hidden somewhere on the UltraGrid to control this behavior. And if this is not the case then maybe there's a workaround? Thanks.
