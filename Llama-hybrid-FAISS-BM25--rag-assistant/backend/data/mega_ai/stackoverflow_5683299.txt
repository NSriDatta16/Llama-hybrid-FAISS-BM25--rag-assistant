Returning false as fudgey suggests works great for making things dynamically unsortable, but there's also a cancel option in the sortable config which lets you set up static unsortables as well: $("#sortable").sortable({ // this prevents all buttons, form fields, and elemens // with the "unsortable" class from being dragged cancel: ":input, button, .unsortable" });
