Shake detection with using IBuilder or Load View without IBuilder

I am writing some application (let's say game - 1 view no cocoa controls) which needs to detect shakes. As beginner with IOS have started with default openGL template (new one). Application works. I have decided to add shakes. "motionBegan" don't work on "EAGLEview", so I have created view controller. Touches worked but "motionBegan" still not worked. (same like "viewDidAppear") I thought that somehow IBuilder file is overlapping it. So I have decided to resign from my IBuilder file and move forward without. What I have now is: main.m int retVal = UIApplicationMain(argc, argv, nil, @"SimplePianoAppDelegate"); SimplePianoAppDelegate.m window = [[UIWindow alloc] initWithFrame:[UIScreen mainScreen].bounds]; [window setUserInteractionEnabled:YES]; [window setMultipleTouchEnabled:YES]; viewController = [[InputControler alloc] init]; glView=[[EAGLView alloc] initWithFrame:window.bounds]; glView.hidden=NO; viewController.view=glView; [window bringSubviewToFront:glView]; [window addSubview:viewController.view]; [window makeKeyAndVisible]; [glView setMultipleTouchEnabled:YES]; [glView performSelectorOnMainThread:@selector(mainAppLoop) withObject:nil waitUntilDone:NO]; With this code touches and motions worked but I don't see anything. (just white screen) :( I am sure that some of the lines above are not necessary, but I am trying all possible options. What is strange is that no matter if I create my glView or not "loadView" in viewcontroller is not called. Thank you for help in advance. Mariusz
