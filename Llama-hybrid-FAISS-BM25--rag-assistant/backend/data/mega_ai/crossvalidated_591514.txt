Detection outliers in financial time series taking into account related time series

I would like seek advice on how to build an efficient approach to identify outliers in a financial series taking into account also related series. For example, let's assume the there is a very important growth in yields of country A, so that the last observation of my series is the highest ever recorded. With a Local Outlier Factor (LOF) or Isolation Forest algorithms, I may probably find that my n observation is flagged as outlier. However, let's say that also country B and C show the same growth, although with different levels, so that, by visual inspection, I would consider that my n observation in country A series is not an outlier as it fits the same trend (growth of yields as in all the countries). Which kind of (mix of) algorithm/approches would you suggest in this case? Thank you.
