Population is normal with known variance and mean. Sample size is small. Which case?

Given a population (normal distribution) mean and variance and a sample set with n I believe that I understand why a t-test is used. It is because we are not sure of the distribution that the sample values come from. We want to compare the mean against the normally distributed population. Typically, this case would require we estimate the variance of the sample when finding the t-value. However, we are given the variance of the population. So should I instead use the given variance for my calculation? $$ t = \frac{\overline{X}-\mu}{\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{N}}} $$ EDIT: I wanted to provide an example for clarification. Company A releases the results of their new printer's performance. These results come from a normal distribution because they are based on averages. $$ \mu_{A} = 40\\ \sigma_{A} = 5 $$ Company B wants to publish their printer results. They take the following 15 samples. $$ B = \{ 25,35,50,20,30,25,30,35,40,45,20,25,30,35,35 \} $$ Calculating the sample mean $\overline{B}$ and sample standard deviation $s_{B}$ is trivial. Can company B make the claim that their printer performs better than company A? Since the underlying distribution of $B$ is unknown, does that disqualify the use of the z-test for this problem? If I am to use a t-test, am I using $\sigma_{A}$ or $s_{B}$?
