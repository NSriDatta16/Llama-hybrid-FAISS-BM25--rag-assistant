Is a friend function defined in-class automatically inline?

If a member function is defined inside the class, it is an inline function. E.g. struct X { void mem_f() {} //mem_f is inline }; My question is whether a nonmember friend function defined inside the class is also automatically inline. E.g. struct Y { friend void friend_f() {} //is friend_f inline? }; A relevant quote/paragraph_no from the standard would be much welcome. Thanks.
