You can set the starting values for the conditional variance/mean values to their theoretical unconditional values. For errors you could set them to zero (because their mean = 0). For other AR,MA parameters you can solve the Yule-Walker equation, for garch parameters to the best of my knowledge you need to fix them to some arbitrarily values BUT they should respect the theoretical constraints ( positivity constraints, stationarity constraints...). Ex for Garch(1,1) , constraints: alpha + beta EDIT : For Initial values of the ARMA part you can have a look to the following article : (paragraph "16.2 Initial values" ): A Package for Estimating, Forecasting and Simulating Arfima Models: Arfima package 1.0 for Ox / By Jurgen A. Doornik and Marius Ooms
