Are there (experimental) JSR-262 JMX-WS enabled Java tools or applications?

I am very interested in the Web Services Connector for Java Management Extensions (JMX) Agents and the reference implementation ws-jmx-connector . JSR 262 will provide a new opportunity for cross-platform/cross-language enterprise integration projects, given the option to communicate with JMX Agents using non-Java clients. (I have been able to use the reference implementation with a Delphi client with little effort). Are there any (open source) Java tools or products which are JSR 262 'enabled' and expose MBeans over JMX WS - so that the JSR 262 reference implementation can be used, without the need to modify their source code?
