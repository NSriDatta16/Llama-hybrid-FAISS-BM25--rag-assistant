I'm not a .NET developer, but one more elegant way to do this would be to have 3 listeners on the table; an add listener, an update listener, and a delete listener. The listeners would trigger an INSERT, an UPDATE, and a DELETE, respectively. Sorting the list has no effect on the data stored on the database.
