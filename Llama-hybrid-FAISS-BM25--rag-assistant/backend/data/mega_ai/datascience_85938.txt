Machine Learning: creating a prediction without previous trends

Is there a machine learning algorithm that allows one to give an input a classification without a grouping or previous classification? Example: with a dataset of 5 digit numbers, the user inputs a random 5 digit number (12345), can the machine output "alteration" when 12345 is similar to something in the dataset, or output "completely new" when 12345 or anything similar doesn't exist? To clarify, the machine would do something like "alteration" when it finds something similar to 12345 such as 12445 where its only number difference, and output "completely new" when no similar numbers exist.
