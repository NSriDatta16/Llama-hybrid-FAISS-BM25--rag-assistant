There is no specific mathematical limit. There could be limits due to limitations of your software or your computer, such as little memory. Apart from that 26 categories should be no problem with good software. The paper http://dimacs.rutgers.edu/archive/Research/MMS/PAPERS/authorid-csna05.pdf about author attribution, using a bayesian version of multinomial logit, uses an example with 114 different authors, plus a category "none of them". Again, 26 should be no problem at all. With a high number of categories it could show important to use a software implementation that uses sparse matrices.
