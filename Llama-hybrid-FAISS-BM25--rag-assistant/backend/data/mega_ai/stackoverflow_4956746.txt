I own both books and have read the 1.2 version more than once (since I used to create and correct exams for students based on this book). I got the 2.0 version a while back. If you want a book that focusses completely on the differences between 1.2 and 2.0, this might not be the very best book although in all fairness Ed Burns does make some attempt. In the introduction there's a 3 page overview of things that are new in JSF 2.0 and throughout the book there are various sections labeled "JSF 2.0 Tip" which makes it clear that something is new to JSF 2.0. In comparison, I also own Bill Burke's book about EJB: Enterprise JavaBeans 3.0 , of which I recently bought the latest version Enterprise JavaBeans 3.1 . In this book there is almost no reference at all to things that are specifically new in EJB 3.1. JSF 2.0 the complete reference absolutely does better here. To sum up, for what you want the book is 'average'. Not super good, but also not super bad. (for learning about JSF in general I think the book is really good though, there just should have been a version for people already very familiar with JSF 1.2)
