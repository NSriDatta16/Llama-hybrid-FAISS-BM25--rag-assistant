Overview of concepts of the methods that this Single-Cell Differential Expression (SCDE) tool uses?

I'm unsure about how this tool works, but as I understand it, it tries to use Bayesian probability in order to differentiate the two different groups from each other as well as some other methods. Right now as I understand it; this R package does this: Takes in a 2D matrix of samples vs. features, with each number representing the amount of appearances of a feature in a sample. Receives another vector of keys that determine which group each sample belongs to. Performs some sort of analysis in order to get correlation between each sample and their respective groups. Transforms this data in order to determine some sort of version of variance or "differential expression scalar number" that ranks the features' differential quality between the two groups. Leaves the final resulting data open so that we can extract the list of features that are the most different between the two samples. Did I get that right? I'd like to understand the steps between 3 and 5. I think the concepts are outlined in the tutorial quite clearly but I don't have the direct stats know how to understand it. I think it's quite easy to read if you try to look at the variable names vs. their explanations. Sorry if this is poorly written. http://pklab.med.harvard.edu/scde/Tutorials/
