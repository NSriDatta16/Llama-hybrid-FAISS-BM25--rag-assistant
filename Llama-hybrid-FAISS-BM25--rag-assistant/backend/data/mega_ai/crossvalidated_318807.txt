Use of previously set cross validation set for ensemble models in h2o

I have time series dataset and as a requirement I prepare a 10 fold cross validation dataset. Briefly, I split data into 10 and for each training set I put a gap between last, first day of validation set and training set. That is, suppose that I take first 100 rows as validation. Then I take training set between the row range (150 - 5000). So 100-150 rows are removed. And repeated the same logic for other 9 folds. In the end I collected folds into dictionary like train[0], test[0] for fold_0, train[1], test[1] for fold_1 and so on... My question is that can I introduce this specific cross val set into ensemble model in h2o. The example code in h2o's web site offers to use fold_column . But I could not figure it out how to use it in this case. One another thing I have tried is that for each fold I have trained the data and get the predictions. And in the end I put 10 predictions into one list as below: preds = [] preds.append([pred1,pred2,pred3,pred4,pred5,pred6,pred7,pred8,pred9,pred10]) So preds list has the same pattern as returned by cross_validation_predictions() But this time I get 10 different base models for each base model. This is the link I am following and I need to ensemble regression base models. http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/data-science/stacked-ensembles.html So how should I proceed?
