VB.NET 8.0/Visual Studio 2005 does not support use of the With statement for direct object initialization. However, I believe you should be able to encapsulate the initialization in a Function: Private ReadOnly _products() As Product = BuildProducts() Private Function BuildProducts() As Product() Dim products(4) As Product Dim product0 As New Product With product0 .Name = "Melon" .Category = "Fruits" End With Dim product1 As New Product With product1 .Name = "Pear" .Category = "Fruits" End With Dim product2 As New Product With product2 .Name = "Milk" .Category = "Beverages" End With Dim product3 As New Product With product3 .Name = "Coca Cola" .Category = "Beverages" End With Dim product4 As New Product With product4 .Name = "Pepsi Cola" .Category = "Beverages" End With products(0) = product0 products(1) = product1 products(2) = product2 products(3) = product3 products(4) = product4 Return products End Function
