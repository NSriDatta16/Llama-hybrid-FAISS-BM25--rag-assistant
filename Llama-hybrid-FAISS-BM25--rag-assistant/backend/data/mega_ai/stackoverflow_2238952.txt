How can I load an external page in a jQuery overlay popup?

I'm trying to make a jQuery overlay load an external page. I think I'm having two versions of jquery conflicting with each other, as I'm using this for a drag and drop and it works fine: src="js/jquery-1.3.2.min.js js/jquery-ui-1.7.2.custom.min.js Now when I add this: http://cdn.jquerytools.org/1.1.2/full/jquery.tools.min.js for the overlay it doesn't seem to work. Does anyone have a simple overlay with external page?
