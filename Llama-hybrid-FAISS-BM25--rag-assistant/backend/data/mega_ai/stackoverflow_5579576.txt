You should store each possible seat as an individual record in the database, arrays really aren't standard practice for storage in DBs; they must break a normal form or two but I don't remember which one ;) Each site would have a rownumber, columnnumber etc, and a unique ID. That way you can get history for each seat, store additional properties for each seat, etc. Much better! If a seat is broken, you can disable it with a flag etc - if only certain seats are suitable for disabled people (near the aisle for example), you can flag it as such too, and query on how many 'accessible' seats are left. In fact, definitely much better :) To populate, you'd need to write a stored procedure / initialisation utility.
