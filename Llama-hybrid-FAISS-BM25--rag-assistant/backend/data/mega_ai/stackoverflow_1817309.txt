Thanks for your reply. I have solved my problem. First I tried to use flowing statements to initialige drag and drop... DataObject dragData = new DataObject(); DragDrop.DoDragDrop(this.devices, dragData, DragDropEffects.Link); But now I am using flowing statement and now all drag drop event is firing... DragDrop.DoDragDrop(this.devices, treeViewItem, DragDropEffects.Move); So only difference is the second parameter which I am sending is different. Thanks again Saquia
