I haven’t read too much into section 10.1.1 in Bishop’s book, but the full paragraph you are referring to is (emphasis in bold mine) The set of equations given by (10.9) for $j = 1,...,M$ represent a set of consistency conditions for the maximum of the lower bound subject to the factorization constraint. However, they do not represent an explicit solution because the expression on the right-hand side of (10.9) for the optimum $q^*_j(Z_j)$ depends on expectations computed with respect to the other factors $q_i(Z_i)$ for $i \neq j$ . We will therefore seek a consistent solution by first initializing all of the factors $q_i(Z_i)$ appropriately and then cycling through the factors and replacing each in turn with a revised estimate given by the right-hand side of (10.9) evaluated using the current estimates for all of the other factors. Convergence is guaranteed because bound is convex with respect to each of the factors $q_i(Z_i)$ (Boyd and Vandenberghe, 2004). The emphasis in bold suggests that the author means that the negative KL divergence $\mathcal L(q)$ is maximized using coordinate ascent, where one component of $q$ is adjusted while all others are fixed. The proof of convergence of coordinate ascent in the convexity case is not as straightforward as the author makes it out to be. See for example the references here .
