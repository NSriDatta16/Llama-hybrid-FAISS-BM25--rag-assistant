Be the counterexample (i.e., hard-working student)! With that said: I was trying to think of a real world example and this was the first that came to my mind. This will not be the mathematically simplest case (but if you understand this example, you should be able to find a simpler example with urns and balls or something). According to some research, the average IQ of men and women is the same, but the variance of male IQ is greater than the variance of female IQ. For concreteness, let's say that male IQ follows $N(100, \sigma^2)$ and female IQ follows $N(100, \alpha \sigma^2)$ with $\alpha . Half the population is male and half the population is female. Assuming that this research is correct: What is the correlation between gender and IQ? Are gender and IQ independent?
