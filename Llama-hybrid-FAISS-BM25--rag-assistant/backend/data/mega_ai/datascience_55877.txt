What is the difference between the value -99 and NaN in a data column?

I am new to data science. I was looking into some datasets and I saw some values like -99, which I discovered later that it means that there is a missing value. Does this mean the same thing as NaN? If it is the same thing, why do we use -99 instead of NaN?
