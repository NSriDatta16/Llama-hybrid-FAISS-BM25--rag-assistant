in every way ... The rules in general are better written, clearer, and now clearly describe this bizarre universe, making this mixture of magic and technology 'coherent'. The role of the Shadowrunners is finally detailed, which is not a luxury since it is neither more nor less what the players embody." Tawrdowski concluded, "Shadowrun 2nd Edition is so close to the old version and yet so much better that it feels like the same game but tested, the first edition being only a draft ... Regulars will move on to the second edition without any difficulty and even with great pleasure as it is thought out, more logical, in short more to the point. For those who don't know Shadowrun, this is an excellent opportunity to discover this game." Matthew Gabbert reviewed Shadowrun: Second Edition as a sneak preview in White Wolf #33 (Sept./Oct. 1992), rating it a 5 out of 5 and stated that "If the artwork and production values for the final version of Shadowrun II are up to FASA's usual high standards, then I see no reason not to give this nicely maturing product my highest recommendation." In Issue 8 of the Australian game magazine Australian Realms, Malcolm Adler reviewed the second edition, and commented, "All of you will be relieved to hear magic has been reworked (taking the basis of the new magic system from [1st edition supplement] The Grimoire) and all other facets, especially combat and character creation have been streamlined and explained with examples throughout." Adler also noted "The new edition puts an emphasis on role playing and character building. This adds to a feel throughout the book of the game leaving the 'Disney' look behind. The world just got deadlier and certainly a tad darker." Adler concluded, "FASA has done the impossible it seems and produced a second edition game that looks like it is going to be a hell of a long time before a third edition is ever needed. Strongly recommended to any Shadowrunners. Anyone else who is looking for a change in system, I suggest you give this a very good look over. Man meets magic and machine, well worth it." Challenge #41 called this "a truly hot game ... It's a great game value, a nicely put together book, and a lot of fun." The German magazine Envoyer reviewed the third edition of the game and noted, "The new set of rules continues the tradition of the existing works in terms of its structure, but has overall become more user-friendly ... These changes seem logical since they have been house-ruled by most groups in one way or another." However, Envoyer pointed out "the expansion system for vehicles remains unmentioned. The equipment list also only contains the bare essentials. What is particularly noticeable is that this is now 2060, but there is not a mention of the bioware that was introduced into the Shadowrun world in 2054." Despite these issues, the review concluded that the third edition "stands out from its predecessors thanks to its presentation and better readability." In his 1990 book The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games, game critic Rick Swan noted the inclusion of magic in the tech-heavy setting, calling it "an excuse to mix fantasy in a pot of hardcore science fiction and see what crawls out." Swan thought the magic system was "terrific fun", with "detailed, imaginative treatments." However, Swan found that "Unfortunately, fuzzy and overly complicated rules plague Shadowrun throughout." Despite this, Swan concluded by giving the game a solid rating of 3 out of 4, saying, "Still, the merits of the setting surpass the awkwardness of the rules ... any game where a fire-breathing dragon can turn up as a corporate chairman is worth checking out." In a 1996 reader poll by the British games magazine Arcane to determine the 50 most popular roleplaying games of all time, Shadowrun was ranked 8th. Editor Paul Pettengale commented: "Shadowrun's strength lies in the cleverly designed background, which creates a unique setting that actually works and is continually evolving
