You need to copy the picture into your project folder, otherwise XCode only creates a reference to the file. The easiest way to do that is to delete the file from your resources folder, and then redrag it in from your flash disk. When the box pops up to import it, make sure the checkbox in the upper corner is selected to copy the files into your project folder.
