DHH on Unit Testing : Is RSpec indeed needlessly complicated?

I happen to be a subscriber of Ruby Inside, since I'm particularly interested in Rails. Yesterday, the creator of Rails, David Heinemeier Hansson, pretty much said that he's just using test/unit. I would understand that, since it's Rails internal, but he seems to have given a strong opinion. He believes that RSpec and Cucumber are needlessly complicated. I would normally not pay much attention, but it depends on who says something. I respect Hansson a lot and his opinion got me thinking. When I started with Rails, I never really looked into test/unit. Just RSpec and Cucumber. And that is why I want your insight. Do you think that RSpec is indeed complicated for not much added value? Does writing test/unit take less time and effort?
