By the way, to do things the Rails way (and good architecture), move the line: @files = Dir['public/images/prompts/*.*'].map {|f| f.sub('public','') } ...out of the view and into the controller. The controller is the place to set up the variables and do data storage access, and the view is the place to display and format the info. And further, I would refactor this more by creating a constant for that path, e.g. in environment.rb: ICON_DIRECTORY_PATH = 'public/images/prompts/'
