From the link you provide the say the definition of those terms is: Symmetrical means that each visible node is connected with each hidden node (see below). Bipartite means it has two parts, or layers, and the graph is a mathematical term for a web of nodes. I would say that symmetrical is just their definition and that nodes are separated into two partitions: in one partition are visible nodes and in the other partition are the hidden nodes. So I wouldn't pay much attention to it ...
