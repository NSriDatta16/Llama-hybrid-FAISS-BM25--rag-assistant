Using lead-lag relationships for time series prediction

I have a large number (hundreds to thousands) of noisy time series that represent contemporaneous observations from different subjects. I hypothesise that there exist lead-lag relationships between observations for different subjects (or groups of subjects.) I would like to explore the potential use of such lead-lag relationships for the purposes of predicting the individual series. What methods might I consider for this? edit: To be clear, I am not looking at pairwise relationships. What I am looking for is a method that would look at the mountain of data at hand and attempt to discover (potentially non-linear) lead-lag relationships between arbitrary groups of series and the individual series to be predicted.
