You can plot the time series of the point estimates of the time-varying regression coefficients (or perhaps standardized coefficients) just as you would plot the time series themselves. You can add the corresponding time series of confidence intervals (at a desired level of confidence) as dashed lines in the same plot. You would then have as many plots as there are independent variables. Consider making the axis ranges equal across the plots for easier comparability. If you skip the confidence intervals and only have a few independent variables, the time series of their coefficients could be fit into a single plot.
