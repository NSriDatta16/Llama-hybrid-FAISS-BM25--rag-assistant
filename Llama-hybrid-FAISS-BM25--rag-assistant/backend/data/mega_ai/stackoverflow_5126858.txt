Use of Name::Class1 from Name::Class2 in the same Name.h file fails

I've a header file 'Custom.h' with two classes, ResizeLabel and ResizePanel, used to build a dll containing Custom Controls. If I use Custom::ResizePanel within ResizeLabel it is failing: error C2039: 'ResizePanel' : is not a member of 'Custom' There is also a warning in the Errorlist: Exception of type 'System.Exception' was thrown I imagine that the warning is relevant. Could it be because Visual Studio is trying to load the dll which contains Custom::ResizePanel from the code it is compiling which contains it? The code is as follows: namespace Custom { public ref class ResizeLabel : public System::Windows::Forms::Label { protected: virtual void OnTextChanged(System::EventArgs^ e) override { __super::OnTextChanged(e); // Not elegant I know, // but this is just to force the panel to process the size change dynamic_cast (this->Parent)->CurrentWidth = 0; } ... }; public ref class ResizePanel : public System::Windows::Forms::Panel { ... }; } I made it a dynamic_cast just to reduce the number of errors reported. How do I best avoid this problem?
