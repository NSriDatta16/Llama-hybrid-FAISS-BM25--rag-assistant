Why order of tensors in equation changes results of GAM?

Recently I'm trying to model daily counts using negative binomial distribution within mgcv's GAM model in order to obtain RR's. The data comes from 20 years of daily time series with weekly and monthly seasonality. Given prior series decomposition I assumed that seasonality is evolving with each year. Hence I used tensor products to model it: library(mgcv) gam_model By accident I changed the order in equation to: library(mgcv) gam_model And results are different, for example the tensor for year and day_of_year changes from (1st eq): to (2nd eq): Why this situation happen? I've checked for concurvity, there's none. I thought that the order of equation's components doesn't matter. Which solution I should choose or how to correct it?
