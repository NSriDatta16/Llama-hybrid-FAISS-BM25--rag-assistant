Let's consider the "bonus question" first, because the first question is just a simple special case. Standard deviations are square roots of variances. Square roots are difficult to work with, so restate your problem in terms of measurement variances and compute the standard deviation of the mean only once you have a solution for its variance. For independent measurements, variances add. This means that the variance of the sum of measurements $S=X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n$ is the sum of the measurement variances $\sigma_i^2,$ whence $$\operatorname{Var}(S) = \sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 + \cdots + \sigma_n^2.$$ Variances scale quadratically. This means that the variance of a multiple $\lambda$ of any random variable $S$ is $\lambda^2$ times the variance of $S.$ Applying this to $\lambda=1/n$ gives the variance of the mean of your measurements. Its square root is the standard deviation: $$\operatorname{sd}\left(\frac{S}{n}\right) = \sqrt{\operatorname{Var}\left(\frac{S}{n}\right)} = \sqrt{\left(\frac{1}{n}\right)^2\left(\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 + \cdots + \sigma_n^2\right)} = \frac{1}{n}\sqrt{\sigma_1^2 + \sigma_2^2 + \cdots + \sigma_n^2}.$$ In the case of $n$ measurements of the same quantity, where every $\sigma_i$ is the same value $\sigma,$ this shows the standard deviation of the average of those measurements is $$\frac{1}{n}\sqrt{\sigma^2 + \sigma^2 + \cdots + \sigma^2} = \frac{1}{n}\sqrt{n\sigma^2} = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}},$$ answering the first question.
