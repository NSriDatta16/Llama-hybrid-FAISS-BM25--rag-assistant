To answer your questions Yes; although with the usual caveats about using an optimisation procedure regarding convergence. If you want to find the MAP of the probability for data $X\sim\operatorname{Bin}(n=10,p)$ , using $X=4$ as an example, with a uniform prior on $p$ ; the following R code uses the BFGS algorithm to do so using the log-odds transform $z = \log p/1-p$ so the domain is suitable for BFGS purposes: # log of likelihood * prior for binomial data with 4 success, 10 trials ln_L_prior We can check the answer because this has posterior $\operatorname{Beta}(5,7)$ , with mode $5 - 1 / 5 + 7 - 2 = 0.4$ , which we log-odds transform and get the value $\approx -0.4054$ which was returned by R. The MAP estimate can be used as a summary of the posterior, however there is also (asymptotic) theory that can be used to describe the posterior near the MAP estimate. For example, the posterior, under some conditions, is approximately normally distributed with mean at the MAP estimate, $\theta_{\text{MAP}}$ , and covariance given by the inverse of the Hessian, $H$ , of the posterior evaluated at $\theta_{\text{MAP}}$ ; this means a credible interval can be approximated using the quantiles of the distribution $\mathcal{N}(\theta_{\text{MAP}}, -H^{-1})$ . The following R code calculates the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles of the $\operatorname{Beta} (5,7)$ distribution and that of the asymptotic approximation to the posterior: # exact posterior interval qbeta(c(0.025, 0.975), 5, 7) # [1] 0.167 0.692 # asymptotic approximation sd Chapter 4 of Bayesian Data Analysis by Gelman et al. is an easy-ish place to start if you want to know more about asymptotic approximations of the posterior based on modes or the MAP estimate.
