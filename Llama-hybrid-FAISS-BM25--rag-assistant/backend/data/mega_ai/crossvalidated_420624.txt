Can I continue ARIMA model despite my time time series has heterodasticity?

I estimated ARIMA model with daily gold time series. The residuals' corelogram is flat but its squared is not flat. Already I tried eVİEWS heterodasticity >> arch effect and ı found prob value 0.00 so there is heterodasticity. Can ı continue with ARIMA? https://yadi.sk/i/rT6UHvOud338Xw 2009q3-2018 work days
