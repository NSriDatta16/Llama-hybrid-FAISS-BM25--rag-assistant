SQL Server 2005 + JavaEE application on one computer in production

We have project with a server witch have about 3000 requests at day from client. 30-40 on-line users. And smth about 30-40Gb data increase per year. And system should be on-line 24x7. Where can we locate the SQL server better? On one computer with JavaEE container or on standalone computer? What pros and cons on this ways?
