Using Entity Framework with Oracle pseudo-booleans

I am investigating the use of Entity Framework in my organization. We use Oracle DBMS, and therefore (for good or ill) are using the "pseudo-boolean" pattern common in Oracle where instead of having a boolean column (which doesn't exist in Oracle) you have a 1 character column with a check constraint to force it to "Y" or "N". So, if I want an entity in my EF model to have a boolean property, how do I map this to a database column as "Y" for true and "N" for false? Is there a concept of "Converters" or something in Entity Framework that will do this for me? And just because it will probably come up, I know that EF only works with SQL Server out of the box. I would be using the DevArt dotConnect for Oracle to use EF with Oracle. http://www.devart.com/dotconnect/oracle/ Edit What about other ORM frameworks like NHibernate? Do they handle this scenario "out of the box"?
