You cannot stop everyone from cracking your security but in this case stopping 90% (or so) of the users from doing it is all you can ask for. And just making it difficult to use an illegal copy will accomplish the task. Look at Adobe and how many cracked license keys for Photoshop and Flash CS3 exist. The point is that doing something is worthwhile to stop the average user - but thats as far as protective measures will go. If someone wants to steal software and willing to put in the time and effort to do so they will be able to get it - no matter how good it is.
