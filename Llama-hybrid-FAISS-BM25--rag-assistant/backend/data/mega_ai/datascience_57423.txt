Inputting Data for Machine Learning in PyTorch

I have scoured the internet and documentation, but have not yet been able to find a simple explanation of how to load data and/or simply type data into pytorch. I am just learning this library, and I believe being able to put in my own custom data would make learning much more accessible. For example, instead of the example I find everywhere, in which dataloader loads an MNIST dataset, how can I get data working with the rest of my pytorch file in a much simpler way? INPUTS OUTPUTS data = [[[1,1,0], [1,1]], [[1,1,1], [1,0]], [[1,0,0], [0,0]], ... [[0,0,0], [0,1]]] Where there are 3 inputs in the input layer, and 2 outputs at the output layer. This example shows 4 distinct examples of training data. I'd even be happy for a straightforward way to load in a CSV. All i really need, at the end of the day, is a little help understanding what a dataset in pytorch looks like, and how I can create and edit them to aid in my attempts at learning more about this library. Thank you very much for any help you might offer.
