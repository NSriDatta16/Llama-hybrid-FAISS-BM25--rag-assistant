If some attacker gets to alter in some way the client application, it could use the valid user certification to access the server. The server should verify the client app, not for server sake (we assume the server checks if client can do this or that operation, but for ensuring the client is not being phished by a bogus client). Then the server can proclaim that all operations made by client-1 we're made through some verified client-app (agent) so they were really intended by the user.
