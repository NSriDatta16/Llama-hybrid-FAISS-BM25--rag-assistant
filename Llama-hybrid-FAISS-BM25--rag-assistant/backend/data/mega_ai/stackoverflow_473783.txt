I think there are a combination of effects here: Firstly, running the same function within the test harness multiple times, with the same data each time, will likely improve because: JIT compilation will optimise the code that is run most frequently to improve performance (as mentioned already by Cory Foy) The program code will be in the disk cache (as mentioned already by Crashwork) Some program code will be in the CPU cache if it is small enough and executed frequently enough If the data is different for each run of the function within the test harness, this could explain why closing and running the test harness again improves results: the data will now also be in the disk cache, where it wasn't the first time. And finally, yes, even if two 'drives' are on the same physical disk, they will have different performance: data can be read faster from the outside of the disk platter than the inside. If they are different physical disks, then the performance difference would seem quite likely. Also, one disk may be more fragmented than the other, causing longer seek times and slower data transfer rates.
