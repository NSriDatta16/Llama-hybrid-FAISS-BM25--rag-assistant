Indesign scripting create deeper structures by adding tags

I first set out to do this with XSLT, then with PHP. Now i'll have to have a go at it with Indesign scripting (javascript probably) My problem is that i have an indesign file without structure (nothing is tagged, but everything has a paragraph style) Wat i have to do is 1) ad tags to paragraphs based on their styles 2) deepen the structure by adding parent-elements to the tags An example: This text: Titel 1 (style = title1) Titel 2 (style = title2) some text (style = text1) listitem 1 (style = listitem) listitem 2 (style = listitem) Has to become (on export to XML) Titel 1 Titel 2 some text listitem 1 listitem 2 Any help is appreciated! a code-example that does this would be marvelous but a push in the right direction is also very welcome. I would be very pleased already when i could change this: Titel 1 to this Titel 1
