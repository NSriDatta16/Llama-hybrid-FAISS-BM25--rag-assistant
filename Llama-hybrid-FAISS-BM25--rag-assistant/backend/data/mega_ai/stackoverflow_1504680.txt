We use to OOXML methods. We were first writing our own method to do it in PL/SQL but a coworker found this product called Excellant. It it is you pass in a xml spec with column mappings and styles/formulas (almost any excel formula works), the query and it gives you a clob back. So you can then run gzip on the clob if you want to make it smaller. The product is pretty cheep my manager bought it with a pcard. The web site is www.peak42solutions.com. We couldn't use ODBC since the network folks don't allow access directly to the database. And we are now emailing invoicing in excel to customers. Thanks, Bill
