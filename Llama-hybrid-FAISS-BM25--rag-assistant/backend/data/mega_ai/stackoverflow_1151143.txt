If you've got whole nav stack in the nib, it's actually pretty easy; you can just drag it into the title area and IB does the right thing automatically. Otherwise, you can just add the segmented control to the nib (not necessarily a subview) and then add an @property IBOutlet to it from your view controller. Then in viewDidLoad, assign it to the titleView as normal. Remember to release in dealloc, and you're golden.
