PCA scores in my own implementation have different sign from the ones computed in R

I am trying to implement PCA (NIPALS method) using Excel. The problem is that my results are not exactly matching with the results of R. There is only a difference in sign: if my scores are positive, then scores using R are negative. I don't know what is going on. What to do?
