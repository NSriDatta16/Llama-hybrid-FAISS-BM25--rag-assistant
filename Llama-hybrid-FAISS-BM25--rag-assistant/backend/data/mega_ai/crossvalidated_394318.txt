How to use the UCR Matrix Profile Algorithm for Motif Mining in R

I am seeking to understand how to use the mstomp_par (Multivariate STOMP algorithm Parallel version) to detect multivariate time series motifs. As of now, I see that this algorithm provides the matrix profile and profile index. I would like to know how to use this information to isolate motifs from data.
