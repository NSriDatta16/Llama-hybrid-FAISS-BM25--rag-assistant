Most appropriate tests for two data set comparisons in R

So I have two datasets from two different groups (blackbirds and song thrushes), with the same 4 variables (Foraging, Singing, Alarm, Aggressive). I've been struggling to find a good way to compare the data in these different sets, the sampling that was conducted is called scan sampling, so it's just a recording of observations of behaviour an individual is performing. What would be an appropriate way to compare these two sets with the hypothesis that both species share similar time budgets? Rows account for the number of observations in total over a period of 10 mins so there isn't really a sample size for this. Blackbirds blackbirds Song thrushes song_thrushes I've read about one-way ANOVA tests and Pearson correlations, but I'm not sure how to compare the proportions between the blackbirds and song thrushes. I'm really new to R so forgive me for being so lost.
