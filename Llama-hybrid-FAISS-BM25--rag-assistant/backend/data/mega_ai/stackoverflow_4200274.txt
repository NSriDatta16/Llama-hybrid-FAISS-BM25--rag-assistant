Just Can't get Entity Framework to pull what I want

Ok, I am not having much luck with this. I am new to Entity Framework, and have been fighting with this one little thing since yesterday. Here are my tables: Clients (id, clientname) Projects (id, projectname, clientid) Tasks (id, taskname, projectid, statusid) TaskStatuses (id, statusname) In code I am only working with one project at a time, and here is how I load that project with EF: thisProject = (from p in dataEntity.projects where p.id == projectID select p).FirstOrDefault(); Then later when I load the tasks: thisProject.Tasks.Load(); Then I set the datasource of a DevExpress XtraGrid to the loaded Tasks: taskGridControl.DataSource = thisProject.Tasks; Up until this point everything works as expected, and the grid shows all of the tasks for the project I have loaded. But, I also want to show the Task statusname field, and that is stored in a different table. This was very easy with a sql join, but for the life of me I cannot figure this out.
