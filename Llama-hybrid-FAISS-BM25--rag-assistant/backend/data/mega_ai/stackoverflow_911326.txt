SQL Select Statement For Calculating A Running Average Column

I am trying to have a running average column in the SELECT statement based on a column from the n previous rows in the same SELECT statement. The average I need is based on the n previous rows in the resultset. Let me explain Id Number Average 1 1 NULL 2 3 NULL 3 2 NULL 4 4 2 The first 3 rows of the Average column are null because there are no previous rows. The row 4 in the Average column shows the average of the Number column from the previous 3 rows. I need some help trying to construct a SQL Select statement that will do this.
