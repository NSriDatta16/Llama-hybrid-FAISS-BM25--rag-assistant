Software Bandwidth/Database Growth Formulas

Are there any industry standard formulas or rules of thumb for determining: Application bandwidth usage/requirements Database growth requirements I have recently started managing a new .NET 3.5/SQL Server project and would like to take a more structured approach than previously when determining exactly what my application needs in terms of storage and bandwidth. If anyone out there has any pointers I would greatly appreciate it!
