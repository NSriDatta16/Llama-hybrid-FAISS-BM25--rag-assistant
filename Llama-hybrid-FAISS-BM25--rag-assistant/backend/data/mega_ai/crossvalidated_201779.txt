Decomposition of average squared bias (in Elements of Statistical Learning)

I can't figure out how formula 7.14 on page 224 of The Elements of Statistical Learning is derived. Can anyone help me figure it out? $$\textrm{Average squared bias} = \textrm{Average}[\textrm{model bias}]^2 + \textrm{Average}[\textrm{estimation bias}]^2$$
