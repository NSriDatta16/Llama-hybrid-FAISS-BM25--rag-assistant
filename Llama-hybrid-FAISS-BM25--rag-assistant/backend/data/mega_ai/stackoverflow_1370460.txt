ITextSharp is smart enough to do this; just do it like this: Document document = new Document(PageSize.LETTER); PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, new FileStream(pdfName, FileMode.Create)); document.Open(); document.Add(new Paragraph(report)); document.Close(); Where pdfName is the name of the pdf you want to save, and report is a string containing the text you want to print. It will automatically apply line and page breaks. I think the default is to use a monospaced font, but if you have trouble with that, let me know and I will add an example of setting the font.
