Calculating goodness-of-fit for circular data?

What is the proper way to report the goodness-of-fit for circular data estimates? Is there an equivalent to $R^2$ that can be used. The toolbox I have can calculate the correlation between two sets of circular variables, but I don't believe that $R^2$ is simply the square of that value. If I have a target variable, x, and $\hat{x}$ is it appropriate to calculate it in a way similar to linear variables. $R^2$ = $1-mse(x,\hat{x})/var(x)$. EDIT: Just to provide a little bit more context, I have series of angles, $\theta$ that I'm trying to predict, and a set of inputs, $Y$ that are used to make that prediction. I have built a (neural network) model to make predictions, $\hat\theta = f(Y)$, and am trying to evaluate how good the model is in making those predictions.
