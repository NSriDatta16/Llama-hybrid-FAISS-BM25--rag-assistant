Not quite sure why you're re-organising the existing string, as... echo $timestamp = strtotime('Sat Mar 24 23:59:59 GMT 2012'); ...works correctly. (It returns 1332633599, which you can check via date('r', 1332633599); (This will result in "Sat, 24 Mar 2012 23:59:59 +0000", so all is well.) That said, if you're going to extract all of the components of the string, you might as well use mktime . For example: function texttotime($texttime) { if(!$texttime || $texttime=="") return NULL; list($junk, $month, $day, $time, $timezone, $year) = explode(' ', $texttime); list($hour, $minute, $second) = explode(':', $time); return mktime($hour, $minute, $second, $month, $day, $year); }
