You are missing something - it is completely legal code, and in fact such code is one of the commonest and best uses of the conditional operator. It's always a mistake to think that the compiler must internally do things in the same order that the code is layed out on the page - it is perfectly at liberty to evaluate the conditional operator (which is justv another expression) and then use the result to perform the initialisation. As for a goto, there is no way of using one in an initialisation. And if an exception is thrown, the reference is deemed never to have been created in the first place.
