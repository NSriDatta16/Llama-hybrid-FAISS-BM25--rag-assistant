If you want to convert your audio files (I'm assuming .wav since it's a pretty common format pre-format conversion) to mp3 LAME is a solid encoder. A full blown LAMP stack is highly unnecessary for using LAME, a simple shell script will suffice. This will convert all *.wav files in the current directory to .mp3 files if they do not have a converted copy already in-place (LAME doesn't care about clobbering output files). #!/bin/bash for file in *.wav; do dest="${file%wav}mp3" if [[ -e "$file" ]] && [[ ! -e "$dest" ]]; then lame "$file" "$dest" fi done You will want to look through man lame for the conversion options specific to your VBR/CBR/ABR (variable, constant and average bitrate) needs.
