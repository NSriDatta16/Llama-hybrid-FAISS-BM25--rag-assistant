Predicting time series data with non-time data

I have 3 numeric variables $x$, $y$, and $z$. Specifically $x$ , $y$ are tachometer readings. I am given $x$ and $y$ and I need to predict $z$ (the velocity of a vehicle). I have built a model that uses standard methods (random forest) and this achieves a decent ($80\%$) accuracy. It achieves this despite the dependence of my $z$ values. However I have since discovered that there is a function $f$ $st$ $f(z_{t-1}) = z_{t} $ which has a $85\%$ accuracy (higher than my model at current). So is there a way I can use this function to improve the accuracy of my classifier. Baring in mind the fact that I never actually gather a value for velocity, I can only ever predict it. I thought that maybe using lagged variable might work, but since $f$ in decidedly non-linear I am not sure if the model would be able to cope, and it seems slightly lacking in elegance. My next thought would be to add a feature of $f(x)$ or $f(y)$ but again since $f$ is non linear this may not work. My last idea would be to use something like the Kalman filter to join both the prediction based on $(x_{t}$,$y_{t})$ and the prediction based on $z_{t-1}$ but I feel this may lead to error propagation. So my questions are: Does what I am doing have an actual name (i.e what could I type into google to get either papers or other questions about this topic)? Would any of these approaches work? Does anyone have any better ideas?
