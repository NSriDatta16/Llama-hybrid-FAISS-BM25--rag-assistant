I think the key is that most Recurrent Neural Networks problems are formulated in terms of either a regression (with low values indicating negative sentiment, and high values positive) or a binary classification (is this text positive?). What you seem to be interested in is a much more nuanced definition of sentiment. This doesn't present any inherent problem, as the same algorithms might well work to predict more complex sentiments. The issue is simply labeled data. Because this kind of classification is difficult even for humans, it isn't easy to reliably gather data on, say, how stressed a writer is. However if you're interested in assembling a dataset of that nature, you'd be able to apply the same methods ( Recurrent Neural Networks are a popular option) to do the classification. Many researchers in the field use Amazon Mechanical Turk or something similar to gather labeled data at a reasonable cost.
