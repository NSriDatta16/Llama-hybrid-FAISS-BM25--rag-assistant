I agree with @Justin Swartsel. There was no error involved, so this is largely an academic matter. Linq-to-SQL endeavors to generate SQL that runs efficiently (which it did in your case). But it does not make any effort to generate conventional SQL that a human would likely create. The Linq-to-SQL implementers likely used the builder pattern to generate the SQL. If so, it would be easier to append a substring (or a subquery in this case) than it would be to backtrack and insert a 'TOP x' fragment into the SELECT clause.
