Tough one. I guess you should try find a scope for a swf context. As you said, swfs can be: ads,games, video players, they can also contain experimental art. who knows. Once you know what exactly your after, it should be easier to figure out how to look for that kind of data. I think it would be easier to get started with commercial websites. Those need promotion, so if they might promotional ria's setup with a little bit of SEO in mind so look for things like swfobject, swfaddress and tracking stuff ( omniture and who knows what else ). They should have keywords in the embedding html. Google and Yahoo are working with Adobe as far as I know to make SWFs indexable. There is something mentioned about a custom FlashPlayer used for Flash indexing in the Flash Internals presentation from Adobe MAX . Hope it helps.
