Two examples: All of functional analysis, which I guess you will know underlies a lot of machine learning, relies on measure theory. There is no "undergraduate" probability measure that describes a distribution over function spaces, as far as I'm aware. Statistical analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems - there is generically at least one starting condition for a dynamical system such that the infinite-time evolution of the system lies on a set of measure zero in state space. Statistical analysis of such systems can go badly wrong without rigorous measure theory.
