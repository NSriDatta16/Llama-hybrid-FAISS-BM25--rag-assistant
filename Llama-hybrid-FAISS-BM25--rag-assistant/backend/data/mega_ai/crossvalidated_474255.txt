There is an R package called trafo that may give some ideas. I have not used it but it tests model assumptions using residuals (see @dave comment). The dependent variable and group two look candidates for preprocessing by taking logarithms. The Q-Q plot is not bad as far as these things go. The heteroscedasity in the residuals can be tested for using the Breuschâ€“Pagan test.
