Calculating the accuracy of a machine learning system in runtime

I have a question in mind about machine learning systems. Say, I have a named entity extraction systems which give me an accuracy of 90%(precision 90, and recall 90) during training and testing. How can I assure that the same system will perform with 90% precision and recall in runtime? In the case of a completely new data set of the same kind. How are these statistical tests significant?
