Shell scripts are excellent for concise filesystem operations and scripting the combination of existing functionality in filters and command line tools via pipes. When your needs are greater - whether in functionality, robustness, performance, efficiency etc - then you can move to a more full-featured language. They tend to offer some combination of: type safety more advanced containers better control over variable lifetimes and memory usage threading advanced IPC like shared memory and TCP/IP full binary I/O capabilities, memory mapped file access etc. access to OS APIs and myriad powerful libraries better readability and maintainability as the project size increases support for more advanced programming paradigms: Object Orientation, Functional Programming, Generative Programming etc. better error-checking before your program starts running, hence less dependent on test case coverage
