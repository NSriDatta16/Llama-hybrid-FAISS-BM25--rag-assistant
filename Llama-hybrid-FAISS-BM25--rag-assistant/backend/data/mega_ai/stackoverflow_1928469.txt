Selectively disable specified referenced javascript files on Firefox

Is there any way to selectively disable specified javascript files on Firefox/Firebug? Perhaps using another add-on? I'm facing drag/drop conflicts between several static javascript files and I want to disable them one by one until finding the conflicting one.
