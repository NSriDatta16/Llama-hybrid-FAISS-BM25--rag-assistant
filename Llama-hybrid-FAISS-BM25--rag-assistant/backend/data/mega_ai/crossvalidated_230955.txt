Forecasting with ARIMA and GARCH: does my plan look alright?

I have a time series containing the daily close price for a stock and I would like to perform a 10 days forecast of the volatility. I'm trying to follow this tutorial: https://talksonmarkets.files.wordpress.com/2012/09/time-series-analysis-with-arima-e28093-arch013.pdf This is my data and its autocorrelation: > closing_price$CloseDayPriceA [1] 0.0610 0.0605 0.0590 0.0575 0.0590 0.0585 0.0610 0.0590 0.0615 0.0610 0.0625 [12] 0.0605 0.0600 0.0650 0.0650 0.0710 0.0740 0.0730 0.0765 0.0770 0.0755 0.0765 [23] 0.0760 0.0775 0.0850 0.0955 0.0975 0.1155 0.1365 0.1200 0.1270 0.1230 0.1210 [34] 0.1040 0.1155 0.1355 0.1315 0.1310 0.1265 0.1250 0.1230 0.1245 0.1240 0.1235 [45] 0.1225 0.1185 0.1110 0.1130 0.1170 0.1150 0.1120 0.1135 0.1135 0.1085 0.1100 [56] 0.1090 0.1075 0.1050 0.1030 0.0960 0.0955 0.0970 0.0960 0.0915 0.0910 > a = acf(closing_price$CloseDayPriceA) > a Autocorrelations of series ‘closing_price$CloseDayPriceA’, by lag 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 1.000 0.955 0.908 0.864 0.813 0.759 0.714 0.680 0.625 0.570 0.511 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 0.446 0.381 0.314 0.242 0.170 0.106 0.048 -0.017 > The data is clearly not stationary. I can make it stationary by differencing: diff_price = diff(closing_price$CloseDayPriceA) or alternatively by fitting an AR(1) model and taking the residuals: arimaA = arima(closing_price$CloseDayPriceA, order = c(1, 0, 0)) Now the squared residuals are still autocorrelated as shown by their ACF. For this reason I apply a GARCH model: library(fGarch) garchA=garchFit(formula = ~garch(2, 1), data = arimaA$residuals, trace = F) acf(residuals(garchA)) My questions are: Does the procedure that I am following make sense? How can I make a 10 days forecast and compute the 10 days volatility? EDIT: This should be the code: A = closing_price$CloseDayPriceA A.log = log(A) log_rtn = diff(A.log) A.garch = garchFit(formula = ~garch(1, 1), data = log_rtn, trace = F) A.est = predict(A.garch, 30, plot=T)
