correct use of classes?

I am college student (computer science) and have just started a C# programming class. For our assignments I have been using a class called "Display" where I put any console output that could be used several times throughout a project. For example, a request to continue or exit program. Instead of typing it out several times in Main() I just call the method from the Display class. Another student in a higher level class has told me that I should not do this. That it is poor coding practice and that I should just include all methods within the primary class (containing Main() ) and only use other class when absolutely needed. I am just looking for some input and advice. I was asked to include code. I was going to originally, but didn't want to make this post too long. I have chosen one assignment that is fairly short. I want to clarify that I am just learning so the code is not as elegant as many of you can write. Constructive criticism is very much welcome. Ultimately I am just playing with the use of classes. I know that some of the methods in the Display class could just as easily be in Main(). This is the Program class that contains Main() namespace Chapter_6_10 { class Program { static void Main() { string triangle = "", result = " ";; char printingCharacter = ' '; int peakNumber = 0; Display.Instructions(); Display.Continue(); // perform a do... while loop to build triangle up to peak do { Console.Clear(); Request.UserInput(out printingCharacter, out peakNumber); int counter = 1, rowCounter = 0; do { do { triangle += printingCharacter; rowCounter++; } while (rowCounter This is the Display class namespace Chapter_6_10 { // This class displays various outputs required by program class Display { // This method display the instructions for the user public static void Instructions() { Console.WriteLine("\nThis program will ask you to enter a character to be used " + " to create triangle." + "\nThen you will be asked to enter a number that will represent the" + "\ntriangles peak." + "\nAfter your values have been received a triangle will be drawn."); } // This method displays the choice to continue public static void Continue() { Console.WriteLine("\n\nPress the enter key when you are ready to continue..."); Console.ReadLine(); } // This method displays an error message public static void Error(string ErrorType) { Console.WriteLine("\nYou have entered \"{0}\", which is a value that is not valid!" + "\nThis is not rocket science." + "\n\nTry agian...", ErrorType); } // This method will ask user to press enter to do again or 'q' to quit public static void DoAgain(out string Result) { string input = " "; Console.WriteLine("\nPress enter to run program again" + "\nor type the letter 'q' to close the application."); input = Console.ReadLine(); // convert input to lowercase so that only one test needed Result = input.ToLower(); } } This is the Request class namespace Chapter_6_10 { // This class is used to get user input class Request { public static void UserInput(out char PrintingCharacter, out int PeakNumber) { string input = " "; char testCharacter = ' '; int testNumber = 0; // a do... while loop to get Printing Character from user // use TryParse() to test for correct input format do { Console.Write("\nPlease enter a character to be used to build triangle : "); input = Console.ReadLine(); bool result = char.TryParse(input, out testCharacter); if (result) { } else { Console.Clear(); Display.Error(input); input = " "; } } while (input == " "); // a do... while loop to get number from user // use TryParse() to test for correct input format do { Console.Write("\nPlease enter a number for the peak of the triangle : "); input = Console.ReadLine(); bool result = int.TryParse(input, out testNumber); if (result) { if ((testNumber > 0) && (testNumber That is it. Would this be considered an inefficeint way to code? How can I improve it? Thanks for all the input so far. It is very valuable to me.
