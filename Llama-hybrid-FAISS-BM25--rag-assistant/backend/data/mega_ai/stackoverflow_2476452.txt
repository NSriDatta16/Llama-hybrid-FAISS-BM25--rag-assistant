I am using git on a fairly large c#/.net project (68 projects in 1 solution) and the TFS footprint of a fresh fetch of the full tree is ~500Mb. The git repo, storing a fair amount of commits locally weighs in at ~800Mb. The compaction and the way that storage works internally in git is excellent. It is amazing to see so many changes packed in to such a small amount of space.
