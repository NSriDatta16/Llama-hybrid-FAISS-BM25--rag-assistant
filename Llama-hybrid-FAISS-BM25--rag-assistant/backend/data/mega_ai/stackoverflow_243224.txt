Using Interface Builder, you can just drag these (UILabels and UIImageViews) onto your view. If you're using a UITableViewController, you might want to switch to a standard UIViewController, to give you more control over what goes into the view. After you've dragged them on, hook them up via outlets (if you want to programatically change/access them) or set their contents in IB and be done with it.
