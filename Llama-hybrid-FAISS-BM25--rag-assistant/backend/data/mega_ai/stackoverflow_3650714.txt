SELECT column_1, column_2, column_3, /* ...the list of columns 4-97, not shown in this example... */, column_98, column_99 FROM table There is no easier way to do this (possibly by design): you need to specifically list each of the columns you want to retrieve. Although it's a hassle to write, this is actually a Good Thing: using SELECT * in production code is discouraged (both for performance and maintainability reasons) - see e.g. this question .
