The correct permissions are 2775 , setting the set gid bit too. This causes new files and directories to inherit the parent's permissions, owner and group. Be aware though, that the standard unix permissions do not allow you to restrict access to the directory to the storage group after chgrp ing it to storageAdmin . Everyone has access now according to the other permission set. Use Posix ACLs or SE Linux if you really need more fine grained access controls.
