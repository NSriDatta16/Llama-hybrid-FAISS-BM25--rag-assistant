I also encourage you to take a look at JMX. You can turn off authentication for JMX in which case make sure the JMX port is not reachable from the internet (filter the port on your host based firewall, or bind it only to a local ip address). JMX was intended to standardize remote monitoring and control of applications, containers in a Java EE world, so it more or less provides the infrastructure you're looking for. Or alternatively use another web container (preferably an embedded one) and handle even container restarts from your java code.
