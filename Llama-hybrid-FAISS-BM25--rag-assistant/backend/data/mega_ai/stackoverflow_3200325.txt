You do actually have .cs and .vb files in your secondary application, however they have already been compiled into a .dll. Each controller file, model, partial class, repository, etc. are .cs or .vb files. To answer your question regarding why you have to do extra work, .NET by default looks in the bin folder for assemblies to include when it builds an application for runtime (and some other places on the server itself, but that is not relevant to your question). If you want to include an assembly that is not in the bin folder, you have to tell it to a) register it using the fully qualified name and b) where the assembly is actually at. Take a look at this link from the other answer on the referenced post, especially the last few paragraphs about the assemblies section of the web.config. It may help to add some clarity to this (and my ramblings) for you.
