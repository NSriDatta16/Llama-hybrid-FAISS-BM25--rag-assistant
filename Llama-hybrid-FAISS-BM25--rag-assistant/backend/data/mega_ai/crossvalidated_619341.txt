Test hypothesis for one median, std or percentile using boostrap

I'm using Bootstrap for testing the mean by creating samples centered around H0 Private Sub Boostrap() Dim datanew() As Double N = UBound(Victor1) ReDim Preserve datanew(N) As Double For I = 1 To UBound(Victor1) datanew(I) = Victor1(I) - xlApp.Average(Victor1) + Val(H0.Text) Next I ' Perform bootstrap mean testing BootstrapMeanTesting datanew, Val(Iterations), Val(H0.Text) End Sub I want to perform the test for the median, std, and percentile. How do I create the Bootstrap distribution under H0?
