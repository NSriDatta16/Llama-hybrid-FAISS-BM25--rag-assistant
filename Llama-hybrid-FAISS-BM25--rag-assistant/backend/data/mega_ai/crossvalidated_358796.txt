Assumption tests to be run on each independent variable or on the entire model in a multiple linear regression?

Here are important assumptions that one has to check when performing a linear Assumption 1: Homoscedasticity of residuals or equal variance (with Breusch-Pagan test for example) Assumption 2: Normalcy of residuals (with Shapiro-Wilk test for example) Assumption 3: No autocorrelation of residuals (for time series with Durbin Watson test for example) Here is my question: When performing a multiple linear regression (with more than ond independent variable), should one do each of the above-mentioned test on the entire model or should one run each of the above-mentioned test for each individual independent variable with the dependent variable?
