Just an FYI, you can get access system tables (and sys stored procs too?) using LINQ. Here is how: Create a connection to the server you want. Right-click the server and choose Change View > Object Type. You should now see System Tables and User Tables. You should see sysjobs there, and you can easily drag it onto a .dbml surface. Above was stolen from this post.
