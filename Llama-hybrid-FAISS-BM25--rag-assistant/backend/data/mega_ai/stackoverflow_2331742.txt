How do I parse a string for a particular delimited section within PHP?

I have a string, for example "[{XYZ123}] This is a test" and need to parse out the content in between the [{ and }] and dump into another string. I assume a regular expression is in order to accomplish this but as it's not for the faint of heart, I did not attempt and need your assistance. What is the best way to pull the fragment in between the [{ and }]? Thanks in advance for your help!
