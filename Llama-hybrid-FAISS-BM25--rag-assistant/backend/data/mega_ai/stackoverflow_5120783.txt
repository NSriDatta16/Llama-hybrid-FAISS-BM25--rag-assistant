Layout issues, not sure what's causing the problem

The page in question is here: http://www.audio-agent.com/wordpress/clients . As you can see, the last post is indented instead of staying aligned to the left, as if there's an invisible post in the way. I've looked through with Firebug and can't seem to find anything taking up the space. The PHP used to generate this section of the page is as follows: "> ID, 'brand_img', true); ?>" /> Thanks for any help!
