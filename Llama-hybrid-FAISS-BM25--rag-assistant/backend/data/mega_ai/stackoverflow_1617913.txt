It has nothing to do with how much RAM is in your system. You are running out of virtual address space. For a 32 bit windows OS process, you get a 4GB virtual address space (irrespective of how much RAM you are using) out of 2GB for the user-mode (3GB in case of LARGEADDRESSAWARE) and 2 GB for kernel. When you do try to allocate memory using new, OS will try to find the contiguos block of virtual memory which is large enough to satisfy the memory allocation request. If your virtual address space is badly fragmented or you are asking for a huge block of memory then it will fail throwing a bad_alloc exception. Check how much virtual memory your process is using.
