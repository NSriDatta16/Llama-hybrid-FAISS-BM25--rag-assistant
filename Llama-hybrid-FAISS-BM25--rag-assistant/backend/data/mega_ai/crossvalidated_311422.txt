How do I handle correlated data points in classification problem where users generate multiple events?

If I have a data set containing multiple users' data with features $X$ and some class (let's assume binary for simplicity) that I want to classify, $Y$. A user can generate multiple "events" and $X$ as well as $Y$ might not be the same for each event. Each "event" is a discrete moment in time but surely each user's events are correlated by the mere virtue of being generated by the same person. How do I deal with this in building a machine learning classifier for $Y$? I have some ID to distinguish between users. If I ignore the ID and treat the data as independent I loose some information and also perhaps bias the classifier to work well on users for whom I have a lot of events. But if I keep only one event per user I loose a lot of information for cases where their behaviour could have been different with different (or the same) $Y$. Is there any literature on dealing with cases such as this or any best practices? Perhaps adding a feature to $X$ indicating if it is a first-time or current user or perhaps a running count on the number of events generated with that user for each data point? I'd also possibly want to stratify my train/validation/test set to not contain the same users or... be stratified over time so that the validation/test set is later in time than the train set.
