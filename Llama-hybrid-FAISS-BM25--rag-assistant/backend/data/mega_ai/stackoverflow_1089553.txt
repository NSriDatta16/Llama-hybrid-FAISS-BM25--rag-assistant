EAV Solutions/Packages/Vendors?

I was recently exposed to the concept of an Entity Attribute Value database model via. the Magento e-commerce system. Varien (the company behind Magento) has used a relational database (mysql) to create an EAV style model using PHP Objects. I'm curious if there are "native" EAV database solutions out there. The "featured recently on stack overflow CouchDB" seems like it might fit this model. Is that a correct assumption, or is CouchDB something else? Where else could I find EAV in the wild? Relational is to MySQL as EAV is to _______?
