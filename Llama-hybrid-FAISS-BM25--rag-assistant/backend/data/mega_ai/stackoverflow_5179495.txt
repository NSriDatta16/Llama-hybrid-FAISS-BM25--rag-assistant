Heavy mysql usage CPU or Memory

I have an Amazon s3 instance and the project we have on the server does a lot of INSERTs and UPDATEs and a few complex SELECTs We are finding that MySQL will quite often take up a lot of the CPU. I am trying to establish whether a higher memory or higher cpu is better of the above setup. Below is an output of cat /proc/meminfo MemTotal: 7347752 kB MemFree: 94408 kB Buffers: 71932 kB Cached: 2202544 kB SwapCached: 0 kB Active: 6483248 kB Inactive: 415888 kB SwapTotal: 0 kB SwapFree: 0 kB Dirty: 168264 kB Writeback: 0 kB AnonPages: 4617848 kB Mapped: 21212 kB Slab: 129444 kB SReclaimable: 86076 kB SUnreclaim: 43368 kB PageTables: 54104 kB NFS_Unstable: 0 kB Bounce: 0 kB CommitLimit: 3673876 kB Committed_AS: 5384852 kB VmallocTotal: 34359738367 kB VmallocUsed: 180 kB VmallocChunk: 34359738187 kB Current Setup: High-CPU Extra Large Instance 7 GB of memory 20 EC2 Compute Units (8 virtual cores with 2.5 EC2 Compute Units each) 1690 GB of instance storage 64-bit platform I/O Performance: High API name: c1.xlarge Possible Setup: High-Memory Double Extra Large Instance 34.2 GB of memory 13 EC2 Compute Units (4 virtual cores with 3.25 EC2 Compute Units each) 850 GB of instance storage 64-bit platform I/O Performance: High API name: m2.2xlarge
