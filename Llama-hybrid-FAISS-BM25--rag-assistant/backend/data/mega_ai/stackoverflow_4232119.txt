How can I implement a recommendation engine?

Please be patient with my writing, as my English is not proficient. As a programmer, I wanna learn about the algorithm, or the machine learning intelligence, that are implemented underneath recommendation systems or related-based systems. For instance, the most obvious example would be from Amazon. They have a really good recommendation system. They get to know: if you like this , you might also like that , or something else like: What percentage of people like this and that together. Of course I know Amazon is a big website and they invested a lot of brain and money into these systems. But, on the very basic core, how can we implement something like that within our database? How can we identify how one object relates to other? How can we build a statistic unit that handles this kind of thing? I'd appreciate if someone can point out some algorithms. Or, basically, point out some good direct references/ books that we can all learn from. Thank you all!
