Update: I guess that you can find the reasoning on the oldnewthing . It was probably added to restore some functionality (like drag and drop) that was removed from Windows Vista due to security reasons. Before Update: conhost seems to launch on any cmd.exe opening. It's probably some new, undocumented thing on windows 7.
