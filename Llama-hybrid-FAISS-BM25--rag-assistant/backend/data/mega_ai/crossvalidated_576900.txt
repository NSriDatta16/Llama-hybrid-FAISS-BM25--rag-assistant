There's a very simple reason, which also immediately suggests the work-around. A level-1 predictor, $x_{ij}$ can't be used in the level-2 equation because there are many different values of $x_{ij}$ for a single level-2 unit $j$ . You can't use, say, individual income as predictor in a model for neighbourhood crime levels, because there are lots of different individual incomes for each neighbourhood. What you can do is use a summary of the level-1 predictor. You could use average individual income or median individual income or median household income or income interquartile range or whatever else you want. As an additional note: it's possible to expand your class of mixed models from the multilevel representation to the Laird-Ware representation. This gets rid of the distinction between levels from the computational/expressive viewpoint. It doesn't get rid of the fact that there are many ways a set of level-1 variables can be summarised as a level-2 variable -- that's a real problem (or opportunity), not a computational one. You still have to decide.
