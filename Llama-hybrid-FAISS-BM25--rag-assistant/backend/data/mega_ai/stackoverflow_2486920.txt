I have been using Factor for a few months, and it is really an impressive language. It feels like a blend of Forth (obviously), Smalltalk (image-based, highly reflective, "integrated" IDE), and LISP (code-as-data, syntax-level abstractions, REPL).. and to some extent, languages such as Python or Ruby, with a strong emphasis on pragmatism and openess (eg. "batteries included"). Moreover the performance seems to be important for the designers, as a lot of work have been spent on the optimizing compiler, much like the SBCL implementation of Common Lisp. The project still suffers a bit from his youngness, with some frequent language changes, parts of the system underdocumented, and a relatively small community. But even at this stage, I think it feels mature enough to start some non trivial stuff.
