rotating an overlay view in iphone

I have an overlay view (Which has self-drawn shapes) that I display over an ImageView. I want the view to be movable, resizable, and rotatable. I could allow the user to move the overlay by dragging it from the middle, or resize it by dragging it from one of two sides (right or bottom). What I still could not do is to allow the user to rotate it by moving the left-top edge. myView.transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation(angle * M_PI / 180); But how can I calculate the angle based on user touches? Any ideas?
