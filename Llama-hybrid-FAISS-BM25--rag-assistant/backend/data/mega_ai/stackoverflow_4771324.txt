Embperl is still being maintained, although it is kinda quiet on the mailing list. Embperl might be an option for small sites. It is conceptually similar to PHP, but more powerful. Fast (due to lots of C bindings), still easy to install (preferably from command line), works best with mod_perl, but a CGI operating mode is also supported. Though, I haven't used all its advanced features (embedding xml-libs, configuring https, for instance), but it is great to use perl on the data-output side, when you have perl also on the data input side (data staging/scrubbing).
