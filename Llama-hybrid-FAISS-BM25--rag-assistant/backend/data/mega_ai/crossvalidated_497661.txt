Observed probabilities in logistic regression?

Calibration is important performance metric in predictive modeling. My question is about calibration plot in logistic regression. Observed values, say, in linear model are those which are actually observed for each unit. But how are " observed probabilities " in calibration plot obtained in logistic model where actual observed outcomes are binary? They are based on bootstrapping or cross-validation procedure as in calibrate in rms package when plotting calibration curve. But what is the actual procedure how these observed probabilities (y-axis below) are obtained? Image from: How to interpret the basics of a logistic regression calibration plot please?
