Taken from MSDN - 'symbol' : alignment of a member was sensitive to packing A structure member is aligned on a memory offset whose value is not a multiple of the member's size. For example, the following code snippet will produce this warning: // C4121.cpp // compile with: /W4 /c #pragma pack(2) // C4121 struct s { char a; int b; }; You could make one of the following changes to prevent this warning: Change pack(2) to pack(4) . Reverse the order of the structure members such that the int precedes the char . When data is not aligned on boundaries that are multiples of the data's size performance can degrade and if you port your code to a RISC machine it will not compile. You can specify the structure alignment with #pragma pack or /Zp. Note that the compiler does not generate this warning when /Zp1 is specified.
