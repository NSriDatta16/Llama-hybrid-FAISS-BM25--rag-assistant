I am not sure why you used a t-test at all, descriptive statistics would suffice for your hypothesis and you could lump all 50 results together, as the difference between averages of 357 and 358 is experimentally irrelevant for your sample sizes, and in any case is piffling. If, for example, you used Graphpad free quickcalcs , you would get a 95% confidence interval of 343 to 371, for a sample size of 50 and a conjectural and probably grossly excessive standard deviation of 50. This shows that your ants eat significantly (though probably not substantially relevantly) more that 20 times their own weight on average. If you really wanted to compare this using a t-test against an hypothetical average of 20 times their own weight, then you could use the one sample t-test that they provide, but I don't think that was really the point of your experiment. To be sure that these tests are appropriate, you should also check that the distributions are normal, which considering the nature of your experiment, I would imagine that they almost certainly are. In addition to the suggestions made by others, I would also want to be sure that the ants didn't leave any excreta on their uneaten foods.
