The template might simplify things from a coding perspective, but it's costing you a lot. First, there's the search-and-replace operation to insert the values for each object. Then there's the overhead of discarding and creating an increasingly long collection of string objects with the += operator. Finally, the innerHTML string needs to be parsed into a DOM document fragment before it can be inserted into the table. Even though the code may be a lot more verbose, creating and appending TR nodes directly from the evaluated JSON objects using DOM methods is going to be a heck of a lot faster and if you create the table in a scrollable region, most of the rendering will be hidden from the user (and, if you wish, can be done on demand in response to the user's scrolling -- the hard part if you go that route is guesstimating the rendered height of the entire table so you can position the scroll thumb appropriately despite there being an incomplete table).
