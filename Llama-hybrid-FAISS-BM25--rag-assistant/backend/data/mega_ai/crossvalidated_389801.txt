I'm going to make some assumptions about your notation; namely, that it's standard notation for the Rubin potential outcomes framework [1]. To make this clear, I'm going to assume that $D$ is some binary treatment variable, where $D = 1$ indicates receiving the treatment and $D = 0$ indicates receiving the control. $y_i$ is the observed outcome for individual $i$ , $y_{i1}$ is the outcome they would have had if they received the treatment, and $y_{i0}$ is the outcome they would have had if they received the control. The expression $\mathbb{E}[y_{i0} | D = 1]$ is the expected outcome among individuals who actually received the treatment, had they instead been given the control. You can calculate this in your example by taking the average $y_{i0}$ among people with treatment status $D = 1$ . The expression $\mathbb{E}[y_{i0} | D = 0]$ has a similar interpretation, and you can calculate it by the average $y_{i0}$ among people with treatment status $D = 0$ . Then you simply take the difference. The reason this is being called "selection bias" is because, if the difference $\mathbb{E}[y_{i0} | D = 1] - \mathbb{E}[y_{i0} | D = 0]$ is non-zero, then people who receive the treatment differ systematically from those who didn't. This is going to invalidate the so-called "ignorability" assumption. [1] Imbens, G., & Rubin, D. (2015). Causal Inference for Statistics, Social, and Biomedical Sciences: An Introduction.
