Portable way to detect heap fragmentation in c++ at runtime?

I'm writing a qt-based c++ application and i need to be able to detect memory fragmentation in order to check if the current system can actually sustain the memory load: the program load a big image (15/21 megapixels are the norm) in memory and then perform some filtering on it (w/ sparse matrices). For instance, i'm having memory fragmentation problem in Windows and VMMap has been very helpful in this: the problem was some DLLs (Wacom tablet "wintab32.dll" and the UltraMon app) doesn't get relocated so are splitting the address space at the 0x10000000-0x30000000 VA of the process. I want to provide the application with some sort of awareness toward the fragmentation problem and wondering if a cross-platform (linux/mac/win32) approach giving the information VMMAP gives already exist.
