How to set the genre of iPad application at development level

Possible Duplicate: Genre of application in iTunes Hi I want to set a specific category or genre like "Productivity" of my iPad Application at development level. I added the iTunesMetadata.plist in the project folder and set the genre key as "Productivity" But it does not work for me... When I drags the app into iTunes, it shows "Unknown Genre". Can anyone suggest how can I set the genre of my app ? Thanks in advance.
