What could lead to this misbehavior for the expected sample size (ESS)?

I am using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) to sample the posterior of a continuous-time Markov Chain (CTMC). However, after running 10 parallel chains with 100 draws each, the effective sample size (ESS) rises in a certain pattern, way beyond the actual sample size (which should be 10 * 100 = 1000 samples). Has anyone seen this pattern before? What could be the cause of this misbehavior? To calculate the ESS I am using the ess() function from the Arviz Python package with the parameters left to default (i.e. method="bulk" ). The trace plot of one of the chains for this parameter looks like this: I figured the oscillations come from the convexity of my target distribution and the fact that I am using HMC to sample it.
