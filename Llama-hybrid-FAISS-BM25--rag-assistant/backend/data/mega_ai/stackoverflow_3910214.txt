This is an old post, but here is the answer for anyone else who is looking, since incredibly the java docs do not state the units returned by the method. The distance returned is in central angle degrees. You can then use any number of formulas to convert to your required unit of measure. The simplest is to convert to radians. 1 radian = 180 degrees divided by pi (rad=180deg/pi). From there, you can multiply radians by the average radius of the earth in your choice of units (6371 km for instance) to get distance between two points. More accurate methods are also available, but you can look them up on the net.
