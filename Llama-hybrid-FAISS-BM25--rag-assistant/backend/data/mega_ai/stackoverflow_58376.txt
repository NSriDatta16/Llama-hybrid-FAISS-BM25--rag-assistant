I would say try and go OO just because what you have can be reused much easier than procedural if done right I will also say that OO is much more organized then procedural. When your at a small scale it's easy to get away with sloppy code OO or not. But when you get to larger projects your procedural must be much more organized and thought out. Where as on some larger projects OO tends to force you to be more organized making things a little easier.
