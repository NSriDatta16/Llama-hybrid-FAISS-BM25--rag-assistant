Relationships between health conditions - Spearman's correlation?

I am examining the relationships between health issues in pigs. I want to know which conditions tend to co-occur. All animals have at least one condition and 5 at most. I have coded each condition in SPSS as 0 = absent, 1 = present. How should I examine the relationships between these? I have tried a Spearman's correlation but something is not right, maybe I have organised the data in the wrong way. This is an example of how I have organised the data: Pig ID Tail lesions Lameness Bursitis 1 1 0 0 2 0 1 0 3 0 0 1 When I am looking at the output in SPSS I can't tell if/how these conditions are related to each other when I carry out a Spearman's correlation.
