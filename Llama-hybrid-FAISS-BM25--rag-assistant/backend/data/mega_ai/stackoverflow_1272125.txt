Using jQuery.UI CSS Framework for DIV Styling

a Project I am currently working on uses the jQuery UI framework for some of its widgets. To provide the user with a global look and feel I would like to use the framework also for its css stuff. I am implementing at the moment a dashboard like homepage, where the user can see an overall status of its data. This dashboard is build of some divs that should be aligned into a grid layout. I try to style the divs like follows Box Header Content of the Box Later I would like to implement some draggable-and-sortable functionality. The Problem I am facing right now is that the boxes aren't properly aligned. Does anyone has a hint on using jQuery.UI for that kind of css work? I was studing the CSS framework documentation on jqueryui.com but there aren't that much information. best regards, Gordon
