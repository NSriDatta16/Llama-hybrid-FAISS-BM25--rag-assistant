Emma doesn't provide code coverage across projects

I was wondering if any of you EMMA users have encountered this issue. Basically I have multiple projects each with different build.xml ANT scripts that are all called from one main ANT script individually. The code is covered appropriately but when a JUnit method calls another method in a different project, that external method call is not covered by EMMA. Has anyone encountered this issue? Can anyone spare any advice? Thanks
