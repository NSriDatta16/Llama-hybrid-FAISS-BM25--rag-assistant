Here's my opinion & experience, for what its worth. We have been using ActiveMQ in production for almost 2 years. We did have a couple of issues with ActiveMQ 5.1 that we had work arounds for, but since ActiveMQ 5.3 (we are using SNAPSHOT from July) we have not had any issues and have been happy. Our system pushes an average of 60 msgs/sec through the system with peak volumes > 700 msgs/sec. We run a single active/passive broker pair with persistence journaling via NFS mount to a dedicated NAS device. --Steven
