Not knowing which physical process is working in the background. I would suggest to use two functions which cover different areas of the data. My python skills are not sufficient to solve this task nicely, but maybe this is a beginning. I fittet your proposed function to two sections of the data. But (1) I do not know how to blend the functions nicely and (2) if it would be possible to plug this approach in the optimiser as well. However, maybe another problem is the distribution of data points. Since you have a lot more data points for the low throttle area the fitting algorithm might weigh this area more (how does python fitting work?). To prevent this I sliced the data up into 15 slices average those and than fit through 15 data points. Averaging the slices and tweaking the model (by scaling and moving the data, be aware that most of the functions look very nice in the range from 0 to 1, but real data usually lives somewhere else.) p1 * np.log( (x-p3)/p4 ) + p2 I end up with: The green dots are the slice-averages. The parameters are: [18.26324409 -34.75603362 15.80303842 0.10152119]
