How to identify document in SharePoint

You can put your documents in SP - cool, but, when its time to reorganize folders structure what I should do with old links? Is there a way how to identify document instead of using URL where path to the document is used? I need something like permanent link: http://mysharepoint/doc-123 , where 123 is the document identifier. I need URL to the document which doesn't depend on folders where the document is published. Are there solutions?
