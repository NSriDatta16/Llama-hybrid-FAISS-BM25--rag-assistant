Deploying to remote server using msbuild in teamcity

OK, I've searched for a few days now and still haven't found what i would deem to be an elegant solution to this problem. Here's what I want to happen. I want TeamCity to Build my code Then test it Then deploy it to a remote server. The first 2 are easy, but nobody seems to have a nice option for deploying. I have set up the server with web deploy support (was it previously known as msdeploy?) and from my local machine i can publish it to the remote server. I would ideally like teamcity to be able to allow for the web site to be published remotely after successfully building and testing. Please tell me somebody has a solution to the problem! I am glad it's almost friday as i am close to tears and need alcohol to help me. Thanks in advance.
