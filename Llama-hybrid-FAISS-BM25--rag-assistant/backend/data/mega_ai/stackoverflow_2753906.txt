Neural Networks test cases

Does increasing the number of test cases training data in case of Precision Neural Networks may led to problems (like over-fitting for example)..? Does it always good to increase test cases training data number? Will that always lead to conversion ? If no, what are these cases.. an example would be better.. Thanks,
