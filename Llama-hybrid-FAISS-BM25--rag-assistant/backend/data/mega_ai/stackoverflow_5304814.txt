YouTube is a video-sharing website on which users can upload, share, and view videos, created by three former PayPal employees in February 2005. In November 2006, YouTube, LLC was bought by Google Inc. for $1.65 billion, and now operates as a subsidiary of Google. Most of the content on YouTube has been uploaded by individuals, although media corporations including CBS, BBC, Vevo, and other organizations offer some of their material via the site, as part of the YouTube partnership program. Unregistered users may watch videos, and registered users may upload an unlimited number of videos. Videos that are considered to contain potentially offensive content are available only to registered users 18 and older. Resources : Youtube website Wikipedia article
