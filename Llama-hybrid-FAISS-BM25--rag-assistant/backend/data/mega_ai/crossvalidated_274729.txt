I think it can. Campbell & Diebold (2005) use an ARX-GARCHX model for point and density forecasting of daily average temperature in Atlanta, Chicago, Las Vegas, and Philadelphia. They compare their forecasts with a few competitors, the best among which is the forecasts from Earth Satellite (EarthSat) corporation which are used to settle temperature-related weather derivative products traded on the CME. In the end, ARX-GARCHX never beats EarthStat, but still looks quite well considering that the model is rather simple (conceptually -- and especially computationally) as compared to models used by professional weather forecasters. Point forecasts: ARX-GARCHX does worse than EarthSat forecasts in 1-4 day horizons, but already in 5-8 day horizons the difference in forecast accuracy between the methods is not statistically significant. Beyond 8 days, ARX-GARCH does roughly as well as the EarthSat forecast. Density forecasts: No comparison between EarthSat and ARX-GARCH (?). References: Campbell, Sean D., and Francis X. Diebold.
