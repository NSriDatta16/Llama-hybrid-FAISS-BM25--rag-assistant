Which DataCache methods are you using to read from the cache? Several of the DataCache methods will always make a hit against the server regardless of local cache being configured. You pretty much have to make sure you only use Get if you want the local cache to be leveraged. This is one my biggest nits with AppFabric Caching. They don't explain any of this to you and so when you begin to rely on local caching you begin to fall into these little pitfalls because you do not think you're paying a penalty for talking to the service, transferring data over the wire and deserializing objects, but you are. The worst thing is, I could understand having to talk to the service to make sure the local cache represents the latest data. I can even understand transferring the data back so that multiple calls are not made. What I can not understand for the life of me though is that even if the instance in the local cache is verified to still be the current version that came back from the cache, they still deserialize the object from the wire rather than just returning the instance that's in memory already. If your objects are large/complex this can hurt a lot.
