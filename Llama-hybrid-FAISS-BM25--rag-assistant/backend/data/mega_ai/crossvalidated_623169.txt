Interpretation of fast fourier transform in a simple time series

I am struggling with understanding the result of FFT in R. I have 729 observations, two years data. In the data I simulated there were more visitors every sunday. I divided 729/7 which is approximately 104. And there was a peak indeed, but also two others, which I didn't get. I see that they are at possitions ~104 x 2 and ~104 x 3. But I totally lack an intution behind it. Then, when I put the peak every first day of the month, I had even more peaks. I am not sure where to look for the explanation. Below is the complete code. It contains simulated data and all of the steps: # Setting the seed for reproducibility set.seed(1234) # Define the start and end date start_date $visits - mean(park_data$ visits) # removing the constant component fft_data I couldn't find any similar questions. Please, share your advice.
