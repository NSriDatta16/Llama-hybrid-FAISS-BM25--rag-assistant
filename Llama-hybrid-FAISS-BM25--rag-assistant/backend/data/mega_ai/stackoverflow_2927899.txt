You can use some simple function like: listened_time_of_song/(length_of_song + 15s) or listened_time_of_song/(length_of_song * 1.1) that means that if song was stopped in 15 seconds then it would be rated with negative score, or maybe the second case is even better (length of song would have no matter to final note if user listened whole song) Another way may be using neural networks if you are common with this subject.
