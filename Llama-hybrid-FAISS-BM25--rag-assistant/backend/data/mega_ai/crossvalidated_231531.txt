Have you tried Gaussian Processes? A random function $f$ is said to be a Gaussian Process if $$ f(x) \sim GP(m(x), k(x, x')), \quad x, x' \in \mathbb R^p. $$ The mean function $m$ is the location parameter and the kernel function represents the covariance between two outputs as function of the inputs: $$ k(x, x') = \mathrm{cov}[f(x), f(x')]. $$ You can encode your prior information about the dependence of $z$ on the previous value in the kernel function. This means that you have to assign a higher correlation value when the points are neighbouring. The Markovian kernel is the Exponential kernel (or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck). The GP will learn itself the nonlinear dependence in the output space. If you are not familiar with the model, you need to have a look at Kevin Murphy, Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective, MIT - chapter 15.
