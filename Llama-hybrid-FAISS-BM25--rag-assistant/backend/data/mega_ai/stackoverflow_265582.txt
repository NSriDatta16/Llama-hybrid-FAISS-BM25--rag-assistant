AFAIK you can not change it (at least with simple means) at runtime, because it is auto-generated as attribute in the properties of the domain classes. E.g. [Column(Name="ITM_CREATE_DATE", Storage="_ITM_CREATE_DATE", DbType="DateTime NOT NULL", UpdateCheck=UpdateCheck.Never)] public System.DateTime CreationDate A possible workaround (that I have never tried, so I don't know if it works) is to copy the .designer.cs code in your single project, make the changes in the copy and use it without the designer.
