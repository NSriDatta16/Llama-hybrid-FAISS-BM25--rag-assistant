WPF layout issue

I have an issue with how to organise the the screen layout for my data. I have a object A with properties A1 and A2 and may contain an Object B. Object B has properties B1, B2, B3 and a collection of 1 or more of object C. Object C contains properties C1, C2 and C3 I want the the layout to be A1 A2 or A1 A2 B1 B2 B3 C1 C2 C3 or A1 A2 B1 B2 B3 C1 C2 C3 C1 C2 C3 I tried the following Xaml but could not get object C to occur more than once. I created a datatemplate and use a listview using the datatemplate to display the data, but only one row of C data is ever displayed. Any suggestions on how to get the desired layout? John
