I'd guess it's either due to that, or because DTBookMonitor only allows one instance of it to run at a time. The following test should shed some light on the situation: Run the first (long) instance of DTBookMonitor Run a second instance without redirecting any of its output Alternatively, run a second instance, but redirect the output to a file other than log\cmdProcessLog.txt Do you get similar results? Different results?
