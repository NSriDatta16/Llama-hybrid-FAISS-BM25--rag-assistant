Elegant way to combine ASP.NET validation with JQuery

How can I best combine JQuery with ASP.NET client side validation model? I've generally avoided implementing ASP.NET validation model because it always seems overkill for what I was doing. For the site I'm working on now I'm just collecting non critical user data and only need somewhat basic validation. I dont want messages appearing in the DOM or anything like that. I've always found it hard to get that to look right anyway. But I need now to implement something a little more elegant. What I want to take advantage of in JQuery is clever search expressions like 'tell me if at least one of these checkboxes is checked'. I'm new to JQuery, but I think this is about 1 line of JQuery and a lot more complicated in the traditional ASP.NET model. So I want to take full advantage of JQuery's abilities but not completely undemine ASP.NET's validation model. My best approach so far is this (which pretty much goes behind the back of ASP.NET): $('# ').bind('click', function(event) { if (...) { alert("You must enter a name"); return false; } return true; }); What's a better approach here? Are there any recommended plugins for JQuery ? PS. I don't want to use MVC model. I'm trying to create a very 'RAD' site and dont have time to delve into that fun new stuff yet.
