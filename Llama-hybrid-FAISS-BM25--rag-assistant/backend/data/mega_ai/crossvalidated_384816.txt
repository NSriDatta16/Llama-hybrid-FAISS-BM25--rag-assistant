Is there an efficient approach in machine learning when I have the confidence (uncertainty) values for the input features?

Could you give me some comments? I'm looking for a better approach when I have confidence (uncertainty) values for each input feature. For example, let's say each class has 3 features. f1,value = 0.003 f2,value = 0.005 f3,value = 0.007 And they have their own confidence value [0-1 range]. (It means how reliable the feature is.) f1,conf = 0.2 (not reliable) f2,conf = 0.8 (reliable feature!) f3,conf = 0.6 (so-so) Actually, the low confidence value is because of noise and other interferences. I'm using conventional neural network and put these values in series. ex) [f1value, f1conf, f2value, f2conf, f3value, f3conf] But is there any better approach to use the confidence values? For example, is there any way to put 'confidence values of input features' to learning network? ----added Actually, I have the confidence values. You can think of these values as signal quality.
