iPhone SQLite3 problem - "No such column"

When I run the following query in an iPhone app @"select name, identifier, score, delta from startups order by name ASC" I get the following error in my logs: sqlite error: no such column: score However, running pragma table_info(startups) in my sqlite3 database yields the following: sqlite> pragma table_info(startups); 0|id|INTEGER|0||1 1|name|TEXT|0||0 2|identifier|TEXT|0||0 3|score|DOUBLE|0|'0'|0 4|delta|DOUBLE|0|'0'|0 5|cached|INTEGER|0|'0'|0 I've run clean and build several times, triple-checked the db, and cannot figure out why this error is appearing. Any help would be awesome. Thanks, StackOverflow!
