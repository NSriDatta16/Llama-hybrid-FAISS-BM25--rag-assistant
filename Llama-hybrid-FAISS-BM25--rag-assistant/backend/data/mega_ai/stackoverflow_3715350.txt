How multiple column b-tree index is organized

I want to understand better index organization. Imagine we have a table with 2 columns: CREATE TABLE user( name varchar(100) ,age int) We would like to create an index: CREATE INDEX IDX_MultiColIdx on user(name,age) How would B-Tree index organization look like? In case of one column, say, age , the organization is clear: every non-leaf node would contain a set of integer keys which would be used for a search. Which values contain nodes of our IDX_MultiColIdx B-Tree index?
