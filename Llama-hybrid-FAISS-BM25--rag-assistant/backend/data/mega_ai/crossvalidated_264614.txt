Is this null hypothesis wrong?

The Wikipedia article Null hypothesis says in its opening paragraph: In inferential statistics, the term "null hypothesis" is a general statement or default position that there is no relationship between two measured phenomena, or no association among groups. (Since this article changes frequently, here is a link to the current version ) The book I'm following has to say : Q: In a nutritional study 13 students were given a usual diet with vitamin tablets and 12 set of other students were given only the normal diet. After 12 months their weights are measured as given below (a 2 x 13 table in which weight gains of the two set of students are mentioned) Can you say that vitamins were responsible for this difference? A: $H_0$= Vitamins are responsible for this difference $H_A$= just the opposite, not responsible The t-value turned out to be more the p-value and they rejected the $H_0$ P.S. I'm sure it isn't right because Vitamin rich diet does cause weight gain and given the concept of null hypothesis the $H_0$ assumed in the excerpt should be wrong.
