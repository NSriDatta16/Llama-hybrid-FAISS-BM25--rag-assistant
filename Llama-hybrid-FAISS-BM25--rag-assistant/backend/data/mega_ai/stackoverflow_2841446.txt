how to get rows created with DataTable.NewRow() in C# / ADO.NET 2.0?

Now I use Select and use a criteria which select only new rows. But is there any kind of GetInsertedRows-method. If I remember correctly there is status for each row so naturally one can loop through them all but that's not elegant. -Cheers -Matti
