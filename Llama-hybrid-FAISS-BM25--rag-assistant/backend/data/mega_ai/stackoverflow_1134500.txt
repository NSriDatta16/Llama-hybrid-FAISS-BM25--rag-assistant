Both AMFPHP and the Zend_Amf classes are written by the same person, but the current AMFPHP is an old (php4-based) codebase - the guts of the new ZF class will, according to his blog (link below), help form the basis of a new, updated AMFPHP. AMFPHP will be a fantastic fit for beginner to intermediate developers and when you need the horse power of a framework check out what I feel is the best one on the market Zend Framework. In summery: Need your clients IP or some database information into Flash/Flex in the next 15 minutes; AMFPHP is your friend. If youâ€™re going to change the world with an application that is enterprise ready and can leverage the wealth of code in a robust framework then check out Zend Framework. It may be a little more work at first but in the end you will be saying wow that is nice! http://wadearnold.com/blog/flash/amfphp/the-future-of-amfphp
