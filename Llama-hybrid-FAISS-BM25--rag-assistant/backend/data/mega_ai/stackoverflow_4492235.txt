Suitable technology for very small user base

My friend wants a way to organize her projects and tasks better at work. She would like to be able to: Define Projects Define (Weekly) Tasks for each Project A Task is associated with a particular week (day/time granularity not needed) Define Sub-Tasks for each Task View a week's worth of tasks and their subtasks at a time Zoom in to see a particular task in more detail Zoom out to see a whole month's tasks in less detail And last, but not least, she would like to share this data with her supervisor, so he can see it and make comments / adjustments. I'd like to know what options are available and the pros/cons of each... I've considered: Excel sheet Pros: easy to share, availability (she and her boss both have Excel installed) Cons: harder to maintain and create multiple views of the same data. Access Pros: easy to share (perhaps via storage on shared drive), availability Cons: UI options not very rich, in my opinion .NET with local db file Pros: Rich UI options, quick development (i am most familiar with .NET) Cons: Availability - they would both have to have my app installed, or it would have to live on a shared drive somewhere (which is probably an option I guess...) Can anybody shed any light on this as far as available options, pros/cons I haven't thought of for these or any other technologies? Thanks!
