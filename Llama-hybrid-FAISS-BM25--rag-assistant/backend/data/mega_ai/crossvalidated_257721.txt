I would like to process semi-structured text. Can machine learning be used?

I have many emails that I would like to extract data from. The emails contain data but in different formats. The below example contains data about a request for a shipment: Account: SugarHigh Inc Qty: 1,000 Tons Sugar Date: 9 - 15 July From: NY To: IL I would like to extract the above into the following format: Account Quantity Product FromDate ToDate From To ------- -------- ------- -------- ------ ---- -- SugarHigh Inc 1000 Sugar 9 July 15 July NY IL The same request can arrive in a different format.For example: Acc: SugarHigh Inc Qty/Date: 1,000 Tons Sugar/9 - 15 July From/To: NY/IL Some requests can even have more or less fields or describe things differently. Can machine learning be used in assisting to extract this data fully/partially? If so what type of algorithms/models exist for this type of problem? I am assuming I might also need to use some type of dictionary for known words such as products or locations.
