Xcode Includes .xib files that have been deleted!

I have a problem with Xcode that I can't seem to resolve. I have a view controller lets call "foobarViewController", there was a "foobarViewController.xib" to accompany it. In this controller I splish-splashed with the view to make it look the way I wanted, but decided to do it pragmatically. And so I deleted the xib from the project, cleaned all targets, restarted xcode, restarted COMPUTER, deleted the old build folder even and STILL when I compile the view includes objects that were only in the XIB file. What is going on here?
