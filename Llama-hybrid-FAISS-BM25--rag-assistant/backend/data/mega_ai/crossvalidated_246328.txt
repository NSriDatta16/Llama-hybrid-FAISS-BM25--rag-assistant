Bayesian updating based on the observed sum of bernouilli variables

I am struggling with the following problem, and i am wondering what the best way to tackle it is. Imagine we have a population of a 100 patients, of which 30 have a prior estimated probability of 20% to be "infected", 30 have a 50% estimated probability, and the remaining 40 have an estimated probability of 70% to be infected. These probabilities are our prior best estimate at the moment. unfortunately, we do not know which individual patients fall into which category. We take a sample of the population (e.g. 10 patients), and notice that 7 are infected. What is the best methodology or framework to update our probabilities to account for this new information?
