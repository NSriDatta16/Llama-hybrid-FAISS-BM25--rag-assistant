Alternative to The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction

I am taking a class in statistics which uses The Elements of Statistical Learning: Data Mining, Inference, and Prediction as a textbook. However, I find this book very terse. Could anyone please recommend a book which has similar topic coverage but contains more examples and detailed explanations and does not omit mathematical derivations. P.S. I found Introduction to Statistical Learning as a good introductory level book. It was easy to read and provided a good overview of ML methods. However, I would like to see more rigorous explanations and mathematical derivations of the methods.
