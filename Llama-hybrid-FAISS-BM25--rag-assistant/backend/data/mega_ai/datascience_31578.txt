Stacking when the the target variable is categorical?

I'm trying to use stacking when predicting for the infamous Iris dataset. Also, I'd like to build to stacked classifier by myself which means I don't want to use mlxtend because it's too "easy" and out of the box. I'm using python 3 and working on windows 10. I'm not having any issue choosing algorithms or during cross-validation but when I try to stack the base learners ( gaussian and multinomial naive bayes, logistic regression) which gave me a string answer : the species of iris ; with the meta-learner (gradient boosting classifier), I can't seem to have a string as an answer, only a probability and it my accuracy score is much lower than any of the individual base learner. Could anyone direct me at some code and/or explanations as to what I should be doing instead? Thanks a lot!
