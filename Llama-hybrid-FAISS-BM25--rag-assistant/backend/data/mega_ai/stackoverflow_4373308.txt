How many ratings required for iTunes average rating?

I have tried to search all over for this, but have not succeeded in finding an answer unfortunately.. Apps on the iTunes app store show average ratings when enough ratings are received. Does anyone have a ballpark on how many ratings are required for an average rating? New apps display "Not enough ratings" until some threshold is reached. I emailed Apple, but they are slow..
