You can find the code to record audio from " http://developer.apple.com/iphone/library/samplecode/SpeakHere/History/History.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/DTS40007802-RevisionHistory-DontLinkElementID_1 " which is provided by apple. After recording audio, you can convert it to base64 and upload it to server by web service. Cheers, Pragnesh
