Multiple mediation model suitable?

Objective To test which base of power performs best in the adaptation process [of something] in a buyer-supplier relationship To understand that, I shall give a quick explanation about what bases of power are: French and Raven (1959) developed five bases of power: Reward power is based on the influenced entity's perception that the influential entity "has the ability to mediate rewards for him". Coercive power is based on the influenced entity's perception that the influential entity "has the ability to mediate punishments for him". Legitimate power is based on the influenced entity's perception that the influential entity "has a legitimate right to prescribe behavior for him". Referent power is based on the desire of the influenced entity to be associated with the influential entity. Expert power is based on the influenced entity's perception that the influential entity "has some special knowledge or expertness" which is either useful or necessary for him. The bases of power can be categorized in hard and soft bases of power. Let's say: ====================== Soft Hard ---------------------- Expert Coercive Referent Legitimate Expert ====================== Hypotheses Now I want to find statistical support for the following hypotheses building on this framework: H1a: The stronger a supplier depends on its buyer, the higher the likelihood to experience hard power bases. H1b: The less a supplier depends on its buyer, the higher the likelihood to experience soft power bases. H2a: A supplier experiencing a hard power base is likely to adapt a buyers [something] on request. H2b: A supplier experiencing a soft power base is likely to refuse a buyers [something] on request. The approach Now since I assume that there is a causal relation between the four variables I have, I understand mediation suitable to test the hypotheses H1a-H2b (Hayes, 2009). Therefore I created the following model which I want to test (assume there were no problems with measurement, validity and implementation in a statistical software). Model (Soft [M1]) / \ / \ / \ (Dependence [X]). . . (Adaptation[Y]) \ / \ / \ / (Hard [M2]) (I didn't know how to draw arrows in the model.) Question Is it sensible to test the hypotheses in this way or would a linear structural equation model do the same job? Follow up questions have to do with the implementation in R due to having two mediators; but before that it would be interesting for me, as a beginner in quantitative research, to hear whether this approach makes sense.
