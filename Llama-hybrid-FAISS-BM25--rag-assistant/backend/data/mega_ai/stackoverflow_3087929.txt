Why is it discouraged to use Resources.getIdentifier()

In the Android SDK, there is a comment that says it's more efficient to retrieve resources by identifier instead of by name. Is this the only reason it's discouraged to use getIdentifier()? I need to programmatically access one of several hundred resources and so far my design makes it easier to access raw resources by name instead of identifier.
