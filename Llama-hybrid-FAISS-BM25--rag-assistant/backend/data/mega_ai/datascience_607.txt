Do you need a virtual machine for data science?

I am brand new to the field of data science, want to break into it, and there are so many tools out there. These VMs have a lot of software on them, but I haven't been able to find any side-by-side comparison. Here's a start from my research, but if someone could tell me that one is objectively more rich-featured, with a larger community of support, and useful to get started then that would help greatly: datasciencetoolKIT.org -> vm is on vagrant cloud (4 GB) and seems to be more "hip" with R, iPython notebook, and other useful command-line tools (html->txt, json->xml, etc). There is a book being released in August with detail. datasciencetoolBOX.org -> vm is a vagrant box (24 GB) downloadable from their website. There seems to be more features here, and more literature.
