How do I auto correct colors in an image?

I will work with a set of arbitrary images. Some of them might need some color correction. I've opened up an image that needed correction in Photoshop and noticed the yellows were a bit high in the Histogram. I applied Auto Color and that improved the image. How does that work ? How implement that ? Do I look for peaks in the histogram and average them based on the other peaks ? The language/syntax shouldn't matter much.
