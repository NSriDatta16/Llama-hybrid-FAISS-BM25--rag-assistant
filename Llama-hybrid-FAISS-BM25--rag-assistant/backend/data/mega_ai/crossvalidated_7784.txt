Measuring correlation of trained neural networks

I am training an artificial neural network (backpropagation, feed-forward) with non-normal distributed data. Beside the root mean squared error, literature does often suggest the Pearson correlation coefficient for evaluating the quality of the trained net. But, is the Pearson correlation coefficient reasonable, if the training data is not normally distributed? Would it not be more reasonable, to use a rank-based correlation measure, e.g. Spearman rho?
