Session_End event behind load balancer

I'm creating web application behind load balancer. To this moment I configured it to store session in database but I'm not sure how should I handle session expiration. The problem is not sessions are not removed from database but Session_End event because I have to call some web service method in it. Assuming Session_End is called when expires the thing I'm afraid of is situation when session is created on one server but finished on another. In this case I'm afraid Session_End on first server will be executed prematurely and I will call web service too early. What would you suggest in this situation? Edit: I remember some time ago reading about Sql Agent reacting to session end event and then performing custom code. Can anybody confirm that this solution is possible?
