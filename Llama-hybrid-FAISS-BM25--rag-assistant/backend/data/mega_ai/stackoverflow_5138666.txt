In Ruby, using "net/http", we have to join the url and query using a "?" ourselves?

In the following code, we have to join the url.path and url.query ourselves using the ? character? Is there a more elegant way to do it? I have to use net/http because in some situations I want to put a string in the header for the user-agent as well. require 'net/http' url_string = 'http://www.time.gov/timezone.cgi?Pacific/d/-8' url = URI.parse(url_string) response = Net::HTTP.start(url.host, url.port) do |http| http.get(url.path + '?' + url.query) end puts response.body[/
