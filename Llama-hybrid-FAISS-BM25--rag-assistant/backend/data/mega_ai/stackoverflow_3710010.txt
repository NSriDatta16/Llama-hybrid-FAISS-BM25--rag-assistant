There are no hard and fast rules for how the controllers are organized. You organize them the way it makes most logical sense to you. This will require a bit of experimentation as you see how the routing works out, and you find the cleanest, most elegant design. ASP.NET MVC is brilliantly agnostic in this respect. It doesn't care how you design your controller/route substructure, and it is flexible enough to handle most any design. Your application design should be heavy on the Model side. Your controllers should be relatively small; if you find that you are stuffing a large amount of logic in the controllers, you should refactor that logic to the model, or add a service layer to contain the logic. Your controller layer is best thought of as a "patch panel"; it is the place where you connect your incoming Urls via routes to your model/service layer and your View Model/Views. You should definitely check out Project Areas , as this might be an appropriate mechanism to contain your three different system areas.
