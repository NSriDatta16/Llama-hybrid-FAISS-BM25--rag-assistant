Image Classification approach for Text images

Let me introduce myself as a beginner to machine learning problems. We are trying to build a system to classify images of text-data like bills, orders, bank-statements etc. We started with the image classification approach with some-what larger data-set to train. This gave a good percentage of predictions in test. But in real-world samples, the problem we see is that, there is no standard layouts or strict rules in producing these text-documents. So the image classification is not giving good results any more. Classifications are going wrong because of common white backgrounds / logos is what we suspect. Different attempts to gray-scale the images, remove the non-text contents etc we tried, but it does not improve much. Since arguments to shift to OCR based recognition & classification are increasing we are having a thought towards that too. My doubt is image classification for text-images is a right approach or not?
