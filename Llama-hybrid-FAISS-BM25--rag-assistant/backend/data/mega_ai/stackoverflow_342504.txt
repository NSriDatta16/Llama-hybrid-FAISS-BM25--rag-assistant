Is 20 SQL Queries per page load really considered a lot?

I was reading Jeff Atwood's blog on Behold WordPress, Destroyer of CPUs and saw that many people there considered 20 SQL Queries per page load to be a lot. What is the average amount of queries per page nowadays for a highly dynamic page with auto suggest, auto refreshing of data, customized pages, and the kitchen sink? For a simple example, Amazon.com practically customizes my homepage with stuff they think I will buy. To me, that doesn't look it just uses 5 or less queries for the front page. I'm still a newbie with databases so please tell me if I'm missing something obvious.
