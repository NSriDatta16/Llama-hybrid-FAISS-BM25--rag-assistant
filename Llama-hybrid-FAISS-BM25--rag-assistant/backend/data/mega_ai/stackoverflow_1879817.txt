I don't think that there's anything in your description that makes GTT's unattractive. You obviously need very large temporary tablespaces but you're not consuming more space overall unless you've been making heavy use of table compression (unavailable in GTT's at least up to 10gR2). Look into the use of tablespace groups: http://download.oracle.com/docs/cd/B19306_01/server.102/b14231/tspaces.htm#ADMIN01103 Using a tablespace group, rather than a single temporary tablespace, can alleviate problems caused where one tablespace is inadequate to hold the results of a sort, particularly on a table that has many partitions. A tablespace group enables parallel execution servers in a single parallel operation to use multiple temporary tablespaces. Also, don't neglect the use of subquery factoring clauses. They can often replace the use of temporary tables. However they might still require just as much temporary storage space because a large result set from a SQFC can spill to disk to avoid the consumption of too much memory, so you still have to go ahead with the increase in TEMP space. They're very handy for not having to deploy a new database object every time you need a new temporary table.
