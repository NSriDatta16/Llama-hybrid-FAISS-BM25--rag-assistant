I use Excel then import that into Visio. Directors Sectariesâ€™ have to implement so i just ask them to fill in a spreadsheet then import that into Visio - =>. UPDATE after comment by SHS => IF you look at the Visio 2007 DATA menu -> Import Data Solution -> Organisation Chart -> there is a wizard (set the columns for the spreadsheet) All I have in the Columns is Role - Person - ReportsTo The wizard helps with the mapping and you get to set who is at the top of the tree. We have awsome sectaries - but often the least technology driven solution is often the best.
