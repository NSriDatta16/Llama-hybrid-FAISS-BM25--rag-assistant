Using MOA to classify new examples?

I'm trying to use the java machine learning library MOA to train on a training data stream, then predict classes for a test data stream. The first part works fine, using (for example) java -cp .:moa.jar:weka.jar -javaagent:sizeofag.jar moa.DoTask "LearnModel -l MajorityClass -s (ArffFileStream -f atrain.arff -c -1) -O amodel.moa" But then I cannot figure out how to use the trained model (amodel.moa) on another stream (atest.arff) to predict the classes. Has anyone done this before?
