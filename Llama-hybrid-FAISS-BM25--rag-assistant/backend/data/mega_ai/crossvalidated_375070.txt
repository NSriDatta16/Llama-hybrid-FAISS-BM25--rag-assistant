The coherence score is for assessing the quality of the learned topics. For one topic, the words $i,j$ being scored in $\sum_{i have the highest probability of occurring for that topic. You need to specify how many words in the topic to consider for the overall score. For the "UMass" measure, the numerator $D(w_i, w_j)$ is the number of documents in which words $w_i$ and $w_j$ appear together. 1 is added to this term because we are taking logs and we need to avoid taking log of 0 when the two words never appear together. The denominator is the number of documents $D(w_i)$ appears in. So the score is higher if $w_i$ and $w_j$ appear together in documents a lot relative to how often $w_i$ alone appears in documents. This makes sense as a measure of topic coherence, since if two words in a topic really belong together you would expect them to show up together a lot. The denominator is just adjusting for the document frequency of the words you are considering, so that words like "the" don't get an artificially high score. You could use the topic coherence scores, $CS(t)$ for $t = 1, \ldots, K$ , to determine the optimal number $K^*$ of topics by finding $\arg\max_K \frac{1}{K}\sum_{t=1}^K CS(t)$ . That is take the average topic coherence score for various settings of $K$ and see which gives the highest average coherence.
