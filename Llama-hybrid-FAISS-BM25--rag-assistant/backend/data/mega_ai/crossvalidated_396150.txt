Multiple T-Tests Over Time Series Data

I have 2 groups, observed for 11 months. I have observed means for each month, for each group. Running 11 t-tests, I find that 4 of the 11 months have a significant difference in their means (at an alpha of 0.05) My question is, how can I calculate the probability that these 4 differences were just by chance?
