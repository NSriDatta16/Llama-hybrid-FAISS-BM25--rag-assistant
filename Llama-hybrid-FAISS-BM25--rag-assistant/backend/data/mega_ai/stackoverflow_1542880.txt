iPhone library: file is not of required architecture

I have searched for hours however I still have no clue what is wrong with my configuration. My project uses a self-written libray (myLib). This library is compiled to work only for simulator and it works perfectly there. What do have to change so it compiles for my iPhone Device as well? This is my current warning: ld: warning: in /.../myLib.a, file is not of required architecture This is my configuration (of myLib.a) I found a lot of articles explaining the reason for this error however I could not find a solution: The simulator runs on an x86 architecture, while the device uses an ARM architecture. What do I have to change to get my library working on my iPhone? Thanks Edit: What I did so far: Cleaned both projects Set library to 'Device' (3.1) Built the library Dragged the .a file of my library into my application Result: This works in simulator but setting the active sdk to device still raises a file is not of required architecture error. I also tried mahboudz ( thanks for your support) link . It explains howto built the project using a shell script. However XCode keeps complaining that the library file is of the wrong architecture and the build fails. This has to be a really stupid beginners mistake.
