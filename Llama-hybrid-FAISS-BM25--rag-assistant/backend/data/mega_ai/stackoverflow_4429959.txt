Passing an xml document (as a parameter?) to a web service

I am developing a web service in java and Metro that requires a lot of information to be passed. For example, something like xml describing all the attributes of a customer. I am wondering if there is some standard way in which to pass the data in a document. Currently I have been passing the data as a string parameter named 'customerXML'. Any suggestions appreciated. FYI I have defined another restful ws using RestEasy which works great using input/output streams, but am looking for a way to leverage soap-based web services to expose similar functionality.
