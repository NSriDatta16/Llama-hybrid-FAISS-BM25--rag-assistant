You can fit a logistic regression model to the historical data for which you know whether each transaction is fraud or not. Then all you need to do as the new data comes in is plug the values of each new transaction into your model and it will give you the probability (or, in the first place, the logarithm of the odds, which is easily converted into a probability) that it is a fraud. Whether this is effective will depend on the cost of a false positive compared to a false negative, and the success of the model in picking up what makes a fraud (eg if all frauds are at 3:15 pm for $11,000 you're in luck - but if they vary in their characteristics it will be harder to pick them up).
