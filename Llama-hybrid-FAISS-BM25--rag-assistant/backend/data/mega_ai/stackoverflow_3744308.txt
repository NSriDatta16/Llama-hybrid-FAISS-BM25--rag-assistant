This is pure speculations, however back in the days(Some are still around) many filesystems were not simple byte streams on a hard drive. Many file systems were record based, thus to satisfy such filesystems in an efficient manner, you'll have to specify the number of items ("records"), allowing fwrite/fread to operate on the storage as records, not just byte streams.
