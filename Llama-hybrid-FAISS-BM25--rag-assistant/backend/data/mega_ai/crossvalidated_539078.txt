Is IPTW (inverse probability of treatment weighting) legal?

When using IPTW, one can easily get weights 10 or even 20 for the observations. For instance, in logistic regression, weight 10 for an observation means that we have not one, but 10 observations identical to this one. Thus, if we are allowed to assign weights > 1 to observations, then we can take, e.g., a sample of 100 observations, assign weight 10 to each one of them, and thus obtain a sample of 1000 observations, with totally lesser p-values etc.. But that will be evidently illegal. Why assigning weights > 1 is legal in IPTW? Is IPTW with weights >1 legal?
