Looking at training progress of generative adversarial network (GAN) - what to look for?

I'm trying to understand the output of a GAN training process. I can always inspect the visual output (the generated images) to see how the GAN's evolving, but how can I evaluate training based on the losses and accuracies of the generator and discriminator? Unless I'm mistaken, the goal is to see the GAN's accuracy go to 0.5, meaning it no longer can differentiate between real and fake data (images). Is that right? Can I learn more from the evolution of the losses?
