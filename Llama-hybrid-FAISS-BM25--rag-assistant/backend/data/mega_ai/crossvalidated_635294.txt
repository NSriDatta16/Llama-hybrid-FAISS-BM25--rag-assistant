In short I believe the answer is no, you cannot just use the sample size of the different trials (and ignore everything else about the trials).(As you rightly assume, weighting a positive trial by the sample size is inappropriate, since you didn't have n successes. I think you need to add a lot more detail (and it's not a logistic regression question). assume that your data from each trial was normally distributed. the relevant variable is $$\frac{(x-\mu)}{\sigma /\sqrt{n}}$$ where n is the sample size. A trial with low sample size but low standard deviation may be more 'significant' than a trial with high sample size but also higher sample size. Without additional information, I believe ignoring the sample size would be just as valid, on the assumption each trial was not underpowered.
