Since you're building an expression rather than executing directly, you can skip the MethodInfo step and go straight to the MethodCallExpression using the Expression.Call overload that takes a method name rather than a MethodInfo. var call = Expression.Call(typeof(Enumerable), "Average", new Type[] { typeof(MyTSource) }, enumerableParameter, lambdaParameter );
