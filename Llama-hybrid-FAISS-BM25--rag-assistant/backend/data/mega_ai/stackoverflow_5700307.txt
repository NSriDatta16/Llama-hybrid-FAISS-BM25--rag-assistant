splitting a file for upload via php

in php.ini and nginx configurations, there are limits that can be set which restrict the total amount of size a request can contain. 1mb for example. so with that requirement, if a user wants to upload a file that is 10mb , i want to split the file into 1mb chunks and send it to multiple backend application servers where they all use shared storage. from here, i want to be able to merge the chunks or re-assemble them back to the final 10mb file. is this possible with PHP front end / back end? I have a REST API which supports POST and will inspect all post requests for $_FILE[] -- I'm unsure how this could be managed on the backend on the front end, when a user hits submit, the file starts to upload ... which means, if it's 10mb ... it'll fail -- SO, does this mean i need some fancy javascript to do the chunking / form submission -- if so, how is that then structured / communicated so that the backend knows what to do ...
