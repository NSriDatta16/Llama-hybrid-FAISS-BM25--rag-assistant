I thought I'd show how an analysis comes out with one of the datasets in the mediation package. In framing , an experiment is done where subjects have the opportunity to send a message to Congress regarding immigration. However, some subjects ( treat=1 ) were first shown a news story that portrays Latinos in a negative way. Besides the binary response (whether or not they sent a message), we also measured emp , the subjects' emotional state after the treatment was applied. There are various demographic variables as well. First, let's load the needed packages in R, and change the labels for educ to shorter strings. > library("lsmeans") > library("mediation") > levels(framing$educ) = c("NA","Ref"," HS","Coll +") Now fit a logistic regression model > framing.glm = glm(cong_mesg ~ age + income + educ + emo + gender * factor(treat), + family = binomial, data = framing) Here is a display of the conventional adjusted means, where predictions are made with the covariates age , income , and emo set at their mean values: > lsmip(framing.glm, treat ~ educ | gender, type = "response") This is a curious result because the displayed treatment effects are the opposite for females as for males, and the effect of education isn't monotone as one might expect. Note, hHowever, emo is a post-treatment measurement. This means that the treatment could have affected it, i.e. emo is a mediating covariate; and so it may not be meaningful to compare predictions of the response variable while holding emo constant. Instead, let's look at the predictions where emo is set to its predicted values given treat and the demographic variables. > lsmip(framing.glm, treat ~ educ | gender, type = "response", + cov.reduce = emo ~ treat*gender + age + educ + income) This result is quite different, suggesting that emo plays a strong mediating role. (The mediation package has functions for estimating the strength of these effects.) The above predictions suggest that, taking emotional response into account, male subjects exposed to the negative news story are more likely to send the message than are females or those not seeing the negative news story. Also, the effect of educ is (almost) monotone. Thanks again to @MasatoNakagawa for pointing me to this interesting example and attuning me to some recent research on causality.
