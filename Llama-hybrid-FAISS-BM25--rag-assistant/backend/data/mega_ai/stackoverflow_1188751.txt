PHP Inheritance and MySQL

So I'm trying to adopt good object oriented programming techniques with PHP. Most (read all) of my projects involve a MySQL database. My immediate problem deals with the users model I need to develop. My current project has Agents and Leads. Both Agents and Leads are Users with much of the same information. So, obviously, I want a class Agents and a class Leads to extend a common class Users. Now, my question is as follows: How should the SQL best be handled for loading these objects? I don't want to execute multiple SQL statements when I instantiate an Agent or a Lead. However, logic tells me that when the Users constructor is fired, it should execute a SQL statement to load the common information between Agents and Leads (username, password, email, contact information, etc). Logic also tells me that when the Agents or Leads constructor is fired, I want to execute SQL to load the data unique to the Agents or Leads class....But, again, logic also tells me that it's a bad idea to execute 2 SQL statements every time I need an Agent or Lead (as there may be thousands of each). I've tried searching for examples of how this is generally handled with no success...Perhaps I'm just searching for the wrong thing?
