As I dug through Bertin (1983) on page 32 he describes a collection of a series of diagrams, tables, maps, etc. as a demonstrational unit . ...the graphic representation will lead to a series of diagrams, double-entry tables..., maps etc...at the moment of publication, the entire set of diagrams must be conceived as a demonstrational unit. The layout must be considered a scientific problem, linked to the imperatives of reading and comparison, before it can be treated as an aesthetic problem. p. 32 Bertin, Jacques. (1983). Semiology of graphics: Diagrams, networks, maps. Madison, WI: University of Wisconsin Press.
