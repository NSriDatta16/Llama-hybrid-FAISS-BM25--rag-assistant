ImageMagick and Paperclip problem

I've got a problem with ImageMagick and Paperclip. I'm using on localhost rails3, ruby1.9.2, imagemagick 6.5.8 and paperclip as gem in version 2.3.8. On production (server) I have rails3, roby1.9.2, imagemagick 6.6.7-4 and the same paperclip as above. When uploading photos on localhost everything is fine. But on server my problem appear. It gets error: [paperclip] identify -format %wx%h '/tmp/stream20110204-15633-3wdd5s.jpg[0]' 2>/dev/null [paperclip] An error was received while processing: Paperclip::NotIdentifiedByImageMagickError: /tmp/stream20110204-15633-3wdd5s.jpg is not recognized by the 'identify' command. (the last paragraph is in brackets but I don't know how to avoid hiding it). Anyone know what's going on? edit: All the time I search for some solve and seems that it is problem with ImageMagick. I uploaded some .jpg file on server and try run command "identify file.jpg" and... there is an error: identify: no decode delegate for this image format `file.jpg' @ error/constitute.c/ReadImage/532. hmm...
