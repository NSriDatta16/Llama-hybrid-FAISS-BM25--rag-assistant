Getting started with client-server networking

I'm a good programmer, but I have zero network experience. Basically, I'd like to get into client-server networking. For example, I'd like to try getting a server process going which allows clients to connect over the internet and send pings to all of the other connected clients. Then maybe I'll try developing a simple chat client, or some simple multiplayer game and I'll go from there. Languages I know very well that might be useful: Java, C++, C. How do I get started? I want to learn best-practices up front, so good learning resources you can recommend (eg books, online materials, etc) would be great. Edit: Should I also look into some kind of VM to emulate various machines interacting with each other? Edit 2: I've put up a 50-rep bounty. Some great answers have been put up so far - I'm looking for more detailed answers though, so hopefully this will encourage that. For example an answer by someone with experience in this type of stuff that compares different learning approaches would be really helpful. Thanks! Also could I get some feedback on the whole VM thing?
