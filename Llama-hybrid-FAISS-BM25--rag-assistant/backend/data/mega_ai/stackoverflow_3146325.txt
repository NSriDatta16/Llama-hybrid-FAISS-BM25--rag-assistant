Is there an elegant way to set a default value for a property in c#?

I have read that there are good reasons to use properties instead of fields in c# on SO. So now I want to convert my code from using fields to using properties. For an instance field of a class, I can set a default value. For example: int speed = 100; For the equivalent property, which I think is: int Speed { get; set; } My understanding is that the Speed property will be initialised to zero when the class is instantiated. I have been unable to find out how to set a default value to easily update my code. Is there an elegant way to provide a default value for a property? It seems like there should be an elegant way to do this, without using a constructor, but I just can't find out how.
