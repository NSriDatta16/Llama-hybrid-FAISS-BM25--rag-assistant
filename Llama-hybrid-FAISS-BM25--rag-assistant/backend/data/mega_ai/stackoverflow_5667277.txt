This can be accomplished through a timed event. Simply call one of the following methods to start the timed event. In your scenario this should be done in the onStart method of your main screen. logEvent(String eventId, boolean timed) logEvent(String eventId, Map parameters, boolean timed) To end your timed event call endTimedEvent(String eventId) In your scenario this would be called in the onStop method of your main screen. Make SURE you pass in true for the boolean timed parameter and you always match eventIds in the onStart and onStop of each Activity. Flurry will automatically report the following metrics in your dev portal account Under Applications > Events > Your Event Id. Choose the Event Duration link or icon (a clock): Average Event Duration - This reports the total event time divided by number of events across some period in time. For example, say you have 2 users of your app in some time period. User A views your main screen for 10 seconds, goes to a secondary screen and returns to your main screen to view for 3 seconds. User B views your main screen for 20 seconds. This is reported as (10+3+20)/3 = 11 seconds. Event Duration Per Session - This reports the average length of time of an event per session. A session is defined as a user being within any View of your app without interruption exceeding 10 seconds (10 seconds is the default pause time and can be updated). For example, your user views the main screen for 15 seconds, goes to a secondary screen, returns to the main screen for 5 seconds. The event duration for that use case is 20 seconds for the session. This is then averaged with the other session over the same time period. Event Duration Per User - This reports the average length of time of an event per user. A user can use your app multiple times in a given time period. For example, in a day say a user views your app 3 times (3 sessions). In the first session your user views the main page for 5 seconds, second session for 10 seconds, third session for 15 seconds. The event duration for this user is 30 seconds for the day. This is then averaged with all other users over the same time period.
