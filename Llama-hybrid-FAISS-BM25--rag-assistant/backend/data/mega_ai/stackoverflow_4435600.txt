Sorting MySQL results in PHP...?

I have a page on my site that lists a bunch of products, each with a user rating. I use one query to pull some data points for each product ("details query"), and a second query that returns the average user rating for each product ("ratings query"). I want to append the user rating for each product onto the "details query" result set, then sort by rating in descending order. I've read a bunch of entries on Stack Overflow, php.net etc. and I think I need to use usort() with a custom function, but every time I pass my MySQL result to usort() I get a php error saying the object I'm passing to usort() isn't an array. For example, I've tried: $data = mysql_fetch_array($details_query); usort($data,"compare"); Doing the above will throw an error saying $data isn't an array. What am I doing wrong? Also, if anyone has any other suggestions on how to get this done I'd really appreciate. I'm having a really tough time with this for some reason... Thanks!
