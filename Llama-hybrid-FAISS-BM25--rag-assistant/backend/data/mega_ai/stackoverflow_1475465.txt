Implementing Arp Sweep

I have been playing with libpcap/jpcap. Implementing a arp sweeper. I send a request for all ip's in the block to the broadcast address and read replies. Now i can't think of a way to exit from the listening function. Now i wait 2 secs and assume ever client responded but this just seems dirty. Can anyone recommend a logic to determine if the scan is complete?
