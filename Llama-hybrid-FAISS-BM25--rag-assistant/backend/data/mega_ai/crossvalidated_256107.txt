XGBoost stands for Extreme Gradient Boosting . It is an algorithm (Chen & Guestrin, 2016) for gradient boosting decision trees . XGBoost adds several features beyond existing algorithms for boosting trees: it is optimized for sparse data and it uses the data's block structure. This makes it faster than previous algorithms. It has been implemented in an R package . Tianqi Chen and Carlos Guestrin. 2016. XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System.
