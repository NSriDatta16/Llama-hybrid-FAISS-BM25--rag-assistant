Basically, you want to use layer-wise approach to train your deep autoencoder. You want to train one layer at a time, and then eventually do fine-tuning on all the layers. You can follow this stanford UFLDL tutorial. It is a great tutorial for deep learning (have stacked autoencoder; not built from RBM. But it should be enough to give you some ideas).
