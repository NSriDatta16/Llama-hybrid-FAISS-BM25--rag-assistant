Tabbed Interface in C#/WPF

I am currently working on an application with a tabbed interface. I want to be able to split the workspace horizontally or vertically by dragging a tab to one edge of the window. For example, open two tabs: http://666kb.com/i/b65vvbusbxhvgy8mf.png Then drag one tab to the bottom of the screen and drop it. A second tabcontrol should appear: http://666kb.com/i/b65vvjnd1ylz54jdz.png How can I achieve that with C# and WPF in .NET 3.5? I think Photoshop does that and I'm sure many other applications too.
