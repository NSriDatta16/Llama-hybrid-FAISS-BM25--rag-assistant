Quantum Bogosort A sorting algorithm that assumes that the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics is correct: Check that the list is sorted. If not, destroy the universe. At the conclusion of the algorithm, the list will be sorted in the only universe left standing. This algorithm takes worst-case Θ(N) and average-case θ(1) time. In fact, the average number of comparisons performed is 2: there's a 50% chance that the universe will be destroyed on the second element, a 25% chance that it'll be destroyed on the third, and so on.
