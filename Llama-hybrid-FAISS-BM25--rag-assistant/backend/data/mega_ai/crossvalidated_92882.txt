I have no background regarding your task. However that reminded me of an idea I have to adapt a classifier (non-Bayesian, but static classifier) to the changes in time (specifically I was trying to adapt a random forest). So, my idea is to collect a sample for a period of time: in your case 2 weeks if you can afford that. Than for each new hour (could be any other period of time), add to the sample the new data points, and remove data points from the oldest hour. It might have some problems, because it depends a lot on how do you choose those periods. Larger periods means smaller effects for the new input. Smaller periods could mean that new data could perturb the old distribution too much. It depends on what do you really need for. [Later edit] After few google searches I have found that this is an old procedure known as "sliding window", and there are a lot of papers for "sliding window quantiles".
