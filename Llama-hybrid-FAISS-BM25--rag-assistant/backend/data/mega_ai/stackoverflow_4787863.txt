Think of the vernacular interpretation of those terms (i.e., outside of the field computer science). Paradigms are all-encompassing views of computation that affect not only what kinds of things you can do, but even what kinds of thoughts you can have; functional programming is an example of a programming paradigm. Patterns are simply well-established programming tricks, codified in some semi-formal manner. Application architecture is a broad term describing how complex applications are organised. Objective-C primarily adds elements of the OO paradigm to the imperative language, C. Patterns and architecture are largely orthogonal to the language.
