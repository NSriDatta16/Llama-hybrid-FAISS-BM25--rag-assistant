Check out UINavigationController and the sample " Navigation-based application " that Xcode offers as a template project. Essentially, each child node type (" Eintrag " type) in your application will be a UIViewController subclass. References to view controllers are placed on the UINavigationController stack. You push and pop references to navigate through the view hierarchy. In each view controller, to open another child node, you call the -pushViewController:animated method on the navigation controller, e.g.: [self.navigationController pushViewController:eintragType1Instance animated:YES]; You'll usually have a "back button" in the top-left corner of the application window. This triggers a "pop", programmatically equivalent to: [self.navigationController popViewControllerAnimated:YES];
