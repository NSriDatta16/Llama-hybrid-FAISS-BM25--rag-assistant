Is it possible to build something like a recurrent neural network for time-series data?

For example, if the data is an acceleration, each input is the acceleration at a time T ? More precisely, I'm curious if I can have the same behavior of a recurrent neural network but only with a normal artificial neural network which has "inputs over time". In fact, I tried something like that and it doesn't work on my problem (but a RNN works). So I wonder if there is a mathematical explanation of why is it limited, why it may never have the same results?
