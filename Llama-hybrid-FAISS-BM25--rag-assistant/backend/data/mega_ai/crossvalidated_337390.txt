Calculate probability of being in the top-N based on pairwise probabilities

I have a set of, say, 20 documents and I have calculated all the pairwise probabilities that doc_x is more important than doc_y (e.g. P(doc_1 > doc_2) = 0.7 ). However, the probabilities may be inconsistent i.e. there may exist three documents where P(doc_1 > doc_2) > P(doc_2 > doc_3) > P(doc_3 > doc_1) . Is there a way to estimate the probability of each document belonging in the top-N most important documents? In other words, how can I say that P(doc_1 belongs in the top-5 documents) = ...% ? EDIT: The probabilities mentioned above are the output of a machine learning model that is trained to return the 'probability' of doc_1 > doc_2. So, they are the output of a binary classification model. Therefore, they are estimates of a probability but not a 'real' probability of some underlying distribution. Let's suppose we always have 20 documents (no more, no less) and all their pairwise probability estimates. Is there a way to estimate the probability of doc_x being in the top-N (N = [1, 2, ... 20]) most important ones? For the sake of simplicity, we can ignore that they may be inconsistent. It's obvious that P(doc_x belongs in the top-20 docs) = 1 .
