Just a few off the top of my head... Use a good password Only allow access to the server from places it should be accessed from. eg. if it should only be accessed by a web server on the same machine, then don't allow mysql to be accessed from outside the machine. Give each person that can access it their own username and password and limit them to only the actions they need to perform. Disable DROP, DELETE etc and don't give average users permission to change databases, create tables, alter tables etc etc. Make sure you understand the user permissions system used in MySQL. It is a nightmare at first, but gives you a lot of control when you get it. Don't assume it is secure - it isn't - regardless of what you've done, you can always do more.
