Please help with this Bayesian PP problem

Only 1 in 10 persons opt for a middle berth in "sleeper class" of Indian railways. What is the probability of getting a middle berth in sleeper compartment? In every coupe, there are 2 Middle Berths out of 8 total berths. Let me try to solve: Simple probability of getting a middle berth is 2/8 = 0.25, but actual probability, I suspect, is very high (as only 1 in 10 opt for it, 9/10 do not opt for it). $$ P(M \mid D) = \frac{P(D \mid M)\, P(M)}{P(D)} = \frac{0.25 \times 0.9}{P(D)} $$ I am stuck up here, what is $P(D)$ ?
