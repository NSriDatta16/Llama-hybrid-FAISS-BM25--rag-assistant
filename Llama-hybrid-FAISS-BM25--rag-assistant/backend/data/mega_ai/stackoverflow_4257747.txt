Inherited table in SQL Server 2008. Performance issues?

I have this idea I've been mulling around in my head based on another concept I read somewhere. Basically you have a single "Primary" table with very few fields, other tables inherit that primary table through a foreign key. This much has been done before so its no news. What I would like to do, is to have virtually every table in the database inherit from that Primary table. This way, every object, every record, every entry in every table can have a fully unique primary key(since the PK is actually stored in the Primary table), and can be simply referenced by ID instead of by table. Another benefit is that it becomes easy to make relationships that can touch multiple tables. For example: I have a Transaction table, and this table wants to have a FK to whatever it is a transaction for(inventory, account, contact, order, etc.). The Transaction can just have a FK to the Primary table, and the necessary piece of data is referenced through that. The issue that keeps coming up in my head, is whether or not that Primary table will become a bottleneck. The thing is gonna have literally millions of records at one point. I know that gigantic record sets can be handled by good table design, but whats the limit? Has anyone attempted anything similar to this, and what were your results?
