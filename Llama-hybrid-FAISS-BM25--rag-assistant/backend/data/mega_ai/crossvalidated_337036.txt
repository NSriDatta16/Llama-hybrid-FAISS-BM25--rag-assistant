Say you take a sample of size $n_j$ in area $j$ , and register the number of votes $x_{ij}$ for party $i$ in area $j$ then this will be binomial distributed (or multinomial if you consider multiple groups at the same time, but for the expression of the variance it does not matter) $$ x_{ij} \sim B(n_j,p_{ij}) $$ where $p_{ij}$ is the fraction of votes for party $i$ in region $j$ (here I will assume that these $p_{ij}$ is known to make calculations easier, and just demonstrate the distribution of the outcome, but in practice you will express the error based on obtained estimates $\hat{p}_{ij}$ which requires a correction for the calculation of the error margins, although with large numbers this correction does not matter much) . The variance of the observations will be: $$\text{Var}(\hat{x}_{ij}) = n_jp_{ij}(1-{p_{ij}})$$ and $$\text{Var}(\hat{p}_{ij}) = \text{Var}(\frac{\hat{x}_{ij}}{n_j}) = \frac{p_{ij}(1-{p_{ij}})}{n_j}$$ Now you will use a weighted combination of multiple estimates, $\hat{p}_{ij} = \frac{\hat{x}_{ij}}{n_j}$ , from different regions to estimate a total $$\hat{p}_{i} = \sum f_j \hat{p}_{ij}$$ for the entire population (where $f_j$ is the fraction of the entire population that lives in the region $j$ ). which has variance: $$\text{Var}(\hat{p}_{i}) = \sum_{\forall j} f_j^2\text{Var}(\hat{p}_{ij}) = \sum_{\forall j} \frac{f_j^2}{n_j} p_{ij}(1-{p_{ij}}) $$ To the point 1 So note that the variance in the weighted mean $$\text{Var}(\hat{p}_{i}) = \sum_{\forall j} f_j^2\text{Var}(\hat{p}_{ij}) $$ is smaller than the variance of a standard arithmetic mean $$\overline{\text{Var}(\hat{p}_{ij})} = \sum_{\forall j} f_j\text{Var}(\hat{p}_{ij})$$ So you may get such values as error rates of 2.93%, but that is for the regions, not for the total. The error rate for the total a weighted a sum of the values in the regions, will be smaller than the average of the individual error rates. See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance#Basic_properties Intuitively you can imagine that if you combine the 7 separate test that the errors (positive and negative) will even out a little bit such that the total error will be relatively smaller. To the point 2 The reason to distribute the sample over the population is because, for a given total sample size $n = \sum n_j $ one can make a most optimal distribution of the $n_j$ that results in a lower variance. So we wish to minimize $$\text{Var}(\hat{p}_{i}) = \sum_{\forall j} f_j^2\text{Var}(\hat{p}_{ij}) = \sum_{\forall j} \frac{f_j^2}{n_j} p_{ij}(1-{p_{ij}}) \qquad \text{with $\sum n_j = n$}$$ which is not straight forward since the term $p_{ij}(1-{p_{ij}})$ is unknown. But if we imagine it is known then we get (using a Lagrangian method, sorry I could not find a reference for this particular example) $$n_j \propto f_j \sqrt{p_{ij}(1-{p_{ij}})} $$ where $\propto$ stands for proportional to. You'd have to find a normalization constant such that you end up with $\sum n_j = n$ . When we ignore the $\sqrt{p_{ij}(1-{p_{ij}})}$ , which we do not know (and when prior estimates of variances in $f_j$ are larger than variances in $p_j$ then this is not such bad plan), then you might imagine it could still be useful to ensure (fix) $n_j = f_j n$ rather than using some random process let determine the $n_j$ (which would result in a likely less optimal distribution of the $n_j$ , because it is likely not a homogeneous distribution like exactly $n_j = f_j n$ , this is especially important when you factor in even more groups than just the seven regions/areas, like age, gender, education, etc. )
