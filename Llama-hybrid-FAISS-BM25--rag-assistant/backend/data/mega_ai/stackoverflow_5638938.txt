The information of user agent is obtained from the HTTP headers, which depends on what browser is used to initiate the WebView object. Therefore, it doesn't make sense if you only want to get the user agent string without creating a WebView. A better way might be create a WebView and set its visibility to GONE. After getting the user agent string, destroy it.
