Coefficient bias in ARIMA vs. lagged regression

I am trying to estimate the effect of an external regressor $x_t$ on a time series $y_t$. My first attempt was using an ARIMAX(p,d,q) Model to estimate $\beta_x$ while controlling for the ARMA structure in the errors. In a second attempt, I modeled $y_t$ using a linear OLS model which includes $y_{t-1}, y_{t-2}, ..., y_{t-p}$ as lagged predictors. The estimates I am getting for $\beta_x$ are quite different between the two approaches. From a theoretical point, the OLS model with lagged predictors should produce similar results as an AR-model (neglecting optimizations issues). Hence the difference must lay in the MA-part of the ARIMA model (neglecting the differentiation for a moment). So on a general level, under which conditions should I expect to obtain biased estimates of $x_t$ from a linear OLS model? Best, W.
