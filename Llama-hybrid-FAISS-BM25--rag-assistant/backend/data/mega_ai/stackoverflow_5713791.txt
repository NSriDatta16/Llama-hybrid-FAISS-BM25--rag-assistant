For Ruby on Rails, instead of adding "require ' '" every where, is it good to add them all to config/environment.rb?

In a Rails project, I see require ' ' in several files, some in controller, some in helper. It is a little bit unorganized this way -- is it a good convention to put them all under config/environment.rb or is there any better ways?
