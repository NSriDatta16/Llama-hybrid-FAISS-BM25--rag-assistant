Cobertura "unable to locate file" problem

Can anyone please help me to understand what is wrong here? I am using Cobertura 1.9.4.1 for Java Code Coverage. I want to attache the source file with HTML report, I am generating report using the below command: cobertura-report.sh --format html --datafile $COBERTURA_HOME/core/emscore.ser --basedir $COBERTURA_HOME/core/src --destination $REPORT_DIR HTML report generated successfully. Where I click on the file name in HTML report, it is giving the below error: "Unable to locate com/airvana/serverImpl/ObjectDao.java. Have you specified the source directory?" However I have the Java source file at: $COBERTURA_HOME/core/src/com/airvana/serverImpl/ObjectDao.java
