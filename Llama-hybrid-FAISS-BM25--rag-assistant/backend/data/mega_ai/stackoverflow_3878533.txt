A little hunting on the web will turn out a lot of your answer. Here's just two: http://www.psgd.org/paul/docs/cstyle/cstyle02.htm http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~lavender/courses/EE360C/lectures/lecture-02.pdf The second one is pretty good. I'd also recommend the c++ Programming Language 3rd edition. There's a great section about file organization. As for what the compiler does, that too is best explained in a separate article. In short, each cpp file is compiled into a translation unit (object code), then the linker connects everything together into the final executable.
