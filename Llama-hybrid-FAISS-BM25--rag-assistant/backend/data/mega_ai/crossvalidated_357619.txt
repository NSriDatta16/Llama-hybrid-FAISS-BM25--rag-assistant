Can I use the multivariate effective sample size (mESS) to estimate the autocorrelation time?

Basically, the title of the question. I'm wondering if it is reasonable to use the mESS (defined here ) to estimate the autocorrelation time $\tau$ as: $$\tau = \frac{N}{mESS}$$ where $N$ is the size of my MCMC chain. I'm asking because I have not seen this used/recommended anywhere and I want to be sure I'm not using it wrong.
