PHP: Whole HTML page as variable - is there a better way?

I have a large form, in the end of the form a user is presented with a summary: You have entered: First name Last name I first designed the summary page and now the thought came to me that it would be nice to send the user this page as a confirmation e-mail. What I have done now is this: First name ".$firstname." Last name ".$lastname." "; echo $summarypage; ?> For loops I use $summarypage .= "blabla"; within the loops. When sending the e-mail I can just take $summarypage and attach it to my e-mail body. Beautiful. Is what I am doing OK? It seems very "not elegant" to me. Isn't $summarypage being rendered totally anew when I call it again in my e-mail - meaning all variables concatenated with it (e.g. $firstname ) will be called again - performance hog? Is there some kind of "buffer" I could just write the $summarypage variable to, so I have a plain-text variable afterwards? Would $newsummarypage = string($summarypage) do the trick?
