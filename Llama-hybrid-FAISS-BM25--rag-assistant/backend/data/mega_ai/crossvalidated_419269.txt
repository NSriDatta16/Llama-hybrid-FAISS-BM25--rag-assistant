Can we use the folded version of RNN in training?

I always see that people teach the unfolded version of the RNN. Do they do that just for the sake of teaching because the unfolded version is simple to explain sequence learning on it? I read in an article before that it's hard to train the folded version of RNN. Why is that? Do deep learning packages implement the folded or the unfolded version of RNN?
