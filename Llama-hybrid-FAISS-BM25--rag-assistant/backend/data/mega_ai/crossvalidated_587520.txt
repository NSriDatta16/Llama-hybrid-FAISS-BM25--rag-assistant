Does evaluation metric not matter for training a model? And why?

I think I'm misunderstanding something with training ML tree models. There's a bunch of evaluation metrics we can use. It seems like this metric however is only used after training, which does not seem intuitive for me. Perhaps we want to prioritise precision. Perhaps we want to prioritise recall, etc. Doesn't the training algorithm need to be aware of this, in the same way a track runner would want to know whether to train for speed or distance? I'm trying different evaluation metrics in a xgboost classifier and it doesn't seem to be making a single difference to the fitted model.
