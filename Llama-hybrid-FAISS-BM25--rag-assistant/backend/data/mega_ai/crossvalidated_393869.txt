Alternative to several one-sample t-tests

My dependent variable is the answer to an open numerical question. E.g. participants were asked to indicate how often within the last three months they were suffering from a headache. I want to know if a certain clinical group is suffering from a headache more often compared to the average population, whereas another clinical group is suffering from a headache less often compared to the average population. Of course I can calculate two one-sample t-tests, and compare if the number of headaches for both groups deviates significantly from the number of headaches in the average population. Let's say I want to compare a unipolar depression sample with a bipolar depression sample. The average number of headaches within the last 3 months in the average population is = 5 . In R I would calculate this as follows: t.test(data$headache[data$condition=="uni_depression"], mu=5, method = "bonferroni") t.test(data$headache[data$condition=="bipolar"], mu=5, method = "bonferroni") However I was wondering if there is a more elegant solution/statistical approach than separate t-tests to calculate this?
