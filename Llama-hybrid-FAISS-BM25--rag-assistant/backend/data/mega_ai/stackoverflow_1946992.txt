Preprocessing with Javacc/ push front some chars in the stream?

Using javacc can I push some new characters in front of the inputstream ? for example let's say that my parser parses the following syntax: #define Paragraphs "Paragraph+" #define Volume "(Title,(Chapter,${Paragraphs})+)" Book=${Volume}+; How can I tell javacc that its scanner should preprocess ${Volume} to (Title,(Chapter,Paragraph+)+) before invoking the parser ? Can It be achieved using the MORE statement ? Thanks
