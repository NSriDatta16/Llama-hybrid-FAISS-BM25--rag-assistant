First off, your lookup combo code could be tightened up a bit: -- the FROM clause was superfluous SELECT 0 AS ID,'All Org' AS Name UNION ALL -- the two-part identifiers were superfluous (only one table) SELECT ID, Name FROM DP_ORG_OrganizationUnit WHERE Code IN ('HR','DEV') For the report query, the simplest form would be: WHERE ((@OrganizationUnit > 0 AND Employee.OrganizationUnit = @OrganizationUnit) OR (@OrganizationUnit = 0 AND Employee.OrganizationUnit IN (4,5)))
