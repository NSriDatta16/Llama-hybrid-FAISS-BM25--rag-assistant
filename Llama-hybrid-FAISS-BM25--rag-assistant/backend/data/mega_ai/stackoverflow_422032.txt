How to get Flex to see a .NET Webservice session when I use the proxy auto-generation?

So I have a Stateful .NET webservice (C#) that I would like Flex to use. The only problem is that I don't see a cookie being passed, even though I have the WebMethods decorated with: WebMethod(EnableSession=true) I can't seem to figure out if it is an issue with Flex or .NET. Does Flex 3 (as3) pay attention to the session cookie automatically with the generated web service classes? If not what can I do to minimize the code I have to write to get this supported with generated proxy classes. Code examples, please :) EDIT 1 I found my own solution .
