There is nothing wrong with your data, your main mistake is that you need to pay attention to the plot function used. This link tells you how to plot your data. https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html However I would change the last line to something like: import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.plot(y_rus) plt.show() or something like: plt.scatter(y_rus) plt.show() In general is a bit difficult to understand what exactly you want or the format of the data, so I hope this works. Follow the tutorial it will help you understand what you really need to continue.
