Best Android Phone for Development?

I am interested in starting Android development, I have significant experience with .NET and WP7 development with several applications on the WP7 Marketplace and a couple on the iPhone App Store. What is the best Android (and cheapest) device to get so that I can test my Android applications on, I realize there is an emulator but in my experience its a pretty big difference from emulator to device when testing comes and performance. I also understand there is some fragmenetation concerns around Android, is there any guidance around how to programatically handle these issues? Such as tips/tricks? Update: I forgot to mention to the phone needs to be unlocked. Thanks everyone!
