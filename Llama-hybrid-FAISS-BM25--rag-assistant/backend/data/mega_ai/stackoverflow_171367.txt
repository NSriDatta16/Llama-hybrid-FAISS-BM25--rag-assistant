Can I save a record in a Windows Gadget in a file or other storage (database, etc.)?

I'm planning to create a simple gadget to create a TO DO list application. This is just for practice and to explore Windows Gadget . How can I store the values in the database? As much as possible, I don't want to set up a local http handler file to be a means to store value to file or database. Note : I tag this with html and javascript since I'm aware it uses such.
