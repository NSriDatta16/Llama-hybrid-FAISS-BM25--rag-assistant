An outlier is not precisely defined, a point can more or less of an outlier. You might say outlier is a fuzzy set where membership depends on the distance $d$ to the pre-existing average. Call such a point a $d$ -outlier. The key difference in mean vs median is that the effect on the mean of a introducing a $d$ -outlier depends on $d$ , but the effect on the median does not. Using Big-0 notation , the effect on the mean is $O(d)$ , and the effect on the median is $O(1)$ . Btw "the average weight of a blue whale and 100 squirrels will be closer to the blue whale's weight"--this is not true.
