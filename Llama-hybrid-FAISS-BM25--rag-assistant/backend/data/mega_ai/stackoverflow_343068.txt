asp.net survey questionnaire engine

I am looking to implement (or build as a last resort) a type of survey engine that allows for extensibility and integration into an existing workflow engine. The survey/questionnaire engine should allow for admin users to add new questions and response types (text/bool/multiple/etc), should use SQL Server for persistence and ASP.NET 2.0 or greater. It should leverage AD for Windows Integrated Auth and security. Does anyone know of a good (free or cheap is even better) off-the shelf solution that meets these basic requirements?
