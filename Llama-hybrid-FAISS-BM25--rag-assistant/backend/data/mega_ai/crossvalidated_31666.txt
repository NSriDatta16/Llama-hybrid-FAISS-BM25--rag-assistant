How can I align/synchronize two signals?

I'm doing some research but have come stuck at the analysis stage (should've paid more attention to my stats lectures). I've collected two simultaneous signals: flow rate integrated for volume and change in chest expansion. I'd like compare the signals and ultimately hope to derive volume from the chest expansion signal. But first I have to align/synchronise my data. As recording doesn't start at precisely the same time and chest expansion is captured for longer periods I need to find the data that corresponds to my volume data within the chest expansion data set and have a measure of how well they are aligned. I'm not quite sure how to go about this if the two signals don't start at exactly the same time, or between data at different scales and at different resolutions. I've attached an example of the two signals ( https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0As4oZTKp4RZ3dFRKaktYWEhZLXlFbFVKNmllbGVXNHc ), please let me know if there's anything further I could provide.
