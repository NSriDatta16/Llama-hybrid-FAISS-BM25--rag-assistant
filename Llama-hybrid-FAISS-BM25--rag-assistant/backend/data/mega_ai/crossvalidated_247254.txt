Markov Chain vs Hidden Markov Model

I have built a small project, where users can interact with the Interface in order to fulfill a task. My goal is to recommend to users next step based on specific task. And for the purpose, I want to use either Markov Model or Hidden Markov model to recommend next interaction. I am a beginner on using Markov models, but I did some research in the last days regarding Markov chain/hidden Markov model. So I have two issues/question which I hope to be able to discuss here and get help from people with experience in this field. First Question/issue is about deciding which one to use Markov chain or HMM? or are those usable in my case? So far, I think the Markov chain is easy usable in my project if a use the interaction as a State? About HMM I am not sure what can I use as hidden variables if again my states are going to be the interactions. Here I would consider any kind of suggestion. The second problem is deciding the initial values for the transition. In every tutorial/example/book they just get some initial values, but I couldn't find so far any description, How is this calculated in real life Projects? Thank you in advance to everyone, who will take some time to help me on understanding better the Markov chain and HMM.
