Procedure-1 : I think it would be better if you can try combining some geners, it is most likely that some follow similar trend, once you identify them try combining them. You can use some Dimensionality reduction, then you can make more sense out of the data, as of now even if you give directly also it might take time for the model to understand and give some useful results. Once you get the outcome of Dimensionality reduction you can directly apply multi class classification algorithms like SVM , RF and many more. Procedure-2 : Another thing which you can try is, You can concatenate all the features(Gener's) into 1 single feature and try try understanding and see if does makes any sense/ get some good insights(Exploratory Analysis). Do let me know if you have questions. SVM : Support Vector Machine RF : Random Forest
