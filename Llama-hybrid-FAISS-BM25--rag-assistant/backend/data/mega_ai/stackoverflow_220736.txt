Splaysort is an obscure sorting method based on splay trees , a type of adaptive binary tree. Splaysort is good not only for partially sorted data, but also partially reverse-sorted data, or indeed any data that has any kind of pre-existing order. It is O(nlogn) in the general case, and O(n) in the case where the data is sorted in some way (forward, reverse, organ-pipe, etc.). Its great advantage over insertion sort is that it doesn't revert to O(n^2) behaviour when the data isn't sorted at all, so you don't need to be absolutely sure that the data is partially sorted before using it. Its disadvantage is the extra space overhead of the splay tree structure it needs, as well as the time required to build and destroy the splay tree. But depending on the size of data and amount of pre-sortedness that you expect, the overhead may be worth it for the increase in speed. A paper on splaysort was published in Software--Practice & Experience.
