To solve the problem in the best way, use picCanvas.Paint event. Set the positions at mousemove event and use that positions to draw at paint event. Point pos = Point.Empty;// or your initial position private void picCanvas_MouseMove(object sender, MouseEventArgs e) { if (_drag) { pos = e.Location; } } private void picCanvas_Paint(object sender, PaintEventArgs e) { if (_drag) { Graphics g = e.Graphics;//The event handler sends us the graphics object to use for painting g.DrawEllipse(_whitePen, pos.X, pos.Y, 10, 10); } } You should add the Paint event to the Control and set the image at formload or some initialization function. picCanvas.Image = (Bitmap)_original.Clone();
