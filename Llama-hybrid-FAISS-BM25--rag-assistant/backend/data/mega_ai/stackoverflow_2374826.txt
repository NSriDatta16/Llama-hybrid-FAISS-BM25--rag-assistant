The java.lang.IllegalAccessError clearly indicates an incompatibility problem with the version of Log4J you are using (a constructor expected to be there is not) and this is not surprising because (and I don't mean to be rude here) your whole dependency management (illustrated by the screenshot) seems to be a BIG mess: You have many unversioned libraries so it's impossible to know what you're using (in what version). You seem to be mixing things from various origins (at least two). You have several version of the same lib (e.g. cglib). You are mixing different versions of slf4j artifacts which can be problematic and is strongly discouraged . So, since you're obviously not using any dependency management solution, my advice would be to use the JARs provided with the Hibernate distribution (put them in a clean directory) or at least to align the slf4j artifacts (e.g. on version 1.5.10 i.e. the version used by hibernate annotations 3.4) and to use log4j-1.2.14.jar. Your current workaround is a temporary fix hiding the real problem.
