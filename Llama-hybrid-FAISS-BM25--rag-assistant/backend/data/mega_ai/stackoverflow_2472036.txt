Is there some reason you can't import his code generation architecture to your build system? I mean, in make I might consider something like: TABLES:=$(wildcard table_*) TABLE_INCS:=$(foreach dir,$TABLES,$dir/$dir.h) include $(foreach dir,$TABLES,dir/makefile.inc) $MAIN: $(SRS) $(TABLE_INCS) where each table_* contains a complete code generation project whose sole purpose is tho build table_n/table_n.h . Also in each table directory a makefile fragment named makefile.inc which provides the dependency lines for generated include files, and now I've removed the recursivity. Done right (and this implementation isn't finished, in part because the point is clearer this way but mostly because I am lazy), you could edit table_3/table_3.input , type make in the main directory and get table_3/table_3.h rebuilt and the program incrementally recompiled.
