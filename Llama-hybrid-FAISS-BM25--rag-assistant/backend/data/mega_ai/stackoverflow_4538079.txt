How to compile a simple source file with GCC in Linux

I am trying to compile a set of source files in C in Linux (Ubuntu). When I try to run the following command, I am getting an error telling "ruby.h" is not found. gcc custom_ext.c This was giving me the following error message. custom_ext.h:10: fatal error: ruby.h: No such file or directory So I downloaded the entire Ruby source code and put it in a dummy directory /home/braga/ruby_source/ruby_1_8_7 . I know that I need to include this directory in the path so that GCC will be able to identify and pick up ruby.h, but I have no idea on how to do that. Please help!!!
