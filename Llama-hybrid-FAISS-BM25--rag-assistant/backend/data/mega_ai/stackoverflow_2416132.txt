Silverlight DataGridDragDropTarget. How to drag a data grid item into a stack panel / user control?

I have a DataGrid . I have DataGridDragDropTarget from November Toolkit. I now can drag and drop a data grid item to a listbox or tree view.. However I need to drop the item onto my user control (and add it to a plane stack panel). There is an article from the guy who wrote all these extension: http://themechanicalbride.blogspot.com/2009/10/silverlight-drag-drop-support-part-2.html But he is incomprehensive. Did anyone try to do the similar I need? I would like to use a behavior (custom behavior is fine - I did it before) or toolkit DragDropTarget solution. I just dont know how to attach to an individual data grid item...
