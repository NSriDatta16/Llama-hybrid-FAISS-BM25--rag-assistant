My MCMC do not overlap : Mixturemodel with JAGS and R

I fitted a JAGS model and I have those results : My questions are: Why do my chains not overlap, and how can I fix that? I used the following method: My model is a mixture Gaussian model of two population with the same unknown variance $\sigma$. The proportion of the two population is $\pi_0$ also unknown and the mean of the two responses are obviously unknown: $\mu_0$ (associate with the proportion $\pi_0$) and $\mu_1$. Mathematical model: Let $ n \in \mathbb{N} $ , $\pi_0 \in \; ]0,1[ \,$ and $(\mu_0,\mu_1,\sigma) \in \mathbb R^2\times\mathbb R^+$. I define the following function $\mu : x \in (0,1) \rightarrow (1-x)\times\mu_0 + x\times\mu_1 $ $(X_i)_{i \in [1,n]}$ and $(Z_i)_{i \in [1,n]}$ are two family of random variable defined by: $$ Z_i \tilde\ Bernoulli(\pi_0) \quad \& \quad X_i|Z_i\tilde\ \mathcal{N}(mu(Z_i),\sigma) $$ Data: I generate a dataset following the mathematical model above: n = 100 # number of points pi0 = 1/4 # proportion of points in the class 1 pi1 = 1-pi0 # proportion of points in the class 2 mu0 = 1 # mean of the class 1 mu1 = 4 # mean of the class 2 sd0 = 1 # sd of the class 1 sd1 = 1 # sd of the class 2 Z = rbinom( n , size=1 , prob=pi0 ) # Hidden information X = rep( 0 , n ) # Information X[Z==1] = rnorm(sum(Z) , mean=mu1 , sd=sd1 ) X[Z==0] = rnorm(n-sum(Z) , mean=mu0 , sd=sd0 ) plot(X,rep(0,n),col=Z*2+2,pch=0) Now with the only information in my vector X, I want to find my four parameters ($\pi_0$, $\mu_0$, $\mu_1$ and $\sigma$). To do that I used JAGS to compute a mixture model. NB: I also used the package Mclust but I want to code my own model to be able to complexity it later. R Code I built the following jags model: top = 2*qnorm(0.925,mean=mean(X),sd=1.5*sd(X)) bot = 2*qnorm(0.025,mean=mean(X),sd=1.5*sd(X)) write( paste( 'model { for(i in 1:',n,') { Z[i] ~ dbern(pi0) mu[i] And I computed the model: # Compilation of the model d The result of the last plot creates the first graphical. I haven't a great experience in MCMC and JAGS code so my problem can be probably obviously solved but if you have some references that can help me to have a better understanding of the problem I'm very interested too.
