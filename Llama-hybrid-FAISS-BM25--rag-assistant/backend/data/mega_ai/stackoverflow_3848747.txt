Apart from MySQL's native full text searching solution, which as you already identified requires the MyISAM storage engine, you may also want to consider the popular third-party search engines Sphinx and Apache Lucene , with which you can use InnoDB tables. You could also stick to MySQL's solution, and use InnoDB storage for all tables except for one table which will simply hold the post_id and text_body . This is assuming that you only require full text searching for the content of forum posts. In addition note that while the major deficiency of MyISAM is the lack of transaction support, there are other important issues as well for a production system.
