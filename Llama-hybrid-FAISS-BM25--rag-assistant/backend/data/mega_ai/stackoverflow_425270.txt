That's good! Of course writing a tool to do all the job for you is impossible and wrong. But automating repeatable tasks is always good - and sometimes writing specific types of code is repeatable. It is even encouraged in the "Pragmatic Programmer" book. Make sure that in the source control you have checked in a code generator and not its output (unless you have to modify the code later by hand)!
