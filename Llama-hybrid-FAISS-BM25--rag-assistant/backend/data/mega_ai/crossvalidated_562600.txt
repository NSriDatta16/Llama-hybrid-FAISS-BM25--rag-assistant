Suppose items come in boxes of $n = 24,$ then the number $X$ of defective items in a box might be modeled as $\mathsf{Binom}(n=24, p = .01)$ so that you'd expect an average defective rate of $\mu = np = 0.24$ per box. Then if you got $y = 6$ defects in ten boxes, you might wonder if you got a shipment of boxes with higher than the usual defective rate. It would be fair to text the the null hypothesis $H_0: p = 0.01$ against $H_a: p > 0.01$ based on $y = 6$ defects in $n = 240.$ In R, an exact binomial test would look like this: binom.test(6, 240, p=0.01, alt="g") Exact binomial test data: 6 and 240 number of successes = 6, number of trials = 240, p-value = 0.03489 alternative hypothesis: true probability of success is greater than 0.01 95 percent confidence interval: 0.01094225 1.00000000 sample estimates: probability of success 0.025 The P-value $0.03489 indicates significance at the 5% level. Also, the lower bound on the one-sided confidence interval for $p$ is $0.011 > 0.01,$ also suggesting incompatibility of six defects in 240 items as inconsistent with a 1% defect rate. Notes: (1) A direct computation of the (one-sided) P-value in R is shown below. $P(X \ge 6; n=240, p=0.01)$ $= 1 - P(X \le 5; n=240, p=0.01)$ $= 0.03488787.$ 1 - pbinom(5, 240, .01) [1] 0.03488787 (2) If you're dealing with thousands of items, you might want to use a Poisson model. For values of interest here, the distributions $\mathsf{Binom}(240, 0.01)$ and $\mathsf{Pois}(2.4)$ are very nearly the same.
