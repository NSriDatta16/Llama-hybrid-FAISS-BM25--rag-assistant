Obviously duplicating the whoViewed() method in 2 places is bad, so that option is off the table. You have a third option: Create a parent class that implements whoViewed() and have A and B inherit from it. The famous Gang of Four Design Patterns book recommends favoring composition over inheritance. So this would suggest making the Viewer class you mentioned in the question. Given the limited context provided in your question, I would suggest taking the GoF's advice and going with the Viewer class. Incidentally, if you expect the implementation of whoViewed() to be different in A and B , you could make Viewer an interface and implement the interface in A and B .
