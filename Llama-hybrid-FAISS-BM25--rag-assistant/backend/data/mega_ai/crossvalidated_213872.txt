Outsource machine learning tasks while keeping information confidential

I have some raw data that I would like to transform into a dataset, then ask for external parties to help me build model (with criteria such as minimising log loss, maximising area under curve). If I pass the dataset to an external parties, is it pretty unlikely that the dataset could be re-engineered back into raw data (which could be confidential for internal only)? The outsourcing is workable because I could pass a dataset to external parties. Is it fair to say that machine learning (and AI in general) would most likely need datasets for years to come? If one day there is no more dataset, I don't know how to outsource without keeping my confidential info. Thanks in advance.
