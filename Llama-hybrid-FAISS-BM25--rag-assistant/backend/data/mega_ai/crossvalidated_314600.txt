Non-Overlapping Fitted and Original Series Values

I trying to create a very simple forecasting routine for a time series. I am using three methods to fit and compare their accuracies. These methods are ets , auto.arima and stlf from forecast package. An example of a time series is shown below. count And, here are how I am doing every fitting. library(forecast) fit.ets When I try to plot the fitted values and original values, I get the following plot. Plotting fitted vs. original values plot(fit.ets$x, col = "red") lines(fitted(fit.ets), col = "blue") produces the following plot. It looks like as if there is a 1-lag between the original and fitted values. Plotting auto.arima fit plot(fit.arima$x, col = "red") lines(fitted(fit.arima), col = "blue") produces similar results. Is this a normal behaviour? If it is, what is the cause?
