With a genetic disease the risk is presumably present from birth or after some later developmental landmark like puberty makes the risk noticeable. From that perspective, you could use your understanding of the subject matter to choose such a time as the time origin time = 0 for your study. In principle there's nothing wrong with that. The event or right-censored survival times then become the elapsed time since that time origin (e.g., years since birth or since puberty). This then becomes a standard situation with left-truncated survival times. From Klein and Moeschberger (2nd edition), Section 9.4: The most common situation, where left-truncated data arises, is when the event time $X$ is the age of the subject and persons are not observed from birth but rather from some other time $V$ corresponding to their entry into the study. The need for special care with left-truncated survival times is that an individual who enters after time = 0 "was not at risk for an observable [event]" until the study entry time; Therneau and Grambsch , Section 3.7.3. Such data can be handled with the Surv(startTime, stopTime, event) counting-process data formatting in the R survival package, which treats startTime as left truncated in a Cox model. This format also handles the time-varying covariates that you have. I worry a bit about your outcome criterion: My intention was to do a prognostic model using Cox regressions where one of the disease manifestations would be the outcome. The binary variables of relevant clinical manifestations of the disease would have been used as predictors. With multiple manifestations of the disease you have to be very careful. This might better be modeled as a multiple-risk model instead of focusing on one particular manifestation as the outcome. Work closely with clinical experts about just what should be modeled as outcome(s) and try to get some more experienced statistical help to deal with the problems raised by left truncation and multiple potential outcomes.
