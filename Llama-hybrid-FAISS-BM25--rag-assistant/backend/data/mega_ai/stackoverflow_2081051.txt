I did try to use Marshal.GetLastWin32Error() which returned 1, according to MSDN it means incorrect function. In the code I am trying to get the device number passing Intptr to buffer of size STORAGE_DEVICE_NUMBER (which is 12 bytes) from function DeviceIoControl in kernel32.dll. I've hit a dead end.
