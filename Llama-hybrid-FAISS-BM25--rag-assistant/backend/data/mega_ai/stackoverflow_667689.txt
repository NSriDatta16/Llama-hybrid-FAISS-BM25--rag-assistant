Why not use multiple memory areas for the streamed textures and pool by texture size? Insomniac has a paper about their texture streaming implementation on PS3. I suppose it could be helpful: link . For general allocation strategies to minimize fragmentation, maybe Doug Lea can help. But from my reading of your question, it sounds like you're overthinking it and I highly recommend a pooled approach. (Also running a defragment pass on write-combined memory doesn't sound particularly safe or fun.)
