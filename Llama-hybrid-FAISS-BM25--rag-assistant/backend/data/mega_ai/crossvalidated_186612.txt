I'm not sure what that prior represents, but from what you're looking to do, you should set up some Beta prior with your Bernoulli likelihood. The posterior distribution of a Beta-Bernoulli is: $$\sim Beta (a_0 + \sum{x_i} , b_0 + n - \sum{x_i})$$ where $\frac{a_0}{a_0 + b_0}$ is your prior conversion rate. The size of $a_{0}$ and $b_0$ represent the strength of belief in your prior. And $\sum{x_i}$ is the number of conversions you observe for a given day. Now how you want to model it is up to you. You could model a conversion rate per day, or a cumulative conversion rate. You'll want to update the model for new data that comes in each day. You also must assume that each data point is independent of the others, which is a strong (perhaps invalid) assumption, especially if you have repeat visitors. In the end you'll have a posterior distribution for $A$ and $B$. Then you could sample from those posteriors and count how many times $B > A$, which is your $P(B>A)$. You could also provide other posterior summaries, perhaps calculate a credible interval for $B - A$, or do any number of Bayesian posterior summaries. Also don't forget to calculate the power of the test to ensure you have a sufficient sample size.
