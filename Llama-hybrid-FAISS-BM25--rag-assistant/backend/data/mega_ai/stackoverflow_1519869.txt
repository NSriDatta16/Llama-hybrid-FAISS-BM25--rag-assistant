MsgWaitForMultipleObjects has very few uses in a traditional multi threaded program. It has some use in Games - where traditional non client frame elements are omitted and APIs like "MessageBox" and "DoDragDrop" are avoided... Usually it finds its best use in "UI worker" threads that don't host visible windows, but use the message queue as an inter thread messaging system and also need to wait on kernel handles. In your case, making a second thread does not seem avoidable. Ironically, PostThreadMessage + MsgWaitForMultipleObjects will probably be the easiest way to set up a reliable communication mechanism between the GUI thread and your "ui" worker thread.
