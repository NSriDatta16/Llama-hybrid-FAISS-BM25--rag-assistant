What are other good ways of finding out the degree of similarity between lists?

I have a ground truth list, call it A, and I have different methods for generating lists that should be somewhat similar.. I want to decide which method of these generates a list that is most similar to the ground truth.. The list consists of strings.. I am new to these stuff, I tried average precision and the results made sense, then I was trying to use Spearman rank correlation, but I ended up comparing something like A = ["abd", "abc", "cad"] and B = ["abd", "decf", "hhj", "cad", .. ] so the list sizes were different, is it even possible to use Spearman here? And what other methods can I use?
