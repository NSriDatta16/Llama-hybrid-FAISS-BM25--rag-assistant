I think you are confused. hcard is one specific microformat (among others): hCard is a simple, open, distributed format for representing people, companies, organizations, and places, using a 1:1 representation of vCard (RFC2426) properties and values in semantic HTML or XHTML. hCard is one of several open microformat standards suitable for embedding in HTML, XHTML, Atom, RSS, and arbitrary XML. Therefore you can have many hcards in a page, each representing one people, company, etc. E.g. in your company's site, one for each office or for people in the organisation
