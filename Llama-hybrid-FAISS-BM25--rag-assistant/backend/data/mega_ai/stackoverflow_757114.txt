Where do you store long/complete queries used in code?

Here's my situation. I've noticed that code gets harder to maintain when you keep embedding queries in every function that will use them. Some queries tend to grow very fast and tend to lose readability after concatenating every line. Another issue that comes with all of the concatenation is when you must test a specific query and paste it. You are forced to remove all of the " that held your query string together. So my question is, what methods are being used to separate queries from the code? I have tried searching but it doesn't look like it's the right thing because i'm not finding anything relevant. I'd like to note that views and stored procedure are not possible since my queries fetch data from a production database. Thank you.
