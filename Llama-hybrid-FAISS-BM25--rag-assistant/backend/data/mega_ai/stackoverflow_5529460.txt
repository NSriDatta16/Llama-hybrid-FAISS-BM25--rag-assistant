Encapsulating layouts in a published Android library

I want to release an SDK that contains my activity with its own layout. However, I don't want to publish my source code - just my reusable components. It seems that I can't create a JAR, because I want to create XML layouts for my activities and also possibly add drawables, etc. A library project is compiled only when the main project is compiled, so that doesn't hide my source code too. So how would you do this? Is there a stable workaround for putting your resource XMLs inside a JAR and then extracting them in runtime? Or something more elegant?
