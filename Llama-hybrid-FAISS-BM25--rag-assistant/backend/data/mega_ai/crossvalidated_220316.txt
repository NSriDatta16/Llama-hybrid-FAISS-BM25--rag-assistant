Summary The question misinterprets the coefficients. The software output shows that the log odds of the response don't depend appreciably on $X$, because its coefficient is small and not significant ($p=0.138$). Therefore the proportion of positive results in the data, equal to $100 - 19.95\% \approx 80\%$, ought to have a log odds close to the intercept of $1.64$. Indeed, $$\log\left(\frac{80\%}{20\%}\right) = \log(4) \approx 1.4$$ is only about one standard error ($0.22$) away from the intercept. Everything looks consistent. Detailed analysis This generalized linear model supposes that the log odds of the response $H$ being $1$ when the independent variable $X$ has a particular value $x$ is some linear function of $x$, $$\text{Log odds}(H=1\,|\,X=x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x.\tag{1}$$ The glm command in R estimated these unknown coefficients with values $$\hat\beta_0 = 1.641666\pm 0.2290133$$ and $$\hat\beta_1 = -0.0014039\pm 0.0009466.$$ The dataset contains a large number $n$ of observations with various values of $x$, written $x_i$ for $i=1, 2, \ldots, n$, which range from $82.3$ to $391.6$ and average $\bar x = 223.8$. Formula $(1)$ enables us to compute the estimated probabilities of each outcome, $\Pr(H=1\,|\,X=x_i)$. If the model is any good, the average of those probabilities ought to be close to the average of the outcomes. Since the odds are, by definition, the ratio of a probability to its complement, we can use simple algebra to find the estimated probabilities in terms of the log odds $$\widehat\Pr(H=1\,|\,X=x) = 1 - \frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(\hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 x\right)}.$$ As a nonlinear function of $x$, that's difficult to average. However, provided $\beta_1 x$ is small (much less than $1$ in size) and $1+\exp(\hat\beta_0)$ is not small (it exceeds $6$ in this case), we can safely use a linear approximation $$\frac{1}{1 + \exp\left(\hat\beta_0 + \hat\beta_1 x\right)} = \frac{1}{1 + \exp(\hat\beta_0)}\left(1 - \hat\beta_1 x \frac{\exp{\hat\beta_0}}{1 + \exp(\hat\beta_0)}\right) + O\left(\hat\beta_1 x\right)^2.$$ Since the $x_i$ never exceed $391.6$, $|\hat\beta_1 x_i|$ never exceeds $391.6\times 0.0014039 \approx 0.55$, so we're ok. Consequently, the average of the outcomes may be approximated as $$\eqalign{ \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \widehat\Pr(H=1\,|\,X=x) &\approx \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^n \left(1 - \frac{1}{1 + \exp(\hat\beta_0)}\left(1 - \hat\beta_1 x_i \frac{\exp{\hat\beta_0}}{1 + \exp(\hat\beta_0)}\right)\right)\\ &= 0.162238 + 0.000190814 \bar{x} \\ &= 20.4943\%. }$$ Although that's not exactly equal to the $19.95\%$ observed in the data, it is more than close enough, because $\hat\beta_1$ has a relatively large standard error. For example, if $\beta_1$ were increased by only $0.3$ of its standard error to $-0.0011271$, then the previous calculation would produce $19.95\%$ exactly .
