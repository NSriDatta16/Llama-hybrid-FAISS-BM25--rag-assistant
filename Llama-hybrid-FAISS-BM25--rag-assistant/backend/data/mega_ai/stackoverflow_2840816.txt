git stash blunder: git stash pop and ended up with merge conflicts

I did a git stash pop and ended up with merge conflicts. I removed the files from the file system and did a git checkout as shown below, but it thinks the files are still unmerged. I then tried replacing the files and doing a git checkout again and same result. I event tried forcing it with -f flag. Any help would be appreciated! chirag-patels-macbook-pro:haloror patelc75$ git status app/views/layouts/_choose_patient.html.erb: needs merge app/views/layouts/_links.html.erb: needs merge # On branch prod-temp # Changes to be committed: # (use "git reset HEAD ..." to unstage) # # modified: db/schema.rb # # Changed but not updated: # (use "git add ..." to update what will be committed) # (use "git checkout -- ..." to discard changes in working directory) # # unmerged: app/views/layouts/_choose_patient.html.erb # unmerged: app/views/layouts/_links.html.erb chirag-patels-macbook-pro:haloror patelc75$ git checkout app/views/layouts/_choose_patient.html.erb error: path 'app/views/layouts/_choose_patient.html.erb' is unmerged chirag-patels-macbook-pro:haloror patelc75$ git checkout -f app/views/layouts/_choose_patient.html.erb warning: path 'app/views/layouts/_choose_patient.html.erb' is unmerged
