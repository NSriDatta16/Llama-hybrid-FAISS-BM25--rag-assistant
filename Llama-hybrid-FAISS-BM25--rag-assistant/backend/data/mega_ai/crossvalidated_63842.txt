Why is 2-fold CV giving better results than 5-fold CV?

I am working on a binary classification problem with relatively few instances (e.g. ~30 instances out of which ~7 are positives). I have noticed that when using 2-fold the average classification performance of the best performing model is better than the best performing model with 5-fold. In fact, The best performing model in 2-fold CV gets the following scores across the two folds: [0.82, 0.82] ( avg. = 0.82 ). That model is different from the best one I get with 5-fold CV, which yields the following AUC scores: [0.4 , 1. , 0.75, 0.75, 0.25] ( avg = 0.64 ). This takes me to the following question: Which model should I use? And why would I ever get a better model when training with less data?
