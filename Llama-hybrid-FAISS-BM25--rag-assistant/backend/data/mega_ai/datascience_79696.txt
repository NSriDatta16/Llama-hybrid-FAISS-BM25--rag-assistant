When to use bayesian linear regression instead of linear regression?

When does it make sense to use a bayesian approach, maybe in context to linear regression ? To be more concrete: Assume you measure a certain number of devices and you wanna' check the linear relationship between, e.g., voltage and current. Why bayesian and/or why not? How would it be different?
