VB.NET Visual Inheritance: Friend VS Protected

Why is it that some components/controls will not be inherited visually in a child form if they are declared with the access modifier Friend vs when they are declared with Protected. For example, I've got a DataSet object in my Parent Form that was initially "Friend" (I drag and dropped it to the form, so it was shown as a control in the designer view), but I noticed that my Child Form did not inherit the control as expected. Once I changed it to "Protected", it showed up in my Child form as expected. I am aware that Protected allows the Child Form to modify the inherited control, but how exactly does this tie in to the issue I described above?
