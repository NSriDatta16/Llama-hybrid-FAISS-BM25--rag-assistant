SQL SSIS Help. Import an excel sheet into a temp table

I have a farily simple task of taking an Excel sheet and importing it into a SQL 2005 database table. I need to create an SSIS task for this. The Excel sheet does not have all the columns I need to make the insert directly into the permanent sql table, but I know how I could link out to other tables and get the columns that are missing. So I was wondering how I could import the Excel sheet into a #tempTable (or @VariableTable) and then one in a temp table I could just write my SQL Insert code (using the temptable as well as the other tables that I will link on) in a basic Execute SQL Task. But I am having trouble figuring out how to do this with SSIS. When I drag my excel source and try to link it to a SQL Server Destination the drop down doesn't have an option for temptables.
