It seems a fair question, what mathematics should I learn as a foundation for machine learning? Maybe it is the answer that is broad. As ML draws from so many disciplines. Others have suggested, Linear Algebra, Probability Theory, Statistics, Metric Spaces and many others which are all relevant. Perhaps a workable approach is to list some of the most popular ML algorithms take a look at them and fill in the mathematics you feel you are less comfortable with.
