Index needed for max(col)?

I'm currently doing some data loading for a kind of warehouse solution. I get an data export from the production each night, which then must be loaded. There are no other updates on the warehouse tables. To only load new items for a certain table I'm currently doing the following steps: get the current max value y for a specific column (id for journal tables and time for event tables) load the data via a query like where x > y To avoid performance issues (I load around 1 million rows per day) I removed most indices from the tables (there are only needed for production, not in the warehouse). But that way the retrieval of the max value takes some time...so my question is: What is the best way to get the current max value for a column without an index on that column? I just read about using the stats but I don't know how to handle columns with 'timestamp with timezone'. Disabling the index before load, and recreate it afterwards takes much too long...
