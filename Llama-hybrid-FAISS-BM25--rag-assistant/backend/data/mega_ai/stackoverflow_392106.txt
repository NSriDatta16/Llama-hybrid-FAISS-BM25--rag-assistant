There certainly are set, recognized patterns, as laid out nicely by the "gang of four"'s Design Patterns book . There are also patterns like CAB and SCSF that teams like the Microsoft Patterns and Practices team publishes. Does that mean that every pattern is covered? Certainly not. Developers and teams often come up with their own patterns that achieve their needs and that they use across their entire project. So we'd like to not reinvent the wheel - use patterns that are already out there - but don't feel that you're constrained to only what others are doing.
