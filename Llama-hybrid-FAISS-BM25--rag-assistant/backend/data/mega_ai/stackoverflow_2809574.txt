I had the same problem with the eclipse GAE plugin not "always" enhancing my classes so I installed the DataNucleus plugin to force it but I ran into a problem with the autogeneration of SerialVersionUIDs. I got an error saying "errors during build" but there were no compile errors. Uninstalled DataNucleus plugin and I was back to normal. They don't play well together, it seems. I'm using GAE v1.3.3.1 and I installed DataNucleus eclipse plugin v2.0.2 Cleaning the project works, even if it's not the most elegant solution.
