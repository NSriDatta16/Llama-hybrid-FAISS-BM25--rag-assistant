I got it to work using a different approach. I generate a unique key, register a callback function bound to the generated key. Then I load the window passing the key to it and have the window register itself so that a match can be made between the key and the window object. This solution takes some plumbing but I think its more elegant and more reliable than relying on timings. var _windowCloseHandlers = []; var _windowCounter = 0; var registerWindow = function(key, window) { var i; for (i = 0; i Then, in the partial view (note these are Coolite (Ext.Net) controls which generate ExtJs code): ' /> And finally, the window caller: loadWindow(#{ModalWindowPanel}, '/Customers/Details', {customerId: id }, function() { #{MainStore}.reload(); \\ This is the callback function that is called when the window is closed. });
