Resources for data science applications in finance/banking

What are good resources for data science applications in finance/banking ? I want to know about the following: Trends in finance/banking area What creative companies do in finance/banking area with data science Major open data sources in finance/banking in Canada I subscribed to several data science news but none of them focus on finance/banking. I need daily/weekly news and reports for my internship. This is my job and I will be evaluated based on this so it is very important for me to get enough information in time. Any suggestions? Thank you very much!
