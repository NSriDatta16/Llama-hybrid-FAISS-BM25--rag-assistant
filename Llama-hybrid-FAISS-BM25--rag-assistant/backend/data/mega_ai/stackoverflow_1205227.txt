Sounds like a job for cron . Execute crontab , and add an entry like so: #min hour date month day command 0 * * * * ssh user@host '(cd path/to/working/copy; svn update)' You may need to set up ssh passwordless authentication with ssh-agent so that it won't prompt. EDIT (per comments below): Assuming you have sufficient privileges to do so, run ssh user@host crontab -e Then add an entry like so: #min hour date month day command 0 * * * * (cd path/to/working/copy; svn update) You can ignore the part above the edit, unless your server doesn't allow you to use cron.
