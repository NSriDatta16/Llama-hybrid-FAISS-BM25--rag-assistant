There are a plethora of tools available to address the plethora of possible bottlenecks. A decent performance tuning strategy starts with measurement and consistent instrumentation of the given system. But performance tuning requires precious time and resources, and should only be pursued when it gives you the most bang for the buck, i.e. it provides the greatest improvement to achieving your website's objectives given the work required. If your website supports (or is ) a business or organization, you must continuously evaluate the business landscape and plan the next allocation of resources. This is entirely dependent on the particular industry. An engineer might focus on continual refinement of an existing system, but the project commissioners (be they an external client, or your company's management) must weigh the costs and benefits of all types of development, from improving an existing featureset, to adding new features, to addressing technical limitations affecting product usability (including performance issues). That's not to say engineers have no say in resource allocation, but their perspective is just one of many contributing to success.
