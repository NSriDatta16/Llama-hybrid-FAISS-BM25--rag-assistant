See Nick's blog for a working example. Basically on upload you need to pull the file from self.request.POST instead of get in order to get the more useful cgi.FieldStorage object. You can then read the mime type from file.type , save the type string to your entity along with the blob, and write it out with the response headers on download. Another option is to save file.name to your entity on upload, and then plug it into mimetypes.guess_type() to guess a type based on the file extension upon download.
