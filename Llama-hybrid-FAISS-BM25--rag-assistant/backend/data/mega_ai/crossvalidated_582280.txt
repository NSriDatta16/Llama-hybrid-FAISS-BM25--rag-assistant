The problem is twofold: You shouldn't subtract one. Just divide one by the other, and you'll get relative numbers 1, 2, 0.5 -- equivalent to 100 % (no change), 200 % (double) and 50 % (half.) Then to get the average relative change, you take the geometric mean : multiply the relative changes and take the root. $\sqrt[3]{1 × 2 × 0.5} = 1$ , leaving the value unchanged after all three steps.
