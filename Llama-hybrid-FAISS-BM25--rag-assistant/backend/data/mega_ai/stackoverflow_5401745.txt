Move search bar from header in home page in magento

I am a new to magento. I wanted to move the search bar from the header to the middle position on home page so that it displays only on the home page. I've read many related answers on the magento forum but all are trying to edit .mini-search element in boxes.css but unfortunately I don't have any such element in this file. So, how can I do this?
