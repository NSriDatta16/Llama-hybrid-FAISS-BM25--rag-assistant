GWT RequestFactory and multiple types

My GWT app has ten different kinds of entities. Right now I use plain old DTOs and transport them over GWT-RPC. This works well for cases like startup - I can pack them all into a single request. I'm looking at switching to RequestFactory because there are many times throughout the lifetime of the app (30 minutes, on average) when I just have to update one type of entity, and the unifying/bandwidth-saving features of RequestFactory are appealing. BUT: I don't see a way to download all of my initialization data in a single request when the app loads. I don't want to have to make ten requests to fetch all of the init data for my ten entity types. Is there a way to make a GeneralRequestContext, or something? I'd even be happy with a solution like: public interface InitDataProxy extends EntityProxy { public UserProxy getInitUsers(); public OrganizationProxy getInitOrganizations(); ... } public interface GeneralRequestContext extends RequestContext { Request getInitData(); } But this won't work because I don't want to have to actually back InitDataProxy with anything, I just want to use it to combine a bunch of different types of Proxies in a single request. So: Is there a way to receive multiple, unrelated types of EntityProxy in a single request? I would also be happy enough making a normal gwt-rpc request to go outside of RequestFactory for this data, but I don't want to have to implement duplicate DTOs to run next to RequestFactory's proxies, and write custom code to copy the DTOs into them!
