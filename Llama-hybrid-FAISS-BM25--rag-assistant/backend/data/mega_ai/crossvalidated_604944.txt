Is it possible of an imbalanced dataset to benefit from the results of the same dataset after balancing?

I am new to data science & machine learning I am using Weka platform to work on a classification problem with an imbalanced dataset. My question is: can I apply a feature selection method to a balanced copy of the dataset then I use the resulted subset of features in the original dataset (imbalanced)? I my question is not clear, I will explain it by the following detail steps: I made two copies of the dataset, the original imbalanced dataset and the balanced dataset. I applied a feature selection method to the balanced copy. (at the end of this step, a subset of features is selected) In the imbalanced copy, I retained the selected features and removed the unselected ones. For example: Assume that you have an imbalanced dataset with 5 features: a, b, c, d, and e features. You balanced the entire dataset. Then you applied a feature selection method. You got three selected features: a, b, and c. After that, you went back to the imbalanced dataset (the original one) and removed d and e features. Then you completed your procedures on the imbalanced dataset with a, b, and c features. Is this procedure correct?
