Some considerations must be made before ultimately deciding on a solution. For instance, must this wizard be completed before moving on to the actual application, or is it something that can be entirely bypassed by (for example) signing in from a different computer? Assuming it's ok to bypass it, I would create a namespace (for instance, getting_started) with three nested resources: photo, profile, and friends. There is really no need to track which step a user is on, as you can simply forward from one step to the next after submission, and add back and skip buttons where necessary. The most important point, though, is to namespace this wizard and avoid polluting the "normal" controllers for these resources with wizard-specific actions. In this way, things stay REST-ful and organized. Routes might look something like: namespace :getting_started do resource :photo, :only => [:edit, :update] resource :profile, :only => [:edit, :update] resources :friends, :only => [:index, :create] end
