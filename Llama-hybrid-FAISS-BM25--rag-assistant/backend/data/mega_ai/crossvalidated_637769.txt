A potential problem with this approach would be in assuming the interaction identified via RF is appropriate for the interactions in the logistic regression model. Since Leo Breiman (Stats, U-C Berkeley) recommended using 5,000-10,000 trees for RF (i.e., "don't be stingy"), I wouldn't want to "look" through 5,000-10,000 trees for anything. Moreover, the interaction between predictors in logistic will be preserved throughout all the partial derivative calculations in the score vector and Hessian matrix during Newton-Raphson iteration. RF, however, is a derivative-free method essentially based on bootstrapping and using cutpoints (like CART), so it's a not a small jump to say what happens in RF regarding interaction can describe interaction in a logistic regression model.
