I also struggled with the set up of my application tests. After I read your post I found another description; which has one thing different. The purpose is to set the application target name different from the original application name. Here's the website . The say: for all Configurations set the "Build→Packaging→Product Name" to something distinct from the original target This solved my problem that the debugger didn't stop at the set breakpoints. I think this also solves your problem when switching from the tests back to the app. Best Wolfgang
