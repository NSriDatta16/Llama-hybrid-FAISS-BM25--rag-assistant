I think development by non-developers is doomed to failure. It's difficult enough when developers try it. What's the going failure rate? 50% or higher? My advice would be to either buy the closest commercial product you can find or hire somebody to help you develop a custom solution with your non-developer maintenance characteristics in mind. Being a developer means keeping a million details in mind at once and caring about details like version control, deployment, testing, etc. Most people who don't care about those things quickly tire of the complexity. By all means involve the domain experts. But don't saddle them with development and maintenance as well. You could be putting your organization at risk with a poorly done solution. If it's important, do it right.
