i don't know especially about analytics, but in general Google uses (ehm.. invented?) Map/Reduce . There are several open source databases which support using Map/Reduce calls, e.g. CouchDb , which is a document-oriented database . These types of application use Geolocation for determining the location of the user on base of the ip address. Additional information is found out via JavaScripts opjects window.navigator (useragent, platform, language, ...) and screen (dimensions, color depth) edit: there is evidence that google uses it's BigTable-DB-Engine (which corresponds to MapReduce) for reader, maps & youtube. on dbms2.com , they even say that analytics uses MapReduce (could be categorized as "insider knowledge").
