There are a number of feature selection techniques in random Forests. As Dij pointed out, RFE is a typical strategy used in random forests. Try the ones out below and see if that helps as well. These are just a few of the techniques available as R packages - some are easier to install than others, but give them a shot. AUCRF : Urrea, V., & Calle, M. (2012). AUCRF: variable selection with random forest and the area under the curve. R package version 1.1. EFS : Neumann, U., Genze, N., & Heider, D. (2017). EFS: an ensemble feature selection tool implemented as R-package and web-application. BioData mining, 10(1), 21. binomialRF : Zaim, S. R., Kenost, C., Lussier, Y. A., & Zhang, H. H.
