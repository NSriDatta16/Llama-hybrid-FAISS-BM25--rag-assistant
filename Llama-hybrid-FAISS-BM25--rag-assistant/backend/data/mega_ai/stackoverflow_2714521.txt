In VB.NET, passing a property by reference updates the actual property, not the underlying value. Thus, when Foo completes, the CLR calls the Property Set method to update the property value with whatever the new value is at the end of the function (even if it hasn't changed). This behaviour is described in the VB.NET Language Specification (Reference Parameters section, last 3 paragraphs): http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa711958(v=VS.71).aspx
