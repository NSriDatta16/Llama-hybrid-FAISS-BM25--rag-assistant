Working Effectively with Legacy Code is my bible when it comes to migrating code without tests into a unit-tested environment, and it also provides a lot of insight into what makes code easy to test and how to test it. I also found Test Driven Development by Example and Pragmatic Unit Testing: in C# with NUnit to be a decent introduction to unit testing in that environment. One simple approach to starting TDD is to start writing tests first from this day forward and make sure that whenever you need to touch your existing (un-unit-tested) code, you write passing tests that verify existing behavior of the system before you change it so that you can re-run those tests after to increase your confidence that you haven't broken anything.
