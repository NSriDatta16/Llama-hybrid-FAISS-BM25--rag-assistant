how to generate String difference vectors?

a bit of a vague question but I am looking for pointers as to how can I generate String diff vectors in C++. The scenario is such that given a paragraph I want to store the various differences(Edit, cut copy paste etc.) it goes through in a draft mode to review Audit history. Any hints in this regard will be really appreciated.
