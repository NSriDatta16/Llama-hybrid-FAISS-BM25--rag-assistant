Cluster analysis of time series data with a few points in time

I have asked the question here before but have not been able to resolve it. I have data from 150 participants who were asked about their emotional state at 3 points in time. There are 28 different emotional states, each asked on a 6-point scale of intensity. My interest is to find out if some clusters can be interpreted in these emotional state change patterns. Could you please tell me a good way to calculate this? I am using R as my statistical software. The data is in the following form. PP Time1: Happy Time2: Happy Time3: Happy Time1: Angry Time2: Angry ... 1 4 4 5 1 2 ... 2 2 1 1 3 3 ... 3 2 3 4 2 2 ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... I am not familiar with methods of clustering. I could not find a good method of clustering for our data, as most of the explanations of clustering are based on a single dimension or a single sample. Moreover, I found that most of the clustering methods for time-series data are for data with many more time points, and I do not understand whether it is appropriate to apply them to data with 3 time points. Thank you.
