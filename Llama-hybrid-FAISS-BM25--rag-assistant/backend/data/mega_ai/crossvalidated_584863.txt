We can find both $\hat{b}_{1, \text{model } 1}$ and $\hat{b}_{1, \text{model } 2}$ are closed form (take the appropriate element of $(X^T X)^{-1}X y$ ) thus the difference between them is also available in closed form. I do not think we can, in general, offer a simpler or more elegant solution than computing their differences because matrix inversion is a complex operation. Nonetheless, it is a closed form solution.
