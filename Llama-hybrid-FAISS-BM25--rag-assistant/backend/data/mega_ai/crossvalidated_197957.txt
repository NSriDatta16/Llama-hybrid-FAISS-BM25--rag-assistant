Calculating the value of k from k = a/b (where data for a and b have been recorded)

Ok this is a very simple question but one which has been troubling me... Lets say that I want to calculate the equilibrium constant K for a chemical reaction where A -> B K = [A]/[B] where [A] is the concentration of A and [B] is the concentration of B at equilibrium I have measured the quantities [A] and [B] and thus have two sets of data. To calculate K should I: i) Take the ratio of [A] and [B] at each data point and then calculate a mean average of all of the K values? OR ii) Plot a graph of [A] against [B] and use the gradient of the trendline as the value of K? My instinct tells me it is the former as the straight line plot on excel has a non-zero intercept (which is not reasonable) If it is option i) can you explain to me why it is so?
