Javascript and website loading time optimization

I know that best practice for including javascript is having all code in a separate .js file and allowing browsers to cache that file. But when we begin to use many jquery plugins which have their own .js , and our functions depend on them, wouldn't it be better to load dynamically only the js function and the required .js for the current page? Wouldn't that be faster, in a page, if I only need one function to load dynamically embedding it in html with the script tag instead of loading the whole js with the js plugins? In other words, aren't there any cases in which there are better practices than keeping our whole javascript code in a separate .js ?
