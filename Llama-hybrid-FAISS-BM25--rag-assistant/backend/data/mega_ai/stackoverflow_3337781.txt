The problem only occurs when the DataGrid is embedded inside a ScrollViewer like: This makes sense because this configuration causes the whole DataGrid to be drawn at the same time (to be able to size the ScrollViewer's client area correctly). In essence, it overrides the built-in virtualization behavior of the DataGrid, which implements its own ScrollBars so that not all of its content has to be placed in the layout simultaneously. In other words, embedding a DataGrid inside a ScrollViewer is rarely needed because the DataGrid has its own automatic scrolling.
