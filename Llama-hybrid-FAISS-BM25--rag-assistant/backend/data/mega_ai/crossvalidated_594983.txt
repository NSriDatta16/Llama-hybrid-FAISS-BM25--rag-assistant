An event itself is neither Bayesian nor non-Bayesian; it is just an event. The method of inference you use to come to your conclusion may or may not be Bayesian, depending on how you did your reasoning. Bayesian inference operates by incorporating prior information into the inference using Bayes rule (see here for an intuited view of what this means). As you can see from the linked post, Bayesian inference can be captured in a symmetry principle. Suppose we start from a state where we have no knowledge about the occurrence or non-occurrence of an event, and the truth or falsity of a hypothesis. If we consider that the occurrence of the event makes the hypothesis $x$ % more (less) likely and likewise the truth of the hypothesis makes the event $x$ % more (less) likely, and if we make our inference consistently on that basis (i.e., applying the rules of probability in a way that is consistent with that symmetry) then that is Bayesian reasoning. In the present case, the prior information is that the roommate rarely eats cereal and the observed evidence is that there is an empty cereal bowl, milk and cereal crumbs in a place where only you and your roommate are expected to be. Bayesian reasoning would go like this: (a) If my roommate ate cereal today it is $80 \%$ more likely that I would observe that bowl, milk, crumbs, etc. (compared to when this hypothesis is unknown); (b) my roommate rarely eats cereal, so the baseline probability that he ate cereal today is only $5 \%$ ; (c) Therefore, having observed the evidence, it is $80 \%$ more likely than usual that he ate cereal today, so the posterior probability he ate cereal today is $9 \%$ . If your reasoning was something like that, you could reasonably describe it as Bayesian.
