Fit a linear function to multiple measurements

I have the data of a measurement of the same value that was repeated multiple times to decrease random noise. There are multiple values per input-value (time), an example could look like this: Time|Measurement 1|Measurement 2|Measurement 3|Measurement 4 ... x_t |y_t1 |y_t2 |y_t3 |y_t4 0 |value |value |value |value ... 1 |value |value |value |value ... 2 |value |value |value |value ... 3 ... ... How can I find the linear function $y_t=\beta x_t +c$ that fits "best" to the data? Also, how can I then calculate the standard deviation/error on the slope and intercept? One approach I thought of, is to just take the average of all the measurements and then perform linear regression on the average measurement but that's probably not the best method.
