Your dataset is very much imbalanced. There is one major class (neutral), and two minor classes (positive and negative). If you build a machine learning algorithm to solve this classification problem, there is a high risk that the predictions are going to be biased towards to majority class. The solutions to prevent this problem is: Oversampling the minority classes, creating synthetic data points etc. (Such as SMOTE) Down-sampling the majority class. The evaluation of the model can be completed by using AUC Score, Recall, Precision, F1 Scores.
