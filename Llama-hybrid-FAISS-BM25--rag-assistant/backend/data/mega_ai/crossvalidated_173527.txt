Note that there is a subtle but important difference between multi label problems, in which each instance may belong to several classes, and multi class problems, in which each instance belongs to one of $\geq 2$ classes. I will discuss both briefly, but based on the question I suspect you are referring to multiclass problems. Multilabel problems can essentially be broken down into sets of binary problems without much loss of information. The only situations where a true multilabel formulation has advantages, at least in theory, is when some combinations of labels are simply not possible, which you cannot enforce cleanly in a set of binary learning problems. Multiclass problems are often best not split up into a set of binary problems because some information may be lost. Ofcourse, this only applies if the learning technique effectively has a natural multiclass formulation (e.g., SVM does not, but neural networks and decision trees do). One of the big benefits of doing pure multiclass classification is that you typically have more data to learn from, which allows better discrimination between subtlely distinct classes. Additionally, there is often an obvious computational advantage in multiclass formulations which features no redundancy in contrast to sets of binary formulations (regardless of your binarization scheme, be it 1-v-1, 1-v-all, ...).
