as3 - getting library symbols from an Assets class

I have created an assets.swf, in which I want to keep all my symbols. Then, I have created an Assets class which does the embedding. It looks like this: public class Assets extends MovieClip { [Embed(source="assets.swf", symbol="MyBox")] public static var MyBox:Class; public function Assets() { } } Now, in some other class, I want to create a new box: import com.company.Assets; ... public function Game() { var myBox:MovieClip = new Assets.MyBox(); addChild(myBox); } I know this in incorrect, and I get "TypeError: Error #1007: Instantiation attempted on a non-constructor." How can I get access to the assets in the Assets class?
