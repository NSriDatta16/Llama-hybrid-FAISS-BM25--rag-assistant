This seems like an interesting problem. I haven't encountered such problems before, but however following are my observations: The problem with your approach might be because of the lack of numerical meaning in your numerical data. This happens when your input is for e.g. categorical data with numbers. In such case, try encoding your input data and then pass them to your neural Network.If the dimensionality goes too high, try using PCA. The problem which you're trying to solve is a classic Hashing problem. Hence I agree to @Brian Spiering's answer of using approximate Hashmaps. Hope this helps :)
