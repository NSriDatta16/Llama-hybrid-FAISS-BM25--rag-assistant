In Interface Builder, can't set a UITabBarCotnroller's "Top Bar" to Navigation Controller

I create a new XIB file, drag a UITabBarController in it, and then try to set the Top Bar to Navigation Bar. No matter what I do, it goes back to Unspecified. I think I should be able to set the Top Bar to Navigation Bar so I can lay out my views assuming I've got both a tab bar and a navigation bar, shouldn't I? Is this intended behaviour???
