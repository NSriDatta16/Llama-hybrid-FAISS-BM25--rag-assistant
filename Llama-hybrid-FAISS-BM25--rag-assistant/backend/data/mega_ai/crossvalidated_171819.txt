Analyzing data with linear regression and logistic regression?

I want to analyze the math score of high school students between 2009 and 2014 in the downtown of a city. The aim of the investigation is to identify the factors that affect the math score. In the methodology I am going to use the following models: Linear regression and Logistic regression Suppose that the math scores fall between 0.0 and 10.0 , for the logistic regression model if the math score is greater than or equal to 6.0, the score is assigned to class 1 (approved) otherwise the math score is assigned to class 0 (reprobate) Finally I am going to compare those models. Is correct to use logistic regression in this problem? Is there any loss of information and how can it affect the conclusions of the research?
