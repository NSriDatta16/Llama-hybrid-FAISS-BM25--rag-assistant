How many tasks can task scheduler run simultaneously

How many tasks can task scheduler run at the same time? I have set up three backup tasks from within SQLyog, all to start running at 12:00 am and run at subsequent 4 hours until midnight. Each task will backup all tables from three different databases to a network attached storage. Will there be any impact on the MySQL Server performance or is there any chance for a task to be missed? Thank you for any input.
