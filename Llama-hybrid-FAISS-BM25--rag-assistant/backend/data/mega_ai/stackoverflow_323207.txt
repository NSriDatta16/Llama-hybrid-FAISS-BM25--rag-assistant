Wow - ok got it. I should have paid more attention to exactly what this meant (MSDN) How to: Create a Publisher Policy Important Note: The publisher policy assembly cannot be added to the global assembly cache unless the original publisher policy file is located in the same directory as the assembly . That requirement is, frankly, so bizarre that it didn't register. The original policy file, that was compiled into the assembly i'm trying to add to the gac, has to be in the same folder as the policy assembly as you add the policy assembly.
