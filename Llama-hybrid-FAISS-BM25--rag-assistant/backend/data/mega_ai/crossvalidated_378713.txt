Sign of coefficient in single variable logistic regression seems to contradict graphical analysis

I have a 5-level ordinal independent variable ('ACT1_2') and a Boolean output variable ('target'). ACT1_2 is a response to a survey question. When I was doing some exploratory data analysis, I graphed the percentage of respondents who responded True within each value of ACT1_2. I got the following graph: There seems to be a pretty obvious positive association with increasing values of ACT1_2 and feeling like one is able to handle unexpected expenses. However, when I fit a logistic regression model using this variable, I got a negative value for its coefficient. I read that this could be explained by the presence of other variables (although I did try to handle multicollinearity by making sure all my VIFs were less than 10), but the coefficient stayed negative even when I fit a logistic regression model with ACT1_2 as the only variable. How can I reconcile these two findings? Relevant code is reproduced below. import pandas as pd import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import statsmodels.api as sm %matplotlib inline df = pd.read_csv('https://www.consumerfinance.gov/documents/5614/NFWBS_PUF_2016_data.csv') # Remove null values df = df[(df['FWB1_1'] != -1) & (df['FWB1_1'] != -4) & (df['ACT1_2'] != -1)] # Create target variable df['target'] = df['FWB1_1'] > 3 # Frequency table for plotting values freq_table = pd.crosstab(df['ACT1_2'], df['target']) num_categories=5 x_vals = np.arange(num_categories) + 1 y_vals = np.empty(num_categories) # Loop through categories for i in np.arange(num_categories): # Calculate percentage of True responses within category y_vals[i] = freq_table.loc[i+1, True] / np.sum(freq_table.iloc[i,0:2]) _ = plt.bar(x_vals, y_vals) _ = plt.xlabel('ACT1_2') _ = plt.ylabel('% of True Responses') X = df['ACT1_2'].values y = df['target'].values logit_model=sm.Logit(y,X) result=logit_model.fit() print(result.summary2()) Optimization terminated successfully.
