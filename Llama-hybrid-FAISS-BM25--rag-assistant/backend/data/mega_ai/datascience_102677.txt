I hope I'm phrasing this correctly. You can call it as a attribute from the best estimator, i.e. grid_model.best_estimator_.oob_score_ so you can't really use grid_model.oob_score_ because gridsearchcv does not have such an attribute; but you can call the best instance of the random forest model, then call the attribute.
