Run an async function in another thread

I'm evaluating the Async CTP. How can I begin execution of an async function on another thread pool's thread? static async Task Test() { // Do something, await something } static void Main( string[] args ) { // Is there more elegant way to write the line below? var t = TaskEx.Run( () => Test().Wait() ); // Doing much more in this same thread t.Wait(); // Waiting for much more then just this single task, this is just an example }
