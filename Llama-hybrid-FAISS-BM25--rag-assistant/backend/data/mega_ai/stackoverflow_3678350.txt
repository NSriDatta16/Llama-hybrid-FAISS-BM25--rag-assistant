Emacs does not record what was your line before calling fill-paragraph . So the only thing you can do is C-_ which runs the command undo. It can undo your fill-paragraph command but only if it is the preceding command call. If you want to put a multi-line paragraph on one line you could do like this : Select the region C-M-% C-q C-j RET SPACE RET !
