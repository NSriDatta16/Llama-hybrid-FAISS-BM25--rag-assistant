Combining Multiple jQuery Scripts

I'm trying to create a simple portfolio site for a friend of mine based around his drawings and paintings. The layout is relatively simple but is proving to be very difficult to implement. I have three jquery scripts on the page that each perform a specific function. 1) bgStretcher - Stretches a series of background images to fill a user's window. 2) collapse - Simple collapsable menu system 3) galleryview - Basic no frills slideshow gallery Currently, bgstretcher and collapse are on one page called nav.shtml (http://yungchoi.com/nav.shtml) and the gallery on gallery.shtml(http://yungchoi.com/gallery.shtml). Seperatley they work fine, but when I call the nav page via SSI ( test.shtml ), The code seems to run into problems and becomes disabled. The solutions I've found all lead to utilizing the noConflict function in jquery (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2656360/use-multiple-jquery-and-jquery-ui-libraries), (http://hubpages.com/hub/How-to-use-jQuery_noConflict), but everytime I've tried inserting it and changing my code, everything gets messed up again. I've also organized each script's files into separate folders and directories but that hasn't helped either. My experience is in graphic and web design, so my coding skills are not the greatest. I do know the basics, but rewriting jquery code was not something I ever learned so I might not be understanding how to correctly fix this problem. If someone could clearly and easily explain what I would need to do to make these all work together, I'd appreciate it greatly. Thanks!
