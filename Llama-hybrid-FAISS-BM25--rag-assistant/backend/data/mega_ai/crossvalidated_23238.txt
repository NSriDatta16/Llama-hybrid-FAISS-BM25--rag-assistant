Cross validation and ordinal logistic regression

I am trying to understand cross-validation for ordinal logistic regression. The aim of the game is to validate the model used in an analysis... I first construct a toy data set: set.seed(1) N 0) ) ) Now, I fit the model it using lrm in the package rms . require("rms") fit fit Logistic Regression Model lrm(formula = y ~ x1 + x2 + x3, x = TRUE, y = TRUE) Model Likelihood Discrimination Rank Discrim. Ratio Test Indexes Indexes Obs 10000 LR chi2 1165.46 R2 0.126 C 0.664 1 2837 d.f. 3 g 0.779 Dxy 0.328 2 2126 Pr(> chi2) |Z|) y>=2 2.1048 0.0656 32.06 =3 1.0997 0.0630 17.45 I understand the second part of the outcome: the coefficients I put in the model are here (it is almost perfect with N = 100000 ). The sign is reversed because in my model I used the coeffs to compute the odds of being $\le 1$, and $\le 2$, here it’s the other way, I think there’s not much issues there. However I don’t understand the discrimination and rank discrimination indexes . Can you help me?! Some pointers? Things are worse when we turn to cross validation... > validate(fit, method="cross") index.orig training test optimism index.corrected n Dxy 0.3278 0.3278 0.3290 -0.0012 0.3291 40 R2 0.1260 0.1260 0.1313 -0.0053 0.1313 40 Intercept 0.0000 0.0000 -0.0072 0.0072 -0.0072 40 Slope 1.0000 1.0000 1.0201 -0.0201 1.0201 40 Emax 0.0000 0.0000 0.0056 0.0056 0.0056 40 D 0.1164 0.1165 0.1186 -0.0021 0.1186 40 U -0.0002 -0.0002 -0.8323 0.8321 -0.8323 40 Q 0.1166 0.1167 0.9509 -0.8342 0.9509 40 B 0.1865 0.1865 0.1867 -0.0001 0.1867 40 g 0.7786 0.7786 0.7928 -0.0142 0.7928 40 gp 0.1472 0.1472 0.1478 -0.0007 0.1478 40 Mmffff? What’s this? How do I interpret this? The man page gives few explaination, I don’t have access to this paper ... and I feel overwhelmed by an ocean of complexity. Please help!
