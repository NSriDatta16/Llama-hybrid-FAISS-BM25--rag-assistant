Flex chart ItemRollOver behavior

I'm trying to prevent a default chart item roll over highlight in a Spark column chart. If you look at any of the chart examples on this page , when you roll over any of the chart series items, they turn a darkened shade of their original colour. This is what I want to prevent. So far I have had no luck with using the itemRollOverColor property, as this only allows you to set it to one specific colour for the whole chart (my app has several different coloured series on the chart at once). Also, trying to leverage the itemRollOver event (with preventDefault() etc) hasn't worked either. Does anyone have any idea what I am missing here? Thanks for reading guys
