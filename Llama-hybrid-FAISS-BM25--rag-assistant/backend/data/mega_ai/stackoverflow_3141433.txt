TPT and foreign key issue

I have a problem with TPT inheritance + foreign key. I'm working on a web application with multi language support, including translating dynamic content. Here's my tables: Language ============= Id, Name ProcessingAgent ==================== Id, some other fields LocalizedProcessingAgent ========================================================= LocalizedProcessingAgentId, Name, Description, LanguageId As you already guessed, I moved the columns which should be translated from ProcessingAgent to LocalizedProcessingAgent . On EF side, I made a TPT inheritance, so ProcessingAgent is a base class of LocalizedProcessingAgent . I'm new to EF, this is my first project I moved on and one of it's strange behavior really confuses me. When I generate EF classes from DB, LocalizedProcessingAgent has a Navigation Property Language (Because of LanguageId ). The problem is that Language property is null after I query the db: LocalizedProcessingAgentRecord l = db.ProcessingAgents .OfType ().First(p => p.Id == 1); //l.Language is null So the foreign key Navigation Property is not filled for some reason, I don't know why. This happens only when I query derived entities, in this case LocalizedProcessingAgentRecord . Any ideas? here's EF xml markup: http://dl.dropbox.com/u/3055964/ef.xml
