class is not a standard function in Lua. You don't say if you've borrowed it from Roberto, rolled your own, or what. But my guess is that you want to change the new method so that it does a deep copy of the prototype instead of a shallow copy: function deep_copy(v) if type(v) == 'table' then local u = { } for k, v in pairs(v) do u[k] = v end setmetatable(u, getmetatable(v)) return u else return v end end (Alert: I haven't tried to compile this code, let alone run it.)
