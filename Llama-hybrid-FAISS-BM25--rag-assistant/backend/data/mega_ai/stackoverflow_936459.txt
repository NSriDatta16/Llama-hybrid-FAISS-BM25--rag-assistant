Is it possible to do custom grouping in the ASP.NET ListView control?

You can only define a GroupItemCount in the ListView, but what if you want to do grouping based on a property of the items in the data source? Sort of an ad-hoc group by. The data source is sorted on this property. I have seen some examples where some markup in the ItemTemplate was conditionally show, but I want to leverage the GroupTemplate if possible. Is this possible?
