For me (in Chrome 8), the problem is caused by the margin on the H1. Specifically, Chrome's user agent stylesheet is inserting: h1 { display: block; font-size: 2em; font-weight: bold; margin: 0.67em 0px; } The extra height to this h1 causes the contentleft div to start directly underneath the testContainer div. Setting a margin of 0 removes the problem for me in Chrome 8. Note the instructions for setting up 960.gs mention the use of the reset.css stylesheet: which should also remove this problem. It's generally good practice to include a reset stylesheet anyway, so if you're learning about the 960 grid system you should include this stylesheet.
