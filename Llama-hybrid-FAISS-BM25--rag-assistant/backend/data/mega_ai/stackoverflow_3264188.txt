UIImageView with strange behaviours with DownArrow.png

I have an image under Resources group named "DownArrow.png" Open your viewController.xib Drag & drop an imageview select imageview & press command+1 ( for attribute inspector ) now set image name DownArrow.png save your viewController.xib close it now reopen it. you will find imageview with different image ( which is really a downArrow ) imageView image name property will have now "DownArrow" only instead of "DownArrow.png" I am using iPhone SDK 3.2 When you run your program, you want be able to see that image. Edit: Just drag & drop UIImageView into your viewController.xib Now set the imagename property to only "DownArrow" Remove Opaque checkmark You will see a down arrow in image view - but not while executing program. Similarly, I found working "RightArrow", "LeftArrow", "TopArrow" & "DownArrow".
