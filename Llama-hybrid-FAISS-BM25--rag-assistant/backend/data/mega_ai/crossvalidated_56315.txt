If you are using Random Forest or Neural Network putting this number as 0 is OK, because they will be able to figure out that 0 is distinctly different from other values (if it is in fact different). Other way around is adding of a categorical variable yes/no in addition to time variable. But all in all, in this particular case I don't see a real issue - 0.1 weeks of breastfeeding is close to 0 and effect will be very similar, so it looks like a pretty continuous variable to me with 0 not standing out as something distinct.
