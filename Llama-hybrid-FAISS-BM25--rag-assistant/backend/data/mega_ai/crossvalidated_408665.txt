I think linear algebra is absolutely essential to the data scientist. A card carrying data scientist should have more than just a comprehensive knowledge of what tools are out there, but he or she should also have the ability to compare them, to develop new tools, and, when a job simply can't be solved by any tool, be able to explain why. Linear algebra (and calculus) is useful for the following essential tasks that a data scientist should be able to do: Deriving first and second order derivatives and gradients for multivariate expressions Solving complex systems of equations Comparing the relative efficiency of two estimators Showing that an estimator (of a parameter, of a density function) is minimax, unbiased, or consistent Understanding the performance and behavior of nonlinear systems and their dependence on initial conditions Showing that the inverse gamma prior is conjugate for a Bayesian linear regression Showing the n-consistency of order-statistic estimators like the median As a master level statistician, I have had to use algebra (maths and calculus included) to prove a few things: Derive a variance estimate for a marginal standardization estimate of relative risk from logistic regression Prove that the "information" of a clinical trial vis-a-vis blinded conditional power is the same as sample size. Derive an EM algorithm to maximize likelihood for truncated data and missing data Prove that a bootstrap combined with multiple imputation gives 95% CIS with accurate coverage
