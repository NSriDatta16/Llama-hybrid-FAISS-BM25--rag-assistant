Do I need a Bonferroni correction?

My study has me running several regression analyses to investigate my hypothesis, and I am struggling with the multiple comparisons problem. I have three separate metabolites as predictor variables, and four other covariates in each model. (Running each metabolite in separate models is typical for these metabolites.) I am running both logistic regression analyses and linear regression for each metabolite. The outcome variable is the same for the respective sets of regression analyses (it was dichotomized for logistic regression and left continuous for the linear regression). I've been through every note I've ever taken, all my books, and a lot of the internet, and I'm still not sure about the Bonferroni correction. I know it's probably a simple problem, but I'll be grateful for any and all help with it. Thanks!
