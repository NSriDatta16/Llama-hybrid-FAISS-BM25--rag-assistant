Bugs uncovered during the sprint, belonging to that sprint should be fixed automaticly as if the task/story wasn't done to begin with. Bugs emerging from previous sprints could be entered into a bug-backlog and prioritized just like the normal backlog. EDIT: Just realized that by mentioning the "bug-backlog" i open up for the "multiple backlogs" which is a bad idea. A better way could be to mark the entry in the backlog with a bug flag or just accept it as any other story in the backlog. The number of severe bugs emerging in a sprint should be minimal as everything is already tested before accepted and delivered to the project owner at the end of the sprint. In reality it shouldn't impact the graph since you will commit to fixing a certain amount of bugs (by the choise of the PO - some bugs have lower priority than new functionality) and when bugs emerge from a sprint itself, well the task really wasn't done so it's ok to realize that and spend time fixing it. EDIT: Realized something else - sometimes working on a scrum team won't always protect you from the reality of having to maintain other applications, support, etc. While this really sucks and makes the whole idea of being on a team with a single backlog and focus not really work, the reality is often that you need to reserve a fixed number of hours a week for support/maintain. Don't encourage this, but if this is the reality try and assign a single person (on rotation so (s)he doesn't turn sad) each week a fixed number of hours dedicated to said support role. This way, you know what to expect since velocity is relative - it will somehow seem like a smaller impact on the sprints.
