When you identify an ARIMA model you should be simultaneously identifying Pulses/Level Shifts/Seasonal Pulses and/or Local Time Trends. You can get some reading material on Intervention Detection procedures. I recommend "Time Series Analysis: Univariate and Multivariate Methods" by David P. Reilly and William W. S. Wei . You may have to pursue commercial software like SAS/SPSS/AUTOBOX to get any useful results as the free software I have seen is wanting. In passing, I have contributed major technical improvements in this area to AUTOBOX. EDIT: An even better approach is to identify the outliers using the rigorous ARIMA method plus Intervention Detection procedures leading to robust ARIMA parameters and a good forecast. Now consider developing simulated forecasts incorporating re-sampled residuals free of pulse effects. In this way, you get the best of both worlds viz a good model and more realistic uncertainty statements for the forecasts which don't assume that the estimated model parameters are the population values.
