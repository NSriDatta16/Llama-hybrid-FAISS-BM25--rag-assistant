I would use a lognormal regression, since sales are usually quite skewed and also the result of a lognormal regression is easier to interpret. Create a data matrix with $n+m$ rows. Each row represents one day. The variable $Y$ will be created by concatenating the vectors $x_1$ and $x_2$ . The variable $X$ will be next in the matrix and will contain only zeros and ones. There will be $m$ zeros and $n$ ones indicating days berfore and after price reduction. Finally, we add the variable number of travellers ( $N$ ), which is concatenated vectors $y_1$ and $y_2$ under your notation. If you are using R, then your model will be as follows: fit = lm(log(Y) ~ X, offset = log(N), data = yourData) #statistical significance of sales change coef(summary(fit))[2,] #effect size (by what percentage has the profile increased) effect_size = (exp(coef(summary(fit))[2,1])-1)*100 paste0("The average profit per traveller increased by ",round(effect_size)," percent.") Why is there an offset in the regression? Because your dependent variable is not sales ( $Y$ ) but sales per traveller ( $Y/N$ ): $log(Y/N) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1$ $log(Y) - log(N) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1$ $log(Y) = \beta_0 + \beta_1X_1 + log(N)$
