Use of "extern" storage class specifier in C

How does the following example usage of extern specifer behave. We have a global variable int x both in files one.c and two.c We want to use these in three.c so have declared this variable in three.c as extern int x; What would happen when we compile and link these files? My answer is: compilation of all these files should succeed, however the linker should flag an error at linking, due to multiple declarations of x. Would there be any difference in behavior in C++ ? Is these any way to refer to int x (in three.c) simultaneously from both files, in C and C++. In C++, I guess we can use namespaces to acheive this. Right?
