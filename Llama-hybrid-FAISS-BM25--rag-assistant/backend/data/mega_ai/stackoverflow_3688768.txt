Live streaming webcam on a web page (most efficient solution)

For a quick project I'll be working on, I have to install a multi-webcam setup that will be live streamed and accessible via a web browser . I'm looking into the quickest and most efficient solution, the less time and hassle it takes to implement, the better. That means buying hardware and/or software is not that much of an issue (as long as it's not 1000$+ flash server software). The requirements / basic setup: The web server will be directly connected the cams (via ethernet / WiFi). The stream should be viewable by the max possible audience so no ActiveX / VLC-style object embedding. Flash would be ideal (even if it's a paid solution). Bandwidth is not an issue, max 2-3 clients at a time, most of the time only one. Any options could be considered, quick-n-dirty hacks included (eg. reloading a .jpeg image 20 times a second via AJAX).
