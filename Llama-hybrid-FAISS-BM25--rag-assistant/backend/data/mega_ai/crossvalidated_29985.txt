Dare I say that both answers are wrong? Since $A$ and $B$ come from independent processes, the number of events of type $A$ in the $[0,1]$ interval has no effect on the number of events of type $B$ on the same interval. So the distribution of $B$s is still $Pois(k_2\lambda)$. Here is a quick simulation study to demonstrate that: R Of course, this is not very helpful, because we do not know $\lambda$. We can, however, estimate it from the number of observed $A$s. From here, you would have to be specific about the estimate, and then one might be able to talk about the properties of $\hat{B}$. EDIT: prediction interval It seems that you are interested in the distribution of $B$ only for the purposes of a prediction interval. I think you can use your argument to build one. Let $B_n$ be the number of $B$ events before the $n$th $A$ event. Then $B_n \sim NB(n,p)$ and $B_A | A=n \sim NB(A,p)$, and for any given sample $B_n \leq B \leq B_{n+1}$. So it is not unreasonable to use the prediction intervals for either of them. At a first glance, the first should undercover, while the second overcover, but in practice discrete confidence intervals often overcover, so even the first one could be OK. Just to follow up on the previous simulation: coverage So pred1 undercovers with respect to the "correct" intervals (which overcover), and pred2 overcovers compared to it. Also note that a benefit of the $NB(n+1,p)$ interval is that it is defined even for $n=0$. Just to summarize, neither of the arguments are correct, $B|A$ still has a Poisson distribution, but both of your distributions could be used for a reasonable prediction interval of $B$.
