The two comments to the question are very insightful. I am just expanding to to make sure this question has an answer. An important concept for OP to review is local minima / saddle point vs. global minima in optimization context. If the objective function is convex, for example, linear regression with squared loss, logistic regression, then, the fitted model is unique. On the other hand, if the objective function is non-convex, such as sum of the distance in K-means, the fitted model is not unique. It will depends on the initialization of the parameters. Therefore, it is perfectly normal to see different runs with different results on K means. Also really strongly recommend you to read this. How to understand the drawbacks of K-means Also, take a look at R kmeans documentation here , the nstart parameter gives number of random repetitions to over come this local minima / saddle point problem.
