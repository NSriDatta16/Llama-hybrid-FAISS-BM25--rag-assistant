Let's assume this is a fixed effects model. (The advice doesn't really change for random-effects models, it just gets a little more complicated.) First let us distinguish the "residuals" from the "errors:" the former are the differences between the responses and their predicted values, while the latter are random variables in the model. With sufficiently large amounts of data and a good fitting procedure, the distributions of the residuals will approximately look like the residuals were drawn randomly from the error distribution (and will therefore give you good information about the properties of that distribution). The assumptions, therefore, are about the errors, not the residuals. No, normality (of the responses) and normal distribution of errors are not the same . Suppose you measured yield from a crop with and without a fertilizer application. In plots without fertilizer the yield ranged from 70 to 130. In two plots with fertilizer the yield ranged from 470 to 530. The distribution of results is strongly non-normal: it's clustered at two locations related to the fertilizer application. Suppose further the average yields are 100 and 500, respectively. Then all residuals range from -30 to +30, and so the errors will be expected to have a comparable distribution. The errors might (or might not) be normally distributed, but obviously this is a completely different distribution. The distribution of the residuals matters , because those reflect the errors, which are the random part of the model. Note also that the p-values are computed from F (or t) statistics and those depend on residuals, not on the original values. If there are significant and important effects in the data (as in this example), then you might be making a "grave" mistake . You could, by luck, make the correct determination: that is, by looking at the raw data you will seeing a mixture of distributions and this can look normal (or not). The point is that what you're looking it is not relevant. ANOVA residuals don't have to be anywhere close to normal in order to fit the model. However, unless you have an enormous amount of data, near-normality of the residuals is essential for p-values computed from the F-distribution to be meaningful.
