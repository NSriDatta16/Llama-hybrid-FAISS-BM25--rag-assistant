global variables in python

class AlphaBetaAgent(MultiAgentSearchAgent): def action(self,gamestate): self.alpha= -9999 self.beta = 9999 def abc(gamestate, depth, alpha, beta): def bvc(gamestate, depth, alpha, beta): return abc(gamestate, 0, alpha, beta) I am calling the getAction function which itself calling the abc funct and abc function calling the bvc funct. The functions abc and bvc are working in recursive way. I need to modify the values of alpha and beta as per the situation demands so I made them local. BUt it is not letting me to do that. Error occurs Error occurs:- global name 'alpha' is not defined
