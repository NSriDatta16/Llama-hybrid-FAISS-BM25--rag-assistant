I think you are using wrong tool; if your whole X is equivalent to the index, you are basically having some sampled function $f:\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ and trying to extrapolate it. Machine learning is all about interpolating history, so it is not surprising that it scores spectacular fail in this case. What you need is a time series analysis (i.e. extracting trend, analysing spectrum and autoregressing or HMMing the rest) or physics (i.e. thinking if there is an ODE that may produce such output and trying to fit its parameters via conserved quantities).
