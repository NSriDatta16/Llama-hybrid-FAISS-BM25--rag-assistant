Rebind a listview from a jQuery iframe

I have a listview that includes links to open an iframe with jQuery and thickbox. This new window allows the user to edit the field information with the iframe. Update button - This refresh works well in IE, but both Firefox and Chrome do not rebind the listview. I have tried meta tags for no cache, and HttpCacheability.NoCache and IIS header content expiration, but nothing seems to be able to force a Firefox refresh. How can I get my listview to rebind from the child iframe?
