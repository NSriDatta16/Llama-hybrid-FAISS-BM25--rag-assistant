The components are the eigenvectors of the covariance matrix. If the covariance matrix is diagonal, then the features are already eigenvectors. So PCA generally will return the original features (up to scaling), ordered in decreasing variance. If you have a degenerate covariance matrix where two or more features has the same variance, however, a poorly designed algorithm that returns linear combinations of those features would technically satisfy the definition of PCA as generally given.
