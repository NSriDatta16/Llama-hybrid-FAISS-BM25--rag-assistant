Your speeds can be affected by many things, file system's cluster size, file fragmentation, disk interface type (ide/sata/etc), other disk operations from other processes, what have you. Each computer and operation parameters will have differences giving different results, one code change might increase speeds here, but could decrease speeds there. Maybe have a default set of settings for files smaller than say 100mb, otherwise run a quick set of tests to pre-configure the settings. Run a read/write speed test with a set number of buffer sizes, detect if the source and destination paths are located on separate disks (if so, make the copy multi-threaded; one that reads, the other that writes). Only raise/callback with progress updates that are significant (progress that has changed by like +3%).
