Why are linear/logistic regression and naive bayes called "parametric" while SVM, random forests, neural nets are not?

This table is mentioned in What algorithms need feature scaling, beside from SVM? It says that linear regression, logistic regression, and naive bayes are parametric, while KNN, decision trees, random forests, adaboost, and neural networks are not. What does parametric mean here? Don't all these models use parameters that influence the predictions?
