I assume the average resolution for a web page is really just the average resolution for a monitor. I find fixed-width layouts kind of annoying when I go to sites that are only using a fraction of my screen, but I understand why some people do it. Getting it right on a wide range of screens can be a real pain. If you want to make sure it looks good on all screen sizes, you can use different stylesheets for different resolutions . Or you can alter the layout using javascript as sites like amazon do.
