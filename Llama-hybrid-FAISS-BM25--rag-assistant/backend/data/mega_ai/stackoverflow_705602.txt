Draggable item added to a sortable list

I have a sortable list and a draggable div: Add Item item 1 item 2 item 3 item 4 item 5 #sortable is already a .sortable(). I should be able to "drag" another item between any of the list items (first, middle, last). How do I go about this? Any reply would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
