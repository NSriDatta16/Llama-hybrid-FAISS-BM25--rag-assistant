I've tried to recreate your scenario, so I had a dummy clip to be loaded by the ScrollPane, and the ScrollPane contained withing a MovieClip with linkage(Export for Actionscript) so I can create several instances. Also in that clip, a layer above the ScrollPane component I've placed a close button. My first attept was to debug the fla and see where exactly it fails first. I didn't mange to find out anything this was as I kept getting this: Cannot display source code at this location. Then I followed your instructions, and found the endDrag() function. I changed it to this: protected function endDrag(event:MouseEvent):void { if(stage) stage.removeEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, doDrag); } And tried it. It didn't work the first time, as if it was not compiled. I tried to edit the class within the Flash IDE and I saw what this little caveat was all about. Here's what I mean: So I copied ScrollPane.as from the Flash CS4 folder into ./fl/containers/ScrollPane (basically relative to the .fla). This .as file got compiled, and the error was gone. Short version is: Yup! you found the problem spot :) Add an if to check for null object as a quickfix and don't forget to save ScrollPane.as relative to the .fla file or in your classpath before compiling again.
