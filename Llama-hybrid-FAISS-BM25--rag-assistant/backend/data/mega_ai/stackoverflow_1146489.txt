The textField:shouldChangeCharactersInRange:replacementString: method is part of the UITextFieldDelegate protocol, so you have to set a delegate for these UITextField s. For example, if you were creating the UITextField s in your table view contoller code, and assuming the method was implemented in the same contoller, you could do this: UITextField *textField = [[UITextField alloc] initWithFrame:CGRectMake(x,y,w,h)]; [textField setDelegate:self]; However, you say you're loading the UITableViewCell s from XIB files. You have to somehow access the UITextField s from inside the code and call the setDelegate: method on them. You can do this by using UIView 's subviews property. For example: UIViewController *controller = [[UIViewController alloc] initWithNibName:@"foo" bundle:nil]; UITextField *textField = (UITextField *)[[controller.view subviews] objectAtIndex:0]; Though creating the UITextField s in the code is much easier and more elegant, IMHO. As for overriding the canPerformAction:sender: method, you'll have to subclass UITextField for that.
