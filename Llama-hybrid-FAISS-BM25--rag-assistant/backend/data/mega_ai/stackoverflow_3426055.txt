the docs are absolutely unambiguous about this: GetLastError Function Retrieves the calling thread's last-error code value. The last-error code is maintained on a per-thread basis. Multiple threads do not overwrite each other's last-error code. So they said it three times (in a single paragraph!): should be enough, as Lewis Carroll said;-). Thus there's no need to answer hypotheticals such as "but if it was per-process rather than per thread, then what about...?";-).
