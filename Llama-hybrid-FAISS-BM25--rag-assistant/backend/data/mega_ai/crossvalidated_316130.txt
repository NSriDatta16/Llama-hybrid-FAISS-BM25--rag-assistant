To answer this question in general is very hard. The "recommended" dimensionality highly depends on the data and the noise. In general: If you choose your dimensionality too high -> over fitting will occur If you choose your dimensionality too low -> you may lose important dimensions I would recommend tinkering a little bit with PCA (Principal component analysis) to get a "feeling" of the data. Also plotting the data raw as well as of dimensionality reduction approaches you often see (as a human) patterns emerge which will be in certain dimensions.
