XML Serialization/Deserialization per item

I'm designing a car catalogue and need to use XML files for storage. In previous projecs, I was manually editing XML files with Linq. However, I came across XML serialization and am thinking this might be a better approach. Each item in the catalogue would be of type CarItem and contain various attributes. The catalogue can contain a few hundred cars and I'm worried about performance. If I deserialize the XML file, will all the CarItems be instantiated straight away? Is there a way for me to be able to choose which object gets deserialized based on parameters? For example, I'd like to say "if car color attribute is red, then only deserialize red CarItems into objects". Thanks for any suggestions
