Identify the index corresponding to the smallest data in a set of arrays

This is a trivial algorithmic question, I believe, but I don't seem to be able to find an efficient and elegant solution. We have 3 arrays of int (Aa, Ab, Ac) and 3 cursors (Ca, Cb, Cc) that indicate an index in the corresponding array. I want to identify and increment the cursor pointing to the smallest value. If this cursor is already at the end of the array, I will exclude it and increment the cursor pointing to the second smallest value. If there is only 1 cursor that is not at the end of the array, we increment this one. The only solutions I can come up are complicated and/or not optimal. For example, I always end up with a huge if...else... Does anyone see a neat solution to this problem ? I am programming in C++ but feel free to discuss it in pseudo-code or any language you like. Thank you
