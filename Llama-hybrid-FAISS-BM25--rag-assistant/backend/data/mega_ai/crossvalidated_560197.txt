Differential Privacy on tabular data

I wanted to create a deferentially private dataset of my private dataset. While I understand the concepts behind DP, I am unable to grasp how this can be applied to these fields. e.g. email timestamp remoteIp useragent extUserReqType a@b.com 1614405118 68.237.20.83 chrome1121 IMAP c@b.com 1614402004 78.127.10.15 safari8767 HTTP_OAUTH2 How do I calibrate noise for each of these fields? If I just add noise, will the correlation between the fields be preserved?
