In SQL you could do all sorts of fancy things, but Google API is rather limited. Given that you want all records to be no more than 1 minute old, I'd just ask the database for all records less than 1 minute old, and then have python collate the results and reject the duplicate rows. From the data you show here, it looks like you're getting a couple of rows per 'name' per minute or so, so that approach should be sufficient even though its inelegant. The alternative would be to keep a second table with only the latest entry for each 'name' in it ... and cull that table every now and then to remove records over a minute old.
