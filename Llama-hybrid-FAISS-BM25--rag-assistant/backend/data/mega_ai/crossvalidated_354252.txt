Identifying an arima model one uses correlations and partial correlations reflecting the impact of previous values. One needs to be aware that this must be done in a robust manner when one has data that may have been impacted by anomalies/level shifts/ local time trends. If you post one of your time series i.e. the actual data, I and others might be able to help further. At a glance your series seems to have a positive autoregressive structure with possible parameter changes or error variance changes over time and seems remarkably free of anomalies although that would have to be confirmed by analysis. EDITED AFTER RECEIPT OF DATA: I took your 120 values into AUTOBOX ( a piece of time series software that I have helped to develop) and lo and behold the identified model is and here . The Actual/Fit and Forecast graph is here with residual plot here and residual acf here A variance change was detected (down) in the residual variance thus Weighted least Squares was used to remedy this non-constancy . . This error variance change occurred at or about period 26 suggesting that periods 1-25 and periods 26-120 differed in variability. What you perceive as some sort of 6-7 period effect is in reality just a manifestation of the short-term relationship and is not found after the short term effect (oscillation) is accounted for. MODIFIED ANSWER TO OP'S QUESTION DETAILING AUT0DEPENDENCE: The model expressed as a simple lag model is useful , shown here to predict the 121st value ( 1 period ahead) ...shown here as predicting 119 due the the fact the 2 values were deleted form the beginning of the series as negligible ... I could have supressed this feature without effect.
