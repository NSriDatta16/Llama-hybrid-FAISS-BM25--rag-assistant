Mean Per Class Error (in Multi-class Classification only) is the average of the errors of each class in your multi-class data set. This metric speaks toward mis-classification of the data across the classes. The lower this metric, the better. But the problem over here is - in case if you are trying to reduce this error in imbalanced data then it leads to more prediction in the majority classes. And the overall model performance will be bad.
