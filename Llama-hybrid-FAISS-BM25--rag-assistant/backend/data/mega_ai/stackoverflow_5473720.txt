Reorg of index for InstancePromotedPropertiesTable fails

At a customer where I have deployed an application that is using Workflow Services hosted in AppFabric and we persist the workflows in an instance store in SQL Server 2008. When they run their jobs to reorganize the indexes in the databases they get the following error message: Failed:(-1073548784) Executing the query "ALTER INDEX [CIX_InstancePromotedPropertiesTable] ..." failed with the following error: "The index "CIX_InstancePromotedPropertiesTable" (partition 1) on table "InstancePromotedPropertiesTable" cannot be reorganized because page level locking is disabled.". Possible failure reasons: Problems with the query, "ResultSet" property not set correctly, parameters not set correctly, or connection not established correctly. I recall having seen an explanation for this, but I cannot find it any more.
