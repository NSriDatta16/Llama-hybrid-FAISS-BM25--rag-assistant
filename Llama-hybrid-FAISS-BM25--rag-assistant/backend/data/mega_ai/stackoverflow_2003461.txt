How to force Python to ignore re.DOTALL in re.findall() statement?

I have been banging my head against the keyboard in search of enlightenment through Google and all Python docs I could get my hands on, but could not find an answer to an issue I'm encountering. I have the following regex that I run against a website, but Python insists in setting re.DOTALL on it, even though my code does not tell it to: \d+. +(?P \d+) *\- *(?P \d+).*?(?P \d+)(?:\/|\s)+(?P [A-Za-z]+)(?:\/|\s)+(?P \d+) +(?: )? ? (?P .*?) This creates an array of seasons/episodes for TV show listings, and it works fine except on epguides.com/BurnNotice (when using the TVRage listings), due to some spacing before newlines (I guess). Using http://re-try.appspot.com to test, I've narrowed down the issue to the use of re.DOTALL. If I enable it on re-try, it replicates the results I get when I run it standalone on my script. If I untick DOTALL, then it gives me the results I expect. How can I force Python NOT to use re.DOTALL? The script runs both on Ubuntu and OS X.
