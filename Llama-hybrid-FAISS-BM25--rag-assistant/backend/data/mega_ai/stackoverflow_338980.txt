I see that several people seem to think that it takes much longer to specify the columns. Since you can drag the column list over from the object browser, it takes maybe an extra minute to specify columns (that's if you have a lot of columns and need to spend some time putting them on separate lines) in the query. Why do people think that is so time-consuming?
