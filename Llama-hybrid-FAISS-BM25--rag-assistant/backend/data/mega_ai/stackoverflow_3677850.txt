Take a look at XML Serialization in the .NET framework. I'm using this with a data interchange project and .NET supports serializing and deserializing the information into and from objects with very little code. It may be the path you want to take. Edit: I see you've played with xsd.exe as well, you could use a db to store the XML in a column in a table for easy retrieval. We're actually doing this as well in the current project. We're receiving some XML from a 3rd party source, so we store it in a table, validate it against the schema, then read it out into .NET objects generated from a .xsd file using the xsd.exe approach. I'm not sure how large your data is, but this approach works well for us.
