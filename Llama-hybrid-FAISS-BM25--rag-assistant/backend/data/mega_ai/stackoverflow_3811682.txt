SSRS 2008 & Column Headers

As you may be aware there is a peculiar situation with the display of column headers in SSRS2008... i.e. you need to dig around a bit to get them to repeat on every page. http://blogs.msdn.com/b/robertbruckner/archive/2008/10/13/repeat-header-and-visible-fixed-header-table.aspx All of the examples I've seen rely on some kind of grouping going on. I'm not using groups in my report. Any idea how I can get the headers of a tablix to appear on each new page. Many thanks.
