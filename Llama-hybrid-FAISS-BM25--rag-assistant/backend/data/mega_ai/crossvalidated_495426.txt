Is there a way to measure the degree of correlation between two posterior distributions?

I have the following two distributions of MCMC samples from a Bayesian analysis and want to know the extent to which values from the first distribution are correlated with those from the second. Is there a way to measure this? If so, what is the standard way to do it?
