There are many alternatives to SWFObject, including SWF embedding code that ships with some popular JS frameworks, but none are as bulletproof as SWFObject. Adobe is in the process of adopting SWFObject 2.x for most of its publishing products (SWFObject will replace Adobe's ActiveContent JavaScript-based solution). BTW, If you use SWFObject's static publishing approach, your SWF will work without JavaScript being enabled. It simply won't have access to Adobe's ExpressInstall utility. See http://code.google.com/p/swfobject/wiki/documentation#Should_I_use_the_static_or_dynamic_publishing_method ? You don't even need to download SWFObject if you use Google's Ajax API repository :)
