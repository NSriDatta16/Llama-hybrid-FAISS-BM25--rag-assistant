Yes it is under $ind$coord . You need to subset the columns based on the cut off you defined, for example: library(FactoMineR) res.pca $eig[,1] > 0.5 PCs = res.pca$ ind$coord[,keep] Not very sure what kind of m you are calculating, but let's say we go for pairwise, using the solution from this post cholMaha And simple cluster: plot(PCs[,1:2],col=factor(kmeans(pairwise_Ma,3)$cluster))
