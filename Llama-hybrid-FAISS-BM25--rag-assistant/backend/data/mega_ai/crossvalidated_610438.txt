If I understand you correctly, you are trying to compare AIC values for models fitted on different subsets of your sample. Since the subsets have different size, the scales of AICs differ. To combat that, you obtain average AICs (i.e. AIC per observation) and compare them. Though there is randomness involved, you should be fine on average. This presumes missingness of data is not associated with the model fit for the particular data point. Otherwise you may get a systematic bias. E.g. if the data tends to be missing for points that would fit terribly, excluding them will yield an overly optimistic average likelihood and thus average AIC. The problem that you outline for AIC applies also for BIC just as much.
