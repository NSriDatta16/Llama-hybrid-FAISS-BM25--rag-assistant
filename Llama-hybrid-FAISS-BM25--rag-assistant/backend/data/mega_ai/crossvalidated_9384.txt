The Ward clustering algorithm is a hierarchical clustering method that minimizes an 'inertia' criteria at each step. This inertia quantifies the sum of squared residuals between the reduced signal and the initial signal: it is a measure of the variance of the error in an l2 (Euclidean) sens. Actually, you even mention it in your question. This is why, I believe, it makes no sens to apply it to a distance matrix that is not a l2 Euclidean distance. On the other hand, an average linkage or a single linkage hierarchical clustering would be perfectly suitable for other distances.
