A very interesting question indeed. Where the neural network which task is to f(X) => y would indeed disclose the relationship which help inferring y, not all architectures do have that e.g. autoencoders which in essence do f(X) => X. In case or Autoencoders the optimization problem would found the solution which help finding the more compact representations, rather then helping inferring relationships.
