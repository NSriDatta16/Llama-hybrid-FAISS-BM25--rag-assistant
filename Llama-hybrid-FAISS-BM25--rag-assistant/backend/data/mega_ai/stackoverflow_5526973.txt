A pragmatic loop unrolling technique

I'm finding a pragmatic loop unrolling technique example. I think Duff's device is a one of nice tip. But Duff's device's destination is never increased . It could be useful for embeded programmer who copies data to serial device, not general programmers. Could you give me a nice and useful example? If you have ever used it in your real code, it will be better.
