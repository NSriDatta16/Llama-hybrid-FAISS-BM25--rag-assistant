It all depends on how you would want to implement multiple selection with a MT UI. In a traditional mouse & keyboard UI, the user can usually make a multiple selection by one of the following means: Clicking additional items while holding a modifier key (shift or ctrl) in order to extend the current selection, or drawing a selection rectangle / lasso around the items to be included in the selection. Multitouch UIs normally don't provide for keyboard input (unless your scenario specifically requires it), so the question is: What kind of multiple selection would you want in your ScatterView? Something like a modifier key, or dragging a selection rectangle?
