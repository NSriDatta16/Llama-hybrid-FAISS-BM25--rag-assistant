organizing a list of pages in the wordpress sidebar using last.fm api

so i have my website, which i did in wordpress - http://chrisgruggen.com/class/mpm35/interactive-self-portrait/ my goal is to make the left sidebar have a list of my top bands (19 or 20 will do). i want them to be organized in order of how many play counts they have (using last.fm api) with the highest being at the top. i also want each band to link to a page within the wordpress site. right now, i have just made each band its own page, and ordered them manually. i'm assuming that id have to write a little bit of php too, however i really dont know any, other than just editing wordpress themes etc. hopefully this is clear enough. thanks! chris
