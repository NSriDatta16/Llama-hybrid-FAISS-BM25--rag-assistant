Once you delete a message, you have changed the length of the message list, so at some point, you are going to come across an index that no longer exists because you have deleted enough messages. To get around this, you have to (essentially) hard code the loop; get the count of messages, and start from the last message and move up from there. Even though you have deleted a message, the indexes above the current one will always be intact. Untested but is a pattern I've used elsewhere... tell application "Microsoft Entourage" activate set lastMessage to count messages of folder named "Inbox" repeat with eachMsg from lastMessage to 1 by -1 set theMsg to message eachMsg of folder named "Inbox" if read status of theMsg is untouched then set messageSubject to subject of theMsg as string -- bla bla bla -- How to delete the message and proceed with the next one??? end if end repeat Applescript's "convenience" syntax sometimes isn't, and that's why I usually avoid it altogether.
