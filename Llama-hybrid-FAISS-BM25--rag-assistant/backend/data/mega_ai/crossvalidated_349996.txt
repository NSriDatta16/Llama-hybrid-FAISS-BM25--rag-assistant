I encourage you to rewrite Case 1 out in matrix form with just 1 variable and i=3 observations. This would give you that the expected value of the inner product of the ith variable and the ith residual are 0. Hopefully this makes it clear that Case 1 violates assumptions 2 and 4 (since assumptions 2 and 4 are the same). Case 2 violates assumptions 2, 3, and 4. To see this, you can rewrite the covariance as the product of the standard deviation of the variables, the standard deviation of the residuals, and the correlation of the variables and the residuals. If the covariance listed in Case 2 is non-zero, then all three of these factors are non-zero. This means that the correlation of the variables and the residuals is non-zero (aka endogeneity [violating assumption 4, and therefore 2]). As for assumption 3, if there is non-zero covariance between your explanatory variables and the error terms, then the variance of the error terms is obviously non-constant.
