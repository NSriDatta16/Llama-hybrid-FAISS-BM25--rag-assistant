The RBF kernel is local in the feature space, so it can only work well if a nearest neighbour predictor also works fairly well. It is often worth trying Nearest Neighbour first - if its results are dreadful then I question whether I have the right feature set. But if you are going to use an SVM, it does not feel right to me to start with feature engineering then use assume the RBF is appropriate. Instead, design a problem-relevant kernel function. This will be equivalent to some set of features, by Mercer's Theorem, but what that set is does not really matter - you get the predictions directly by building an SVM with your kernel function.
