The JDK comes bundles with an internal version of Xalan, and you get an instance on it by using the standard API (e.g. TransformerFactory.newInstance() ). Unless Xalan doesn't work for you (which is highly unlikely), there's no need to look elsewhere. By the way, TrAX is the old name for the javax.xml.transform API, from the days when it was an optional extension to the JDK.
