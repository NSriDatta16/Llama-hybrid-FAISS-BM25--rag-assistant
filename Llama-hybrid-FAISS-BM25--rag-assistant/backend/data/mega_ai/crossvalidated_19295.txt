With up to 10,000 levels of each predictor, you are liable to have huge standard errors around each coefficient--plus, who is going to read the output containing all these results, or fashion a predictive equation out of them? Instead of using a general linear model like you have, consider looking into data mining techniques like neural networks. I think it would be more practical.
