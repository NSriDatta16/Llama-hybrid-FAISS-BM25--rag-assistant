showing how two sub-rates make a total rate

I'm working with a table that shows a total rate and two sub-rates. I have no underlying data just the finished table from an article. The rates are shown as per 1,000 women - the category is marriage per 1,000 for particular groups. There is Hispanic, Total 16.7 per 1000 (16.7 per 1000 Hispanic women are married), then 13.1 per 1000 Hispanic US born , and 32.6 per 1000 Hispanic foreign born. How can I show that 16.7 is a combination of 13.1 and 32.6? Is it possible without the original underlying values of each sub-category? It looks like a weighted average type calculation.
