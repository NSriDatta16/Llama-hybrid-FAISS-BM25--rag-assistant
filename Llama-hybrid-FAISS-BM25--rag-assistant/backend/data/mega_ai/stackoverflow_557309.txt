If you're getting intermittent behavior it may be possible that an exception is escaping on of your handlers and an inadvertently disconnecting drag drop. Try adding a blanket Try/Catch block around your code and do a Debug.Fail in the Catch block. That will at least rule out the possibility of an unhandled exception being your problem.
