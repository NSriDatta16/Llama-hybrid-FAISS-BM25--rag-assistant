Usually time series is thought to be represented by following construction: series = seasonal component + trend component + irregular component One way to deseasonalize series is to extract trend and add irregular component back to the trend. For example R has a function stl which can be used to form a three component matrix for time series. You can take trend and irregular component and form an deseasonalized series: https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/stats/html/stl.html Actually since we observer only one time series and not these unobservable components, we need many assumptions when modeling these series.
