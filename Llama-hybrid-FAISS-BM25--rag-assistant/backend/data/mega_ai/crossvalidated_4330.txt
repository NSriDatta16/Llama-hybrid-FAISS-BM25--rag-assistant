RJMCMC was introduced by Peter Green in a 1995 paper that is a citation classic. He wrote a Fortran program called AutoRJ for automatic RJMCMC; his page on this links to David Hastie's C program AutoMix . There's a list of freely available software for various RJMCMC algorithms in Table 1 of a 2005 paper by Scott Sisson . A Google search also finds some pseudocode from a group at the University of Glasgow that may be useful in understanding the principles if you want to program it yourself.
