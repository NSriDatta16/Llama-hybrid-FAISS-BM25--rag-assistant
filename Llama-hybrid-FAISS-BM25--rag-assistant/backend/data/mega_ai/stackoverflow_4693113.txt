The VARCHAR column is limited to 65,535 bytes, which doesn't always mean 65,535 characters depending on which character set you are using. If your using the latin1 character set which is one byte per character you won't run into any issues because the length of the string in the same as the amount of storage needed. If you use a character set that stores multi-byte characters you can only set the length to be what the character set will allow. For instance the utf8 character set can have a maximum length of 21,844 characters.
