Go back and copy the code straight from your source file, then edit your question. You have a potential ambiguity: Your first fragment calls the prepared statement "preparedStatement", then you change to "prepareStatement" (without the "d"). Having a clean look at your source code will make isolating the problem easier. Do you have two variables or did you mistype your example? [later...] Thanks for updating your code. I'm not seeing an obvious problem with it. Have you stepped through it with a debugger (e.g., in Eclipse) to ensure that the two methods are being called as expected?
