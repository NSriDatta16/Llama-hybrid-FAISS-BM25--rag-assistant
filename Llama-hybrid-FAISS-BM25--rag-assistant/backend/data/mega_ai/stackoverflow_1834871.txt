Microsoft Membership Provider Vs Custom Provider Vs Complete Custom Login System

I am currently converting a very old, but working classic ASP site to ASP.Net. It has a completely custom written user management system. Whilst it works fine, it really needs a refresh as I want it to be more flexible for some future projects in the works. When I asked someone about this, they said "You need to use the Microsoft Provider" and gave a lecture on how Microsoft release all these things for free and how good they are and should be re used as much as possible. I have done quite a bit of research on it (mainly looking at the videos on http://asp.net/learn ) and am very impressed by some of the features as there appears to be drag and drop components for items that would take me ages to write. However, the current membership database is complicated to explain, it is a completely custom written database that has many internal relations... It is not really "compatible" with the default Microsoft Provider. I have taken a look at How Do I: Create a Custom Membership Provider? , but I feel a little out of my comfort zone and worried it will either be slow, introduce a security hole or simply won't work. At the end of the day, the Microsoft Membership Provider should work for me - the only customisations I really need is the login to use the username/password field in my database and the create user script which has a lot of custom code to several third party systems (needing to provision services etc.). I was just wondering, what would you do if faced with a similar situation? Use the Microsoft Membership Provider and somehow get it to work for you (although I would like suggestions) Use the Microsoft Membership Provider but use custom provider that is customised around your code. Use your own completely customised solution?
