1) For logistic regression use type.measure="class" or "auc" depending on whether it is a binomial or a multinomial classification. 2) Plot the two models using a ROC curve (use ROCR package) and compare the area under the curve as shown below. 3) A good score would depend on the baseline you are comparing with. If your baseline is random guessing you are comparing against the purple line.
