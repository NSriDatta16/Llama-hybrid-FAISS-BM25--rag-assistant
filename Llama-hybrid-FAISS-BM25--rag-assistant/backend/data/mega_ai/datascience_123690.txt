There are many scenarios under which you want to use naive bayes. Its easy and Fast: Naive Bayes is very simple to use and runs fast. Good when you need a quick answer and donot have a strong computer. Good for Many Features: If you have data with many many things to look at, like words in text, Naive Bayes is a good choice. It handles many variables well. Updates Easily: One good thing is you can add more data easily. No need to start from the beginning. Saves you time and work. Works with Small Data: If you donot have much data, it still okay. Naive Bayes can work well with small amounts of data. Easy to Understand: This model is not complicated. Easier to explain to other people who donot know machine learning. Gives Probabilities: Not just does it give you the answer, but also tells how sure it is. Good for making decisions. Great to explain to business people and management. Still Works: Yes, Naive Bayes makes strong assumptions about the data being independent. But even if not perfect, most times it works well. People say it is a "good bad model" because of this. So, your professor has a point about Naive Bayes limitations, but it is not completely useless. It's the right tool sometimes.
