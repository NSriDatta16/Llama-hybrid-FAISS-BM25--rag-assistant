An entirely different approach: Use Line Art instead of Text. If you create a "line art only" PdfGraphics2D object from the page's overContent, you can use an AWT font and need not worry about embedding at all. With a relatively short string you don't have to worry about the PDF's size exploding either. PdfContentByte overcontent = stamper.getOverContent(1); Graphics2D g2d = overcontent.createGraphicsShapes(pageWid, pageHei); drawStuffToTheGraphic(g2d); g2d.dispose(); This will result in "text" that is actually line art. It cannot be selected, searched, etc. That could be good or bad depending on what you're after.
