c# LINQ creating anonymous type from run-time information

Say I have a List of columnNames that is populated at run-time. How would I use a LINQ expression to create average values for each of those columnNames, inside a grouped by query such as: var result = from data in view.AsEnumerable() group data by new {Group = data.Field ("group_no")} into grp select new { Group = grp.Key.Group, //Add anonymous values for eachcolumn average }; As far as I can tell you cannot enumerate within an anonymous scope? Is there a way to do this? Thanks.
