When using Data augmentation is it ok to validate only with the original images?

I'm working on a multi-classification deep learning algorithm and I was getting big over-fitting: My model is supposed to classify sunglasses on 17 different brands, but I only had around 400 images from each brand so I created a folder with data augmented x3 times, generating images with these parameters: datagen = ImageDataGenerator( rotation_range=30, width_shift_range=0.2, height_shift_range=0.2, shear_range=0.2, zoom_range=0.2, horizontal_flip=True, fill_mode='nearest') After doing so i got these results: I don't know if it's correct to do the validation only using the original images or if I have to use also the augmented images for the validation, also is strange for me to get higher accuracy on the validation than the training.
