Answering my own question :-) Re-reading this paragraph: P(A): The coin has a 50 percent chance of being Heads. P(A|X): You look at the coin, observe a Heads has landed, denote this information X, and trivially assign probability 1.0 to Heads and 0.0 to Tails. Given that I have already looked at the coin and know the answer (i.e. X), I would just assign probability P(A|X) of 1.0 to the current coin.
