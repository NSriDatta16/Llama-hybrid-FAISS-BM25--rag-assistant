Postgresql , SQL Server 2008 and Any recent version of Oracle all have spatial indexing, table partitioning and BLOBs and are capable of acting as the back-end of a large geographic database. You might also want to check out two open-source GIS applications: GRASS and QGIS , which might support doing what you want with less modification work than writing a bespoke application. Both can use Postgresql and other database back-ends. As for support, any commercial or open-source database is going to need the attentions of a competent DBA if you want to get it to work well on terabyte-size databases. I don't think you will get away with a model of pure end-user support - attempts to do this are unlikely to work.
