App dies on startup but not crash report

I've given an ad hoc version of my app to some users. Two of them have the app die on start up while one user has no issues. I can also install the ad hoc without issue...but that is always the case for me. One user sent the info below from the Xcode Organizer Console. They didn't find any crash logs. I don't know what to make of the info below. The one thing that stands out is "Permission denied". I place the provisioning and myapp.app files in a dropbox folder. The user then retrieves the files from the same location. I've run codesign against the .app file in the dropbox and get valid output: codesign -vvvv myapp.app myapp.app: valid on disk myapp.app: satisfies its Designated Requirement Any one have some ideas how I can figure out why the app doesn't work for this user? Here is the Console output from one user. They couldn't find any associated crash logs: Stats totalMLSITDBPostProcessing=5.31s commands=0.01 misc=0.45s icuSort=4.41s (MLS_icu_data=0.23s, MLS_icu_sec_data=0.13, dropIdx=0.04, normalize=0.13, update_orders=1.31, tStatsICUOther1=0.02, createIndex=2.50) Sun Dec 13 12:35:04 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.cygen.myapp[0x8cb6]) posix_spawn("/var/mobile/Applications/4B036396-3294-4E0A-BBCC-4118E72846D4/myapp.app/myapp", ...): Permission denied Sun Dec 13 12:35:04 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.cygen.myapp[0x8cb6]) Exited with exit code: 1 Sun Dec 13 12:35:04 unknown SpringBoard[24] : Failed to spawn myapp. Unable to obtain a task name port right for pid 179: (os/kern) failure Sun Dec 13 12:35:04 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.cygen.myapp[0x8cb6]) Throttling respawn: Will start in 2147483647 seconds Sun Dec 13 12:35:04 unknown SpringBoard[24] : Application 'myapp' exited abnormally with exit status 1 Sun Dec 13 12:35:10 unknown springboardservicesrelay[155] : Unable to parse property list data of length: 0 Sun Dec 13 12:35:13 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.cygen.myapp[0x3ce5]) posix_spawn("/var/mobile/Applications/4B036396-3294-4E0A-BBCC-4118E72846D4/myapp.app/myapp", ...): Permission denied Sun Dec 13 12:35:13 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.cygen.myapp[0x3ce5]) Exited with exit code: 1 Sun Dec 13 12:35:13 unknown SpringBoard[24] : Failed to spawn myapp. Unable to obtain a task name port right for pid 182: (os/kern) failure Sun Dec 13 12:35:13 unknown com.apple.launchd[1] : (UIKitApplication:com.cygen.myapp[0x3ce5]) Throttling respawn: Will start in 2147483647 seconds Sun Dec 13 12:35:13 unknown SpringBoard[24] : Application 'myapp' exited abnormally with exit status 1
