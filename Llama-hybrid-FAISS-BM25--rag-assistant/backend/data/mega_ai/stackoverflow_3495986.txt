My Ajax is trying to render a view that it shouldn't

So everything works. But if a user has firebug's console open, they'll see a bug. :D When my AJAX is sent : $(".remove_qf").live("click", function(){ $.ajax({type: "POST", url: $(this).attr("href"), data: { '_method': 'delete' }, dataType: "script"}); return false; }) And my controller fires it : def destroy @quick_fact = @organization.quick_facts.find(params[:id]) @quick_fact.destroy end A view is fired and errors out on a 500 : Missing template quick_facts/destroy.erb in view path app/views:vendor/plugins/rails-ckeditor/app/views Strange though, because I don't need a destroy view, and I shouldn't add any code to what I have already to tell it to render false. I say this because I have something similar working my project with the same premise. Anyone know what might be causing this? Update Routes.rb map.resources :organizations, :collection => {:live_validation => :post, :search => :get, :send_invitation_code_request => :post} do |organization| organization.resources :quick_facts
