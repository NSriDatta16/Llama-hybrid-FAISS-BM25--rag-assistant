Unbalanced class distribution in binary logistic regression

I'm building a logistic regression model with a binary target. My target has a ratio of 4:1 (i.e., it has 4 times as many values for one class than the other). Is there anything I have to consider with this information? I have seen this question, however I'm not satisfied with the first answer, and then the second answer just says that "there may not be sufficient patterns belonging to the minority class to adequately represent its distribution". So, is there anything else to consider? Is there anything connected to the sensitivity or specificity that may arise as a problem or even anything else?
