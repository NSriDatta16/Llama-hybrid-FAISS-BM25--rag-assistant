If the behavior of your controls is the same as the built-in and just the actual pixels are different, there are some things you can do to skin components. Buttons are totally customizable with an image. Use stretchableImageWithLeftCapWidth:topCapHeight: in UIImage to stretch the middle and leave the border of the button intact UITableCellView is meant to be subclassed -- tables are pretty customizable For a lot of controls, you can turn off some of the look, and then put an image behind them. They still have the behavior of the image. Use CoreAnimation to add little touches.
