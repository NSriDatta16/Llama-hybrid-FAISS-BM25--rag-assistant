How to tackle datasets where the dependent variables has around 80% 1's?

If my target variable has more 1's (say around 80%) than 0's then how do I handle such imbalanced data for building models using different methods such as GBM, RF, logistic regression, etc. Should I perform under sampling of 1's?
