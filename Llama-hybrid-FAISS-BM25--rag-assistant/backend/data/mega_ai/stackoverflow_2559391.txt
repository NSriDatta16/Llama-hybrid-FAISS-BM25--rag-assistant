If you're doing a length job in the UI thread the UI is going to freeze. One way to avoid this is to call once in a while QCoreApplication::processEvents() . You should be VERY careful however to understand what this does before you decide to do it. Calling this function means that a GUI event can fire in the middle of your operation. If this event can in turn create some more jobs you can end up starting a new job while in the middle of the old job. I wouldn't be so quick dismissing the worker thread approach. It has the advantage of completely separating the work from the GUI so you are certain that something that began is going to finish. You should also consider that Windows especially sometimes introduces non trivial delays to GUI loops. If the host is somewhat busy or in a memory thrashing state you'll find that GUI events may take up to several long seconds to finish and return control to your processing.
