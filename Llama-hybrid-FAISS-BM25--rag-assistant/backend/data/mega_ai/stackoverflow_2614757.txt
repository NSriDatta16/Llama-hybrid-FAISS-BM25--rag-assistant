From the livedoc in the first paragraph it states Every Class object is an instance of the Class class. Therefore, it would be an error to extend Class as any class object already is a Class. You said a system that generates some templates, and then generates some objects based on those templates. It sounds like what you are really trying to do is create an interface. An interface should be used when your template does not provide any implementation. That is, you declare a bunch of fields and methods but provide no implementation of the methods. You would declare such a class as follows: public interface Foo { function bar:void; } Now to create a class that implements this interface you simply do the following. public class MyClass implements Foo { function bar:void { ..... implementation goes here ..... } } It is possible for a class to implement multiple interfaces, while it may extend only one class. If however, you want to provide any implementation in your template class then it is likely that you are best off just creating a class that has any commonalities that its subclasses have and just use plain old inheritance. Hope this helps.
