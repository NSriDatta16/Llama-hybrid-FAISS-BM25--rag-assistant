C++ language guarantees that POD objects with static storage duration initialized with constant expressions are initialized statically , i.e. "at compile time". More pedantically, regardless of how static initialization is implemented (at compile time, at run time), it must take place before any dynamic initialization. A constructor call, for example, is dynamic initialization. In your case myArrayOfPod is a POD, integer literals are integer constant expressions, and string literals are address constant expressions. I'd say that your myArrayOfPod satisfies all requirements and therefore must be initialized statically. If you observe uninitialized myArrayOfPod from the constructor of oSomeGlobalObject in your experiment, it must be a bug in the compiler.
