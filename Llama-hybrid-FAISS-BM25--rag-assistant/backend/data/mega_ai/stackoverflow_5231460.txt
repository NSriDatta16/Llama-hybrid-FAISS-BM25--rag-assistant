Dynamic output cache

I wonder if there are any cache engines or if someone has a good solution that can handle these requirements: It should store plain HTML fragments of a page like the standard Output cache in asp.net The HTML may contain dynamic content from a database When an object is updated in the database all the cached HTML fragment containing that particular object should be destroyed and re-cached next time it will be requested. There is a separate admin tool to handle all data in the database so I can easy store the Id’s in a cachetable when an object is invalid. I can also make a request to a page that destroy all cached HTML fragment for that object. But when I write the markup, how could I do to store and retrieve a particular segment from the cache? Of cause I could do this in code behind and have the markup in a string but I don’t want that. I want to have the markup as intact as possible.
