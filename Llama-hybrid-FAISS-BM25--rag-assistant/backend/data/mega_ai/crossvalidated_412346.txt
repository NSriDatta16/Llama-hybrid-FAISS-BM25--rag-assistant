Time series forecast with probability

I have historical data for a particular metric for each month for the last 3 years for different categories. The metric is a percentage and its heavily skewed towards 1 with more than 75% of values being above 0.9 but some values as low as 0.3 My idea was to create some form of time series forecast but one which I can simulate thousands of times to get the probability the metric for a month in the future might be higher than 0.95 for example. I tried a linear model but that doesn't work at all
