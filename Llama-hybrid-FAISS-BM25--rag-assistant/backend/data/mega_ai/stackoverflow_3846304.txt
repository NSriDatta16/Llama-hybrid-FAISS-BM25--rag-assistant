stopping ZmEu attacks with ASP.NET MVC

recently my elmah exception logs are full of attempts from people using thus dam ZmEu security software against my server for those thinking “what the hell is ZmEu?” here is an explanation... “ZmEu appears to be a security tool used for discovering security holes in in version 2.x.x of PHPMyAdmin, a web based MySQL database manager. The tool appears to have originated from somewhere in Eastern Europe. Like what seems to happen to all black hat security tools, it made its way to China, where it has been used ever since for non stop brute force attacks against web servers all over the world.” Heres a great link about this annoying attack -> http://www.philriesch.com/articles/2010/07/getting-a-little-sick-of-zmeu/ Im using .net so they aint gonna find PHPMyAdmin on my server but the fact that my logs are full ofZmEu attacks its becoming tiresome. The link above provide a great fix using HTAccess, but im using IIS7.5, not apache. I have a asp.net MVC 2 site, so im using the global.asax file to create my routes Here is the HTAccess seugestion RewriteEngine on RewriteCond %{REQUEST_URI} !^/path/to/your/abusefile.php RewriteCond %{HTTP_USER_AGENT} (.*)ZmEu(.*) RewriteRule .* http://www.yourdomain.com/path/to/your/abusefile.php [R=301,L] My question is there anything i can add like this in the Global.ascx file that does the same thing ?
