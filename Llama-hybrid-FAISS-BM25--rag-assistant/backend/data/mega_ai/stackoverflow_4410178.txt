Just two remarks: TLSF is O(1) in the sense that is has not a single loop; and manages up to 2Gb. Although it is really hard to believe, just check the code. It is not true that the "best fit" policy (find the tight block) is the most suitable to achieve small fragmentation. It is far from trivial to demonstrate this claim, in fact it has not been formally proven but there are lot of evidences that go in that direction. (nice research topic).
