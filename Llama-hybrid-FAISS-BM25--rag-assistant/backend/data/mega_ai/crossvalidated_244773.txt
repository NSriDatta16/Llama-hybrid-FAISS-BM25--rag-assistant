PCA is good at streamlining numerous variables and recombining them into three Mega-variables called Principal Components. PCA by doing so is very good at resolving multicollinearity issues within your numerous variables. Your Principal Components will be the equivalent of indexes that are weighting your variable combinations. One variable is typically included in all three Principal Components. Given that, PCA is often very difficult to interpret. It makes for pretty opaque model lacking much transparency and explanatory power. That is especially true if you have to convey your results to anyone that is not a super-quant. Last but not least, I don't think traditional PCA does work with a binomial variable. Someone else, mentioned Discriminant Analysis which would work better than PCA. But, it suffers similar issues regarding opaqueness. But, instead of having three recombined Principal Components, it has three main Discriminants. Those recombined variables are really difficult to interpret. In view of the above, Logit Regression is a far better fit for what you are trying to achieve. This method is earmarked to handle a binomial variable exactly as you have. And, by standardizing the regression coefficients of your variables you will be able to easily measure their relative influence on your dependent binomial variable.
