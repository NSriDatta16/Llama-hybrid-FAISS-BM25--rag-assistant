I can think about one issue when you are talking about several servers connecting to you, you may want to conceder a nonblock mode. Because when you are working with blocking mod, each server can connect at the time, meaning that there will be delay delivering the message. http://il2.php.net/manual/en/function.socket-set-nonblock.php I think java would be better choise, multi thread may help here. from my point of view, this is something that you need to develop your self, socket programming needs a lot of attention.
