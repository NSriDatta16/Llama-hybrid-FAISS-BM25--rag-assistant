WCF - Network Cost

I have a wcf service deployed on IIS with basicHttpBinding and aspNetCompatibilityEnabled=true I have a test client as well which invokes multiple service functions simultaneously. To check the performance of service call on client and server I calculated the Avg time it takes to complete a service request on client(in proxy code) and on server as well. after a test of 8 hrs (server and client were on the same machine) i came to know that average response time on client is around 34ms where as the Avg execution time on server is around 3ms so the difference is 31ms. I would like to know why every call is taking 31ms is it justified? and how can i reduce this? EDIT: After Answer Post by "Marc Gravell" SSL Enabled within IIS no other security on WCF level Service perform minor database operation you can estimate operation cost by given 3ms average execution time. (if this is what you call payload) There is no Blob, no MTOM Send and Receive Messages are not big may be around 100 byte to 500 byte, Simple Message Contracts Please let me know if anything else required to diagnose this Actually i am more concerned about the cost of TCP Connection establishment if you can explain how WCF does the TCP connection job and if there is any difference in it against different bindings available
