One reason against 'chaining' is the Law of Demeter which would suggest that your code is fragile in the face of changes to LookupCodeDataTable. You should add a function like this: function getMeaning( lookupCode as LookupCodeDataTable) getMeaning=lookupCode.Item(0).Meaning end function and call it like this: strDescription=getMeaning(taLookupCode.GetDataByCodeAndValue("EmpStatus", "FULL")) Now getMeaning() is available to be called in many other places and if LookupCodeDataTable changes, then you only have to change getMeaning() to fix it.
