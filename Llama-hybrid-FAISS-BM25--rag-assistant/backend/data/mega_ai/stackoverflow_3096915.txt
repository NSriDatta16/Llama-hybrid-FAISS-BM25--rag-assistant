Simple round robin (moving average) array in C#

As a diagnostic, I want to display the number of cycles per second in my app. (Think frames-per-second in a first-person-shooter.) But I don't want to display the most recent value, or the average since launch. What I want to calculate is the mean of the last X values. My question is, I suppose, about the best way to store these values. My first thought was to create a fixed size array, so each new value would push out the oldest. Is this the best way to do it? If so, how would I implement it? EDIT: Here's the class I wrote: RRQueue . It inherits Queue, but enforces the capacity and dequeues if necessary. EDIT 2: Pastebin is so pass√©. Now on a GitHub repo .
