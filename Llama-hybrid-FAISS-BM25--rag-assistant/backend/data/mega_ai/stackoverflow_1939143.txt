As far as I understand you try average all channels. You could try the following approach which uses Core Graphics: CGImageRef inImage = mainImageView.image.CGImage; CFDataRef dataRef = CGDataProviderCopyData(CGImageGetDataProvider(inImage)); UInt8* pixelBuffer = (UInt8*)CFDataGetBytePtr(dataRef); int length = CFDataGetLength(dataRef); for (int index = 0; index The result is stored in rawImage . You could also take a look at the GLImageProcessing sample from Apple . This shows some basic image processing techniques on the iPhone using OpenGL.
