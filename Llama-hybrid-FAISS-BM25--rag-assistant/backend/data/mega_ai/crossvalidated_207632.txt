Overview of predictive modelling, machine learning, etc.

My text Intuitive Biostatistics is a nonmathematical explanation of conventional statistics. Chapter 3 explains the basic mindset of statistics as analyzing a sample to make inferences from a population, or to fit a scientifically sensible model to find parameters to understand and compare. For the next (fourth) edition, I want to add a short section explaining that there are other mindsets used in data analysis. I'd welcome a critique. Thanks! This chapter has discussed the basic idea of statistics as used in many scientific and clicnical situations. You can think of this approach as using data from a sample to make inferences about a population. Alternatively, you can think about fitting and comparing understandable models in order to obtain parameter values that can be interpreted and compared. Sometimes statistics is used with an entirely different goal: to predict future events, or to find patterns in data. In these situations, it is not always necessary to think about samples and populations, or to think about a model that expresses a scientific idea. Instead the goal is to simply find an equation or algorithm that makes reasonably correct predictons. Enter one set of data to obtain a rule for making a prediction, and evalutate these predictions with another set of data. This approach goes by many names including machine learning , neural networks , data mining and predictive modelling . Those terms donâ€™t all mean exactly the same thing, but all describe approaches to data analysis that use an approach not covered in this chapter or anywhere in this book.
