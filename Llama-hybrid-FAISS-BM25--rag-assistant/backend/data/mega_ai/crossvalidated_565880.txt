If you have the entire population, there there is nothing to do. You know exactly what happened. If a subject had a certain combination of predictors (features) and experienced an outcome, then that was the outcome. If multiple subjects had the same combination of predictors and experienced different outcomes, you know the proportion in which they experienced the various outcomes. You have the entire population. There is no need to do any modeling. Do not run logistic regressions. Do not run random forests. Do not run SVMs. You have the absolute, inarguable truth. It's like predicting yesterday's closing stock price. You don't predict it; you look up what it was, and that's what it was. (In my opinion, even when we think we have the entire population, usually we are really interested in a data-generating process. If you find my response unsatisfactory, think hard about if you are interested in something beyond the subjects you observed.)
