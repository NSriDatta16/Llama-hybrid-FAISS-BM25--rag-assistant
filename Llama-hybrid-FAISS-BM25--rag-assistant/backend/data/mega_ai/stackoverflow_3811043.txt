It's risky. To be sure that Google does index your homepage make this: User-agent: * Allow: /index.php Disallow: /a Disallow: /b ... Disallow: /z Disallow: /0 ... Disallow: /9 So your root "/" will not match disallow rules. Also if you have AdSense don't forget to add User-agent: Mediapartners-Google Allow: /
