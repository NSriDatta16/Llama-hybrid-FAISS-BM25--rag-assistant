How can we assess whether the statistical relationship between measurements in one year is significantly different from that in other years?

I am measuring the productivity of a plant and several meteorological variables. For ease of discussion, let us reduce the variables to the following where the dependent variable y is the productivity of the plant and x1 is light availibility and x2 is water availibity (and x3 is a dummy variable for phenology). I have six years of measurements with hourly resolution, but I am working with daily averages here. Now the following situation: The productivity is unnaturally low in year 5. It is likely that this is caused by damage to the plant in year 4 (lateral effect). In order to "proof" this, I need to show that low productivity in year 5 is not caused by low light or low water availability. In other words I try to answer the following question: How "likely" is the data of year 5 given the relationship of the variables in the other years (I assume it is unlikely). I started by building a multiple linear regression with all my observations: Call: lm(formula = Productivity ~ Light + Water + Phenology, data = data) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -7.5005 -1.0894 0.0600 0.9473 6.6023 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -2.2889532 0.1731193 -13.22 When we look at the results, we can see that the observed productivity is lower in year 5 than predicted. plot(predict(mod)) points(data$Productivity, col = "red") My idea now is to build a model with all observations except year 5 and then use that model to predict year 5. I would probably get a high RMSE or a low R-squared, for example. But that probably wouldn't answer my question about how unlikely the year 5 data is given the relationship of the variables in the other years , would it?. Do you have a better idea? I am also afraid that the model is just following the phenological cycle of the plant. Should I remove the seasonality from the data? What do you think?
