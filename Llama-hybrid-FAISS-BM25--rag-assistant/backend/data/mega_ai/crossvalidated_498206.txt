Parameters weibull distribution

If anyone can help me with this question i would be very thankfull An article in IEEE Transactions on Dielectrics and Electrical Insulation [“Statistical Analysis of the AC Breakdown Voltages of Ester Based Transformer Oils” (2008, Vol. 15(4))] used Weibull distributions to model the breakdown voltage of insulators. The breakdown voltage is the minimum voltage at which the insulator conducts. For 1 mm of natural ester, the 1% probability of breakdown voltage is approximately 26 kV, and the 7% probability is approximately 31.6 kV. Determine the parameters δ and β of the Weibull distribution. obs: i tried to solve the system $P(X=26)=F(26)=1-e^{-(26/\sigma)^\beta}=0.01$ and $P(X=31.6)=F(31.6)=1-e^{-(31.6/\sigma)^\beta}=0.07$ but i got absurd values.
