Integration with Robot framework's keyword management for Selenium Object Pattern Design

I have been shopping for tools for UI automation quite a while. And, the reason being so cautious is to prevent from shooting myself in the foot. The link below best describes my fear http://gojko.net/2010/04/13/how-to-implement-ui-testing-without-shooting-yourself-in-the-foot-2/ I am now quite certain that I can going to meet the goal by leveraging Selenium2.0 with Page Object Design(that takes care of technical activity part) in conjunction with Robot Framework's keyword feature (that takes care of the work flow and rule parts). So, what happen would be I will map user defined keywords with the corresponding Page methods and then use to keywords to design test plans on robot framework However, I have not found a solution on how to map a user defined keyword to the methods from the corresponding Page Object Designed method in Java. A guidance on how would be appreciated. Thanks
