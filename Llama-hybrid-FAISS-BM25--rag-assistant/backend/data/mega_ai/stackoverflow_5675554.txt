CDash Custom Dynamic Analysis

I'm trying to integrate custom dynamic analysis tools to CDash. Such as KWStyle, CppCheck and Visual Leak Detector. I'v figured out that I need to generate a DynamicAnalysis.xml file and submit it to CDash, from CTest scripts. I think I know how to run the external tool as a part of the ctest script. Either by using these variables to change how ctest_memcheck() works CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_SUPPRESSIONS_FILE CTEST_MEMORYCHECK_COMMAND_OPTIONS or by running the tool from the execute_process() command. But I'm a bit uncertain which one to use. The main problem I think I have is, how can I extract errors from the output of the custom tool and include that information into the DynamicAnalysis.xml to submit? The extreme solution i see is that i'd need to make a program that generates a valid DynamicAnalysis.xml file. But the problem is that I don't know the syntax of the DefectList element in the XML file. I have found no answer from google and even the XML Schema for that file is unhelpful. EDIT: Looking at this: http://www.cdash.org/CDash/viewDynamicAnalysis.php?buildid=987149 What draws my attention are the labels, especially the empty ones. I don't see how these would come from the DynamicAnalysis.xml file. Maybe it tracks any labels that have ever appearred? Can i create my own custom labels somehow? Does CDash create the labels automatically, depending on the tool type? Does this block custom defect types? I'm just guessing here, so the question is; can i create custom labels for my custom tool, just by generating a DynamicAnalysis.xml - file. It occurred to me that the amount of different errors from CppCheck (static code analysis) is huge, compared to valgrind for instance. I'm not that certain that I should use the dynamic analysis. Maybe a custom build type (Continuous / Experimental / Nightly) thing would work better. Like this: http://www.cdash.org/CDash/buildSummary.php?buildid=930174 I have no idea how to do this, i guess it requires meddling around with CDash code? Which one would work better?
