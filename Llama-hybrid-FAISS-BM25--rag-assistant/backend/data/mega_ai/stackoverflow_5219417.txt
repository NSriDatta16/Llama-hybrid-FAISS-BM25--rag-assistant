Can't initialize use of double (fp64) in OpenCL programs

when I use the following line in my OpenCL programs #pragma OPENCL EXTENSION cl_khr_fp64 : enable I get the following OpenCL error: cl::Error: -46, (std::exception.what() returns "clCreateKernel") Does anyone know why? What am I doing wrong? Btw, I have the following system: [INFO] Name: GeForce GTX 470 [INFO] Vendor: NVIDIA Corporation [INFO] Profile: FULL_PROFILE [INFO] Version: OpenCL 1.0 CUDA [INFO] Driver: 260.19.06 Cheers,
