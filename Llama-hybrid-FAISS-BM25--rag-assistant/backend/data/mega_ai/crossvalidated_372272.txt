Efficiency of Bayesian Estimator

In the Wikipedia article for Minimum Mean Square Error , the Bayesian estimator is referred as "asymptotically efficient" using the similar arguments of Fisher information from frequentist statistics. Does it even make sense to talk about the "efficiency" (or "asymptotic unbiasedness") of a Bayesian estimator given a credible prior at hand?
