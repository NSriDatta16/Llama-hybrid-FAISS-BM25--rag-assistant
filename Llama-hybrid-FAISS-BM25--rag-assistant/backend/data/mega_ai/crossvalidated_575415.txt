Start with your first expression: $$\log E(Y_{i}|b_i,x_i)=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+b_i$$ The effect of a one-unit change in $x_i$ is easy to write: $$\log E(Y|x_i+1,b_i) - \log E(Y|x_i,b_i) = \beta_0+\beta_1(x_i+1) + b_i - (\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+b_i) = \beta_1$$ Exponentiating both sides gives us: $${E(Y|x_i+1,b_i) \over E(Y|x_i,b_i)} = e^{\beta_1}$$ So a one-unit increase in $x_i$ causes an $e^{\beta_1}-1$ percent change regardless of $x_i$ and $b_i$ , implying that the population-averaged effect of a one-unit increase in $x_i$ also causes an $e^{\beta_1}-1$ percent change in $E(Y)$ .
