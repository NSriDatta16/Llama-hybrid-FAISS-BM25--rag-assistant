As Aristos pointed out, this is easier said than done: You can easily track how many have opened the page, but if they leave via an html link you will not be able to know they left. There are ways to get around this which may not be very accurate or elegant. You could use AJAX to keep tabs on who is still on the page by polling the web service. If the system doesn't get back a response for the particular id in a certain amount of time you can infer that the user has left.
