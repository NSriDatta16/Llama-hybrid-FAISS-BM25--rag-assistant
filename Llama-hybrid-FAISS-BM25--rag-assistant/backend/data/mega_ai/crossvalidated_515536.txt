Data. Here is a right skewed sample that has some negative values, but a sample average $A$ somewhat above $0.$ set.seed(1234) n = 200; x = rexp(n, .1) - 8 a.obs = mean(x); a.obs [1] 2.045604 stripchart(x, pch="|") abline(v = mean(x), col="greens") Permutation test. Now we use the sample mean as metric, permute signs of the $n = 200$ observations, and find the average a.perm of the sign-permuted data. With $10\,000$ such values we can get a good idea of the permutation distribution sample averages. The null hypothesis that the mean is $0$ for the distribution from which x was randomly sampled is rejected. The P-value of the test is about $0.0035 set.seed(326) a.prm = replicate(10^4, mean(sample(c(-1,1),n,rep=T)*x)) mean(abs(a.prm)>=abs(a.obs)) [1] 0.0035 # P-value of permutation test hist(a.prm, prob=T, br=30, col="skyblue2", main="Permutation Dist'n") abline(v = c(a.obs,-a.obs), lwd=2, col="red", lty="dotted")
