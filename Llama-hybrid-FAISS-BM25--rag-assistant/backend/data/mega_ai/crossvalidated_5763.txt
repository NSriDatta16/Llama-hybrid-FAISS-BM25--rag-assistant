Logistic regression is to be used when the outcome of interest is a binary variable (e.g., success/failure), whereas multinomial logistic is reserved for the case of a multi-category response variable (e.g., blue/red/green). In both cases, the response variable to be predicted is a categorical variable. The predictors might be categorical or continuous variables. From what you described, you are interested in predicting scores on a social attribution task based on observed scores on a reading scores. If both sets of scores are numerical, then it is simply a linear regression model. In R, it is something like # fake data x The output reads: Call: lm(formula = y ~ x) Residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -2.6635 -0.6227 -0.1589 0.6360 2.2494 Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error t value Pr(>|t|) (Intercept) -0.03769 0.10042 -0.375 0.708 x 1.31590 0.10796 12.188 Here an increase of one unit in $x$ is associated to an increase of 1.32 units in $y$. This is basically what the regression coefficient tells you when you assume a model like $\mathbb{E}(y|x)=\beta_0+\beta_1x+\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ are independent and identically distributed as a centered gaussian with variance $\sigma^2$ (unknown). Now, you may still be interested in a binary outcome. For instance, I can define "Success" as $y>0$. In this case, a logistic regression would look like yb 0, 1, 0) summary(glm(yb ~ x, family=binomial)) where the regression coefficient gives you the log of the odds of passing the exam (compared to failing to reach a score of 0): Coefficients: Estimate Std. Error z value Pr(>|z|) (Intercept) -0.5047 0.3194 -1.580 0.114 x 3.3959 0.6871 4.943 7.7e-07 *** --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Edit Some pointers with multinomial logistic regression have already been given. What I wonder is the outcome you want to model: If you're interested in whether the autistic group has lower scores on the attribution task (as would be expected from the literature), then in a logistic model both scores will be continuous predictors, and reading scores will be considered as a covariate; in other words, you model the odds of being in one of the diagnostic class as a function of attrition task, after adjusting for baseline differences in language proficiency. But it seems it would make sense only if the diagnostic categories are not a priori defined and it does not directly answer the question you are asking (whether language is a predictor for attrition that may act differentially according to the diagnostic group); otherwise, I would rather model the attrition scores as a function of a grouping variable (diagnostic category) + reading scores, which is basically an ANCOVA model. Both models are available in R: mlogit() in the package mlogit for multinomial logistic regression, and lm() for ANCOVA.
