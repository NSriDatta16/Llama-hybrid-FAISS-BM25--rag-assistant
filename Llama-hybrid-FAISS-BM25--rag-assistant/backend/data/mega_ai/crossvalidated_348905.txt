CF1 is a feature whose value is a vector where each element corresponds to one unique word. If the word is present between the two concepts of interest, then its corresponding value in the vector is 1, and 0 otherwise. As mentioned in the paper, the feature vector is sparse, i.e. most values are 0. Note that the current state-of-the-art systems for relation extraction and classification typically use neural networks ( example 1 ), not SVM.
