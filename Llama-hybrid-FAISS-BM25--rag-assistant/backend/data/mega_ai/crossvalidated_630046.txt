Understanding notation for input space

I'm taking the free Caltech machine learning course . I'm having trouble understanding the notation on one of the problems : In this problem, you will create your own target function f and data set D to see how the Perceptron Learning Algorithm works. Take d = 2 so you can visualize the problem, and assume X = [−1, 1] × [−1, 1] with uniform probability of picking each x ∈ X . What does it mean that X = [−1, 1] × [−1, 1] ? what does the x or times symbol mean? Is this a continuous range or discrete set of elements? Basically what values can be in X?
