The use of matching on other characteristics than that being tested, followed by a paired t-test is fine; there's a point to that (to control for the effect of other variables thought to be relevant to the outcome). The matching makes it paired, because - if the characteristics on which the matching was carried out* affect the outcome - the pair-members will tend to be more alike than two random observations. * or other characteristics which are related to them. See, for example, the discussion in the third paragraph (' A paired samples t-test based on a "matched-pairs sample" ...') here . Henry's point that the pairs should be selected before deciding on which is to be the pilot (randomly) is a good one, though that problem won't necessarily invalidate the test - depending, for example, on how those pilots were chosen. However, unless Dimitriy's supposition was correct - that two lots of tests were done, one on the matching variables, and then a different test later for the effect of interest - then the way the matching was done, using the p-value of the test of interest as the matching criterion, renders the resulting p-value meaningless. It's certainly no longer uniformly distributed under the null. In that case, the hypothesis test is effectively useless as it stands.
