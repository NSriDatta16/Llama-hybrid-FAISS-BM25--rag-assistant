If the clients chose their time within the hour using a reasonable random number generation, that ought to keep the load evenly distributed on average. Random numbers can have clustering, however. If the clients have to register/deregister with the server, the server could simply assign each a time slot to check in and then ensure an even distribution, but without some sort of coordination I don't think there's any real way for the clients to guarantee an even load.
