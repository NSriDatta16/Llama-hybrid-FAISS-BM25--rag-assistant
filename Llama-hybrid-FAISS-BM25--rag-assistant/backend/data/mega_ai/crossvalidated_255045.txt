First off, we know the groups aren't independent. In fact, once you know the ranks in the second group, you know the ranks in the first (and vice versa)--i.e. each rank is either in one group or the other but not both. Given this, you might want to perform a permutation test to see whether the average rank (or some other statistic) of the first group is extreme compared to the sampling distribution of the average rank under the assumption that the ranks are randomly assigned to each group.
