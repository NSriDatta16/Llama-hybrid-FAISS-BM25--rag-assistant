installing MSMQ with bat file or some automated stuff

We are creating a service which requires MSMQ, and it might happen the boxes where we install doesn't have MSMQ installed. So I want some mechanism which can install MSMQ as a prerequisite when installing my service. Any suggestions?? Some how i manage to find from the below answer I am using the below in the .ini file & bat file but its prompts me for windows xp cd(I386) path. Is there anyway to suppress that or give the in the bat file bat file sysocmgr.exe /i:sysoc.inf /n /f /u:"MSMQsetup.ini" MSMQsetup.ini file [Components] msmq_Core = ON msmq_LocalStorage = ON msmq_HTTPSupport = ON msmq_TriggersService = ON msmq_ADIntegrated = ON msmq_MQDSService = OFF msmq_RoutingSupport = OFF
