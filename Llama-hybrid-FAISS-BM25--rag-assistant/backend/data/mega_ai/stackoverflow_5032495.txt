Try using $client->__soapCall() : https://www.php.net/manual/en/soapclient.soapcall.php . I don't believe you can use direct method calls in non-WSDL mode. Edit: Also, your web service in .asp is not returning any content. A webservice doesn't actually call a method like Test() on the server. SOAP is merely a protocol for language-agnostic communication of calls and parameters. The server needs to actually take the call and apply it to the proper intended method.
