The answer to the question in the title is yes, you can perform a PCA on any set of data described by a coordinate system with any number of axes. The result is a new set of axes, called principal coordinates. The PCA produces as many PC as there are original axes, but the new coordinate system as different properties, such as: The principal components are ranked based on how much variability they account for, the first PC being the axis with maximum variability along itself; by definition, all principal components are orthogonal to each other. Here is a very good interactive explanation of what PCA does and how does it work. For further reference see here , here . The details in the text body seem to refer to a specific program (I'm guessing Python), which make me think that this question may be more suitable for Stack Overflow.
