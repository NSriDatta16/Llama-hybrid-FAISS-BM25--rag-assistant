Using EditTextPreference with 2 user input fields

I would like to use EditTextPreference to show 2 input fields instead of 1. For instance, a username and password field should be shown. I don't want to use a dialog for each one. How can this be done? In the WiFi settings there is one that does this, when you want connect to a protected network, a dialog shows to set a password for the credential storage with 2 fields.
