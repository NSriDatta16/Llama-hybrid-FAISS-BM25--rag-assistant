Random forest assumptions

I am kind of new to random forest so I am still struggling with some basic concepts. In linear regression, we assume independent observations, constant varianceâ€¦ What are the basic assumptions/hypothesis we make, when we use random forest? What are the key differences between random forest and naive bayes in terms of model assumptions?
