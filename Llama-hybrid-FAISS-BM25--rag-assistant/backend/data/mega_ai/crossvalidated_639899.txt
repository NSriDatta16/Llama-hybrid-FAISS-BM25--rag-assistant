There is a more formal answer to your question, but I won't give it here. In broader terms, though: What I don't understand is why they would take the log of 1 and not the log of 1/5.5, which is the probability assigned to each possible value in the function range. Taking the log of 1 would be the log of the total probability within the function but I can't seem to find any explanations of their reasoning anywhere. It doesn't (usually) matter . When you're using MCMC to estimate the posterior distribution, it's not actually necessary to have a function that outputs the value of the posterior density, $P(\theta | x)$ . All you need is to output a value that's proportional to this, usually written as $\propto P(\theta | x)$ . This is good, because to actually calculate $P(\theta | x)$ you need to also calculate the normalising constant , and this is expensive to do, but because it's a constant, it doesn't affect the proportional value. For this reason, it doesn't actually matter if you shift the prior density up or down by a constant amount (e.g. $1$ vs $\frac{1}{5.5}$ ), since everything remains in proportion. An additional question, if anyone should know is, when doing log prior and if your parameters are outside the function range, therefore assigned a value of - infinity, when going to add this to your likelihood function to get the posterior (as we are in log space), wouldn't you always get a value of -infinity? because your likelihood value is small in comparison ? Maybe this is a naive question based on my currently limited understanding but any guidance would be appreciated. Correct. If the prior says a value of $\theta$ has a probability of 0 (it's impossible), it should also have a probability of 0 (also impossible) in the posterior, since no amount of data can make the impossible possible. Edit: It's also worth looking at what people actually mean when they say "up to a constant" when talking about the posterior, e.g. here .
