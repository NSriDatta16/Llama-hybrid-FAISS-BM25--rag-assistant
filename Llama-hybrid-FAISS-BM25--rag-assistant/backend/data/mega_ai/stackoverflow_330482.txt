Best way to save a ordered List to the Database while keeping the ordering

I was wondering if anyone has a good solution to a problem I've encountered numerous times during the last years. I have a shopping cart and my customer explicitly requests that it's order is significant. So I need to persist the order to the DB. The obvious way would be to simply insert some OrderField where I would assign the number 0 to N and sort it that way. But doing so would make reordering harder and I somehow feel that this solution is kinda fragile and will come back at me some day. (I use C# 3,5 with NHibernate and SQL Server 2005) Thank you
