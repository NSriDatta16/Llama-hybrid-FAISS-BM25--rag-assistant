Do I need to standardize or normalize my data?

I have the results of EPL season football stats with around 300 matches played. Some data is the averaged results of past matches and some are different types of data such as odds. It looks something like this (there are a lot more columns but this gives the idea): Team Odds Win % Goal Avg Concede Avg Last 6 Goal Av Last 3 Goal Av Strength Arsenal 1.20 78 2.5 0.5 2.1 1.9 ?? Liverpool 7.50 23 0.9 1.8 1.7 1.9 ?? Man. City 4.10 60 1.1 1.2 1.5 1.6 ?? The Strength column in each row will simply add the rows results together and divide by the total number of columns. (I plan on simply making the odds a negative number). The Strength basically just needs to be the sum of numbers in that particular row, divided by the amount of numbers. So basically 1.2 + 2.5 + 1.1 / 3 (as an example). The question though is regarding how I normalise the data 'types', specifically the averages. When normalizing averages, do I use the min/max of the averaged data or do I use the actual min/max values. I've done some reading but it is going well over my head - I'm a web developer not a mathematician :) And any type of pseudo code would be extremely helpful. Thanks
