There has to be an existing ASP.NET user control defined, and you can dynamically load it. That's about as much as dynamic capabilities with user controls that you have. You can also leverage custom controls, which really gives you the complete control over the rendered UI. However, not rendering complete ID's can have subsequent issues with the client/server integration, depending on what you are trying to do. Also, to customize the ID, you can leverage ASP.NET 4.0's ClientIDMode property: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.web.ui.control.clientidmode.aspx
