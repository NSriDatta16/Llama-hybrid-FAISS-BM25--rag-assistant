Namespaces, like all identifiers, are meant to organize. So using them, only benefits if your project gets organized in a better way. This highly subjective matter (there have been 'wars' on even the most simple naming conventions!), so impossible to really answer. Here is some documentation on how namespaces work in Delphi. Note that 'true' namespaces (where more than one generic DLL can contribute to the same namespace; this is how namespaces function in the .NET world) are not possible in Delphi: you could go the BPL way, but that is not the same as a 'generic DLL'. This is not a limitation of Delphi itself, but the way that native DLLs in Windows 'work'. --jeroen
