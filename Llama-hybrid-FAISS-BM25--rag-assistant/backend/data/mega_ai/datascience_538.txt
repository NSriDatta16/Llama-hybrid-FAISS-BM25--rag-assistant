What are your favorite sources for news about Machine Learning and Data Science?

Data Science and Machine Learning include a lot of different topics and itÂ´s hard to stay up-to-date about all the news about papers, researches or new tutorials and tools. What sources do you use to get all the information? I use mostly Reddit as my first source and the subreddits Machine Learning and R . But I would also Datatau and of course the great KDNuggets .
