Where can I find resources and papers regarding Data Science in the area of Public Health

I'm quite new to Data Science, but I would like to do a project to learn more about it. My subject will be Data Understanding in Public Health. So I want to do some introductory research to public health. I would like to visualize some data with the use of a tool like Tableau. Which path would you take to develop a good understanding of Data Science? I imagine taking some online courses, eg. Udacity courses on data science, but which courses would you recommend? Where can I get real data (secondary Dummy Data) to work with? And are there any good resources on research papers done in Data Science area with the subject of Public Health? Any suggestions and comments are welcome.
