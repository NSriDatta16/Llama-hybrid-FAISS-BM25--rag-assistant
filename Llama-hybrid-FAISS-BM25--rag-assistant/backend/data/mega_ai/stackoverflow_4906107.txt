To expand on the above answers, need to break your line of code: vector > ObjectList(100, MyObject (param1)) into its two components: MyObject myObject(param1) vector > ObjectList(100, myObject) As you can see, you are creating 'myObject' once, and then calling its copy constructor 100x times (rather than creating 100x MyObjects). Judging by what you are expecting you have not created a custom copy constructor - so are getting (as others have mentioned) default 'shallow copy' behaviour. I would also recommend to not use naked pointers/heap allocation (e.g. MyType* t = new MyType[param1]) new inside of MyObject, rather implement storage with another vector, which already supports the copy mechanisms your probably expect.
