Your initial solution did not work reliably because: Cache control is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request/response chain. The only mechanisms that I know of are proxies, so user agents are not bound by it. The Pragma: header does not include a value. I'm not sure it's even legal - in terms of the HTTP protocol.
