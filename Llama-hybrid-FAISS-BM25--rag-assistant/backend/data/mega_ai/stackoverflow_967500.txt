VS can and will edit you web/app config for all sorts of reasons. Also, there are certain situations where VS tools will give you a GUI for sections of the file (Which im guessing is what you are after). But for the most part the "the proper way" as you say is to hand edit it. It could also be likely that if your project is big enough you'll have CI concerns and roll outs to several servers, which would mean scripting the generation of sections of your config files. One final thing that's worth saying is that you shouldn't be looking for an MS blessed approach to anything, you should take your needs and come up with the most pragmatic approach with all the facts at hand.
