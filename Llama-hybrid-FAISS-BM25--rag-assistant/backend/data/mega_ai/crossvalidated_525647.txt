Should you bin data when creating moving average to generate a forecast?

Let's say I have insurance claims that are created on a daily basis on Monday through Friday but sometimes there will be days in which we don't get a claim, perhaps it'll be a week or two that we don't get a claim. If I want to calculate a 3-month moving average, is it best to first calculate total claims received by month and then calculate the 3-month moving average ? Or would it be best to calculate total claims by date such as claims received on 5/10/2021, 5/11/2021, etc., and then calculate the 90-day moving average ? My gut tells me that grouping by month to calculate the monthly totals may hide the underlying trend that could only be captured by looking at daily totals. Thanks!
