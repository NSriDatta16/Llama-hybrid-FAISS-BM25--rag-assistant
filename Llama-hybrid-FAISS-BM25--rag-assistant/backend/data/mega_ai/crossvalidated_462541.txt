I like this paper, because it references some other studies which examine the Events Per Variable (EPV) in logistic regression. The paper examines the common 1-in-10 rule for logistic regression and argues there is no rationale for it (and that it might be too liberal a requirement). From this paper, it seems that some studies say a low EPV can result in highly variable predictions (see the first paragraph of that paper). The extent to which this is a problem highly depends on your situation. If you are only regressing on a handful of variables which are more or less orthogonal, then you may be OK. If your variables are correlated, then you will have model instability. Everything in between is a "it depends" situation. In any case, when the EPV is low, I think you should bootstrap your model to examine how well the asymptotic estimates of model variance stack up against bootstrapped variance estimates.
