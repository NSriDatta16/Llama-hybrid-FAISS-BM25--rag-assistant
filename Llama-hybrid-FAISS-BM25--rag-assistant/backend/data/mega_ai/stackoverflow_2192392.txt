SQL Server doesn't natively support regular expressions in the REPLACE() function. Have you tried one of these approaches: Leverage .NET regex support by integrating SQL Server and the CLR Write a stored procedure or user defined function that loops through the string and uses PATINDEX() to locate the numbers (PATINDEX lets you specify a pattern to find, REPLACE does not) Both of these have some performance implications, so I'd be careful in how you use them.
