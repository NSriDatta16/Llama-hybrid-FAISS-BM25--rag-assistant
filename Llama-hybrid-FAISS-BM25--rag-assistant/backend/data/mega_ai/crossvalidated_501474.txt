Â¿What is the difference between scores and Principal Components in PCA?

OK, this question may already be answered but I do not quite understand all of it. So I have understood that scores loadings and principal components are different concepts: Scores: Are the new coordinates of the observations in the new space defined by PC. (There is no such thing as first principal component score) Loadings: They are the coefficients of the linear combination of the original variables in orher to form the principal components. Then in a related question they mention that a principal component is a linear combination of what ? Is a linear combination of loadings and the original observed variables ? Then, a score is what ? the component of the PC vector ?
