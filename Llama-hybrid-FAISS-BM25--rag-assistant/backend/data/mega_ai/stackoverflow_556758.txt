You have, as always, a number of options, depending on your requirements. use the Runtime Preferences to store in a PreferenceStore with a suitable PreferenceInitializer. Quite a large and extensive API with quite a lot of thought gone into it. The preferences aren't exposed to the user or admin by default, so you'd need to do some work to expose a preference page, or write to a properties file. For less advanced/less work, especially if you don't have access to the eclipse preferences (e.g. server side OSGi): set as a system property, in the RCP.ini. Not user-changeable after launch, requires access to the RCP.ini (eclipse.ini) file which may be possible especially if you're not contributing the the IDE. set as a system property, as an argument in the shortcut. Depends on the user using the shortcut. Specialized shortcut needs to be generated at installation time. If accessibility from the filesystem is really important, then I would consider using one of the methods above to set an etc directory, and the let your bundles generate default properties files in the etc directory if they don't exist on first use. This is essentially rolling your own preference store, so if you do have access preferences bundle, you may be better off doing that. This rather old User Settings FAQ may also be helpful. I do recall an Erich Gamma (as in Gang of Four, and JDT technical lead) interview in which he says that there are about seven different preference mechanisms, and he never knew which one to use.
