Two-factor ANOVA: What should be done when each cell has only one observation?

I have a data set, described as the measurement of insecticide found through four different extraction methods, A, B, C, and D. A measurement for each extraction method is made under the conditions when the flower is: Fresh, 1-year untreated, and 1-year treated. The data set looks like: A B C D Fresh: 1 2 3 2 1yr untreated: 2 3 1 3 1yr treated: 5 3 2 4 I am asked to propose a model for the data and estimate its parameters. By the description of the data, it sounds like it just has to be a two-factor ANOVA. Both the extraction method and the "freshness" seem like independent and relevant variables controlling the outcome. Moreover, I would think it's fair to suspect interaction effects. So this sounds like my proposed model ... Except, each cell has only one observation. My textbook says that we cannot conduct a hypothesis test without at least two observations per cell. So now it sounds like perhaps I can't use this model. On the other hand, I'm not asked to actually conduct a hypothesis test, only estimate parameters. So for instance, can I still estimate the value of $\mu \approx \hat{\mu} = X...$ , which is to say average over the $i,j,k$ coordinates (here, $k=1$ always)? And likewise for the formulae to estimate the "row-" and "column-" and "interaction-effects"?
