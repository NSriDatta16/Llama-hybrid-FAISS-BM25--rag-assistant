The output of PCA is a set of eigenvectors each associated with an eigenvalue. The eigenvalues are non-negative real values. The egenvectors are all unity vectors (i.e. with Euclidean norm 1.0); their components can be positive or negative real values. If you have calculated PCA with SVD, the eigenvalues of PCA are just the squared value of the singular values of SVD.
