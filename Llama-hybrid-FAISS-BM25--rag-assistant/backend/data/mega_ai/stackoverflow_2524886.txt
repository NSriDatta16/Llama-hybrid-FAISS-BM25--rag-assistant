Considering you're referring to Linq to SQL , I think it is not possible to do what you want (clear all database entities) with just one command line. You could use SQL truncate or delete command to delete each one of your entities, using DataContext.ExecuteCommand , as follows: context.ExecuteCommand("DELETE FROM EntityName"); Or context.ExecuteCommand("TRUNCATE TABLE EntityName"); Although, you still have to do this for each one of your entities and pay attention to relationships between entities (foreign keys).
