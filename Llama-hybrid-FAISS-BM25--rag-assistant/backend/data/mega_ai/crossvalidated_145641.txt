Understanding fractional-differencing formula

I have a time series $y_t$ and I would like to model it as an ARFIMA (a.k.a. FARIMA) process. If $y_t$ is integrated of (fractional) order $d$, I would like to fractionally-difference it to make it stationary. Question : is the following formula defining fractional-differencing correct? $\Delta^d y_t := y_t - d y_{t-1} + \frac{d(d-1)}{2!} y_{t-2} - \frac{d(d-1)(d-2)}{3!} y_{t-3} + ... +(-1)^{k+1} \frac{d(d-1) \cdot ... \cdot (d-k)}{k!} y_{t-k} + ...$ (Here $\Delta^d$ denotes fractional-differencing of order $d$.) I base the formula on this Wikipedia article on ARFIMA , Chapter ARFIMA($0,d,0$), but I am not sure if I got it correctly.
