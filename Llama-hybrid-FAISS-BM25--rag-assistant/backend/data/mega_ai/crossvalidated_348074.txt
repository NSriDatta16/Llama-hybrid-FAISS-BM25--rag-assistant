To keep the word order, one way is to use LSTM. The input of LSTM is a sentence, in which each word is represented as a word embedding. You feed one-hot encoding as the input of the word embedding layer. The LSTM "reads" the sentence from the first word of the sentence to the last word. The output at the last word is the target of your task (say, sentence labels).
