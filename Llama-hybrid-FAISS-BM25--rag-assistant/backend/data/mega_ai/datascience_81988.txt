Mean of mean and average

In order to establish an overall rating for a product from a series of user ratings (from 1 to 5), I thought that the median would be a good idea so that extreme values would not have too much influence. But in doing so, it is hard to rank products since they will all have a whole ranking. So I thought about averaging the mean and the median. Is this a known measure? Is it relevant in this case?
