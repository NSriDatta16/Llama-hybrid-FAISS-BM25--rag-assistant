It is evident from looking at the Autocorrelation Function (ACF) of an MA(1) process that it stops after the initial lag. This occurs because in an MA(1) process, none of the stages before it affect the output directly; rather, it only depends on the error term of the prior step. There is no correlation between the time series values after the first lag since the error terms are taken to be independent and identically distributed. The Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF), on the other hand, measures the correlation between observations at different lags that is not explained by correlations at all lower-order lags. Now, for an MA(1) process, the PACF does not cut off abruptly after lag 1 like the ACF does. Instead, it declines more gradually. This might seem counterintuitive at first, because if there is no correlation after lag 1, one would expect the PACF to show the same. The reason for this apparent discrepancy is that while ACF considers both direct and indirect effects of correlations, PACF aims to isolate the direct effect at each lag. The PACF at higher lags for an MA(1) process is attempting to account for the direct correlation between observations separated by more than one time period, assuming we could account for the effect at lag 1. However, because an MA(1) process only directly incorporates one lag of error, the indirect effects that PACF is trying to account for don't actually exist. The appearance of a declining PACF is a consequence of the statistical methods used to estimate the PACF values. These methods effectively impose an artificial structure when trying to isolate the direct effects at higher lags in an MA(1) model, leading to the estimated PACF values that appear to decay exponentially rather than cutting off. This is somewhat of a mathematical artifact rather than a true indication of direct correlations at higher lags. To further appreciate this, consider the PACF as an attempt to use all available data up to k-1 to explain the connection at lag k. As there is no further information available after lag 1 to explain the correlation in an MA(1) process, interpreting the PACF at higher lags turns into an exercise in extrapolating the observed decay pattern from the available data.
