Why ignore the denominator of bayes rule?

I am a new beginner in stats. I have specifically diverted my attention towards this because, I wish to understand the concept of Deep Bayesian Learning, so I am starting with the basics. The question is: The Bayes rule equation is given by $P(X | Y)$ = $\cfrac{P(Y | X). P(X)}{P(Y)}$ But, I have noticed in some places, the denominator being ignored entirely and using just the numerator of the RHS of the equation. making it: $P(X | Y)$ = $P(Y|X).P(X)$ Is there some special case where we can ignore the P(Y)? as in when P(Y) = 1? But, if that's the case, wouldn't all the things become very easy: P(Y | X) will become 1, and P(X | Y) will be just P(X) and done.
