What PHP application design/design patterns do you use?

Please share your favorite application design / design patterns for use in PHP with me. Some things I'd like to know: How your folders are designed How you use object oritentation in your PHP applications Do you have a standard way of dealing with CRUD, pagination, or any other common tasks? How do you avoid using repetitive code? What's your approach to libraries/sharing common code, etc? What are ways in which you can make your code more elegant? You don't have to answer all of these, answering any or a few of these will be helpful. The reason I'm asking this,is because I'm very tired of writing repetitive, ugly code in PHP and I want to make a small framework for my freelancing projects which will make programming easier and let me focus on the challenging/business tasks rather than form validation, pagination, and the other mundane activities which make up 80% of programming work in PHP All opinions appreciated!
