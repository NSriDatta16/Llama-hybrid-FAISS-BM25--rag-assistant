Each input sequence should be padded to the same length. The most common method is to find the longest sequence and then add zeros to all shorter sequences. Most Deep Learning frameworks will have a built-in function to do this. Consistently sized-input data allows common neural networks models (e.g., Convolutional Neural Network and Recurrent Neural Network) to be fit in a straight-forward manner.
