Okay so here's the solution. Most everyone made really good points but none solved the problem (THANKS for the help). Here is the solution I found to work. Move jars from .../web-inf/lib to PROJECT_ROOT/lib Alter build path in eclipse to reflect this change. cleaned and rebuilt my project. ran the junit test and BOOM it worked! My guess is that it had something to do with how Ganymede reads jars in the /web-inf/lib folder. But who knows... It works now.
