I have to disagree with the earlier answers that the values of the (unnormalised) posteriors at the MCMC simulations are not of any use. They actually provide a much more refined view of the posterior than an histogram, especially in multiple dimensions. One direct illustration is the construction of the HPD region: the easiest way to construct an HPD region at level $\alpha$ is to take the same percentage on the MCMC simulations with the largest [unnormalised] posterior values and to construct a convex envelope of these simulations.
