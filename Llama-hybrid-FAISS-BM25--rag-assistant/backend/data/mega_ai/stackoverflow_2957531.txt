hmm interesting error, I've seen this before, I suggest you using Gecko . Some References: Embedding Gecko(Mozilla rendering engine) in a .Net application GeckoFX is a Windows Forms control written in clean, commented C# that embeds the Mozilla Gecko browser control in any Windows Forms Application.
