Have you thought about targeting x86 assembly? I did a Tiger compiler myself few years ago, and the assembly emitter, although hard to write, was one of the most rewarding things in the whole project. Writing your own small VM in C is also a good (if not better) idea. Targeting existing VM is pragmatic, if you're creating a production language, but removes many learning possibilities from the exercise. If I were you, I would take a closer look at different optimization techniques later in the project.
