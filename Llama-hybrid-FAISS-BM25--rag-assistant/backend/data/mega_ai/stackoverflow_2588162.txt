You should ignore retain counts because the system adds and removes retain count behind the scenes and you can't possibly track it. Instead, you need to focus on matching the retains and releases pairs you yourself create. In this case, the only thing you need to pay attention to is the possible retain of initializing the image views in the first place. Usually it looks something like this: UIImageView *imgView=[[UIImageView alloc] initWithImage.... [myMutableArray addObject:imgView]; [myView addSubview:imgView]; [imgView release]; And you're done. The array and view will manage their own retention and you matched the retain of your initialization with a release and all is right with the world.
