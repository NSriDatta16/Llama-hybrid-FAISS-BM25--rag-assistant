Precision and recall for clustering?

Im confused about calculating precision and recall for clustering mentioned in this paper , Model-based Overlapping Clustering , A Banerjee et al., (last paragraph of column 1 on page 5). Suppose, if we are given with resultant cluster indicator matrix $C$ of size $n \times k$ where $n$ is the number of data points and $k$ is the number of cluster. A data point may be assigned to multiple cluster. Can any one provide me the exact details of calculating precision and recall for this resultant cluster indicator matrix $C$ as mentioned in the paper . Assume the true cluster indicator matrix is also available, say $True\_C$
