Without you telling us what application such a database schema is supposed to support, we cannot really comment. In general, however, the DB schema is supposed to at least somewhat reflect the application and the data of one or more specific domains. However, inserting one more layer just in order to avoid future refactoring does not sound very appealing to me, at least not without a clear-cut advantage for the code that is under development now , such as introducing a more suitable storage model for your data. As it is, all I can see is a whole bunch of indexes (implied by the PRIMARY KEY and UNIQUE constraints) and foreign keys, which is an excellent way to bring any DB server down to its knees...
