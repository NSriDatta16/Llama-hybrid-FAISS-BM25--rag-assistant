When shell=True is passed to Popen, you pass whatever you would send on the command line. That means your list should only have one element. So for example: subprocess.Popen(['myscript.sh "var=11; ignore all" /path/to/files'], shell=True, executable="/bin/bash") Or if /path/to/files is a variable in your Python environment: subprocess.Popen(['myscript.sh "var=11; ignore all" %s' % path_to_files], shell=True, executable="/bin/bash") Having said that I STRONGLY encourage you not to use the shell argument. The reason is fragility. You'll get a much more robust way of doing it like this: subprocess.Popen(["/bin/bash", "myscript.sh", "var=11; ignore all", path_to_files]) Note that "var=11; ignore all" is passed as one argument to your script. If those are separate arguments, make them separate list elements.
