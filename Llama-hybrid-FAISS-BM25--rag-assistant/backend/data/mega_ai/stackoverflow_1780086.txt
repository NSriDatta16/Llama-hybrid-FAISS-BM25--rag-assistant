AS3 actionscripting

I'm embedding a flash file from an external domain and there is some JSON data in the page I would like to use in the movie. Whats the best method to get these variables without passing them on as a flashvars (I don't have control of the page it's embedded in). My only idea is to enable script access to 'always' and then get the full url to scrape the html from the page. All within flash and I'd then use regular expressions to remove everything except the part I need. This isn't ideal and I'm sure there must be a proper way to do this. Any help much appreciate. Thanks,
