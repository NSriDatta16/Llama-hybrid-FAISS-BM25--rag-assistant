I just saw Josh's Tweet. There are a few ways to tackle this. 1 Use the CRM Migration Tool Can you make a copy of your 3.0 system and upgrade it to 4.0? If you can Upgrade your CRM 3.0 machine to 4.0 and make sure that it and your new system are at the same rollup level then you can migrate everything across. The deployment manager has a tool to allow importing an entire organization from another CRM system. Now that CRM supports multi-tenant configurations and companies are supposed to be able to go from offline Hosted solutions to local solutions, they had to create a way to migrate all of that data back and forth. The key to making this work well is to make sure that you have all of the same CRM users set up on the target system, otherwise you will have to provide it with a choice for remapping the data owned by each CRM user. 2 Bulk Import You can export your data to a CSV format to be imported using the provided CRM bulk import tool. Unfortunately this has a lot of limitations. 3 Custom Import solution I have an import framework that I have been evolving for a while now that can move data from just about any format into CRM. This is MUCH more powerful than the Bulk import because you can decide exactly how you want things to be migrated. Feel free to contact me if you need this kind of solution. My email can be found off my blog or website. Try option 1 if you can, option 2 if you only need some of your data and the bulk import tool will bring enough of it over, and option 3 if you can't make option 1 or 2 work for you.
