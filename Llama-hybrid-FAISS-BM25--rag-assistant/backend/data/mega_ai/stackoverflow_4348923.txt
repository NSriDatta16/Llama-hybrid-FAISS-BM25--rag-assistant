Delete all Excel drawing layer shapes matching a pattern

Consider an Excel Worksheet with lots of shapes. To select two shapes: ActiveSheet.Shapes.Range(Array("Freeform 314", "Freeform 278")).Select The goal is to delete all the shapes starting with "Freeform" . I found an example referencing MS VBScript Regular Expression 5.5 , but shapes do not reside on specific cells. The quantity or specific number of shapes is almost unkwown. So an ugly solution can be to brute force the strings names, on the other hand I hope you can help me out to achieve an elegant solution. The code below doesn't work, but you can get a better idea of the problem. Sub DeleteShapes() Dim re As New RegExp re.Pattern = "Freeform*" Dim cell As Range For Each cell In ActiveSheet.Shapes.Range(Array(re.Pattern)).Select Selection.delete Next cell End Sub
