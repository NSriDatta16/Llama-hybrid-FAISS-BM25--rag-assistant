There is also another good example here: http://silvermail.com.au This is a Silverlight based mail client that looks a little like Outlook. When I go to send mail and start typing in the "To" text box, an auto-complete pops up and populates the control for me based on values in a list... I think it automatically stores the addresses in isolated storage, but that's just a guess. This is a really handy tool for checking mail while away from my home PC... at work for example... and it is loaded with impressive Silverlight functionality. S.
