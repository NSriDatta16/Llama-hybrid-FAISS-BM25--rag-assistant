Dissimilarity only between different treatments in dataset

I am studying the impact of wildfires on vegetation species composition. I have surveyed the burnt and unburnt areas on six sites which burned at different points in time from which I now have species abundance data, in the form of a matrix (plots as rows, species as columns) I'm interested in the dissimilarity between the burnt and unburnt plots at each site, and I would like to see if this changes over time. The hypothesis is that a recently burnt area has high dissimilarity from the adjecent unburnt area, but that this dissimilarity decreases with time since fire as the vegetation regenerates. I know I can use eg. the vegdist function in Vegan in R to get eg. Bray-Curtis dissimilarity. But the result matrix that this returns is not very useful as it gives me the dissimilarity between ALL plots with all other plots (burnt-burnt, unburnt-unburnt and burnt-unburnt), and I am only interested in half of the resulting matrix (burnt-unburnt). I'd like to plot the results of dissimilarity between all burnt and unburnt plots at each site as a simple linear regression and then test the change over time, with a simple linear regression. The attached image is me having done this, sort of, but after a lot of work where I've sorted the vegdist result in excel, removing all undesirable quadrat combinations. There MUST be an easier way to do this! Can't I tell R what my groups (treatments) are, and have it show me the dissimilarity for only the desirable combinations? I need to do this on a few other datasets, and I don't want to do it this way every time. I guess I can do eg. an NMDS test get the centroids for each treatment at each site, and then look if the distance between them changes with time, but if I test the significance of that it will be a very low sample size, compared to if i test all pairwise comparisons (so I'm assuming that might not be good enough but maybe I'm wrong). Do you have any advice on how to do this? I hope my explanation makes sense.
