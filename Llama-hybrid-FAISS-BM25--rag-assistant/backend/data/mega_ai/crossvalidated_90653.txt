Nonlinear SVM is a synonym for SVM with a kernel trick. The idea is that if there is no linear separation in the original space, it may exist in some other space, quite likely of a higher dimension. Kernel trick allows one to construct this space implicitly by messing with the dot product in the original space; that's why the result seems as there is a nonlinear boundary in the original space. The scalar stuff is just a way of interpreting the boundary hyperplane. You can map the points on an axis perpendicular to the boundary, hook the zero onto the intersection and then each object will get a single coordinate that is positive for one class and negative for the other. See above. Tough stuff; sometimes you know that the data will fit particular kernel, sometimes you hope that RBF will also be good enough this time but generally it is an extra hyperparameter to be tuned. See 2.
