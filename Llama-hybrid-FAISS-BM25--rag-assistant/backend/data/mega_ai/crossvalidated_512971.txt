MCMC stands for Markov Chain Monte Carlo and is a method that can estimate or compute different distributions. In MCMC you create a sequence of random variables under the Markov assumption (a Markov Chain) and you modify that sequence so that you can use the generated random variables for Monte Carlo sampling . Monte Carlo sampling can be used to compute quantities such as the posterior mean, the posterior mode, etc. The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is an MCMC algorithm to obtain samples, $\theta^{(n)}$ , from a desired distribution, such as the posterior distribution. The posterior distribution tells you what is the probability distribution of the parameters $\theta$ in a model given a set of realized measurements, $X = x$ . The measurements are assumed to be a realization of a set of random variables $X$ , that is generated by said model and its parameters $\theta$ . Applying the Metropolis Algorithm to the posterior distribution gives: Given $\theta^{(n)}$ Sample $\theta'$ from $\mathcal{N}(\theta';\theta^{(n)}, \Sigma)$ Set $$\theta^{(n+1)} = \begin{cases}\theta' \quad \text{with probability } \rho(\theta', \theta^{(n)}) \\ \theta^{(n)} \quad \text{with probability } 1- \rho(\theta', \theta^{(n)}) \end{cases}$$ where $$ \rho(\theta', \theta^{(n)}) = \min \left(1, \frac{p(X=x|\theta')p(\theta')}{p(X=x|\theta^{(n)})p(\theta^{(n)})}\right) $$ Running this for sufficiently many samples, the generated samples will then be distributed according to the posterior distribution $$ \theta^{(n)} \sim p(\theta | X=x) $$ The interpretation of a Metropolis step is that for each proposed $\theta'$ you compute the probability of observing the generated $X$ , from the model and $\theta'$ , with what you have $x$ . If that probability is higher than the corresponding value for $\theta^{(n)}$ , you accept that sample. But even if the proposed value $\theta'$ yields a lower probability, there is still a chance that you accept that sample. Running this for a long time, the samples $\theta^{(n)}$ will concentrate around regions where $p(\theta | X=x)$ have high probability.
