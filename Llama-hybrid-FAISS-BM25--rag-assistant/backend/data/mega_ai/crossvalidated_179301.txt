Theoretically, does the intercept term in a logistic regression model capture all unobserved effects? This is an interesting question, and I can see how with some simple experiments, one might think that this is the case. In fact, in my first attempt to set this up, I actually created a demonstration would only incorrectly estimate the intercept when I mis-specified the model -- otherwise, all coefficient estimates were fine! In an OLS regression, the error term is where we would like for all of the effects for which we have not accounted to go... but if there are effects for which we have not accounted (i.e., the model is mis-specified) then they will tend to rear their heads in other features of the model, particularly if there are confounding relationships among variables. This is also true of all other conventional regression methods -- if the model is mis-specified, the coefficient estimates are not trustworthy (but perhaps the predictions will be helpful or the model serves some other useful purpose). For example, here is a binomial model where there are just two features, and some dependence between them. I've rigged it such that the coefficients should be $\beta_0=10, \beta_1=-5, \beta_2=5.$ But if we omit $x_2$ from the model estimation, all of our coefficients are estimated incorrectly -- and wildly so! set.seed(13) N |z|) (Intercept) -0.1404 0.2327 -0.604 0.546 x1 -1.3417 0.3041 -4.412 1.02e-05 *** But if we correctly-specify the model, we get our coefficients back, but with some estimate error. goodModel |z|) (Intercept) -9.9512 2.9331 -3.393 0.000692 *** x1 -4.8657 1.1918 -4.083 4.45e-05 *** x2 0.9970 0.2948 3.382 0.000720 *** In other words, in a logistic regression model with a perfect fit (i.e. all relevant variables are included), the intercept term should be zero right? Why would this be the case? Suppose you're performing a logistic regression and you have no covariates -- for example, your experiment is rolling a die and every 6 is a "success", and every other outcome is a failure (perhaps you're doing quality assurance for a casino). If we assume that the dice are fair, you'd estimate the coefficient at some nonzero value purely because there are more unfavorable outcomes than favorable outcomes in your data. It's important to understand that you've asked two different questions in your post. The first asks whether the intercept captures un-modeled effects (it doesn't! All coefficient estimates are wrong when the model is mis-specified!) The second question asks whether the intercept should be zero -- and the answer is also no, because the intercept term is fixed by the ratio of "successes" to "failures".
