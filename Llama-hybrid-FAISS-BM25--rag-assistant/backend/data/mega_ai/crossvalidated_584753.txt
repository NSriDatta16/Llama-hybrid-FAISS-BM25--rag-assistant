You cannot use the pooled $df_{2}$ value. The pooled $df_{2}$ is calculated as follows (see enders 2010 p239 and following) $df_{2Pooled} = 4 + (km - k - 4)[1+(1-\frac{2}{km-k})\frac{1}{ARIV}]^2$ where k = number of parameters, m = number of imputation data, ARIV = average relative increase in variance and km - m > 4. It is hard to see from the equation but if you plot it, you see a linear increase in $df_2$ for m (see here an example with k=4 and reduction in variance of 5). Because $eta^2$ is inverse proportional to $df_2$ , your $eta^2$ will shrink if you use the pooled $df_2$ version and increase m (the number of imputations). You can also just try it out, use the pooled $df_2$ value and calculate the $eta^2$ values for different values of m. I would suggest to calculate $eta^2$ by bootstrapping the sum of squares. In the end $eta^2 = SS_{effect} / SS_{total}$
