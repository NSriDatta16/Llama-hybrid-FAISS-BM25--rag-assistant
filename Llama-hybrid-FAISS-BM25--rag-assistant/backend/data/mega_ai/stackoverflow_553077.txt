It is more "constrained variables" than "constrained types" - but definitely interesting. As with generic constraints, there are probably a few minor niggles with resolution if there are conflicting members, but the same workarounds would presumably apply as with generic constraints. Of course, the pragmatic view is that you can already cast etc, but then you need to keep the two references up-to-date with each-other... hmm... interesting.
