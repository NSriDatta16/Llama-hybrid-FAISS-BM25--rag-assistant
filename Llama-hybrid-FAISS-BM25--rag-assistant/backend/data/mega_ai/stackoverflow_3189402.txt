Objective-C: Any way to embed text formatting like or into a string in a plist?

I am a new objective-c/iPhone developer and am wondering if there is any way to embed formatting tags into a string in plist? I have a plist that is an array of dictionaries. Each dictionary contains a few string objects, some of which I would like to contain lists and paragraphs of information. Is there any way to embed tags like or into an string that will be recognized? If there is a way to do this, any reference to which tags are accepted would be greatly appreciated. I have tried embedding these into the string from the xcode plist editor, tried using PlistEdit Pro, and also tried editing the xml, but have not had any luck so far! Thanks in advance for your help.
