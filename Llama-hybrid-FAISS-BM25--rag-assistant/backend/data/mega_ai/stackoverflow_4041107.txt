From my personal experience, both lua and tcl have fantastic C APIs for embedding. Both languages are very simple. If you're writing a command interface, I'd probably say go with tcl, but if you're just using an embedded interpreter, I'd recommend lua. Given that you're using C++, you might also want to look into the luabind API, I have heard good things about it. For AI scripting, or other state machine-type things, this blog post by Zed Shaw is a good read. Coroutine-based AI code can look a lot nicer for complex scripts, rather than managing an enormous pile of states and their transitions. If you're using python, you might be better off extending rather than embedding .
