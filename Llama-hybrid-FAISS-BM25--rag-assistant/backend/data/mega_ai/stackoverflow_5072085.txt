What Kai said... just would like to add to it what is likely causing it. If you click on the thumb (the actual thumb) it is a Bitmap object. so the target is not a MovieClip. Try running it in debug mode to make sure that this is the case. You can also add a trace flash.utils.getQualifiedClassName(e.target) to see what ti is. If you are converting a non related class (non MovieClip or MovieClip derived Class) then you'll get a null. you could do an while statement to find the parent that is a projectThumb or just assume that it's the parent. Another way of doing it is adding transparent button that would cover the size of the projectThumb on top of everything so you know what's calling the click event listener try... projectThumb.addEventListener( MouseEvent.MOUSE_DOWN, onThumbPress ); projectThumb.addEventListener( MouseEvent.MOUSE_UP, onThumbRelease ); function onThumbPress( e:MouseEvent ):void { var target:MovieClip = findPT(e.target as DisplayObject) as MovieClip; if(target){ setChildIndex(target, numChildren - 1 ); target.startDrag(); } } function onThumbRelease( e:MouseEvent ):void { var target:MovieClip = findPT(e.target as DisplayObject) as MovieClip; if(target){ target.stopDrag(); } } function findPT($mc:DisplayObject):DisplayObject{ while (1){ if ($mc is ProjectThumb){ //
