Why is the Objective-C Boolean data type defined as a signed char?

Something that has piqued my interest is Objective-C's BOOL type definition. Why is it defined as a signed char (which could cause unexpected behaviour if a value greater than 1 byte in length is assigned to it) rather than as an int , as C does (much less margin for error: a zero value is false, a non-zero value is true)? The only reason I can think of is the Objective-C designers micro-optimising storage because the char will use less memory than the int . Please can someone enlighten me?
