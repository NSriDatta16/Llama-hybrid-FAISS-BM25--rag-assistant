Drupal, Views module, Group fields in layout

I want to group some fields inside a div or similar HTML tag, for example I'm displaying node's title + node's teaser + node's image, I want to group the title and teaser into one DIV in layout for easier CSS styling. I know a silly method to do it in templates, but I want a quicker and easier method (Drag-and-drop in views edit). A similar example is CCK Fieldgroup.
