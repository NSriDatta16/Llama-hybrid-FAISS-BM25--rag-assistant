the IF EXISTS clause doesn't exist in the DROP SEQUENCE command in Oracle. You could use a PLSQL block to ignore the error: SQL> DECLARE 2 sequence_doesnt_exist EXCEPTION; 3 PRAGMA EXCEPTION_INIT(sequence_doesnt_exist, -2289); 4 BEGIN 5 EXECUTE IMMEDIATE 'DROP SEQUENCE seq_name'; 6 EXCEPTION 7 WHEN sequence_doesnt_exist THEN NULL; 8 END; 9 / PL/SQL procedure successfully completed
