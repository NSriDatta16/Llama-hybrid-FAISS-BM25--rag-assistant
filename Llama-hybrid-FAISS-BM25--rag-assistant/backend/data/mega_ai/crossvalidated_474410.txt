Bayesian estimation Prior adaptation

I have a dataset of 1 dimensional 20points as prior information, so assuming prior distribution to be Gaussian distribution we can easily find its variance and mean. Now we will use this prior finding the posterior, further some extra event occurred and due to that we will be getting 5 more data points, So now how should we update the prior to get a new posterior?
