Stan syntax, arrays versus integers?

I'm new to STAN, and on the job I've been given some sample training code. data { int N_pairs; // number of agent and callgroup pairs in data int N_agent; // number of agents int N_callgroup; // number of callgroups int agentid_ix[N_pairs]; // array with agentid int callgroup_ix[N_pairs]; // array with callgroup int calls[N_pairs]; // array with calls for each agent callgroup pair int outcomes[N_pairs]; // array with outcomes for each agent callgroup pair } Every item is defined as an integer, yet the last four line have comments detailing that it is an array assignment, despite the integer declaration. What's going on here? Additionally, this syntax int agentid_ix[N_pairs]; confuses me. Specifically, I have no idea what agentid_ix[N_pairs] is telling STAN to do. Any thoughts?
