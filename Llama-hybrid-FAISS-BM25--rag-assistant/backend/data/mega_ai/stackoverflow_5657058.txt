I think the more elegant solution is to use HasFlag(): [Flags] public enum DaysOfWeek { Sunday = 1, Monday = 2, Tuesday = 4, Wednesday = 8, Thursday = 16, Friday = 32, Saturday = 64 } public void RunOnDays(DaysOfWeek days) { bool isTuesdaySet = days.HasFlag(DaysOfWeek.Tuesday); if (isTuesdaySet) { //... } } public void CallMethodWithTuesdayAndThursday() { RunOnDays(DaysOfWeek.Tuesday | DaysOfWeek.Thursday); }
