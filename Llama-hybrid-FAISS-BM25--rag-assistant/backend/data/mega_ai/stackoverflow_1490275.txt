Neural Network Input Bias in MATLAB

In Matlab (Neural Network Toolbox + Image Processing Toolbox), I have written a script to extract features from images and construct a "feature vector". My problem is that some features have more data than others. I don't want these features to have more significance than others with less data. For example, I might have a feature vector made up of 9 elements: hProjection = [12,45,19,10]; vProjection = [3,16,90,19]; area = 346; featureVector = [hProjection, vProjection, area]; If I construct a Neural Network with featureVector as my input, the area only makes up 10% of the input data and is less significant. I'm using a feed-forward back-propogation network with a tansig transfer function (pattern-recognition network). How do I deal with this?
