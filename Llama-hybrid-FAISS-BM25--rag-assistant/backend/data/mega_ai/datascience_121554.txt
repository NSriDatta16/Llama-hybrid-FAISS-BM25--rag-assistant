Which algorithm can I use to estimate total number of passengers carried from time series of passenger counts

I have time series data coming at 10sec intervals from passenger counter in a bus [10,10,10,10,9,9,9,5,5,5,10,10 ...]. I need to estimate the total number of passengers carried in 1 hour. When the counts decrease, it means someone/somepeople got off. And when it increases it means new people got on.
