I think one issue that is occurring is that with a GLM, if you have random effects (such as $u$) that average out to 0, this does not mean that their effect on the average comes out to be zero. This is due to Jensen's inequality. To illustrate this very simply: consider $x_1 = -1, x_2 = 1$. Clearly, $\bar x = 0$. But $\bar{(e^{x})} \approx 1.5 â‰  1.0 = e^{\bar x}$. This is a very common mistake that is made in interpreting fixed effects in a generalized mixed effects model. In the case of an identity link, the fixed effect can be interpreted as the population average. This is not the case for other link functions. In terms of accounting for the random effect $u$, this actually can be done with generalized mixed effects models. Consider the following fits in R: library(lme4) u
