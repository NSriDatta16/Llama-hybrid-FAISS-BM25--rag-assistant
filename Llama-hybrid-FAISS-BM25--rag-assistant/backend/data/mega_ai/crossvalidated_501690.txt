Is my logic straight? Logistic regressions in R

I'm doing an experiment on people's ability to read facial expressions on faces with and without covid-19 face masks. It's a between-subject design with repeated measures. One participant either saw 36 images with masks or 36 images without masks and their task was to tell which facial expression the face was showing. The 36 images were of 6 different people showing 6 different emotions. Condition 1 was with masks, 2 was without masks I have a dataframe like this: id = participant id baseFace = id for image person faceSex = gender of image person faceEmotion = the facial expression of the image person response = the participants response of which facial expression they think they saw accuracy = well, accuracy condition = if they saw condition 1 stimuli or condition 2 stimuli id | baseFace | faceAgeGroup | faceSex | faceEmotion | response | accuracy | condition 1 001 young male angry sad 0 1 1 002 medium female happy happy 1 1 1 003 old female sad sad 1 1 1 004 young male neutral sad 0 1 2 001 medium female happy happy 1 2 2 002 old female sad sad 1 2 2 003 young male angry sad 0 2 2 004 medium female happy happy 1 2 3 001 old female sad sad 1 2 3 002 young male neutral sad 0 2 3 003 medium female happy happy 1 2 3 004 old female sad sad 1 2 4 001 young male angry sad 0 1 4 002 medium female happy happy 1 1 4 003 old female sad sad 1 1 4 004 young male angry sad 0 1 5 001 medium female happy happy 1 2 5 002 old female sad sad 1 2 5 003 medium female happy happy 1 2 5 004 old female sad sad 1 2 My hypothesis is 1 People are better at reading facial expressions in faces without face masks 2 People will report higher levels of confidence in decisions when evaluating faces without masks AND NOW TO MY QUESTION Since my outcome is binary (accuracy), I use a logistic regression model: lme4::glmer(accuracy ~ condition + (1|id), df, family = binomial) This is to me the most logical way to build the model since I'm using condition as predictor for accuracy. The question is: Would I violate any rules or my own hypothesis if I included more predictors or random intercepts? Here is my whole dataframe (in .csv) if it is useful: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uEL3vVM2v_QB4Ep8AXlYIF-hZyJouQzh/view?usp=sharing Thank you for any help. I also posted my question on StackOverflow but I was told to try here instead.
