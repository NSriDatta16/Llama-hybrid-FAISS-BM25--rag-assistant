For data juggling I try to use as much SQL as possible, at least for the basic things like GROUP BY averages. I like R a lot but sometimes it's not only fun to realize that your research strategy was not good enough to find yet another function hidden in yet another package. For my cases SQL dialects do not differ much and the code is really transparent. Most of the time the threshold (when to start to use R syntax) is rather intuitive to discover. e.g. require(RMySQL) # selection of variables alongside conditions in SQL is really transparent # even if conditional variables are not part of the selection statement = "SELECT id,v1,v2,v3,v4,v5 FROM mytable WHERE this=5 AND that != 6" mydf So I consider it good practice and really recommend to use a SQL database for your data for most use cases. I am also looking into TSdbi and saving time series in relational database, but cannot really judge that yet.
