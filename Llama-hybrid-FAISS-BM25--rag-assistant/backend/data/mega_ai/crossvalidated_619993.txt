Should standardizing a vector of data lead to a unit length vector?

I am reading "Introduction to Econophysics" by Stanley and Mantegna and I found the following in Chapter 13. I can't understand why the 2-Norm of a vector standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the SD should be 1. To me, it should be $\sqrt{n}$ where $n$ is the dimension of the vector. Let $v$ be a vector, $\overline{v}$ the average of the vector, $sd(v)$ the (population) standard deviation and $\widetilde{v}$ the standardized vector. The squared 2-norm of the standardized vector is $$ ||\widetilde{v}||^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n (\frac{v_i - \overline{v}}{sd(v)})^2 = \frac{1}{sd(v)^2} \sum_{i=1}^n (v_i - \overline{v})^2 = \frac{1}{sd(v)^2} \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(v_i - \overline{v})^2}{n}{n} = \frac{1}{sd(v)^2} {sd(v)^2} {n} = n $$ I understand that if we apply the same reasoning to a random variable the conclusion holds. But the norm of a random variable includes the expected value (reference here ): $$ ||V||_2 = \sqrt{E[V^2]} $$ $$ sd(V)=\sqrt{E[(V-E[V])^2]} = ||(V-E[V])||_2 $$ The 2-norm of a vector of data, however, does not have the $1/n$ component that is, in a sense, "embedded" in the expected value which leads to saying that the 2-norm of RV minus its mean equals the SD of the RV. The same conclusion is not possible when working with data because (interpret here $\overline{v}$ as a vector of averages of $v$ ) $$ sd(v) = \frac{||v-\overline{v}||}{\sqrt{n}} $$ So my questions are: Am I missing something or misinterpreting the text? How should I deal with data: should I standardize (divide by SD) or normalize (divide by 2-norm)? Thank you for the help!
