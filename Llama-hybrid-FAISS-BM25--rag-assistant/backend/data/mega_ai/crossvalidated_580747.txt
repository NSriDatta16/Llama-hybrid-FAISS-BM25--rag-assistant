What is the prior corresponding to a weighted sum of pdfs?

Recently, I have read a paper (Bayesian Bridge Regression , H. Mallick, 2018) which states that since $$ \frac{\lambda^{1/\alpha}}{2\Gamma(1+1/\alpha)}e^{-\lambda|\beta|^\alpha}=\int_{u>|\beta|^\alpha}\frac{\lambda^{1+1/\alpha}}{2u^{1/\alpha}\Gamma(1+1/\alpha)}u^{(1+1/\alpha)-1}e^{-\lambda u}du $$ then hierarchical representation is as follows $$ \beta|u\sim \text{Uniform}(-u^{1/\alpha},u^{1/\alpha}) $$ $$ u\sim \text{Gamma}(1+1/\alpha,\lambda) $$ My question: Suppose that instead $$ \frac{\lambda^{1/\alpha}}{2\Gamma(1+1/\alpha)}e^{-\lambda|\beta|^\alpha}=\int_{u>|\beta|^\alpha}\frac{\lambda^{1+1/\alpha}}{2u^{1/\alpha}\Gamma(1+1/\alpha)}(c_1 f(u)+c_2 g(u))du $$ where $f$ and $g$ are two known pdfs and $c_1,c_2$ some constants. Then, how would we write the hierarchical representation? and are there any problems with this kind of representation?
