It looks like a linear regression problem me too, but what about K nearest neighbors KNN . You can come up with a distance formula between each car and compute the price as the average between the K (say 3) nearest. A distance formula can be euclidian based like the difference in cylinders plus the difference in doors, plus difference in horsepower and so on. If you go with linear regresion I would suggest a couple things: Scale the dollar value up to modern day to account for inflation. Divide your data into epochs. I'll bet you'll find you will need one model for pre ww2 and post ww2 for example. This is just a hunch though. Cross validate your model to avoid over fitting. Divide your data into 5 chunks. Train on 4 and urn the model on the 5th chunk. Sum up the errors, rinse, repeat for the other chunks. Another idea is to made a hybrid between models. Use regresion and KNN both as datapoints and create the final price as the weighted average or something.
