You want to know if being murdered is independent from being a farmer. Use a $\chi^2$ independence test. See : http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~clight/chisquared.htm You must use real numbers of persons, not average (divided) values or whatsoever. The test mainly tells you if your statistics are strong enough (practically if you enough persons and deviation) to rule out the independent hypothesis. That's why real numbers of persons are required. Write something like two variables: M=0 if not murdered (still living or dead another way), M=1 murdered F=0 if is/was not a farmer, F=1 is/was a farmer Write the table as in the tutorial and just apply the test.
