You can just use a standard AJAX call to accomplish this. Create a .aspx page which updates the database in its Page_Load method, and displays any desired information (like the current DB value after the update) as XML. Then make an AJAX call to that page using jQuery. You can also return an HTML fragment (i.e. an updated GridView), and use jQuery to insert the updated HTML into the current page. Edit: Sample 2 on this page should be very close to what you want: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/ajax/AjaxJQuerySample.aspx
