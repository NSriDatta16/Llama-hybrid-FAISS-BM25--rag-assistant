Hello (author of 300 papers on time series here). This question is too vague without saying what the data is, heartbeats, gestures, web-query volumes etc. The best single paper to read on features for time series is "catch22: CAnonical Time-series CHaracteristics" The best source for dynamic time warping, is https://www.cs.unm.edu/~mueen/DTW.pdf If you explain the problem better, I could advise more.
