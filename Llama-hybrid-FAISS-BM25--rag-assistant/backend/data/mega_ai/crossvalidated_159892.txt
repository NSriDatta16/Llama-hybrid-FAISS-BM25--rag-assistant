Non-vector data and SVM?

My research is on antimicrobial peptide classification and prediction. I have gathered peptide sequences of lengths ranging from 10 - 200 and classified them using different machine learning algorithms. The algorithm with the highest performance in terms of ACC, SEN, SPC and MCC was the SVM. My negative and positive datasets are balanced, each with about 500 samples. The total number of attributes was 126. I want to know if my dataset can be classified as a non-vector dataset? Also, if the reason SVM had the best performance is that kernel methods are more appropriate when dealing with non-vector inputs? P.S. I major in biotechnology and my knowledge on machine learning is very general and basic.
