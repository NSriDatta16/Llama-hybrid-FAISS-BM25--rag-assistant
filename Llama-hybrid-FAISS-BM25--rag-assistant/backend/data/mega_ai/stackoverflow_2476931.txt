Redirect print in Python: val = print(arg) to output mixed iterable to file

So lets say I have an incredibly nested iterable of lists/dictionaries. I would like to print them to a file as easily as possible. Why can't I just redirect print to a file? val = print(arg) gets a SyntaxError. Is there a way to access stdinput? And why does print take forever with massive strings? Bad programming on my side for outputting massive strings, but quick debugging--and isn't that leveraging the strength of an interactive prompt? There's probably also an easier way than my gripe. Has the hive-mind an answer?
