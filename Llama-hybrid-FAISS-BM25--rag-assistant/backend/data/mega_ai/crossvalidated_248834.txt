We do not need to . It is a common and long-standing convention in statistics that data matrices have observations in rows and variables in columns. In your case, you indeed have $1000$ observations of $9$ variables. So it would be standard to organize your data in a matrix of $1000\times 9$ size. Most standard PCA implementations will expect to get such an input. For example, pca() function in Matlab says this on its help page : coeff = pca(X) returns the principal component coefficients, also known as loadings, for the $n$-by-$p$ data matrix X . Rows of X correspond to observations and columns correspond to variables. The coefficient matrix is $p$-by-$p$. But if you write your own code for PCA, you are free to follow an opposite convention and store variables in rows. I often did it myself this way.
