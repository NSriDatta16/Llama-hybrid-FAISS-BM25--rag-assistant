Assuming that you want the equivalent of if ( not ((a >= 40 && a = 60 && a then, if you think about the original expression, it should be if (a 50 && a 80) The first expression is allowing a to be a number from 40 to 50 or from 60 to 80. Negate that in English and you want a number less than 40 or between 50 and 60 or greater than 80. De Morgan's Laws can get you an accurate answer, but I prefer code that you can read aloud and make sense of.
