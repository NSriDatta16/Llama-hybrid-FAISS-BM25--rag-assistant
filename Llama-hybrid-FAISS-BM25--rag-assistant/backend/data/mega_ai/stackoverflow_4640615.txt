Is this a valid structure of an app

I have the following structure in my app, is this a correct/valid way of doing it? UINavigationController attached to the window, the rootcontroller in this navigationcontroller is a UIViewController that presents a tableview. When a user taps one of the rows a UITabBarController is pushed on the stack. This works, however I began to be unsure when I read this: Because the UITabBarController class inherits from the UIViewController class, tab bar controllers have their own view that is accessible through the view property. When deploying a tab bar interface, you must install this view as the root of your window. Unlike other view controllers, a tab bar interface should never be installed as a child of another view controller.
