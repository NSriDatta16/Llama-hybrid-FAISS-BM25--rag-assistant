Resources for learning how to implement ensemble methods

I understand theoretically (sort of) how they would work, but am not sure how to go about actually making use an ensemble method (such as voting, weighted mixtures, etc.). What are good resources for implementing ensemble methods? Are there any particular resources regarding implementation in Python? EDIT: To clear up some based on the discussion on the comments, I'm not looking for ensemble algorithms such as randomForest, etc. Instead, I'm wondering how can you combine different classifications from different algorithms. For example, say someone uses logistic regression, SVM, and some other methods to predict the class of a certain observation. What is the best way to go about capturing the best estimate of the class based upon these predictions?
