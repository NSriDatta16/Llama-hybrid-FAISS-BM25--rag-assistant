Is it a good practice to avoid using Session State in ASP.NET MVC? If yes, why and how?

It's not explicitly written somewhere but I felt so after reading few blogs on ASP.NET MVC. Just got curious and thought of asking it here. UPDATE: I'm not asking about memory/storage/RAM concerns on server. For them, there is a solution to store session out of process. I know that. I'm curious that, are there any scenarios where we had to use Session in WebForms but we can avoid it now in MVC taking benefit of the nice structured way offered by MVC?
