For Java development using Eclipse I have a few plugins that are indispensable. The MyEclipse Workbench adds a lot of functionality to most of the built-in modules. It makes it very easy to deploy an application to multiple application servers, and enhances a lot of the built-in editors. The PMD plugin is great for searching for potential code issues. As mentioned in a previous post today, the Ganymede plugin really helps to highlight log entries.
