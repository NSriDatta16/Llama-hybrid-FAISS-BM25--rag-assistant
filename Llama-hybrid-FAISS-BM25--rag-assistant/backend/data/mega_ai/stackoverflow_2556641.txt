It's presumably possible if the developers spent 679 times as much time writing test code as they spent writing production code. Just think: if they'd opted instead for 339 times as much test code, they could have had two entire database engines, each still with a ludicrous amount of test coverage. I once watched a fellow developer trying to placate a furious customer about slipped deadlines by informing them that he had written 5 times as much test code as production code. The customer was not placated, if you can imagine. At least I don't think 5X coverage is extreme anymore.
