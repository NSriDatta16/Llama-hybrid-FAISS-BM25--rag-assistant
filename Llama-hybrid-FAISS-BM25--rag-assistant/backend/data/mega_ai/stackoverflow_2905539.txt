What if it takes 1200 seconds to upload 610155 bytes? That seems perfectly reasonable. HTTP transfers are usually not as aggressive as mechanisms like scp and can tend to drag a lot more since HTTP is not especially efficient at uploading. You can try opening up your timeout, if that has a direct effect on the situation, or remember that some clients may be connected via a firewall that, for whatever reason, limits connections to a maximum amount of time, often of around ten minutes. Can you replicate the problem from a connection with a similar speed? Or on a larger file?
