You should consider checking the Azure Machine Learning platform. It is online and you can use it with a free account. Azure ML provides you with a workflow by using modules in a graphic user interface. Many of them are related with Data Munging and you can easily clean your data. If there is something that you cannot do in the GUI, then you can just add a module which let you run custom R or Python script to manipulate your data. The nice part of it, is that you can easily visualise your data at any time and check simple stats like the dataframe.describe() of the R.
