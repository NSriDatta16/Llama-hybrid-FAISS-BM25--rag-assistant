Have you looked into AMF (Action Message Format)? Action Message Format(AMF) is a binary file format representing a serialized ActionScript object. The AMF file type is used throughout the Flash Player for data storage and data exchange. For example in the Flash Player AMF is used in SharedObjects, RemoteObjects, LocalConnection, ByteArray, RTMP, and all RPC operations. Wade Arnold is responsible for an AMFPHP library that has since been packaged into the Zend Framework. You can use it independently of the framework, however. Here's some more info on it: http://framework.zend.com/wiki/display/ZFPROP/Zend_Amf+-+Wade+Arnold
