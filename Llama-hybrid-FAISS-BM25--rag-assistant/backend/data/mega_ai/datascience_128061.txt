You already have the perfect predictive model: if x1-x2> 0 then label = 1 else 0 . There is no machine learning to do. Just label according to this rule. If you, for whatever reason, have to scale the variables, then just crunch through the algebra. For scaling transformations $T_1$ and $T_2$ , define new, scaled variables by $s_1 = T_1(x_1)$ and $s_2 = T_2(x_2).$ $$ x_1-x_2>0\\ \Updownarrow\\ T^{-1}_1(s_1)-T^{-1}_2(s_2)>0 $$ You now have the condition to give labels in terms of the scales values, $s_1$ and $s_2,$ instead of in terms of $x_1$ and $x_2.$
