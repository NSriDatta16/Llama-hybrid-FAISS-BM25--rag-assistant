What is appropriate ordering of css selector? eg p.class or .class p

While debugging some css i noticed there is a difference between this order of declaration. The first caused headings inside anchors to display inline as desired, the second seems not to: 1/ a.aname { display:inline; margin:0px;} 2/ .aname a { display:inline; margin:0px;} Download I have mostly been using the second form to apply class styles. What is the difference in how these are applied, and are there any guide rules when to use each? (to avoid the css-puzzlement which arises when it's done wrong) Basic solution from answers: Use "direct selection" elementtype.class{} or elementtype#id{} to apply style to elements directly. For styling which is intended to affect once each time the rule is used eg. a margin change, a display change, a noninheriting font change. Direct selection does not inherit to child elements, it is applied to parent element only. Use "descendant selection" .class elementtype{} or #id elementtype to apply style to type descendants/children of the named or classed element. For styling which is intended to change appearance of elementtypes under an element/within a section of page where it is applied eg. inheriting font changes to text sections, inheriting format changes to paragraphs or list elements. Descendant selection applies to all child elements but never the parent. NBself: learn about other selectors too asap ;)
