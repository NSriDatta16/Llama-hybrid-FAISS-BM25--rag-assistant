How to determine the effect of different weather parameters (temp, wind speed etc) on component failure

I have a daily time series of the different weather parameters (temperature, wind speed, precipitation, Dew Point, ...) as well as a daily count of failure rates for an external component. I want to determine the effect of weather on the failure rate of the component. I have done the following: correlation, lag correlation to determine max lag, lm, glm, analysis of variance, intervalizing the weather parameters and combining. What is the best way to go about my general question How do I combine multiple weather time series into 1 or determine the most informative of the different time series. How do I address possible correlation within the weather parameters.
