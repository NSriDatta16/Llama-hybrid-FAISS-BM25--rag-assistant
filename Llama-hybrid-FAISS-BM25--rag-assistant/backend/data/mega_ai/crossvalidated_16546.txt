How to perform repeated measures ordinal logistic regression using SPSS?

I'm usually a UseR. However, for didactic purposes I have to use SPSS today. I have to specify a General linear model with ordinal structure because what I'm examining is: Change in Likert scale scores (1,2,3,4,5) WITHIN people, BETWEEN intervention groups over 2 timepoints. I can specify a full factorial model * Generalized Linear Models. GENLIN Question1 (ORDER=ASCENDING) BY Group PrePost Participant (ORDER=ASCENDING) /MODEL Group PrePost Group*PrePost DISTRIBUTION=MULTINOMIAL LINK=CUMLOGIT /CRITERIA METHOD=FISHER(1) SCALE=1 COVB=MODEL MAXITERATIONS=100 MAXSTEPHALVING=5 PCONVERGE=1E-006(ABSOLUTE) SINGULAR=1E-012 ANALYSISTYPE=3(LR) CILEVEL=95 CITYPE=WALD LIKELIHOOD=FULL /MISSING CLASSMISSING=EXCLUDE /PRINT CPS DESCRIPTIVES MODELINFO FIT SUMMARY SOLUTION. But that model doesn't take account of the non-independence of the participant's measures over time. I'd be massively grateful if someone could help me (help someone else) speify a model that would have a random effects component, taking into account the "clustering within patients".
