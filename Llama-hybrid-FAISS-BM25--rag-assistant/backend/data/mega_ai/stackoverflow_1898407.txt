Getting SelectedValue back from a DropDown in ASP.NET MVC (C#) using Entity Framework

Sorry if this is a repeated question, I scanned the related questions and didn't see anything obvious. I'm using an EditModel with an Entity object, along with two SelectLists in it. The problem is, once I reach my POST action, the SelectedValues for both drop downs are still the same default values I set in the constructor for the model, no matter what I actually select on the browser. My constructor sets some default values for the SelectedValues, but they are just 0 and "" (which aren't valid values in the dropdowns). I have a feeling the problem revolves around that somehow, but I'll give more details. Here is a stripped down version of the model: public class UserAccountModel { public UserAccount UserAccountData { get; set; } // Entity from EF public SelectList Organizations { get; set; } public SelectList Roles { get; set; } public UserAccountModel() : this(null) { } public UserAccountModel(UserAccount obj) { UserAccountData = (obj == null) ? new UserAccount() : obj; // default selected value int orgChildId = (UserAccountData.Organization == null) ? 0 : UserAccountData.Organization.ID; string roleChildId = (UserAccountData.Role == null) ? "" : UserAccountData.Role.Name; // go get the drop down options and set up the property binding using (UserAccountRepository rep = new UserAccountRepository()) { Organizations = new SelectList(rep.GetOrganizationOptions(), "ID", "ID", orgChildId); Roles = new SelectList(rep.GetRoleOptions(), "ID", "Name", roleChildId); } } public void UpdateModel() { UserAccountData.Organization = Organizations.SelectedValue as Organization; UserAccountData.Role = Roles.SelectedValue as Role; } } This is the Dropdowns portion of the view: Organization: Role: I might have done something stupid and obvious here. The examples are much more straight forward when using the ViewData dictionary, but I couldn't find too many examples trying to use straight model binding for SelectLists. Any help is greatly appreciated! Chris
