Iphone Scrollview Question

i am quit new at iphone development and trying to make a photo collage software while learning it. Right now i have a lil problem and hope you can help me out. I have an UiviewController with a view in it, in this view i have 7 scrollviews with uiimagevies in them for zooming and scollign images within these scrollviews. All that works well but now i want to make these 7 scrollviews dragable and maybe if possible zoomable (so that the image within the given scroolview zoom together with the scrollview). It should be possible to drag them all around the screen and if possible even overlap them and by the way rotating would be great ;-) hope that is not to much asked for. Would be great if someone can help me out with this..
