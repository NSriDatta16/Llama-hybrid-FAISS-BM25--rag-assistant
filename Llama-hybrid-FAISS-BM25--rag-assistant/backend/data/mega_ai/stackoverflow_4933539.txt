Database Design

First question I have following entities: Form which can have some Parameters (but not necessarily), Form has Tables . In one case(if Form has no Parameters) i know advance what Tables correspond to the Form, in other case (if Form have Parameters that the user chooses) I decide which Tables to load depending on choosen Parameters. How i can store this information in database? [Update] At this moment i have following schema: table Form, table FormParam, table Table; Form has relation to FormParam(one-to-many), Form has relation to Table(one-to-many); but in this schema doesn`t exist information about the dependence of Table from FormParam. I can do relation from FormParam to Table, but in my case not all situations Table depends from FormParam. Second question I have one table which contains some data (catalog of organizations). In another table i have data which will be selected by user from Form. In some Forms user must choose organization from list of organization. I want uniformity of data storage that a user selects from a Form, so i can duplicate records from the first table in the second, but i don`t want( i think this is bad style). How should I to do in this case? [Update] Perhaps there is a solution in such a way to design a DataBase that I can specify a first table to refer to records stored in another table. Maybe I'm wrong. Thank you!
