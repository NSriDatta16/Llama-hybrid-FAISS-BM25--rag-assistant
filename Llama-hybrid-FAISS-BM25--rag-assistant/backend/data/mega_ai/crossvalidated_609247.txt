Many things are possible . ( Here is one possible data-generating process that might lead to such sub-daily seasonalities , but no, I'm not really serious about that.) I am not an expert in wind power generation as such, however, I find such a periodicity extremely unlikely. I understand that wind could have intra-daily patterns (differences between night and day), i.e., a seasonal period of 24 hours, and intra-yearly patterns (differences between summer and winter), i.e., a seasonal period of about 8766 hours. (These are examples of multiple-seasonalities - you may find the tag wiki helpful.) However, other patterns simply don't make a lot of sense from a data generation point of view. Yes, the moon might have some very weak effect on the wind, perhaps via tides, so we might have intra-monthly patterns. I see no reason why the wind itself should have intra-weekly effects. Conversely, wind power generation might actually have such patterns: since electricity demand has weekly patterns, it might be that wind farms get cycled up or down with a certain weekly influence. But subdaily patterns at all these periodicities sound like an artifact or an error to me. I have to admit that I am a forecaster and think like one. To a forecaster, the question is not so much whether a structure is present in a time series, but whether it helps us forecast the series better . As such, I naturally turn to papers about forecasting wind power, e.g., something connected with a good journal like the International Journal of Forecasting , and then I start skimming them on whether they report this kind of seasonality. Here is a paper that sampled in 10-minute buckets and found daily seasonality ( $24\times 6 = 144$ ) periods per cycle - nothing about the kinds of seasonality you found. The GEFCom2014 did include a competition on wind power forecasting, but the summary paper does not go into details on what seasonalities were modeled by the winning methods. You might be able to get a better idea of what other people have found with a deeper literature search.
