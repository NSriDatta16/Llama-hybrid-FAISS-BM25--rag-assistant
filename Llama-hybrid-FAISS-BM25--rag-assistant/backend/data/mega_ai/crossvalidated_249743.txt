Forecasting a time series without significant autocorrelation

I have a time series without significant autocorrelation. http://pastebin.com/xZJnZs7k Autocorrelation plot. Partial autocorrelation plot. Here you can find a year worth of data and a forecast produced by auto.arima from the forecast package: observed and predicted values I have tried multiple models, for example ANNs and SVR, but they seem to always predict the most frequent values of the series. In other words the forecasts are nearly straight lines near the series mean value. Also I tried to use the ets R framework, but the forecasts were not much different from All models were validated using rolling out of sample forecasts. No model achieved an R2 score over 0.1. I aim to minimize the mean absolute error, the best I got was 1. My question is: What methods are there for forecasting such time series?
