Bezier curves draw stretched ellipses in HTML5 canvas

This method for drawing ellipses appears to be clean and elegant: http://www.williammalone.com/briefs/how-to-draw-ellipse-html5-canvas/ However, in testing it, I found that the resulting ellipses were stretched. Setting width and height equal, I got ellipses that were about 20% taller than wide. Here's the result with width = height = 50 : To make sure that the problem was with the method itself, I tried changing the algorithm so that all the points used for the Bezier curves were rotated 90 degrees. The result: Again, in both cases, I was expecting a 50x50 circle. Using the arc method described at How to draw an oval in html5 canvas? works fine, generating perfect 50x50 circles (which can then be stretched into ellipses using scale ). What's going on?
