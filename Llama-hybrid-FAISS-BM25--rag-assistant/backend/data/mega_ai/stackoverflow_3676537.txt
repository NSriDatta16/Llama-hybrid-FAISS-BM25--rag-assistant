You no longer have to rebuild the sample storage client library. v1.2 will automagically add three DLL references to your role: Microsoft.WindowsAzure.Diagnostics Microsoft.WindowAzure.ServiceRuntime Microsoft.WindowsAzure.StorageClient To create a table, you'll need to first set up your table : Create a class deriving from TableServiceEntity (say, "MyEntity")- Derive a table class from TableServiceContext (say, "MyEntityDataServiceContext"). In that class, create a property of type DataServiceQuery () that returns CreateQuery ("MyEntities"); Once you've done that, create the table with code like this: var account = CloudStorageAccount.DevelopmentStorageAccount; CloudTableClient.CreateTablesFromModel(typeof(MyEntityDataServiceContext),account.TableEndpoint.AbsoluteUri, account.Credentials); For a much more detailed look at this, download the Azure Platform Training Kit . There's a lab called "Exploring Windows Azure Storage" that covers all this.
