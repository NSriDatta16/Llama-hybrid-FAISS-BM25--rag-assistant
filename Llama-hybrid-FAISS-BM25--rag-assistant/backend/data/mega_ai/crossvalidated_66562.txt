It's possible to construct silly confidence intervals that are technically valid, i.e. have the claimed coverage, but it's not obligatory. So I don't know why doing so should demonstrate a flaw in "confidence interval methodology" (whatever that is)—you could have constructed a more appropriate one for your purposes. A more orthodox approach to this particular problem: First, note that you can reëxpress the sufficient statistic $(Y,Z)$ to contain an obvious ancillary component: the sample range $Z-Y$ . It's a very strong precision index: as it approaches $a$ , $\theta$ is known almost exactly. So any inference should be conditional on its observed value $z-y$ . Second, the sample minimum $Y$ conditional on the observed value of the range is uniformly distributed between $\theta$ and $\theta+a-r$ . Confidence intervals based on this distribution could be constructed & would be well behaved. Still, the likelihood for $\theta$ is flat between $z-a$ and $y$ , so it wouldn't be possible to say for any confidence interval with less than 100% coverage that it contained values of $\theta$ less discrepant with the data than those outside it. Best to stick with the 100% interval. [Response to comments: (1) Your confidence interval does have some undesirable properties* but that's no reason to tar all confidence intervals with the same brush. You only took unconditional coverage into account when you derived it & therefore have no right to complain that unconditional coverage is all it gives you. (2) You're right that $\left(Y-\left(1-\frac{1-\gamma} 2\right)(a-r),Y-\frac{1-\gamma} 2(a-r)\right)$ is a valid C.I., conditional on $r$ , but why not use $(Y-\gamma(a-r),Y)$ ? The likelihood is $\frac{1}{a-r}$ for all values of $\theta$ between $y+r-a$ and $y$ , & I don't see any generally compelling reason to honour an arbitrary 95% of those values with inclusion in my confidence interval. The 100% interval $(y+r-a,y)$ is preferable as it separates zero-likelihood values of $\theta$ from those with positive likelihood. *At least for inference on $\theta$ from a single sample: there may be some applications—say in quality control, where consideration of coverage over repeated samples is more than a thought experiment—for which it could have some use.]
