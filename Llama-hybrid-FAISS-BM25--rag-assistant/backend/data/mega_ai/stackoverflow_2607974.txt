Android v1.5 w/ browser data storage

I'm trying to build an offline web application which can sync online if the network is available. I tryed jQuery jStore but the test page stop at "testing..." whitout result, then I tryed Google Gears which is supposed to be working on the phone but it is not found. if (window.google && google.gears) { google.gears.factory.getPermission(); // Database var db = google.gears.factory.create('beta.database'); db.open('foobar'); db.execute('create table if not exists Lectures' + ' (ID_COMPTEUR int, DATE_HEURE timestamp, kWh float, Wmax float, VAmax float, Wcum float, VAcum float);'); } else { alert('Google Gears non trouv√©.'); } the code does work on Google Chrome v5. [edit] alert(window.google); on the phone is undefined, but is an object in Chrome. alert(google.gears); does nothing on the phone and jam the javascript, but is an object in Chrome. [edit 2] in the phone configuration, gears is activated. [edit 3] to be clear, you have to use google.gears database on Android 1.5, and html5's localStorage on Android 2.x
