Can I suggest that you use for loops instead of while s? You need to stop if you run out of space, so you might as well use the appropriate construct. I suspect you have a bug in this code: while(chapter[i]=get_paragraph(infile)) { if(!isspace(**chapter[0])){ break; } i++; } chapter[++i]='\0'; Firstly, shouldn't it be chapter[i] instead of chapter[0] ? You want to know if the pointer at chapter[i] points to a space, not the first pointer in chapter . So this will probably loop indefinitely - hence the need for a for loop, so you don't just loop forever accidentally. Secondly, you increment i at the end of the while block, and then again in the chapter[++i] assignment. i has already been incremented by the final loop execution before the while condition breaks, so it is already the correct position to use. ++i increments before yielding the value, so presumably you meant to have i++ here, so that it would increment after yielding the current value of i . Either way, it's confusing one of us as to what you mean, so maybe just put the increment on a separate line for clarity. The compiler will sort out any available optimisation. Finally (and I might well be wrong here) why are you setting the value to '\0' ? That's a null character, isn't it? But your array is of pointers. The null pointer would be 0 , rather than '\0' , I think. If I'm right, you might have still got away with it if '\0' yields the same set of zeroes as the null pointer.
