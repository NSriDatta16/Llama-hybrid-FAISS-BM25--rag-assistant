If all you have is WAR files, then an EAR is of limited usefulness, serving only as a deployment container for your WARs. You can save a bit of bloat by sharing JARs between the WARs in this way, but that in itself is not hugely compelling. EARs are essential, however, when dealing with full JavaEE/J2EE applications, which use WARs, EJBs, JMS, JCA resources, etc. The interactions and dependencies between the components of these sort of applications is vastly easier to manage in an EAR. But if all you're using Weblogic for is a WAR container, then you might as well use a vanilla servlet container like Tomcat or Jetty, for all the functional use you get out of Weblogic.
