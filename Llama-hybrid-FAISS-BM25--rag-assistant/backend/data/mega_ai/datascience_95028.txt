Suitable instance counting CNN for training on polygonal masks

I have a medical dataset labeled with polygonal masks (rather than rectangle boxes). It works well for pixel annotation with UNet to generate masks of healthy vs damaged skin. Now I need to do instance counting. Most of the CNNs like YOLOv4 consumes bounding boxes, not polygons. Which CNN should I use for instance counting given that my dataset consists of labeled polygons?
