Can you compare AIC to WAIC?

This may be a simple question, but I'm at a bit of a loss. Can I compare AIC to WAIC for the same model, one estimated using general linear models and one using Bayesian estimation? Or do I need to compare models using the same information criterion? Motivation for the question: The glm models are preliminary and ultimately inform the choice of more complex Bayesian models. Given the number of models I am running, I am trying to save some time by using glm where possible.
