Like many other database management systems, many-to-many relationships are not natively supported in App Engine Datastore, but could be solved through a "junction table". However, since App Engine's query language does not support joins, this will be very painful to use in your application. Google's BigTable architecture in fact discourages this, because distributed joins are not efficient. So, I suggest going with the "keep it simple stupid" rule; use the simplest thing that works. A list of strings in a "Blogentry" object sounds fairly robust. Even if it's prone to race conditions (people making updates in parallel, overwriting each other's changes), but how many people do you have editing the same blog post anyway?
