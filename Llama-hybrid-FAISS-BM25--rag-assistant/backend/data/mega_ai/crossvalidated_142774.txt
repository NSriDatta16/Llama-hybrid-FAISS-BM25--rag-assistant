percentiles of deviation

Disclaimer - I am an amateur and self taught in stats so I apologize if the answer is painstakingly obvious. From what I've read, the average can sometimes hide data regarding extreme values and that the use of percentiles is better for capturing these anomalies, but it seems that standard deviation is a lot like the mean in the fact that (if I'm not mistaken) you get the average deviation from the mean but no idea about extreme values or frequency of said values. For this reason is there a term analogous to the median of the data that describes the different percentiles of deviations from the mean? And is there a term for the frequency that each percentile occurs?
