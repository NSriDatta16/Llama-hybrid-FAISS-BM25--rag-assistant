Cross-correlation in R â€“ dealing with missing values

I have two time series. One is an environmental variable ( n = 108) organized by year and month. The other is a biological variable, also organized by year and month, but I have no data for some months ( n = 97). I did a cross-correlation in R between these 2 times series, and used the na.exclude function for the biological variable to account for the missing values. I then fit a lagged regression, again accounting for the missing values. However, I want to know: Could I do a cross-correlation by deleting these missing values (no data months) for the biological variable, which will leave me with unequal lengths? R still does a cross-correlation, but I am unsure if the results are valid. Could I delete the corresponding months in the env. variable to have equal length time series, or is accounting for missing values the correct approach? Thanks.
