As far as I know, there is nothing in the API to directly do "remote service discovery", but I found this , which I think is about that: Service discovery allows you to find nearby services, regardless of what devices are offering them. DiscoveryAgent provides methods to discover services on a Bluetooth server device and to initiate service-discovery transactions. Before a service can be discovered, it must first be registered or advertised on a Bluetooth server device. The server is responsible for a number of things, including creating a service record that describes the service offered, accepting connections from clients, and adding a service record to the server's Service Discovery Database (SDDB). In general, it works like Web services.
