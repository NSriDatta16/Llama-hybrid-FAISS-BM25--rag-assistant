Thanks for the input demi, I just basically put hidden buttons on top of the images. They weren't really circles, they were more complex shapes; hence the reason I didn't bother about the maths, so I just placed hidden buttons on top of the images themselves and make those hit areas and cover appropriately until I get the desired hit area coverage I need. Although not very neat, it works well! :D Thanks once again for the swift reply demi.
