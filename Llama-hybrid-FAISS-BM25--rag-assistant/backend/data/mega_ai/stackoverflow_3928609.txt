You could simplify the regex to: '(.*?)'|(\w+) You still have to use the flatten and compact, but at least it is a bit nicer looking. Not that you specified the need, but this will allow for the string: 'quote one' 'quote two' Below was rejected as less elegant than original solution. You could try: regex = %r((\w+)|(?:')([^"\r\n]*)(?:')) text.split(regex).delete_if { |x| x.strip.empty? }
