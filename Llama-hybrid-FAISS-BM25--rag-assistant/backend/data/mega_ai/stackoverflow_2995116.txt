At one point they took away getenv, but then the next version they put it back. I once had a problem where a new library class name conflicted with the name of a class we had created. We used "import java.whateveritwas.*" so we dragged in the new class without even knowing it. I forget what the class name was, but it could happen to you with any new class, especially one with a fairly generic name like "List" or "Map". That's the only problems with new versions that I recall running into.
