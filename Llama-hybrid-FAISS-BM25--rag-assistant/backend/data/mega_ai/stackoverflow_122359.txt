how do I create an array or list of ASP.NET checkboxlists

I know how to use the checkboxlist in ASP.NET to display options retrieved from a database. What I don't know how to do is to make this 2-dimensional. That is, I need a list of checkboxlists where I don't know how long the list is; both dimensions of the checkboxlist will be determined by list of people (pulled from database) list of tasks (pulled from database) and the user of the web page will click in column/row to specify which people will be assigned which tasks. Right now I'm thinking that my only option is to brute-force it by creating a table and populate each cell with its own checkbox. (yuck) Is there a more elegant way to create a 2-dimensional array of checkboxes with labels for both rows and columns?
