As others have mentioned here, the main application of tobit regression is where there is censoring of data. Tobit is widely used in conjunction with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) and by the economist. In DEA, efficiency score lies in between 0 and 1, which means that the dependent variable is censored at 0 from left and 1 from right. Therefore, application of linear regression (OLS) is not feasible. Tobit is a combination of probit and truncated regression. Care must be taken while differentiating censoring and truncating: Censoring: When the limit observations are in the sample. The dependent variable values hit a limit either to the left or right. Truncation: Observation in which certain range of dependent values is not included in the study. For example, only positive values. Truncation has greater loss of information then censoring. Tobit = Probit + Truncation Regression Tobit model assumes normality as the probit model does. Steps: Probit model decides whether the dependent variable is 0 or 1. $$ P(y>0) = Φ(x^{'} β) \tag{Discreet decision} $$ If the dependent variable is 1 then by how much (assuming censoring at 0). $E(y│y>0)= x^{'} β+ σλ\big(\frac{x^{'} β}{σ}\big) \tag{Continuous decision}$ Coefficient $β$ is same for both the decision model. $σλ\big(\frac{x^{'} β}{σ}\big)$ is the correction term to adjust the censored values (zeros). Please also check Cragg's model where you can use different $β$ in each step.
