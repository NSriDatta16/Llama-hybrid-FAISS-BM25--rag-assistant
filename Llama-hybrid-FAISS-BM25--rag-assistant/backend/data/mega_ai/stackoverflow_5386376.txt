2nd column of what would line up? Given that you are on iOS, using HTML or a table view would be far more straightforward than trying to line up characters with spaces. Beyond being programmatically more elegant, it will look better, be more resilient to input data changes over time, and render a user experience more in line with expectations for the platform. If you really want to use spaces, then you are going to have to limit your UI to a monospace font (ugly for readability purposes outside of specific contexts, like source code) and international characters are going to be a bit of a pain. From there, it would be a matter of getting the string length (keeping in mind that "length" does not necessarily mean "# of characters" in some languages), doing a bit of math, using substringWithRange: and appending spaces to the result.
