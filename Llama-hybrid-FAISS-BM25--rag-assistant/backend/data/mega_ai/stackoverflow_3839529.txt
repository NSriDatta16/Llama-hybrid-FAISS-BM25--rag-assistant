Perhaps you can get your toolbar to look better by enabling visual styles. You need manifest files for this. If you are using MSVC then you can do this with an inline manifest file in the form of a #pragma. #pragma comment(linker,"\"/manifestdependency:type='win32' name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' \ version='6.0.0.0' processorArchitecture='*' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")
