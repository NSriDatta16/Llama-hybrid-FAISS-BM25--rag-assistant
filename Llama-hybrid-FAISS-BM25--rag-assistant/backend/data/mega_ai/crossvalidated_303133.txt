I have not checked your code but an (appropriate) neural network can fit your indicator function easily. I am not a Keras expert but it looks like you have tanh activation in the hidden layer and linear output, which I think is not a good choice here. Perhaps you can try with sigmoid/logistic activation. The following is a single hidden layer of (only size 3) with sigmoid activation (a=2,b=5; red line is fitted; non-integer data is including in training;) Note that you would not expect an exact fit. One consideration is whether a neural network is the most appropriate for your problem. You may wish to simply estimate $a$ and $b$ with another (perhaps more classical) method.
