Not as much an answer to your question, but to the underlying misunderstanding: SPM does not simply set $\phi = 0.2$ , it approximates the autocorrelation of an AR(1) process by a 1st-order Taylor expansion at $\phi = 0.2$ . The coefficients of the resulting variance components are estimated by SPM. For a reference, see K. Friston et al. (eds.), Statistical Parametric Mapping , 2007, chapter 10. The rationale is that variance components can be estimated by ReML, while proper AR estimation from residuals is difficult. This approach has been shown to often not be sufficient (look at the publications by W. Olszowy). Newer versions of SPM implement another method, called "F.A.S.T.", which appears to overcome these limitations by adding more Taylor-expansion variance components.
