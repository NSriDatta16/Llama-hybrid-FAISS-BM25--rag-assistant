You are right that the documentation is wrong. Note that p values are defined somewhat differently from what you write. They do not measure the probability of a decision , such as the decision to reject the null or to fail to reject the null. They measure the probability of test statistics . Whether or not to reject a null hypothesis is a subsequent decision based on the p value and the alpha threshold. Instead of test statistics, one often uses the shorthand "data": $$\text{p-value} \equiv P( \text{data} \;|\; \text{the null is true}).$$ As you write, there is simply no way whatsoever to get from this to what the documentation is writing about, which is $$\text{p-value}\; (\not\equiv)\; P( \text{the null is true} \;|\; \text{data}),$$ unless you are prepared to go the Bayesian route, posit priors etc. Not even "any charitable way (even if it's a stretch)" . Nothing. This is a very common misunderstanding. The American Statistical Association (ASA) recently published a statement on p values , and the statement we are discussing here is treated in statement 2 in the ASA document (see p. 131 in the The American Statistician document): P-values do not measure the probability that the studied hypothesis is true
