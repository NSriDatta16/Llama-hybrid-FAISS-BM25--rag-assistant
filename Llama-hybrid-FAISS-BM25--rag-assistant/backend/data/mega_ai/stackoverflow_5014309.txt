Jquery UI draggable - Using percents instead of pixels

i have a problem with jq-ui draggable. I drag a DIV (on my home PC 1680x1024) into the right/bottom corner and save the position (left:125px; top:1536px;). Everything works fine. But when i switch to my netbook (1024x768) i get a stupid scrollbar. The problem is the different Screensize. Is it possible to use percents instead of pixels on jquery ui draggable() und resizeable()? Thanks in advance! Peter
