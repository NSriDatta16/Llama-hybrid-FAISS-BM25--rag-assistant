Dimension reduction for multivariate functional target that varies in length

I have target features consisting of about 70 different discrete time-series and I want to use this data to learn a model. Now the data is of course very high-dimensional, as I can also use a very high resolution regarding the time-steps. I came across multivariate functional Principal Component Analysis which I think suits my problem very well. The problem now is that the time-series vary in length from data point to data point. In other words: consider I have 2 data points with 70 time-series each. All the 70 time-series from data point 1 have the same length but a different length respective to the second data point. Can one still apply multivariate functional PCA on this? I also thought about using LSTMs (or recurrent neural networks in general) as auto-encoder and then using the encoder as dimension reduction but I am not able to produce 'much' data (somewhere in the ten thousand region) and I am not sure whether a LSTM is able to handle such high-dimensional data with less data points. EDIT: The data comes from observations and a corresponding simulation. One observation consists of 70 time series. The ultimate goal is it to do a simulation-based optimization, to be further specific to solve an inverse problem regarding the simulation. Thus I wanted to use a meta model/surrogate and hence I have to learn on the time series data.
