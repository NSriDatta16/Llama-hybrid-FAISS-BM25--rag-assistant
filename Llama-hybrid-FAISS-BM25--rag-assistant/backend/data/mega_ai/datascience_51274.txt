Yes there is a lot of literature about object detection using RNNs and it often consists of object detection and tracking in videos or action detection. Some papers: "Online Video Object Detection Using Association LSTM", 2018, Lu et al. "Re3 : Real-Time Recurrent Regression Networks for Visual Tracking of Generic Objects", 2017, Gordon et al. "Online Multi-Target Tracking Using Recurrent Neural Networks", 2016, Milan et al. "Action Recognition in Video Sequences using Deep Bi-Directional LSTM With CNN Features", 2018, Ullah et al.
