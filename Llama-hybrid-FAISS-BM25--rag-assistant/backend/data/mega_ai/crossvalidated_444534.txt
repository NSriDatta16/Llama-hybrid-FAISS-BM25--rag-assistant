You could consider using a two-part mixed-effects model for semi-continuous data. This combines a mixed-effects logistic regression for the dichotomous outcome $\mbox{I}(x_1 = 0)$ with a linear mixed model for the logarithm positive responses $\log(x_1)$ for $x_1 > 0$ . This model can be fitted, for example, in the GLMMadaptive package in R. For an example, check here .
