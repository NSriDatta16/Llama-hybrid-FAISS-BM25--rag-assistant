I have another opinion to the different importance ranking, there are following reasons for this variation: First, maybe there some highly correlated variables. random forest can't remove the highly correlated variables because of independent select features and tree construct process, so the highly correlated variables importance ranking will change every time. You can remove some highly correlated variables. Second, the parameters of random forest is not tuned. you can tuning the parameters, and plot the parameters vs. rmse, then select a more suitable parameters. Using the corresponding method, maybe you can produce a more stable results.
