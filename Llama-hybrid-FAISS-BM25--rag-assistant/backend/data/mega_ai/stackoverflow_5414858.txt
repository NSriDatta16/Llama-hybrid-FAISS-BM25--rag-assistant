Customer Invitation in magento

Can we find email-id of them which are invited by specific customer of Magento say "xyz@abc.com"? I know We can fetch the record for those who have accepted the invitation by table rewardpoints_referral , My question is here Can we get the records which are not accepted yet and if yes, then by which table? Thanks!
