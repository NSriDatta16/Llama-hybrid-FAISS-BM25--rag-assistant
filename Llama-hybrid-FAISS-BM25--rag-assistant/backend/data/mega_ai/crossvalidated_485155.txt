I'd say that the authors are not 'normalizing' to prepare a statistical elaboration, but just to show the results of their elaboration. Using their words: "While the variance in the data from the module is larger than that of the benchtop potentiostat ([...] $0.630\Omega$ versus $0.186\Omega$ ) each is still within acceptable bounds for that particular technique and matches well with the CHI measurements", i.e. the module measurements are very close to the CHI measurements: more than $99.5\%$ on average, within about $99\%$ and $100.3\%$ . Here 'normalizing' means "using CHI average measurement as a benchmark." The figure is not perfect, but... what is the problem? I'm not an engineer, so let me play with toy numbers. The average CHI measurement is $50$ , its confidence interval is $(49,51)$ . The average module measurement is lower, $49.2$ , its confidence interval is wider, $(48.2,51.2)$ , because of a larger variance. Dividing by $50$ , i.e. using $50$ as a benchmark, you have: CHI: $100\%$ on average, in $(98\%,102\%)$ ; module: $98.4\%$ on average, in $(96.4\%,102.4\%)$ . CHI is more precise, but module is still acceptable.
