Without having custom classes for each one, I don't know of an easy way to make these tables appropriately. Having said that, I would encourage you to reconsider your design, and consider the usage of better OO concepts. For instance, say you kept your Stock object/table, but then had another object such as DailyActivity component which contained a date, open, high, low, close, etc. You could then specify your stock as having a collection of DailyActivity objects. This could then be mapped by Hibernate as a Stock to DailyActivity, one-to-many, relationship. Then, if you wanted to evaluate how MSFT did it would become a relatively trivial query selecting the MSFT record from the Stock table, selecting its DailyActivity objects for a specified period of time.
