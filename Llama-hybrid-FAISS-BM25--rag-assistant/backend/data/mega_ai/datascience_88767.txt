This simply has to do with the fact that returns are compounding, i.e. the daily percentage changes are cumulative. If a stock gets has a daily percentage change of 1% for a single year (trading for 252 days), and therefore also an average change of 1% the total return over this year will not be equal to 1%. The actual return is equal to $(1 + 0.01) ^{252} - 1 \approx 11.274$ , meaning around 1127.4% , which is much larger than the average daily change of 1%. To get the correct total return over a specific period you have to multiply the percentage change for each period, which in your case is daily.
