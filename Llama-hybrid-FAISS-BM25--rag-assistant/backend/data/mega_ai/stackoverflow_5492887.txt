The modern Objective-C runtime can synthesize not only accessors but also storage for properties. You can specify the ivars that back your properties yourself if you want to, or you can let the runtime figure it out. SQLite is the only backing store for Core Data supported in iOS. If I'm not mistaken, the file will get created (if it doesn't already exist) when the managed object context is saved. The URL is associated with the persistent store when it's added to the persistent store coordinator.
