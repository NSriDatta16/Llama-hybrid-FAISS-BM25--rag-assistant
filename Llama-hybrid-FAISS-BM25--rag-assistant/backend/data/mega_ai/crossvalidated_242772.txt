Logistic regression in metabolomics data

So I have this huge dataframe with metabolomics data, meaning concentrations of 1030 metabolites, and other parameters like sex and age. Some of my data are from people with a particular disease (coded as 1), and control cases (0); and the final objective is to know if there is a correlation between any metabolites and the disease/no disease outcome (I am using the logistic regression for purely statistical reasons, not for classification). I've been trying to get to understand how a logistic regression works, and how my data are, and how to make simple logistic regressions in R, which I did. My problems comes into play when I try to go from 4 variables to my 1000. I an utterly lost about how to do it. On top of that, I have to model my variables with age as confounding factor, that I know how it is but I havenÂ´t found a place where they explain how to include this into my model. Any ideas about how to proceed?
