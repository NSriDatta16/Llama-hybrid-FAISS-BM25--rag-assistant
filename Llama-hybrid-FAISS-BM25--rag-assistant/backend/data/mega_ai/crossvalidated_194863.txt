PCA sounds like a good answer if you want to assume that there is a single axis of popularity - i.e. that a post that is more likely to have many shares is also likely to have many clicks or likes. If this is the case, your first component should capture variation in most or all of these variables and explain a large part of the data. If your PCA returns a number of components which each explains a fair amount of the data, but no one of which explains a majority, that suggests to me that the underlying assumption is somewhat flawed, and that in fact "popularity" in this case is used to refer to a number of metrics that need not coincide. Or, in other words, that there are several and perhaps conflicting ways that a post can be popular. In that case, maybe a principal component won't be the best index for you, but you'll still have learned something about your data and your assumptions. :)
