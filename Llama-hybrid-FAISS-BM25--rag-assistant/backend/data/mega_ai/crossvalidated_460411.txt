Books to read on ML after ESL (Elements of Statistical Learning)?

I am almost finished reading ESL; Elements of Statistical Learning. I come from a strong mathematical and statistical background, and that was my first book about Machine Learning. What other books would be good to go over now? I am aware of books such as: Machine Learning: A Bayesian and Optimization Perspective (.Net Developers Series) Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning by Bishop Machine Learning: A Probabilistic Perspective, by Murphy and I have heard they are all good. However I am unsure of the order of reading or if you may; 'double-reading' same stuff (although that would not be a terrible idea as not everything stuck with me from ESL). Thank you
