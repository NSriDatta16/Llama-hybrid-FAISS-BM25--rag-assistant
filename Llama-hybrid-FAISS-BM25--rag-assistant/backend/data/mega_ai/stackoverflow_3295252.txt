Shouldn't the xpath be: /achievements/category/achievement[@id='4602'] Or: //category/achievement[@id='4602'] http://www.w3schools.com/xpath/xpath_syntax.asp Update: The issue with that code is the fact that you were adding to the end of each name in $array . Generally, avoid adding formatting in this way, unless there's a good reason. Also, note my notes in the comments. Especially, urlendcode() . I left this for you to do with $url as I didn't notice it until after starting this edit and I'm lazy. ;) Note, that once you pass those query string params through urlencode() the + in the guild name won't be necessary and it will actually get in the way. ini_set("user_agent", "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux i686; pl-PL; rv:1.9.0.2) Gecko/20121223 Ubuntu/9.25 (jaunty) Firefox/3.8"); $server = "Sunstrider"; $guild = "Operation+Eskimo"; $url='http://eu.wowarmory.com/guild-info.xml?r='.$server.'&gn='.$guild; $xml = simplexml_load_file($url); $array = array(); foreach ($xml->guildInfo->guild->members->character as $char) { if (strtolower($char['level']) === '80') { $array[] = $char['name']; } } foreach ($array as $i => $name) { // note that this if statement and $i in the foreach are only here to limit this to 1 for testing, the full list spews out A LOT of data and takes A LONG time if ($i) { exit; } // note the urlencode() call, that's important $raidurl='http://eu.wowarmory.com/character-achievements.xml?r=' . urlencode($server) . '&cn=' . urlencode($name) . '&c=168'; $xmlraid = simplexml_load_file($raidurl); // note the pre tags around var_dump, makes things easier to read in the browser // also note print instead of echo, I lke to do this for debugging, as it makes // it easier to determine what's is debug output for those long running debugging sessions print ' '; var_dump($xmlraid); print ' '; echo " "; // quick and dirty solution for viewing the XML /*print ' '; print $xmlraid->asXML(); print ' ';*/ $achievement = $xmlraid->xpath("/achievements/category/achievement[@id='4602']"); print ' '; var_dump($achievement); print ' '; }
