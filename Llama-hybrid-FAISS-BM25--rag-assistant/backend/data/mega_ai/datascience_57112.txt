CNN model for more than 3 channels input

Are there any special cnn architectures for data, which has more than 3 channels? For example, satellite imagery, where we can consider different wavelenghts. It's clear, that we can readily use unet or something like that, but when there are 20 channels, for instance, it seems, that approach should differ. Not a neural network model, which can get feature-vector consisted of pixels from each channel, isn't sufficient perhaps, because spatial characteristics are important too.
