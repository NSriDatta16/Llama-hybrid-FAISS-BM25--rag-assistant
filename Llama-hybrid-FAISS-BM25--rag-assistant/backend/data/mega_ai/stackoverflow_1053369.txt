Finding Available Time Slot C#

We are building a slot booking system but the slots are dynamic that get updated live from the handhelds. I have got to the stage where we have the booking screen i know i have an avalible day and time slot between e.g. 8am and 10am. When i book the slot i need to put 2 records in a table 1 for job time and 1 for travel time. e.g. Slot 8am-10am Travel Time = 20 mins (Start 8:00am Finish 8:20am) Job Time = 30 mins (Start 8:20am Finish 8:50am) This would then show on a schedule gantt view visually we will be able to see his travel time and job time as 2 blocks. So if there where no other appointments booked the first appointment would start at 8am and finish at 8:50am but how can i see if there are any appointments booked in this slot and if they are find the finish time so i no what to set the start time for the next job. second problem - it may be the case where i have an appointment for 8am - 8:30am and another for 9:30am - 10am (the gap in the middle is due to a customer canceling) so i need to be able to say i have a job that totals 40mins can i fit it in the gap, YES get the finish time (8:30) and insert the records that fills the gap. Hope that makes sense, i would like to do the with c#. Any Ideas??
