How to represent numerically the diversity of groups of datapoints with a single value?

I work for a performing arts organization, and am trying to create a numerical figure to represent the amount of genre-diversity in each of our seasons. So let's say that we have a Spring Season and a Fall Season. There may be 5 theater events in Spring, 3 music events, and 6 art exhibitions. And 6 theater events in Fall, 5 music events, and 5 art exhibitions. My thought is to--for each season--find the total number of events, the proportion of each genre that makes up that total in percentage, and subtract those percentages from one another, add the absolute value of the difference, and then the higher that number is, the less evenly distributed the season would be right? The more variant the percentages are the less evenly distributed the events are, and thus one is probably getting more events than another. My main question is what is the statistical vocabulary to describe this (if it's something that would work anyway)?
