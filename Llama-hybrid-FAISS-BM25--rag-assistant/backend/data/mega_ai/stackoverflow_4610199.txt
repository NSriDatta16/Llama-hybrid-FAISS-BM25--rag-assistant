ASP.NET MVC SubString help

I have an ASP.NET MVC app that shows news articles and for the main paragraph I have a truncate and HTML tag stripper. e.g. The two functions are from an extension and are as follows: public static string RemoveHTMLTags(this string text) { return Regex.Replace(text, @" ", string.Empty); } public static string Truncate(this string text) { return text.Substring(0, 200) + "..."; } However when I create a new article say with a story with only 3-4 words it will throw this error: Index and length must refer to a location within the string. Parameter name: length What is the problem? Thanks
