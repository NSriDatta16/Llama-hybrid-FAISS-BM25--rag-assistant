Binomial distribution has two parameters: sample size and probability of success. The parameters can either be fixed or be random variables, can be known or need to be estimated. If they are to be estimated, then depending on your preferred approach they can be treated as random variables (Bayesian school of thought) or not (frequentist or likelihoodist). So both cases are possible and you need to consult the book about what exactly the author says. That said, using conditional “ $| $ ” ( vs “ $; $ ” ) notation often, but not necessary , suggests that the author treats them as random variables. If they talk about posterior, that this is clearly the case, since there are no non-Bayesian posteriors.
