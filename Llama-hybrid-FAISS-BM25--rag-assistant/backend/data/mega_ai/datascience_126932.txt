How can we make embeddings from the text?

I have a dataset with questions and answers to them. I want to make embeddings of questions and save them in a vector database. Next, I will make a query to the database. With the help of the pinecone service, I will be able to do what I have planned. I'm not vectorizing the answer text itself, just the question. But I have some questions. How do I need to provide the text of the questions in the embedding in order to summarize and simplify the search for the right embedding? That is, do I need to provide multiple questions referring to a single answer? I mean, the wording of a sentence can be different, and the answer to it can be the same.
