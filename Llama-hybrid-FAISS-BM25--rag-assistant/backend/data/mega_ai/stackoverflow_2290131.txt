IMHO you should do an array of structs despite the performance hit you take for instansiating all of the structs. The organizational sense of one state being stored in one struct far outweighs the loss of performance, and using one struct with a bunch of arrays and simply assigning each process an index in a number of arrays is very messy and can be a huge pain to debug.
