You have 3 response variables: one is a score and two are dichotomous. Assume you want to analyze them separately (fit a model for each of them). Conditions A, B and C will be treated as categorical covariate by using dummy variables $X_{ij1}$ and $X_{ij2}$, and difficulty levels as continue covariate $X_{ij3}$, where $i$ indicates the participant and $j = 1,\dots, 30$ means trials. Considering the score as continuous variable $Y_{ij}$. The linear mixed model can be: $$Y_{ij} = \beta_0+\beta_1X_{ij1}+\beta_2X_{ij2}+\beta_3X_{ij3} + \gamma_{i}+\epsilon_{ij}$$ and $\gamma_{i} \sim N(0,\sigma_\gamma^2)$, $\epsilon_{ij} \sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ and all of the random terms are independent. For dichotomous response variables, the mixed effect logistic regression maybe works. Same as above, Let $$Y=\begin{cases} 1 & \text{if correct}\\ 0 & \text{if incorrect} \end{cases} $$ and $$\mu_{ij} = \beta_0+\beta_1X_{ij1}+\beta_2X_{ij2}+\beta_3X_{ij3} + \gamma_{i}$$ Fit the model $$\Pr(Y=1)=\frac{\exp(\mu_{ij})}{1+\exp(\mu_{ij})}$$ When data are available, need to check the assumptions based on which the models are established. It is possible all of these models are not suitable for your data.
