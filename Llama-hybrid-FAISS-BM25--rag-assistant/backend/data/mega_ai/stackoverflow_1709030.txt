The definition of .org (from various sources) is "top-level Internet domain used by associations and non-profit organizations mostly in the U.S. and Canada." So, this could become misleading (not that people don't do it). I would follow the lead of WordPress, where .org is the Open Source project and .com is the commercial entity.
