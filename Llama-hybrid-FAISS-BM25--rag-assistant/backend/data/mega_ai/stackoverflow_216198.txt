I agree with other answers that it is not possible in Java. The other answers further suggest it shows a flaw in your design. While I agree with them, it is only fair to point out that some prominent OO experts (particularly Bertrand Meyer) disagree with us, and believe such a design should be allowed. Other OO inheritance models (notably, Meyer's Eiffel programming language) do support the "Change of Availability or Type" (CAT) feature that you are looking for.
