Please refer to the official scrum guide here: http://www.scrum.org/storage/scrumguides/Scrum%20Guide.pdf#view=fit My opinion is that in certain cases, having the stakeholders and product owner involved is an asset if there is something to improve in the interaction between the team and them. The management can see what's going on by checking the information radiator and seeing product done in the sprint reviews.
