Difference in difference was made for this sort of thing. Let $t$ be a binary variable with 0 indicating time point 0 and 1 indicating time point 1. Let $g$ be a binary variable with 0 indicating group A and 1 indicating group B. The model $$ C = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + \beta_2 g + \beta_3 t \times g + \epsilon$$ is interpreted as follows: $\beta_0$ is the average biomarker measure for group A in time point 0 $\beta_1$ is the average difference in biomarker measure between group B and group A $\beta_2$ is the average difference in biomarker measure in group A between time points 1 and 0 $\beta_3$ is the average difference in biomarker measure in group B between time points 1 and 0. If the test for coefficient $\beta_3$ rejects the null, then the data are consistent group B changing differently in time as compared to group A.
