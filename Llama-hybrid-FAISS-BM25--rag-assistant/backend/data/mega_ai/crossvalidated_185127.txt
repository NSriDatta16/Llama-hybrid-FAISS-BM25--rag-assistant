neural network back-propagation converging

i am trying to use neuralnet function on my data, i have two dataset one for train and one for test with 5 attributes and one output , the question is after i scale my data if i use 75% of my training data with backprop it works fine but if i use whole my training data it does not converge and gives me the famous error: algorithm did not converge in 1 of 1 repetition(s) within the stepmax can someone advise me what should i do ? i already tried all possible ways like changing the learning rate and stepmax and even rep , but still if i use the whole train data it wont converge thank you
