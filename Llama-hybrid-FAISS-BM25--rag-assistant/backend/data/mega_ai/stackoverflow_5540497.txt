Here's a fragment from some code where I 'solved' this problem using brute force. # $html is accumulator for HTML string my $html; # tag and section my $dtd = ' '; # HTML5 DTD my $title = "Storage analysis of $HOSTNAME as of $TODAY"; $html .= start_html( -title => $title, -style => { -code => $css, } ); # KLUDGE: CGI.pm doesn't support HTML5 DTD; replace the one it puts in. $html =~ s{ }{$dtd}s;
