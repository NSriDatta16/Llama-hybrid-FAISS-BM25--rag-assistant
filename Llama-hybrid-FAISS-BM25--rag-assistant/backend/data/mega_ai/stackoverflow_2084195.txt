You cannot set a minimum length for a VARCHAR field in MySQL. Despite jspcal's answer, there is no such min length constraint. The max is simply VARCHAR(max) Yes, you must use PHP to limit the length. Personally, I use application code to perform all my constraint validations, and only rely on the DB as a last resort/failsafe. It's better to detect invalid data in your application and return a useful error message, than to catch a DB exception and have to interpret/translate that into the appropriate error message.
