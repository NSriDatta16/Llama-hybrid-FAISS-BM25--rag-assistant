Magento catching exceptions and rolling back database transactions

I'm working on a Magento module and need to know if it's possible to roll back a series of model saves. Basically, I have five models plus several from my module that I need to save one after the other: admin/role admin/user core/website core/store_group core/store mymodule/model1 mymodule/model2 My problem is that whenever any of these models throw an exception, I need to go into MySQL and manually delete all the rows that were saved. This is very unproductive. I'm pretty sure that Magento doesn't have a rollback procedure that I can access in my context. For example, I looked in Mage_Core_Model_Abstract and in the save method, the rollback mechanisms are all protected. So, my question is, is there some best practice for doing database transactions in Magento that I should be aware of?
