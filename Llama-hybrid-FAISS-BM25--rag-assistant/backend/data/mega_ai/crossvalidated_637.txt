It sounds like you are trying to predict your boolean response, yes? This is called classification. Logistic Regression is the obvious choice here, but there are other methods too. You can't do traditional regression, because the response is not a real number. The lookup variables are called nominals, and can be dealt with in regression by using "dummy" variables. For example, if your lookup variable is type=[steel, aluminum, plastic] (N=3), then your dummy variables would look like this: IsSteel = [1,0] IsAlum = [1,0] There would only be two (N-1) dummy variables, as IsSteel=0 AND IsAlum=0 represents "IsPlastic"=1 But any good stats program should handle this. If you need a book, I recommend Multivariate Data Analysis by Hair.
