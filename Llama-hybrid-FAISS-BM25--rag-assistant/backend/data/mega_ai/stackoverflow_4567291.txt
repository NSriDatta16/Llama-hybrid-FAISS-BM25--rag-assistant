The file you thought you dragged to the desktop is not a -- or no longer a -- source file, plain and simple. You either dragged some other file to the desktop or your computer's filesystem is going bad and it trashed the file. Given that your system still boots, I'd assume the former before the latter. Unless you accidentally compressed the file or something, you will need to recover the file from your backup or from revision control. If you don't have those, then you'll probably have to start over on that source.
