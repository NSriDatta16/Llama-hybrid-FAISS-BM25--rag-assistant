Excluding endpoint integration tests from rake test and being able to isolate and run them with rake test:endpoints was solved with only a few lines of code. I have to admit though, I spent a whole lot of hours swearing and cursing. There should be more documentation and explanations in the railties source. Ruby code like that tend not to be very self-explanatory, IMO. Well, here it goes: create your task: lib/tasks/slow_tests.rake require 'rails/test_unit/railtie' desc "Runs all endpoint integration tests." namespace :test do #hooks on to the test task through the 'test:prepare' #For details, check the railties gem (v3.0+) lib/rails/test_unit/testing.rake, #look for "task :test" and "namespace :test" TestTaskWithoutDescription.new(:endpoints => 'test:prepare') do |t| t.libs Now I may put my fragile endpoint integration tests in the test/enpoints directory, running them whenever I want (not often) Note: this supposes test/unit or shoulda.
