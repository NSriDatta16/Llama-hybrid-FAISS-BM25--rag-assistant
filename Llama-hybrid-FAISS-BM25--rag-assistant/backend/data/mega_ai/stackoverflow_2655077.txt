You'll need to reverse-engineer what the Javascript is doing. Does it fire off an AJAX request to populate the ? If so, it should be pretty easy to sniff the request using Firebug and then duplicate it with LWP::UserAgent or WWW::Mechanize to get the information. If the Javascript is just doing pure DOM manipulation, then that means the data must exist somewhere else in the page or the Javascript already. So figure out where it's coming from and grab it. Finally, if none of those options are adequate, you may need to just use a real browser to do it. There are a few options for automating browser behavior, like WWW::Mechanize::Firefox or Win32::IE::Mechanize .
