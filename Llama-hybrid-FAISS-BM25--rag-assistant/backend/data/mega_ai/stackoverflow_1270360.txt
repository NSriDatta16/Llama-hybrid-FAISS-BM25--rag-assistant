The canonical site is regular-expressions.info . It contains a great in-depth tutorial, lots of real-world regex examples, and a comprehensive reference for the difference between regex flavors. Also, Jan Goyvaerts' and Steven Levithan's new book " Regular Expressions Cookbook " is highly recommended. I personally have derived most of my regex knowledge from using RegexBuddy which is a great interactive tool for constructing, analyzing, debugging, and using regexes. I even switched editors from UltraEdit to EditPadPro because of its awesome regex features. Sorry if I'm coming across as a Jan Goyvaerts fanboy, but Jeff Atwood would probably agree .
