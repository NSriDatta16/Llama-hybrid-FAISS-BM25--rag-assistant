C++ - Alphabetizing Strings - '<' Operator Overload

For starters this is homework, I have a good understanding of what i'm supposed to do but I am obviously missing something. I currently have an abstract base class called "Person". And I have 3 classes that inherit person they are Staff, Faculty, and Student. I am trying to organize all the "Person's" names by last name. So I must overload the ' I have the function written but I just don't know where to put it. Function: bool operator = right.getLastName() == 0 ) return true; return false; } Should I put this in the header file for all my derived classes, or should I put it as a virtual function in the base class Person? Or should I do Both. Currently I am doing both and I'm getting an error for every file. error: error C2662: 'Person::getLastName' : cannot convert 'this' pointer from Update: I have changed my function to: bool operator = right.getLastName(); } After getting advice from other people, I have only placed this function in "Person" and made it not virtual. Yet I am still getting 5 of the same exact errors that all point to this function. Error: 'Person::getLastName' : cannot convert 'this' pointer from 'const Person' to 'Person &' If it helps anyone at all here is the code to my "Person.h": class Person { private: string FirstName, LastName, MiddleName, SSN; string FullName; public: Person(); Person(string, string, string, string); Person(string); string getFirstName(); string getLastName(); string getMiddleName(); string getSSN(); string getFullName(); void setFirstName(string); void setLastName(string); void setMiddleName(string); void setSSN(string); void setFullName(string); virtual string getIdentity() { return FirstName + " " + MiddleName + " " + LastName + " " + SSN; } bool operator = right.getLastName(); } virtual string getPurpose() = 0; };
