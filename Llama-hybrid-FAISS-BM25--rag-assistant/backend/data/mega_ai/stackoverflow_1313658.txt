Instead of putting this code in your controller (which is where I'm guessing it is), you may want to consider using a validation instead, which I think would solve the problem: class AttentionSeeker :locale_id end Please note the "scope" option in the validation rule. Failing that you could try wrapping the query in a Transaction Failing that, and this seems incredibly janky you could add a cachebuster to the query itself. Something like buster = rand(Time.now) attention_seeker = AttentionSeeker.find(:first, :conditions => ["#{buster} = #{buster}"]) Which should give you a unique query every time through your loop.
