Convert MySQL result to int (C++)

I'm retriving a result from MySQL with from the variable row[2]. The data from this variable is int in the mysql table but I can't put this into an int variable in c++ because I get the error message average.cpp:40: error: invalid conversion from char* to int Line 40 is total += row[2]; What am I doing wrong:? Thanks
