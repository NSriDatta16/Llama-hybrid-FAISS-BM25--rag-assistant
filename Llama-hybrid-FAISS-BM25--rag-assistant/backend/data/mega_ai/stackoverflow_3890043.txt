Namespaces - How deep is too deep

We are currently reorganising some of our services projects so their naming is more logical. We have the following structure: Djp.Services. Type . ServiceName This seems to make sense as a logical grouping, however what I want to know is, is it acceptable to have further levels under this based on the folders in the project. For example one project is called Djp.Services.Management.Data Under this project we have a "POCO" folder and a "Repositories" folder, which means, in principal, objects under these folders will have a namespace 5 levels deep. Is this depth of namespace something that should avoided, or is it perfectly reasonable?
