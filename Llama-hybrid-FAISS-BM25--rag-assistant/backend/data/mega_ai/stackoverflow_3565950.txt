The standard method is "bayesian", where you compare the word frequencies in spam against the word frequencies in non-spam (aka "ham"). The problem with that is while people would be perfectly willing to forward you all their spam, they're unlikely to want to forward you their ham. One program that does this already is called "bogofilter". There is a standard Debian package for it.
