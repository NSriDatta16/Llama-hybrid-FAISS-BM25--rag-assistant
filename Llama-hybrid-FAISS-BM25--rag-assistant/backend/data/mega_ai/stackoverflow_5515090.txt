TSQL Rolling Average of Time Groupings

This is a follow up to: TSQL Group by N Seconds . (I got what I asked for, but didn't ask for the right thing) How can I get a rolling average of 1 second groups of count(*) ? So I want to return per second counts, but I also want to be able to smooth that out over certain intervals, say 10 seconds. So one method might be to take the average per second of every 10 seconds, can that be done in TSQL? Ideally, the time field would be returned in Unix Time.
