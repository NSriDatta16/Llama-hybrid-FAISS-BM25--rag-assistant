Books - Deep learning and recurrent neural networks

I have read with interest the Elements of Statistical Learning and Murphy's Machine Learning - a Probabilistic Perspective. The latter touches upon deep learning and deep / recurrent neural networks in the last chapter, but I was wondering if new books / sources have come out that go into more depth on these topics?
