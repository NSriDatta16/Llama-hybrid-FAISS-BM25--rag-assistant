Joint entropy for estimating conditional mutual sorting information

I'm going through this paper , and their notation is confusing me a little bit. In section III (Coupling Measures), they consider two time series $x_t$ and $y_t$ , as well as their corresponding so-called permutation series $\pi_t^{\vartheta_x}$ and $\pi_t^{\vartheta_y}$ ; if I understand correctly, the latter are a synonym for an ordinal pattern sequence. My first confusion is with respect to their mutual sorting information: $$ I_{xy}^{\text{MSI}} (\tau) = H_x + H_y - H_{xy} $$ where, and I quote, "the joint entropy $H_{xy}$ is obtained from the joint probabilities $p_{ij}$ for $(\pi_t^{\vartheta_x}, \pi_{t+\tau}^{\vartheta_y}) = (\pi_{i \cdot}, \pi_{\cdot j})$ ". The index $t + \tau$ means that the permutation series is "lagged"? If yes, is this "common" for joint entropies? Seems kind of random. Afterwards, they define the conditional version: $$\begin{align} I_{xy|z}^{\text{CMSI}} (\tau) &= H_{xz} + H_{yz} - H_{z} - H_{xyz} \\ z &= (\pi_{t}^{\vartheta_{z_x}}, \pi_{t+\tau}^{\vartheta_{z_y}}) \\ H_{xyz} &= p_{ijk} \; \text{for} \; [\pi_{t}^{\vartheta_x}, \pi_{t+\tau}^{\vartheta_y}, z] \end{align}$$ Should I understand that all these joint entropies are calculated with the aforementioned lag?
