Cobertura Coverage Report Image

Does anybody know where Cobertura sticks it's coverage report image? The url to my image is: http://ContinualTests/746/cobertura/graph When I dig down on my box that is running tomcat/hudson I find tomcat6/.hudson/jobs/XX/builds/746 but I don't see the graph. Is the image getting generate on the fly? Seems like something that would be generated once and reused. Erik
