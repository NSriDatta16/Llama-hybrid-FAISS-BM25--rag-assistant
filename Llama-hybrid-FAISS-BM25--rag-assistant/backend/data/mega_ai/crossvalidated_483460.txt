I have never been happy with one hot encoding. See: https://roamanalytics.com/2016/10/28/are-categorical-variables-getting-lost-in-your-random-forests/ Recently, I have tried CatBoost ( http://CatBoost.ai ), Open Source from Yandex. CatBoost uses Categorical variables directly. (XGBoost uses one-hot-encoding under the covers.) It seems to score better and faster than H2O's XGBoost, but training seems to take longer. You might want to give it a try.
