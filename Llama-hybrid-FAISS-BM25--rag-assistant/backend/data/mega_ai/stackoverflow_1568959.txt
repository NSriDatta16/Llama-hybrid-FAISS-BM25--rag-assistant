Maven - Include Different Files at Build Time

I have ten WAR files, all of which have nearly identical code and markup. The only differences lie in the images, CSS and Messages. I hit on the concept of Profiles but I haven't quite groked it yet and I'm not sure if this can handle what I need it to do. Basically, I want a base project with different profiles for the 10 different WARs. Whenever a build is started with a given profile, it goes to a repository (either local or my organization's) and retrieves the CSS, images and messages files and places them in the correct spot before finishing out the process. I can't imagine this is much different than going out and retrieving a JAR file and putting it in WEB-INF lib. I'm sure this isn't TOO far out in left field and I want to stick to Maven's sweet spot as much as possible. Any help would be appreciated!
