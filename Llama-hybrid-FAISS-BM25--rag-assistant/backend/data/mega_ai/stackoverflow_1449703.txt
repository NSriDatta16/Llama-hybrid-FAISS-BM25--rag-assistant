how to append a list object to another

in C++, I have two list objects A and B and I want to add all the members of B to the end of A . I've searched a few different sources and haven't found a simple solution (e.i. A.append(B); ) and this surprises me a bit. What is the best way to do this? As it happens, I don't care about B after this (it gets deleted in the very next line) so if there is a way to leverage that for better perf I'm also interested in that.
