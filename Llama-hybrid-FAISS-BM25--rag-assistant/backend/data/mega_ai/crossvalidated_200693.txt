Having a very small $ \det(R) $ only means that you have some variables that are almost linearly dependent. Note that $\det(R)$ equals the product of the eigenvalues of $R$; so there is at least one eigenvalue that is approximately zero. This only means that you have some extra/redundant dimensions in your dataset and that PCA will actually be able to represent 100% of the information with a smaller ($p_\text{new} \le p - 1$) set of dimensions.
