For anyone who happens to come across this same problem... I didn't find a direct answer to how to put both the [t] and [fragile] tags on a frame. However, I did find a way to apply the [t] tag to the entire document, which is actually a better solution to the problem in my case. To do this, replace the first line of the document: \documentclass{beamer} With this: \documentclass[t]{beamer} If anyone does know how to use two tags on a frame like I was asking though, I would still appreciate an answer.
