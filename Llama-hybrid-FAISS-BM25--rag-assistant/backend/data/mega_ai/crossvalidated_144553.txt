The uniform PDF is as you say: $$ p(\theta) = \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 / (b-a) \quad &\text{if } a Bayesian methods (MCMC) are usually only concerned with the posterior distributions up to a constant of proportionality, that is: $$ p(\theta | D) \propto p(\theta) p(D | \theta) $$ for some observed data $D$. Thus you only really need the prior distribution up to a constant of proportionality too, which is why you can use: $$ p(\theta) \propto \left \{ \begin{array}{ll} 1 \quad &\text{if } a In which sense the prior on $\theta$ only provides upper ($b$) and lower ($a$) bounds on allowable value of $\theta$. In computing terms, the proportional form is faster.
