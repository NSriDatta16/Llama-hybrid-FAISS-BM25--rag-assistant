Is this possible with Magento?

I want to create a private store (disable frontend user registration and guest checkout, only enable the option for the admin to add new users). I want to give the registered user the possibility to purchase items without paying at the checkout. I don't want to add products with the price set to 0.00, because at the end of the month I want to send them the invoice covering all the purchases for that month (and for that, I want the products to have the price). It this possible with Magento? Please let me know, thanks.
