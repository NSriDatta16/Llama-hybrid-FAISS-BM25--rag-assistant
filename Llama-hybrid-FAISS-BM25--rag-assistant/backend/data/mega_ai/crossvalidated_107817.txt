Subjectivity in Frequentist Statistics

I often hear the claim that Bayesian statistics can be highly subjective. The main argument being that inference depends on the choice of a prior (even though one could use the principle of indifference o maximum entropy to choose a prior). In comparison, the claim goes, frequentist statistics is in general more objective. How much truth is there in this statement? Also, this makes me wonder: What are concrete elements of frequentist statistics (if any) that can be particularly subjective and that are not present or are less important in Bayesian statistics? Is subjectivity more prevalent in Bayesian than in frequentist statistics?
