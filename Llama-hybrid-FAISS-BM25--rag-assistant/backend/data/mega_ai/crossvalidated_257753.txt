Cointegration in Time-Series

I want to run a time series regression where I regress stock returns on each other. Clearly, the time series for stocks are typically not stationary, however, the returns are (I also tested that). I was wondering whether it is necessary to test the time series for cointegration since - as far as I know - cointegration is only a problem when the time series are not stationary.
