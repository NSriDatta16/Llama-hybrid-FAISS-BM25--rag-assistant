NET Coverage tools require admin rights?

I'm trying to find a coverage tool i can use in a very restrictive dev environment, where nobody has admin rights. Which NET coverage tools require admin rights to run? What coverage tools do not have this requirement, or have a workarounds to run without admin rights? As far as i know, NCover needs admin rights to run, what about the other frameworks? (DotCover, Semantic Designs, Partcover, Visual Studio coverage) Please share your experience, it's not easy to find anything in the docs of various tools on this topic.
