Cook's distance : ${\displaystyle D_{i}={\frac {e_{i}^{2}}{s^{2}p}}\left[{\frac {h_{i}}{(1-h_{i})^{2}}}\right],}$ ($p$ is the column dimension of $X$) Leverage : $h_{i}$ The version of standardized residual used in the plot is: $\frac{e_i}{s\sqrt{1 - h_i}}$ (well, it also uses weights if they're present; I presume weights are a non-issue for you - i.e. all 1 - since you didn't mention them) Here's the piece of code in plot.lm that's computing the standardized residual: rsp ( r.w having previously been computed from the raw residual by multiplying by the square root of weight) Note therefore that if we call that standardized residual $r_i$ then $pD_i = r_i^2 h_i/(1-h_i)$. If you draw lines for $D=1$ and $D=0.5$, it's easy to see where they should go on a plot of $r$ vs $h$, by simple rearrangement of that formula.
