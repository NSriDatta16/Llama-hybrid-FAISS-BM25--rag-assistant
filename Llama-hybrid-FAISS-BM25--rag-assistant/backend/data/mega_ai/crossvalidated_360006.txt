You have a binary outcome ("experiences growth barrier" - yes/no), and a continuous predictor (firm size). You suspect a nonlinear relationship between the two. Your best bet is a standard logistic regression. In order to model potential nonlinearities, do not feed firm size into the logistic regression as-is. Rather, transform them using splines . In a comment, you write : marginal effects estimates cannot deliver anything else than a linear measure This is incorrect - just use splines. These work for logistic regression just as well as for "vanilla" OLS. I have used splines to model nonlinearities in logistic regression models (regressing the likelihood to develop PTSD on spline transformed traumatic event load, Kolassa et al., 2010, J Clin Psych , and the same for the likelihood for spontaneous remission, Kolassa et al., 2010, Psych Trauma ). I very much recommend Frank Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies on splines. Do not use discretization to model nonlinearities , since the discretization will introduce discontinuities that are typically spurious. (In your specific scenario, discontinuities may actually be valid for regulatory reasons; e.g., certain regulations on reporting or employee protection may only apply to firms of a certain size. If something like this is pertinent, add one or more Boolean indicator variables.)
