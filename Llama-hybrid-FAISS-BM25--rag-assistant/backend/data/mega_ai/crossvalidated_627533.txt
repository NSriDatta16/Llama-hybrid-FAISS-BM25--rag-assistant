Proving that the average number of arrival events as $\lambda t$ given the inter-arrival duration are i.i.d. Exp($\lambda$) random variables

I'm trying to prove a common result for the Poisson process but I'm stuck. Given $T_i$ are i.i.d. $Exp(\lambda)$ random variables (where $\lambda$ is the rate) that represent the duration of arrival events and $N(t) = \textrm{max} \{ n: \sum_{i=1}^{n}T_i \leq t \}$ is the number of said events within the interval $[0, t]$ , prove that the mean of $N(t)$ is $\lambda t$ . Intuitively it makes a lot of sense: if the average duration between the events is 2s, then in a 10 second duration then the average # of events would be 5. But I wanted to see it mathematically. My strategy was to use the exponentially distributed durations to get a mathematical expression that I can say resembles a Poisson with mean of $\lambda t$ . I ended going down the path using the fact that $Y_k = T_1 + T_2 + \ldots T_k \sim Gamma(k,\lambda)$ and getting a product of Gamma CDFs: \begin{align} P(N(t) = k) &= P(Y_k \leq t, Y_{k+1} > t) \newline &= P(Y_k \leq t) (1 - P(Y_{k+1} which looks kind of close but I couldn't get further.
