OK, there are a couple of problems here. First, dataPtr is never initialized, so *dataPtr points to a random place in memory and you're setting it to an arbritary integer value. This invokes undefined behaviour (so nasal demons are a possibility). Second, you need to allocate new storage each time through the loop, otherwise you will end up with ten references to the last number you read.
