How can I add the constraint that regression parameters are orthogonal to a design matrix in an MCMC algorithm?

Suppose I have a linear regression like $$y_i=X\boldsymbol{\beta} + \alpha_i + \epsilon_i,$$ where $\epsilon_i\sim N(0,\sigma^2)$ are i.i.d. Further, suppose that I want to add the constraint that $\alpha_i$ is orthogonal to $X$ . How can I implement this constraint in an MCMC algorithm?
