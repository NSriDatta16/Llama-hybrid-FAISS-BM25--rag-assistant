Drupal 6 parse incoming POST data

I have an Excel file that I need to send data from to my Drupal MySql database. To do that, I am using an HTTP POST from within the VBA of my Excel sheet as follows: Set objHTTP = CreateObject("MSXML2.ServerXMLHTTP") URL = "http://localhost:8082/acquia-drupal/node/2" objHTTP.Open "POST", URL, False objHTTP.setRequestHeader "User-Agent", "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.0)" objHTTP.send ("string=testdata") I want to use a Drupal page that will parse out the POST data and write it to a table in the Drupal MySql database. Here is what I have started with, Is this the right direction to go in? Also, could someone provide some code snippet guidance on parsing out the POST data correctly?
