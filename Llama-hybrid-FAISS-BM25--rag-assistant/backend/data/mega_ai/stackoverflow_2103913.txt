Your first approach to remove the sdtRun and adding a new one will obviously remove the formatting because you are only adding a Run but not the RunStyle. To preserve the formatting you should create run elements like new Run( new RunProperties(new RunStyle(){ Val = "MyStyle" }), new Text("Replacement Text")); Your second approach to replace all Decendants will work for Plain Text Content Control only because a Rich Text Content Control does not have SdtRun element. Rich Text Content Control is SdtBlock with SdtContent elements. A rich text content control can have multiple paragraphs, multiple Runs and multiple Texts. So your code, sdtRun.Descendants ().First().Text = replacementText , will be flawed for a Rich Text Content Control. There is no one line code to replace the entire text of a rich content control and yet preserve all the formatting. I did not understand what you mean by "it doesn't get rid of the content control in the final document"? I thought your requirement here is to change the text (content) only by preserving the content control and the formatting.
