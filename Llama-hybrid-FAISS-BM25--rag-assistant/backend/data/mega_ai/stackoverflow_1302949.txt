What percentage of browsers have Google's cached version of JQuery already loaded?

What percentage of browsers would probably have Google's cached version of JQuery already loaded? I am asking this to figure out how fast my page would load on an "average" browser. My page needs both JQuery and JQuery UI. I believe most browsers would probably have JQuery already cached from Google's servers. Is this true? And what are the numbers for JQuery UI? Any proof of your claim would be helpful. Also, for Jquery UI: What components does Google's Jquery UI have? Does it have all of them or just a few (sortable, etc...)? Also, I think it's about 180 kb. Should I use that or should I create a custom.ui.min at jqueryui.com that might be smaller?
