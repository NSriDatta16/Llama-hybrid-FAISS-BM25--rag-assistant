Confused about home screen widget size in normal screen and larget screen

I am designing a home screen widget. The widget layout file is like below. I ran this widget on a HTC Hero device, which has a screen of 320 pixels * 480 pixels with mdpi. It ran perfect on HTC Hero. The widget takes 3 cells * 2 cells space, i.e. 240 pixels * 200 pixels. Then I ran this widget on a Nexus One device, which has a screen of 480 pixels * 800 pixels, mdpi. Since Nexus One also is mdpi, so I though 240dip is equivalent to 240 pixels on Nexus One and 200dip is equivalent to 200 pixels on Nexus One, so the widget will not take 3 cells * 2 cells space on Nexus One device. To my surprise, when running on Nexus One device, the widget take exact 3 cells * 2 cells, about 360 pixels * 300 pixels, on Nexus One device. I am confused. The layout xml above specifies 240dip in width and 200dip in height for the widget, but why did it take 360 pixels * 300 pixels on Nexus One Device? What am I missing? Thanks. In reply to mbaird's comment: I am still confused. Suppose I specify a ImageView, picture1, with 90dip * 100dip as below in the widget. What dimension in device pixels will the ImageView on the Nexus One device? I have to know this, because in my program I have to draw on the ImageView: public void draw(Canvas canvas) { ShapeDrawable drawable = new ShapeDrawable(new RectShape()); drawable.getPaint().setColor(Color.WHITE); drawable.setBounds(m_leftTopX, m_leftTopY, m_leftTopX + m_width, m_leftTopY + m_height); drawable.draw(canvas); } As I understant, drawable.setBounds() is using physical pixels in its parameters. I need to know the size of the ImageView in dimension of physical pixels. Thanks.
