Drupal image upload issues

When uploading images in Drupal I have continuously encounter an issue with the physical size of the image - not the size of the file. Let me explain further. An image could be a small file size (under the restrictions) but be larger than average on the screen. These images fail to upload in Drupal across all sites that I have built using the CMS. Has this happened for anyone else? Any ideas how I could get around this?
