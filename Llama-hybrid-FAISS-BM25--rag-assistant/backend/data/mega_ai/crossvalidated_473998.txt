Asymptotic theory tells us that the variance (or uncertainty) around a coefficient estimate from a regression decreases as the sample grows, therefore, what the theory tells us is that running a regression on the full sample as opposed to smaller bootstrapped samples would give a coefficient estimate with less noise than individual bootstrapped coefficients. Now, you are saying that averaging over a lot of bootstrapped coefficients would give a less noisy estimate than by running one regression, however an average over the coefficients is in theory an expected value, and so the gauss markov theorem would tell us that the average over a very large number of the bootstrapped samples is in theory the same as the estimate from one regression.
