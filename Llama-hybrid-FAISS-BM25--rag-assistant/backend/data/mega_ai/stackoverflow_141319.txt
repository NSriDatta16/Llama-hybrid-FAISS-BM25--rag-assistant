What's the difference between Phing and PHPUnderControl?

We currently use a hand-rolled setup and configuration script and a hand-rolled continuous integration script to build and deploy our application. I am looking at formalizing this somewhat with a third party system designed for these purposes. I have looked into Phing before, and I get that it's basically like Ant. But, my Ant experience is somewhat limited so that doesn't help me much. (Most of the Java work I have done was just deployed as a jar file). I have looked into Cruise Control before, and I understand that phpUnderControl is a plug-in for CC. But, Phing says it also works with CC. So I am not clear on the overlap here. Do I need both Phing and phpUnderControl to work with CruiseControl, or are they mutually exlclusive? What I need exactly is something that can: Check out source from SVN Install the database from SQL file Generate some local configuration files from a series of templates and an ini file Run all of our unit tests (currently ST, but easy to convert to PHPUnit) and send an email to the dev team if any tests break (with a stack trace of course) Generate API documentation for the application and put it somewhere Run a test coverage report Now, we have just about all of this in one form or another. But, it'd be nice to have it all automated and bundled together in one process.
