You need to go into iTunes connect and go into the Manage Applications sections. From there you should select your currently live App to view it's details, and then hit the "Add new version" button. You should then fill out the necessary meta data. At this point you can change the apps name as it appears in the app store or change its keywords, screenshots etc. Then once that is done and submitted, you should click the ready to upload binary button near the top right of the page. You'll be asked the usual questions about adding or modifying encryption and a new question regarding iCloud and legal issues. Answer according to your particular situation and carry on. Your app should now be in the "waiting for upload" state. Once your update is in this state, you can use Application Loader or Xcode's Organiser to upload the binary for the update. Xcode and application loader now perform some standard checks on your app to ensure it conforms to the guidelines. Once this is done you're app should transition to the "waiting for review" stage and that's all you need to do.
