High Collinearity Problem about XGBoost

From my understanding of XGBoost, if two features have high collinearity, it will choose only one as a more important feature, while the importance of another feature will be very low. However, from my recent practice, it didn't show this. For example, from the figure below, PD and ED should have extremely high collinearity. However, the importance of ED is still very high from the importance graph. Still, when we look at the dependence plot, it shows a horizontal line for ED. Does it mean that the high collinearity problem is still not an issue in this model?
