Is it okay to use relative error on a set of measurements rather than an absolute error?

As far as I've learned, if you have a set of measurements and the differences between the average of those measurements and the individual measurements aren't always smaller than the absolute error of your individual measurements, you have non-reproducible errors and need to apply statistics to find a standard deviation etc. I was wondering whether it would be okay to pick a certain constant relative error that applies to all your measurements rather than an absolute one. Here's an example: I have a bunch of time measurements and the same absolute error for each of them. If the time is short (3-9 seconds) the results are considered reproducible by my above definition. If the time is longer than that, the results vary too much and become non-reproducible. Instead of using the aforementioned absolute error I could pick a relative error that works for all results so that I can process all the results in the same way. I'm applying this to 3 measurements of upwards and downwards velocity of oildrops in a magnetic field (Millikan) for 20 different drops. Out of these times I'll determine the velocity and eventually the charge and size of the particles. The final result I want to get is the elementary charge of an electron.
