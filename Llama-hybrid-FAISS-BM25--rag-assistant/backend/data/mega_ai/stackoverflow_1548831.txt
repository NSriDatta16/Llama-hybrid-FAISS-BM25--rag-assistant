Maven Plugins - how to require a license

I would like to make my plugin require a license to run similar to the maven clover plugin. Is there some utility out there that I can generate licenses with that will also allow me to integrate that into the plugin? I need to do the following steps. Modify the existing plugin to validate the license file Generate the license file online and store the information for retrieval later. Thanks, Walter
