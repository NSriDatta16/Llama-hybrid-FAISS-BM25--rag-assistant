When you use off-line, (most likely mobile), most of the time you'll need an optimized build as well. You don't really want to offline a few dozen files. I don't think XHR works offline, so any resource you load via XHR (that includes scripts, i18n bundles and other dynamically-loaded resources that are triggered via href) you should store into localStorage, and then branch off to load from loaclStorage instead of XHR when offline. Now, you really need to be making an optimized build if you are running on the iPhone, iPad or an Android device. Also consider using the Closure Compiler to further optimize your build. See link below. http://dojo-toolkit.33424.n3.nabble.com/file/n2636749/Using_the_Dojo_Toolkit_with_the_Closure_Compiler.pdf?by-user=t
