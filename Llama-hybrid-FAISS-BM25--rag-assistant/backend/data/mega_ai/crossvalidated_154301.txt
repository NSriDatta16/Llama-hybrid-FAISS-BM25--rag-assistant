Simulating non-normal correlated data for Bayesian regression

I'm interested in generating data for three separate datasets where each contains three IVs and a single DV that are correlated with one another based on meta-analytic data. For example, I would like the correlation matrix between the variables to look as follows based on the meta-analytic data: IV1 IV2 IV3 DV IV1 1 IV2 0.31 1 IV3 0.14 0.21 1 DV 0.03 0.18 0.18 1 Another nuanced bit to the simulated data is that I would like those relationships to hold across the datasets, but I want to manipulate the distribution of the dependent variable. In the first dataset, the distribution of the DV would be normal, the second dataset the DV would have a moderate, positive skew, and the third dataset the DV would follow a power-law distribution. I haven't simulated data before so I am very naive to the process, so any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!
