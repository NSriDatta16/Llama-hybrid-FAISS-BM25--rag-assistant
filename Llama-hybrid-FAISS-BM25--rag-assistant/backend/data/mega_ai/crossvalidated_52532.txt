There are at least a couple options with "check all that apply" data. First, you could analyze each body part as a separate dependent (in this case) possibly logistic regression (injured that part vs. did not) or possibly some form of count regression (number of times that part was injured). I suspect a zero-inflated negative binomial regression would be best here. The equipment would be the independent variable. Second you could analyze combinations of body parts as the dependent variable. This would depend on having a large enough N to make various combinations common enough to analyze, and it would require some judgement in picking combinations. You don't say how many body parts you list, but it looks like it would be at least 10. That makes for a LOT of potential combinations. You might wind up with things like "Head and something else" but you'd have to be careful to make the categories exhaustive and exclusive.
