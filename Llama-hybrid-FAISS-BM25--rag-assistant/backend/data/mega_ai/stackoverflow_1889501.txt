for each ... break

I feel dirty every time I "break" out of a for-each construct (PHP/Javascript) So something like this: // Javascript example for (object in objectList) { if (object.test == true) { //do some process on object break; } } For large objectLists I would go through the hassle building a more elegant solution. But for small lists there is no noticeable performance issue and hence "why not?" It's quick and more importantly easy to understand and follow. But it just "feels wrong". Kind of like a goto statement. How do you handle this kind of situation?
