Added a table to a dbml, but it doesn't show up in code

I am using VS2010 with C#, and linq-to-sql. Does anyone have any ideas of where to start looking for a solution? My database has a 'Cats' table and there is a 'Feet' and 'EyeColour' table that are both linked to it with a one-to-one relationship. The 'Feet' table works fine with linq-to-sql, but 'EyeColour' does not. I dragged the EyeColour table from the database explorer. It has a one-to-one relationship with another item (Cats) in the database. All properties match 'Feet'. doing Cat.Feet works, but doing Cat.EyeColour does not, it doesn't appear in the intellisense and gives me a cannot find it error, but both tables are there and the links/relationships are identical. I tried deleting the designer.cs file so it regenerated, but still nothing. Tried closing/opening VS as well. Any clues as to what might cause this?
