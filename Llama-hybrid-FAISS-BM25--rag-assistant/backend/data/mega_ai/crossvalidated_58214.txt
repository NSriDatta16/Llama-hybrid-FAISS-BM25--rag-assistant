When does Naive Bayes perform better than SVM?

In a small text classification problem I was looking at, Naive Bayes has been exhibiting a performance similar to or greater than an SVM and I was very confused. I was wondering what factors decide the triumph of one algorithm over the other. Are there situations where there is no point in using Naive Bayes over SVMs? Can someone shed light on this?
