The problem with your data is not that it is extremely detailed: you have no values at weekends, that's why it is plotted with gaps. There are two ways to deal with it: Either try to guess approximate values in weekends with some smoothing methods ( smooth.spline , loess , etc.). Code of simple interpolation is below. But in this case you will introduce something "unnatural" and artificial to the data. That's why I prefer second option. currentDate 0) { currentDate You can go from daily basis to a weekly basis, just averaging (for example) five sequential points that belog to one week (in this case you are "killing" some information). Just a quick example of how to do that would be openValues = c(mean(oracle$Open[1:5])); dates = c(as.Date(oracle$Date[1])); for (i in seq(6,5045,5)) { openValues = c(openValues, mean(oracle$Open[i:i+5])); dates = c(dates, as.Date(oracle$Date[i])); } plot(dates, openValues, type="l") Hope it will help.
