Excel and Data Science - sounds really strange to me. Maybe Excel and 'Data Analysis'. Anyways, I think a good compromise between Excel and R is: KNIME ( http://www.knime.org/knime-analytics-platform ). It's free on the desktop and much easier to get started. You can import / export to Excel but also use R, Python or Java if the ~ 1.000 nodes miss some functionality that you need. Since the workflows are visually created, it's also much easier to show them to someone who doesn't know any programming languages - which is quite an advantage in some companies.
