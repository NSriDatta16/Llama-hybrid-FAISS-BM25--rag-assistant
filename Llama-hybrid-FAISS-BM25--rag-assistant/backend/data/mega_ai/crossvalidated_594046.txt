To build up on the great answer from @Gavin Simpson, one can check the BLAS/LAPACK version in R through sessionInfo() . If there are multiple versions on the cluster, you can choose one of them by using LD_PRELOAD trick via the bash script: export LD_PRELOAD=/usr/lib64/libopenblasp-r0.3.15.so Dr. Simon Wood provided further insights on how BLAS version might affect the mgcv output: "Different BLAS optimizations order computations differently. The computations are mathematically equivalent, of course, but different ordering leads to slightly different rounding errors in floating point arithmetic. Occasionally such a tiny difference can get amplified to a noticeable effect if the model is not statistically very stable. Logistic regression in regions where the response are all zeroes or all ones is an example. Another thing that can happen is that just occasionally a tiny difference leads to the optimizer meeting the convergence criterion a step earlier on one BLAS version than another, and this actually making a difference - that one can be spotted by looking at how many optimization steps have been taken, and is usually fixed by tightening convergence tolerances. Of course it is also sometimes possible that the REML criterion used for smoothing parameter selection has developed more than one optimum, and different actual optima have been located."
