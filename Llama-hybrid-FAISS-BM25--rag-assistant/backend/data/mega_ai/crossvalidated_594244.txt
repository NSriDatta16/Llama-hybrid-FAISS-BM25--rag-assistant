Determining weakness of Instrumental Variables

The problem is about doing a regression on the impacts of money supply growth and output (GDP) growth on inflat ion rate growth: $$ \mathrm{inflation} = \beta_1 + \beta_2\mathrm{money} + \beta_3\mathrm{output} + u $$ The variable output is known to be endogenous . The variable money is exogenous . There are four instrumental variables: initial level of GDP, school population education level measurement, inv average investment portion of GDP, poprate average population growth rate. I used r to create a regression like so: # Full tsls regression ivreg = ivreg( inflat ~ money + output | money + initial + school + inv + poprate, data=brumm) # First stage of two-stage-TSLS-regression # Regressing endogenous X on the instrument variables and exogenous variables reg = lm_robust(output ~ money + initial + inv + school + poprate, data = brumm, se_type = "stata") reg1 = lm_robust(output ~ money + initial, data = brumm, se_type = "stata") reg2 = lm_robust(output ~ money + inv, data = brumm, se_type = "stata") reg3 = lm_robust(output ~ money + school, data = brumm, se_type = "stata") reg4 = lm_robust(output ~ money + poprate, data = brumm, se_type = "stata") # Check for weakness linearHypothesis(reg, c("inv=0", "school=0", "poprate=0", "initial=0"), test=c("F")) linearHypothesis(reg1, c("initial=0"), test=c("F")) linearHypothesis(reg2, c("inv=0"), test=c("F")) linearHypothesis(reg3, c("school=0"), test=c("F")) linearHypothesis(reg4, c("poprate=0"), test=c("F")) The first linear hypothesis I do is all of the instrumental variables being 0, which results in F value
