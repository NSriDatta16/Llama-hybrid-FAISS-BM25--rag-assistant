SQL Server, where field is int?

how can I accomplish: select * from table where column_value is int I know I can probably inner join to the system tables and type tables but I'm wondering if there's a more elegant way. Note that column_value is a varchar that "could" have an int, but not necessarily. Maybe I can just cast it and trap the error? But again, that seems like a hack.
