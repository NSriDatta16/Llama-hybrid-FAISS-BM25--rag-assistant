Drawing a caret between a point and a draggable div

I have a draggable div that represents a little info popup that the user can drag around the screen. But this div is anchored to a point on the screen, and I would like there to be a caret drawn between the div and the point that it is anchored to. An example of this can be found on Google maps, when you hover over a store or point of interest that you've searched for. You'll see a caret drawn between the point and the popup. This is simple enough, but their popup is not draggable while mine is. So what is the best way to implement this? I'm thinking of using a series of caret images that are resized depending on the orientation of the popup relative to the anchor point. It'll get tricky in that I'll have to use a different type of caret depending on the angle at which the popup is placed relative to the anchor. Is there a better way to do this? Thanks!
