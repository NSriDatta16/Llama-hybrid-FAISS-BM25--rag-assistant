Question about calculating confidence intervals

I am reading about confidence intervals and got stuck with this example from L. Wasserman's book titled "All of Statistics". Could anybody explain why P Q (θ ∈ C) = 3/4 in this example? Below is the paragraph from the book: Let θ be a fixed, known real number and let X 1 , X 2 be independent random variables such that P(X i = 1) = P(X i = -1) = 1/2. Now define Y i = θ + X i and suppose that you only observe Y 1 and Y 2 . Define the following interval that actually contains only one point: You can check that, no matter what θ is, we have P θ (θ ∈ C) = 3/4 so this is a 75 percent confidence interval. Suppose we now do the experiment and we get Y 1 = 15 and Y 2 = 17. Then our 75 percent confidence interval is {16}. However, we are certain that θ = 16. If you wanted to make a probability statement about θ you would probably say that P(θ ∈ C|Y 1 , Y 2 ) = 1. There is nothing wrong with saying that {16} is a 75 percent confidence interval. But is it not a probability statement about θ.
