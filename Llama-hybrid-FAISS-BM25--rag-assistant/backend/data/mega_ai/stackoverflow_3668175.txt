DragonFireSDK and iPhone development on Windows

So in previous questions about iPhone development on Windows, the basic/easy answer has been "just get a mac." However, I noticed a comment that mentioned DragonFireSDK. But no one else said anything about it? Has anyone tried this? It look pretty legit to me, but I'm new to the iPhone world. I just find it weird that no one has discussed this yet. I mean, it looks like the perfect tools for the Windows users. Thanks! Oh yeah....here's the link to DragonFireSDK: DragonFireSDK EDIT: This app is for my website, We, the Pixels . Any comments on if Dragonfire would be a good fit for an iPhone version of my website? Thanks!
