parsed xml file: skip creation if blank?

This could be a HappyMapper specific question, but I don't think so. In my app, users can upload their blog subscriptions (via an OPML file), which I parse and add to their profile. The only problem is during the parsing, or more specifically the creation of each subscription, I can't figure out how to skip over entries that are just "labels". Since OPML files allow you to label your blogs, or organize them into folders, this is my problem. The actual blog subscriptions and their labels both have "outline" tags. After parsing, I create each feed via a method call inside of the HappyMapper module def create_feed Feed.new( :feed_htmlUrl => self.htmlUrl, :feed_title => self.title, ... But how do I prevent it from creating new "feeds" for those outline tags that are just tags? (i.e. those that don't have an htmlUrl?)
