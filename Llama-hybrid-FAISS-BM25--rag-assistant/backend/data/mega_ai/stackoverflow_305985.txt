Multiple back ends for Entity Framework

Can I use two different back ends for an .net Entity Framework project? I need to support the full programmability support of stored procedures on SQL server when available. I need to support only table structures in a .mdb file when SQL server is not available. All business logic above the Entity Framework uses the entity abstratctions rather than going directly to the database. The entity model can use either stored procedure calls or dynamic sql to read/write to the database tables. Is it possible to create two logically identical entity models, each with different mappings to the database (one managed by the framework, one managed by stored procedures), and switch between them at runtime based on the functionality provided by the back-end storage mechanism?
