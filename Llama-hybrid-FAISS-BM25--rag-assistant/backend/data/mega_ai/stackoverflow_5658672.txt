What does using a project that has the "reciprocal public license 1.5" mean I have to do with my code?

So I found an open source project that uses the reciprocal public license 1.5 (RPL). It seems that the RPL means that you must post all of your code back out to the community. RPL 1.5 - Paragraph 5 Further, under the RPL all components you author including schemas, scripts, source code, etc. -- regardless of whether they're compiled into a single binary or used as two halves of client/server application -- must be shared. You have to share the whole pie, not an isolated slice of it. I work for a health care company that is not going to be ok with me posting our proprietary code out on the internet. So I am wondering, is that really what the RPL does? Is there limitations on what needs to be published? Or is it really just any thing that touches the RPLed project must also go open source under the RPL?
