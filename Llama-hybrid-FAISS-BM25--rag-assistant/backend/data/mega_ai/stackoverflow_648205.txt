This is the list of Windows Images. I couldn't find one with what you are asking, so you need to start from an existing one (better to start with one that has IIS already installed) and then install PHP and MySQL yourself. Then you could save this as your base image and use it for all your subsequent deployments. However, the infrastructure you are describing doesn't fit well with a Cloud environment. At first, MySQL or any other relational database isn't a suitable persistence mechanism. It is not guaranteed that your instance will not go away, and if that does happen, then all data stored in the local file system will be lost. You can only safely use MySQL by employing Elastic Block Storage. This is another consideration for you. For the same reason, it is not recommended to use a simple image to serve files. Amazon offers S3 service, which is great on this respect. As a conclusion, deploying in a Cloud environment is different than deploying in dedicated servers. You need a different architecture, not just to reproduce your installations.
