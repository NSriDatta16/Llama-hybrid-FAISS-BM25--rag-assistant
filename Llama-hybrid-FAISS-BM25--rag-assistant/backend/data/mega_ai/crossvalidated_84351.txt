Here is more of a visual explanation. (For those of us that are math challenged.). Take a cauchy distributed random number generator and try averaging the resulting values. Here is a good page on a function for this. https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/484395/how-to-generate-a-cauchy-random-variable You will find that the "spikiness" of the random values cause it to get larger as you go instead of smaller. Hence it has no mean.
