You want to keep clean separation of concerns - so no data access in the business logic, etc. Typically I'd define that boundary using an interface, and you can't have any data access specific stuff in here either (otherwise you're dragging those dependencies into anything that deals with the interface. Within a data access implelentation you can do what you want, at this point it'd be a straight shoot-out between your favorite database access technologies; and I'd imagine there's no shortage of comparions out there online (sorry I don't have that in my head to give you). I haven't used LinQ2Sql myself, but I know a few people who love it; the phrase "Lin2SQL F##king ROCKS man" comes to mind (from one of my more vocal friends).
