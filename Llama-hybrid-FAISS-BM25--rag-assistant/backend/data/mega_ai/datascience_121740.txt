Your instinct is right, you will probably need to use a fixed effects model to examine the relationship between personality traits and feedback outcomes, and a multilevel model to examine the moderating effect of virtual working on extraversion. For the fixed effects model, you can use logistic regression to predict whether someone will give feedback at work and ordinal regression to predict the type of feedback they will provide (positive or negative). You can include the five personality traits as predictors in the model. For the multilevel model, you can use a linear mixed-effects model to examine the moderating effect of virtual working on extraversion. You can include virtual working as a time-varying predictor and extraversion as a non-time varying predictor. You can also include random intercepts and slopes for each participant to account for the repeated measures design. You can use the lme4 package in R to run the multilevel model. You can also use visualization techniques to examine the distribution of the generated data and evaluate the model's performance using metrics. If the generated distribution is not satisfactory, you can adjust hyperparameters or use advanced techniques like adversarial training to improve the model's performance.
