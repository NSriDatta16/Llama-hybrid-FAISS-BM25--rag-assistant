Question about mixture models intuition

The following paragraph appears in Kevin P Murphy's 'Machine Learning A Probabilistic Perspective' chapter 'Mixture Models Discrete Hidden Variables' Whilst there are some cases, such as the Gaussian Mixture Model discussed below, where there is a clear visual interpretation of the meaning of ‘cluster’, the reader should bear in mind that the intuitive meaning of ‘cluster’ is based on datapoints being ‘close’ in some sense to each other. The tremendous advantage of the realisation that mixture models generalise the idea of modelling clusters, is that we are freed from the conceptual constraint of distances in some Euclidean type sense. Instead, two datapoints become ‘close’ if they are both likely with respect to the model for that ‘cluster’. Hence, we can immediately start to ‘cluster’ all kinds of data – music, shopping purchases etc – things which do not necessarily have a natural ‘distance’ measure. I did not quite understand the meaning of the statement "The tremendous advantage of the realisation that mixture models generalise the idea of modelling clusters, is that we are freed from the conceptual constraint of distances in some Euclidean type sense." Would appreciate if someone explained this statement with an example to make it more easier to understand.
