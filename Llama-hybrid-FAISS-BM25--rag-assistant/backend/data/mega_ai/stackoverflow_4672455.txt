This is an old post, and you might have already decided which way to go, but here are a few things I can point out. Today's web applications have so many things to do such as database access, session management, integration with the client side program using Ajax and so on. In that sense, #1 doesn't help much. You would need to write a lot of code from scratch. I personally like Lift a lot. Though, its unique features and concepts might confuse you especially when you're new to Scala. There are other alternatives raging from ones in the Scala world such as Scalatra and Play to ones in the Java world such as Spring. I hope this will help, KK
