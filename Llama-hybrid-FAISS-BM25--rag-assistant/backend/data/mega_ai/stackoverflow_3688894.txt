It is difficult to argue about elegance or ugliness of a certain syntax construction. You just see it or don't. Comma separated join syntax reflects the fundamental feature of Relational Algebra, which asserts the normal form for select-project-join queries. The only kind of join that escapes it (and therefore, warrants a dedicated syntax) is the outer join. Accidental mistakes of missing equality predicates that render join graph disjoint is just a matter of how sophisticated your front-end SQL programming tool is (does it display join graph at all?). It is not only aesthetics. It is common for production databases to have columns like CREATED_ON, or COMMENTS across many tables. In this case the NATURAL JOIN syntax is plain dangerous. As Anthony Molinaro (author of popular "SQL Cookbook") eloquently put it: â€œ Old style is short and sweet and perfect. ANSI dumbed it down, and for people who've been developing for sometime, it's wholly unnecessary ".
