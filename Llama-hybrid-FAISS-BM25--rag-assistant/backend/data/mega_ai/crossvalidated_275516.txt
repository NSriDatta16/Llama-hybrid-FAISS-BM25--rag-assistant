For simplicity think in terms of a test on means. Suppose under H0 the treatment effect is zero, so that each z value is a weighted estimate of the treatment effect θi. Stouffer's method gives an unweighted average of these treatment effects so will give a more precise estimate (and hence smaller p-value) than each separate z value. This unweighted estimate of the treatment effect is biased but a weighted Stouffer's method is possible, and if the weights are proportional to 1/standard error(θi) the treatment effect estimate is unbiased. This only makes sense however if the separate z values are measures of the same quantity. An advantage of Stouffer's and Fisher's methods is that they can also be applied to meta-analyses where different response variables have been chosen - so they can't be averaged - but where a consistency of direction of effect can still be discerned.
