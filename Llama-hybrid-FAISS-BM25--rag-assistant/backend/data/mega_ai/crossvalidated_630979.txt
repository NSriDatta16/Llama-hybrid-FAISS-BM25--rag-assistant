In my opinion, a rough explanation (that will get them to more than 60% understanding) is to tell them is simply a measure of how much something varies . If you ate the same amount of food every day your diet would have low variance. If they want more precision they should look at the maths. Variance squares the differences with the mean, so it gives more importance to large differences, as opposed to the standard deviation. This is given attention to in investing for example, because of risk aversion. For two equally valued things, the one with higher variance would tend to have higher highs and lower lows, and people tend to avoid that, even if the possibility of the worst happening is extremely low.
