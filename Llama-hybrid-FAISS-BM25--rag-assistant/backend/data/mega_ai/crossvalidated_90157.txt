Fitting ARMA model with MATLAB R2012b

I want to fit an ARMA model on a time series (quarterly log returns of a 10 year bond) using MATLAB R2012b. This is part of an exercise. I have problems with the code and the interpretation of a result. This is the code I'm using: % last element is the most recent one, first element is the oldest one timeSeries = ... [0.0327; 0.0386; 0.0375; 0.0147; 0.0417; -0.0319; -0.0278; ... -0.0693; 0.0328; -0.0721; -0.0727; 0.0645; -0.0301; -0.0301; -0.0261; ... 0.0313; -0.0912; -0.0235; 0.0436; -0.0714; 0.0128; 0.0506; 0.1451; ... 0.0387; -0.0190; 0.0822; -0.0009; -0.0094; 0.0408; 0.0324; 0.0661; ... 0.1519; 0.0713; 0.2015; 0.0353; -0.0800; 0.0079; 0.0119; -0.1376; 0.0345; ... 0.0568; -0.3770; 0.0516; 0.0563; 0.0849; 0.0484; 0.0148; 0.0991; 0.0796; ... 0.0872; 0.0754; -0.0473; -0.3189; 0.0478; 0.0457; 0.0183; -0.0422; ... -0.0528; 0.0632; -0.0287; -0.1751; 0.0238; 0.0733; -0.0177; 0.0933; ... 0.1358; -0.0631; -0.0542; -0.0166; 0.0194; -0.0868; 0.0742; 0.0260; ... 0.0122; 0.0634; 0.0277; 0.0171; 0.0509; 0.1551; 0.0875; 0.0535; 0.0058; ... 0.1711; 0.1028; -0.2364; 0.0991; -0.0061; 0.0768; -0.0444; 0.2470; ... 0.0935; -0.0983; -0.0428; -0.0852; -0.0977; 0.0094; -0.3146; 0.1685; ... 0.0379; -0.1846; -0.3769; 0.0353; -0.1330; 0.2245; 0.0255; 0.1483; ... -0.0051; 0.0255; -0.0407; 0.0779; 0.0305; 0.0353; 0.0931; 0.0520; 0.1156; ... -0.0712; 0.0579; 0.0879]; p = 1; q = 1; % first way: garchfit spec = garchset('R', p, 'M', q, 'VarianceModel', 'Constant'); [coeff, coeffErrors, llf, innovation, sigma, summary] = garchfit(spec, timeSeries); garchdisp(coeff, coeffErrors); % second way: arima class [model, varCov, llf2, info2] = estimate(arima(p,0,q), timeSeries); I get the following results using garchfit (coefficients equal to 1 or -1 have an absolute value very close to 1, like 0.999999998): Standard T Parameter Value Error Statistic ----------- ----------- ------------ ----------- C 0.0063979 0.022847 0.2800 AR(1) -1 0.025306 -39.5159 MA(1) 1 0.040576 24.6451 K 0.010616 0.0010517 10.0941 These are the results using the arima class: Standard t Parameter Value Error Statistic ----------- ----------- ------------ ----------- Constant 0.00381023 0.0235065 0.162092 AR{1} 0.638413 2.19145 0.29132 MA{1} -0.617482 2.26535 -0.272577 Variance 0.0107181 0.00103327 10.373 Question 1 . I believe that the two ways to fit the model should lead to the same model: an ARMA model can be represented as a GARCH model with constant variance (this is what I was taught at least, I'm no expert of GARCH models). Is it correct? Question 2 . Assuming that both ways should lead to the same model, why do I get very different values for coefficients AR{1} and MA{1}? Is it just related to the optimization procedure used to compute them? Question 3 . Assumption: the garchfit results are correct; in fact, these results are significant, while the ones computed with the arima class are not. Therefore, my univariate model becomes $$ y_{t} = 0.0063979 - y_{t-1} + \epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon_t $$ where $\epsilon$ are residuals. Therefore, it is $$ y_{t} + y_{t-1} = 0.0063979 + \epsilon_{t-1} + \epsilon_t $$ Can you help me understand what does it mean? I think it should mean that the time series is equal to its residuals, therefore the time series is a white noise according to the theory of ARMA models. Is is correct? Thank you very much.
