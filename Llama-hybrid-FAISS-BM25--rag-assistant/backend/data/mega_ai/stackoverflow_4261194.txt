PDF/A-1a: OutputIntents for Black and White Images

I'm attempting to create a PDF/A-1a compliant file that only contains a black and white image (i.e. CCITTFaxD). I'm running into trouble with the "OutputIntents". I basically can't find an outputintent that's made for 1-bit images. Does anyone know of a profile I'm suppose to use? Alternatively, how do I not use an OutputIntent for b/w images? Note: I have this working for grayscaled images and coloured images. Albert
