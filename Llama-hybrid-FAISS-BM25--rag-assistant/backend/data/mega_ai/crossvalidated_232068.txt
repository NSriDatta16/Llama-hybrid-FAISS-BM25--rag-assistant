Hierarchical Bayesian Modelling: deriving a Conditional PDF relation

Background I am currently reading through the book: Data Analysis: A Bayesian Tutorial, second edition by D.S. Sivia. I am stumped by one of the relations that he introduces in the context of model selection, when evaluating the evidence for a model $B$, which is parameterised by $\lambda$, with data $D$ and other relevant background information $I$, i.e. $prob(D \mid B, I) = \int prob(D \mid \lambda, B, I) \, prob(\lambda \mid B,I)d\lambda$. Note $prob(\cdot)$ refers to a probability density function. Issue My issue is concerned with how $prob(D \mid\lambda, B, I)$ is rewritten on page 80, equation (4.5) of the book. The book says: Let us also take it that there is a value $\lambda_{0}$ which yields the closest agreement with the measurements; the corresponding probability $prob(D \mid \lambda_{0}, B, I)$ will be the maximum of B's likelihood function. As long as this adjustable parameter lies in the neighbourhood of the optimal value, $\lambda_{0} \pm \delta\lambda$, we would expect a reasonable fit to the data; this can be represented by the Gaussian pdf $prob(D \mid\lambda, B, I) = prob(D \mid\lambda_{0}, B, I) \times \exp \left(-\frac{(\lambda - \lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\delta\lambda^{2}} \right)$ Intuitively this relation makes sense to me. However, I cannot seem to be able to derive the relation myself. Attempt at solution First of all I will say that I am interpreting $\exp \left(-\frac{(\lambda - \lambda_{0})^{2}}{2\delta\lambda^{2}} \right)$ as $prob(\lambda \mid \lambda_{0}, B, I)$, and so I am looking to derive the relation: $prob(D \mid \lambda, B, I) = prob(D \mid\lambda_{0}, B, I) \times prob(\lambda \mid \lambda_{0}, B, I)$ I have made numerous attempts at trying to derive the LHS from the RHS or vice versa by applying Bayes' Theorem and/or the chain rule of probability to no avail. I have also looked into Hierarchical Bayes' statistics (where this example would be a two stage hierarchical model), and from this I believe that $\lambda_{0}$ should be conditioned on the LHS of the equation (i.e. it has implicitly been absorbed into the background info, $I$) so that the relation can be written: $prob(D \mid \lambda, \lambda_{0}, B, I) = prob(D \mid \lambda_{0}, B, I) \times prob(\lambda \mid \lambda_{0}, B, I).$ However, I still cannot derive this relation. Any advice on how to proceed would be very much appreciated, and I apologise in advance if the solution is simply some trivial relation between $prob(A \mid B,C)$, $prob(A \mid C)$ and $prob(B \mid C)$, but I am not aware of one.
