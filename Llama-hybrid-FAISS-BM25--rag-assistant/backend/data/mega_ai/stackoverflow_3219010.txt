It's not clear from your question, but I assume you're trying to make your C# app automate a Web browser that's running as a separate application (as opposed to embedding a WebBrowser control in your app and automating that). This sounds like the sort of thing WatiN is meant to automate. It's intended for automated tests (which may or may not be what you're doing) but gives you an easy way to drive an external instance of either IE or FireFox, navigate to pages, find text fields and type into them, click buttons, etc. A sample code snippet from their site: using (var browser = new IE("http://www.google.com")) { browser.TextField(Find.ByName("q")).TypeText("WatiN"); browser.Button(Find.ByName("btnG")).Click(); Assert.IsTrue(browser.ContainsText("WatiN")); }
