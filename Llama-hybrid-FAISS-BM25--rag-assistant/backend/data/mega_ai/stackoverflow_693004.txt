This answer takes your comment to Rich's answer in mind. The site is probably checking whether or not you are a real user using the HTTP referer or the User Agent string. try setting these for your curl: //pretend you came from their site already curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_REFERER, 'http://domainofthesite.com'); //pretend you are firefox 3.06 running on windows Vista curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 6.0; en-US; rv:1.9.0.6) Gecko/2009011913 Firefox/3.0.6');
