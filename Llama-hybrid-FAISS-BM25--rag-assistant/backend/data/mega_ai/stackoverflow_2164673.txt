Using the built-in sorting algorithm of the DataView (which is where you'd do actual sorting, not in the DataTable itself), this isn't possible, strictly speaking; there is no support for "custom" sorting, which is what you'd need. The sorting capabilities of the DataView are actually surprisingly limited, and (IIRC) it isn't even a stable sort (since it uses Array.Sort , which is documented as unstable). Your only real option (from a GUI perspective) is to use a data display control that provides custom sorting capability, like the DevExpress XtraGrid.
