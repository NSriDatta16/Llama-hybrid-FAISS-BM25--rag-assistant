First place to look is the Open Font Library : they have probably the biggest range of freely licensed fonts out there, organised with tags. Googling for {sil free font license} will give you pointers, as well. Check out typoasis : there are some sublime fonts if you look around the site. Free as in beer, not speech. Look around at the classic fonts by Zapf: some are freely licensed, and there's quite a range.
