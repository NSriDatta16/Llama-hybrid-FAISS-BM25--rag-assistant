It's not something that comes as standard - even in Silverlight 4 (I hit this very problem today). However, there are quite a few DIY implementations on the net: http://gistom.blogspot.com/2009/12/silverlight-combobox-with-keyboard.html http://www.codeproject.com/KB/silverlight/ComboBoxKeyBrdSelection.aspx http://www.reflectionit.nl/Blog/PermaLinkd137c1f7-a515-4084-8199-f8b3cf892b8f.aspx The author of the last post created a small Behavior which fixes this problem. You can attach the KeyboardSelectionBehavior to a ListBox or ComboBox using Microsoft Expression Blend. You drag it from the Assets and drop it on your ComboBox or ListBox. If you have a custom ItemTemplate you will have to set the SelectionMemberPath property. If you don't have access to Blend then just use the code as a template and edit the XAML by hand to produce the same result.
