VSTO 2007: how do I determine the page and paragraph number of a Range?

I'm building an MS Word add-in that has to gather all comment balloons from a document and summarize them in a list. My result will be a list of ReviewItem classes containing the Comment itself, the paragraph number and the page number on which the commented text resides. Part of my code looks like this: private static List FindComments() { List result = new List (); foreach (Comment c in WorkingDoc.Comments) { ReviewItem item = new ReviewItem() { Remark = c.Reference.Text, Paragraph = c.Scope. ???, // How to determine the paragraph number? Page = c.Scope. ??? // How to determine the page number? }; result.Add(item); } return result; } The Scope property of the Comment class points to the actual text in the document the comment is about and is of type Microsoft.Office.Interop.Word.Range . I can't work out how to determine what page and which paragraph that range is located. With paragraph number, I actually mean the "numbered list" number of the paragraph, such as "2.3" or "1.3.2". Any suggestions? Thanks!
