Interpreting results of the vegan anova.cca function

1st question here! I've scoured the internet, including the vegan documentation, but am still confused about the meaning of the F versus ChiSquare values in the results of the anova.cca() vegan function. In this scenario, I've sampled the microbiome of 15 animals over several months and want to know which variable contributes the most to changes in diversity- age or individuality (animal ID). In every example I can find online the ChiSquare and F value are always the highest for one variable, but in my results ChiSquare is highest for "animalID" and the F is highest for "Age" and both are significant. I would like to know a) in layman's terms, the meaning of each value, b) which variable is more influential in this case and c) which should be reported in a manuscript (both?). Thank you! #R code: my.cca F) Age 1 0.4673 7.7879 0.001 *** Name 14 2.1805 2.5958 0.001 *** Age:Name 14 1.9529 2.3248 0.001 *** Residual 169 10.1400 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1
