First off, there's a huge difference between random and pseudorandom. There's no way to generate perfectly random numbers from a deterministic process (such as a computer) without bringing in some physical process like latency between keystrokes or another entropy source. The approach of saving all the numbers generated will slow down the computation rather quickly; the more numbers you have, the larger your storage needs, until you've filled up all available memory. A better method would be (as someone's already suggested) using a well known pseudorandom number generator such as the Linear Congruential Generator ; it's super fast, requiring only modular multiplication and addition, and the theory behind it gets a lot of mention in Vol. 2 of Knuth's TAOCP. That way, the theory involved guarantees a rather large period before repetition, and the only storage needed are the parameters and seed used.
