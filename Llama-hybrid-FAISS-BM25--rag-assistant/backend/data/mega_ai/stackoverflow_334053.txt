Find a small spot where you feel comfortable and change it. Ignore the rest; you'll get to learn about it when you need it. Don't feel overwhelmed by the size; every program started with the first line and if it wasn't organized in small, independent bits, it would be impossible to maintain. So there is always a niche for you.
