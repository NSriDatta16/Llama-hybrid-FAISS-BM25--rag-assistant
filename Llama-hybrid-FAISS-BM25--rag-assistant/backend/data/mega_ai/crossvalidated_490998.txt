Joint optimization - Feature extraction and a classifier

I am dealing with a classification problem and high dimensional data. I am using a feature extraction method ( PCA - Principle Component Analysis) followed by a Support Vector Machine (SVM). I just wonder if there is a way that I can jointly optimize both (PCA and SVM) so that I can keep the features that improve the performance of SVM. Does anyone have any idea if there is way to do this (joint optimization) in Python?
