Firefox has Addons and plugins. Addons are written in a version of javascript with some special functionalities to allow operations like reading/writing files, modifying the page/requests, etc. Plugins like flash, java, or the DIVX plugin are displayed as part of the webpage. It sounds like you want to make an addon. Keep in mind, users can disable or uninstall addons and plugins quite easily from firefox. It sounds like you might be better doing this with a proxy that analyses requests like websense. If you don't want to go the proxy route, maybe a tool that uses winpcap (windows version of libpcap) to monitor all outgoing network traffic that contains web requests (GET, POST, etc) and simply block them that way? You could create one program that worked for all browsers and make it harder to uninstall
