If you are using 2 cameras or more then you do not need to use machine learning. The dartboard can be modeled as a plane, so you only need two cameras to identify its position. You can simply put a camera above the dartboard, and one on its right. Then you can get the horizontal position from the top camera and the vertical position from the side camera. If you want to use machine learning for learning sake, you can do that with a single camera. Besides the lower project cost, you will also be reducing the size of the input data without losing information. I would position the camera at an angle facing the dartboard. Then you will need to follow the following steps Collecting data Labelling the data Building a model Collecting the data You will need to collect thousands of images of the darts in the dartboard from the camera in a fixed position. Labelling the data You will need to attribute a target with the ground truth for each image. This will consist of an (x,y) coordinate for each of the 3 darts. Our final model will have 6 outputs. Building a model For object detection in images, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) are a good choice to start. You can build one easily by using the Keras API of TensorFlow.
