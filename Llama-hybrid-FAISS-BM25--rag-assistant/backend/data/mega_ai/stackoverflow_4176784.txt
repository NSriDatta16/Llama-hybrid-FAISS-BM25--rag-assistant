Lost git history after reorganizing project folder

I made a commit about a month ago that involved me creating new folder and sub-folders and moving my source code files in between them. I just was looking through my history for the first time since then and realized git has 'lost' history since the original files were deleted and then re-added, I suppose - i.e. when I'm viewing a file in my git GUI (it's under NDA so I can't discuss it directly, but for example, this repository is broken on GitHub too. GitHub clearly shows its detecting the commit as a series of moves.) it only shows history for each file back to when the project folder was reorganized. After reading a few questions ( Getting Git to Acknowledge Previously Moved Files , How to make git mark a deleted and a new file as a file move? ), I'm simply more lost than when I started. It sounds like from those answers that I won't be able to fix this at all? I'd really appreciate any help here.
