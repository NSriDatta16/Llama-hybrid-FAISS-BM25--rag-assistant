That is a bit of a vague question you are asking. And I think you are not facing a choice of database software, but an architectural problem. Some considerations: How reliable are the devices, and how well are they connected to the querying software? How failsafe do you need the storage to be? How much extra processing power do the devices have to process your queries? Basically, your idea of a spatial partitioning is a good idea. That does not exclude a temporal partition, if necessary. Whether you do that in postgres or sqlite depends on other factors, like the processing power and available libraries. Another consideration would be whether your devices are reliable and powerful enough to handle your queries. Otherwise, you might want to work with a centralized cluster of databases instead, which you can still query in parallel.
