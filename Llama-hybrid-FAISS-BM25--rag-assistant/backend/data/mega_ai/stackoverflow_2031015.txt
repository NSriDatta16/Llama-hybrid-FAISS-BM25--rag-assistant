Cast the average, don't average the cast: cast(AVG(scale) as decimal(5,2)) Update Using ROUND() changes the value not the type. Eg. select round(0.12345,2) returns 0.12000 as it should becuase it rounds 0.12345 to 0.12 but keeps the original type with 5 decimals after the point, hence 0.12000. To change the type one must use cast, as in my post.
