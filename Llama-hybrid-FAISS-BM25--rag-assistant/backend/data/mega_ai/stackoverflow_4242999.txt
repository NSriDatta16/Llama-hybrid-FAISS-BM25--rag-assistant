Yeah, each domain/subdomain has a different localStorage and you can call the keys whatever you want (prefix is not required). To get a key you can use the method key(index) such as localStorage.key(0); There was an object called globalStorage before where you could have multiple localStorages, but it's been deprecated from the specs
