How to pass a multimap into function

I have a pretty simple question. Im just learning Maps and multimaps and want to know how to pass them into a function. Ive got most of my mind wrapped around multimaps but would like a quick example on how to pass them into a void function. int main() { multimap movies; movies.insert(pair ("Happy Feet",6)); movies.insert(pair ("Happy Feet",4)); movies.insert(pair ("Pirates of the Caribbean",5)); movies.insert(pair ("Happy Feet",3)); movies.insert(pair ("Pirates of the Caribbean",4)); movies.insert(pair ("Happy Feet",4)); movies.insert(pair ("Flags of out Fathers",4)); movies.insert(pair ("Gigli",4)); cout *q) { // this function wont calculate the average obviously. I just wanted to test it int averageH; int averageP; int averageF; int averageG; averageH = (q->count("Happy Feet")); averageP = (q->count("Happy Feet")); averageF = (q->count("Happy Feet")); averageG = (q->count("Happy Feet")); };
