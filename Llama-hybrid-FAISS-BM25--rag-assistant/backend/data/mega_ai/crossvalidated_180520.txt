I hope someone who knows more will answer your actual question. Until then, it bears noting that Hosmer-Lemeshow is not a good test. Briefly, its results are very sensitive to minor changes that should not matter at all -- how ties are dealt with and cutpoints are defined, and how many groups are used (ten is traditional, but shouldn't matter). People, including Hosmer and Lemeshow, have been writing about this for a while -- see Hosmer, D. W., Hosmer, T., Le Cessie, S. & Lemeshow, S. A Comparison of Goodness-of-Fit Tests for the Logistic Regression Model. Statist. Med. 16, 965–980 (1997). and Allison, P. Measures of Fit for Logistic Regression. in SAS Global Forum 2014 (2014). at http://www.statisticalhorizons.com/wp-content/uploads/GOFForLogisticRegression-Paper.pdf . Paul Alison also has a lovely post summarizing this, Why I Don’t Trust the Hosmer-Lemeshow Test for Logistic Regression . I don't believe there's a widely-accepted substitute for the H-L test; there's a literature, not a solution. The above references point to some possibilities.
