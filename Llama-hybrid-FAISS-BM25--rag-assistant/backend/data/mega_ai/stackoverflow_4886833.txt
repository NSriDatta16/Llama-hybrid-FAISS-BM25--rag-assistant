Android USB HID Device

Does anyone know how to configure an Android device (tablet) to appear as a USB HID device when connected to a PC? Is there any other way of getting data from the tablet to the PC (via USB) other than writing it to a file, and have the PC retrieve the (updated) file from the tablet which is acting as a 'mass storage device' for the PC? Can USB carry a TCP/IP end-end connection? Using a tablet as a high-end intelligent 'keyboard' or 'mouse' or similar device would be immensely powerful, and open up lots of possibilities. Controlling a model railway layout is the end I have in mind. Thanks
