allBundle returns an NSArray of all the bundles. You mean to use the method mainBundle . If you can't find your resource then this is most likely a problem with the name of the resource you're looking for (have you checked the value of nm is correct?) Also check in your Target under the "Copy resources" section that your .jpg file is listed there. If it's not then you should drag it there to ensure that the file is copied into your bundle when you build it. If you really want to search through all the available bundles for your resource, then you can loop through the array of bundles that allBundle returns as follows: NSString* pathForResource = nil; for (NSBundle currentBundle in [NSBundle allBundle]) { pathForResource = [currentBundle pathForResource:nm ofType:@"jpg"]; if (pathForResource) { break; // Found resource, no longer need to search through bundles. } } Note: You also don't need to use the "inDirectory:" part of the method (see the docs).
