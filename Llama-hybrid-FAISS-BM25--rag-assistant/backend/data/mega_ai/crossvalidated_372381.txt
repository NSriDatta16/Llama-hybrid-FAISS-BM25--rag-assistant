In what sense is momentum "optimal" for optimisation of neural networks?

This article states about the use of momentum in gradient descent for neural networks: A lower bound, courtesy of Nesterov [5] , states that momentum is, in a certain very narrow and technical sense, optimal. I cannot open the Nesterov reference, since it is a book (and probably I'd find it hard to understand anyway). Could you explain in what sense momentum is optimal for optimization?
