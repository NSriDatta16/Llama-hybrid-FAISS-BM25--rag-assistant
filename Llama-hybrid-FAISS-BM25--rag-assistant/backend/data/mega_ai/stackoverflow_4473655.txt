Why Maven asks me for distribution config in every module in multi-module site deployment?

My multi-module Maven project looks like: /foo pom.xml /foo-parent /foo-core /foo-something /src /site Pay attention that foo is not a parent project, but foo-parent is (for foo-core and foo-something ). foo is not inheriting from foo-parent . Site configuration is stored in foo . All other sub-modules don't know anything about project site and don't have . mvn site works perfect, and now I'm running mvn site-deploy : [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-site-plugin:2.0.1:deploy (default-deploy) on project foo-parent: Missing site information in the distribution management element in the project.. -> [Help 1] Maven is trying to site-deploy every sub-module individually?? Is it a correct behavior?
