Constant boolean variables in multivariate time series observations

I am observing multivariate time series with some of its variables being boolean. One example of such observation has its var1=1 during all time series, and another observation has var2=0 for example during all time series. So what I mean is all observations must have all its boolean variables constant. My question is should these variables be somehow preprocessed or it is totally fine to fit nn with such multivariate time series data? Thank you in advance. I am newbie in these things.
