Your statement echoes Jaynes. He said When we look at these problems on a sufficiently fundamental level and realize how careful one must be to specify the prior information before we have a well-posed problem, it becomes evident that there is, in fact, no logical difference between (3.51) and (4.3); exactly the same principles are needed to assign either sampling probabilities or prior probabilities, and one man’s sampling probability is another man’s prior probability. The equations in chapter three are on elementary sampling theory and four on elementary hypothesis testing. There are three primary methods to create Bayesian theory from Cox's, de Finetti's and Savage's axioms. Cox is built on logic, de Finetti on gambling and Savage on preferences. In all three cases, you do not get well-posed problems with arbitrary calculations. If you think of a probability statement as a statement about a logical assertion, then to get a proper answer all parts of the logical argument must be included. Likewise, when one gambles, one would be insane to purposely ignore information about which you were going to gamble on. Finally, it begs rationality with respect to preferences to ignore knowledge. I believe the mistake comes from a misunderstanding of probabilities as frequencies. They are not. Long run frequencies will not be derived from Bayesian methods. It can be the case they have nice Frequentist properties, but this is incidental. Now, this does ask is there any circumstance where one should ignore prior information and the answer is "yes." As long as one is not introducing contradictory information or damaging the assertion there can be. Consider the case of a high dimension model with prohibitive calculation costs that could be approximated closely by an approximate solution. Weakening the prior gives a solution when a strong prior makes it impossible to do the work. Likewise, consider a low dimension model where time is of the essence and determining a full prior would result in catastrophic losses due to the time constraints. This is the terrorist with the bomb scenario. In that case, it is rational to use less than the available information. Laziness or ignorance is not an excuse for ignoring the prior.
