An important point to me from the above is that CI do not have to assume normality. They can assume any distribution. Also, having never heard of PI before this post which is at best distressing after all the years I read time series, I don't think either CI or PI get stressed that much especially by practitioners (although unlike Stephen Kolassa I am not an expert I just read the literature and run models). I think uncertainty for time series is pretty large, almost certainly greater than a CI. For one thing structural breaks are a real issue. Ask anyone plotting financial data what COVID19 did to their models. I know a state agency that has on their wall their ARIMA models before the 2008 crash... and what really occurred. So uncertainty in the future is very high and probably unknowable. I doubt you can ever calculate it ahead of time, the best you can do is sensitivity models. What if it is ten percent, twenty percent etc higher. What if this happens...
