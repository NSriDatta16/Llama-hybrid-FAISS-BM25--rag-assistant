If you use a truncated normal as your proposal, $\mathcal{N}_a^b(\mu,\sigma^2)$ where $(a,b)$ is the truncation interval, If $a$ or $b$ depend on the previous value of the Markov chain, the normalisation constant $$\Phi(\{b-\mu\}/\sigma)-\Phi(\{a-\mu\}/\sigma)$$ must also appear in the acceptance probability $$\frac{\pi(x')}{\pi(x)}\times\frac{\varphi(x|a',b',\mu',\sigma')}{\varphi(x'|a,b,\mu,\sigma)}\wedge 1$$where $\varphi(x|a',b',\mu',\sigma')$ denotes the truncated normal density, i.e. $$\varphi(x|a,b,\mu,\sigma)=\dfrac{\exp\{-(x-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2\}\mathbb{I}_{[a,b]}(x)}{\sqrt{2\pi‌​}\sigma[\Phi(\{b-\mu\}/\sigma)-\Phi(\{a-\mu\}/\sigma)]}$$ The simulation from the truncated normal does not require discarding any value as you can use the inverted cdf technique, as explained in this earlier answer .
