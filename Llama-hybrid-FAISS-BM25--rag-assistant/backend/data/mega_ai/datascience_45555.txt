These models are used for convex optimization. which means that there is only one solution for the problem. LinearSVC and SVC are used for same purpose but the optimization techniques used are different. E.g. LinearSVC intercept is penalized while in SVC it isn't. there might be differences scaling or default loss function. Hence they produce different results. LinearSVC tends to optimize faster. in multiclass classification, liblinear does one-vs-rest by default whereas libsvm does one-vs-one. if you want to know how they can produce similar results. You can check out this question. https://stackoverflow.com/q/33843981/5947203 Now the reason why SVN produced better results than Naive Bayes is that in this problem features are important. Naive Bayes treat them as independent while SVN looks at the interactions between them to a certain degree. Mathematically, One is probabilistic while other is geometrical. The dependencies are not captured by Naive Bayes hence it does not produce good results.
