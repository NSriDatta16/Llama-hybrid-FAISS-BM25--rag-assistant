How many parameters can your model possibly have?

This is a rather general question that came to mind while attending a talk on deep learning. A deep net had been trained with 32x32 images and there were 10 classes(CIFAR dataset). There were about 60000 images in the dataset. The person giving the talk said that the network has learnt more than 10 million parameters. That seems a bit weird to me because the number of pixels in all these images is around that order. How does one justify a model using this many parameters? Don't the chances of overfitting to a dataset increase with the number of parameters?
