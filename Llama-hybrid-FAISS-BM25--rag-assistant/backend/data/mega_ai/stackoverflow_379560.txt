How do I write ints out to a text file with the low bits on the right side (Bigendian)

By default the BinaryWriter class writes int values with the low bits on the left (e.g. (int)6 becomes 06 00 00 00 when the resulting file is viewed in a hex editor). I need the low bits on the right (e.g. 00 00 00 06). How do I achieve this? EDIT: Thanks strager for giving me the name for what I was looking for. I've edited the title and tags to make it easier to find.
