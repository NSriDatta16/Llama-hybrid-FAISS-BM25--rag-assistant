The question is a bit unclear but does this query not work to get all cases that aren't assigned to that user? Case.objects.exclude(agents=request.user) If you are trying to get cases belonging to user's organization AND not assigned to him OR NOT unassigned to anybody this should work. Case.objects.filter(Q(organization=organization)|Q(agents=None)).exclude(agents=request.user)
