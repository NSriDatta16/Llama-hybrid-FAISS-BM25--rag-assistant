There is a plugin for Eclipse called PDT which makes PHP development a breeze. For an overview on how to install it, you can refer to the Eclipse website: http://wiki.eclipse.org/PDT/Installation#Eclipse_3.4_.2F_Ganymede_.2F_PDT_2.0 To actually view the PHP scripts running, I would imagine that you'd have to have some sort of server already installed and running. You could probably set the workspace location to be in the server path, and then view the files through localhost. But maybe the PDT package takes care of some of that for you.
