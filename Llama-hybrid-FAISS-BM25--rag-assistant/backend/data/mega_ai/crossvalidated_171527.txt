running time of function predict random forest R

I have implemented random forest with R's Random Forest package. The forest has 500 trees and 12 predictors. What should be the running time of function Predict? it takes around 57 millisecond. is there faster implementation? test time to predict: options(digits.secs=6) start = Sys.time() for (i in 1:1000) { predict(rf,test[1,]) } end = Sys.time() Thanks
