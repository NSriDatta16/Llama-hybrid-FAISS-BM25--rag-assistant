Is there any concurrent HTTP requests limitation for Silverlight?

I know that RFC requires UserAgent to have a limit of max 2 http connection to single server. In fact, most browsers have the limit larger than 2. The question is whether Silverlight have such limitation. Does it follow limit of hosting web browser? or does it has its own max connection limit?
