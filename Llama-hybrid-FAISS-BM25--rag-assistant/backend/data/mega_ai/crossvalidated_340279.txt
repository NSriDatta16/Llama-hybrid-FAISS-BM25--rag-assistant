Mean Vector of Weakly Stationary Time Series

$Y_t$ is weakly stationary and $Z_t$ is a sequence of IID normally distributed random variables with mean 0 and covariance matrix $\sum$. For the bivariate AR(4) model $Y_t - \phi_4Y_{t-4} = \phi_0+ Z_t $, how can we show that the mean vector of $Y_t$ is $\mu = (I_2 - \phi_4)^{-1}\phi_0 $?
