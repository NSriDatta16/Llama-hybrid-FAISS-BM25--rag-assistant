Custom UITableView reorder

I'm wondering if anyone has a link to a good tutorial or can point me in the right direction to recreate the 'drag to reorder' cells in a UITableView like Epic Win App. The basic idea is you tap and hold on a list item and then you drag to where you want the item to be. Any help would be greatly appreciated.
