Arithmetic or geometric mean to calculate an annual average price index?

I have monthly indices (Consumer Price Indices for 12 months) for a set of countries. I want to calculate the annual average for each country in order to have an average Consumer Price Index for a given year, not month. Do I calculate the annual average by simply summing all 12 monthly data points (i.e. monthly indices) and divide by 12; or should I be using the geometric mean here? From Wikipedia I see that This makes the geometric mean the only correct mean when averaging normalized results; that is, results that are presented as ratios to reference values. That being said, I'm not sure if the data I'm using can be categorized as "normalized data". Also, perhaps that I am using a reference year (the base year) may further complicate things.
