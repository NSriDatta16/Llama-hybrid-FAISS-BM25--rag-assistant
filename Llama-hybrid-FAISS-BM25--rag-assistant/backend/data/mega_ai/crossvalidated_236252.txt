You randomly select two distinct integers between 1 and 100. What is the probability that the larger number is exactly twice the smaller number?

I recently took a HackerRank test for a Data Science position and got this question wrong. I came to 1/200 . Here's how: There are 50 combinations that will make this true. (i.e. {1,2},{2,4},{3,6}...{50,100}). Probability of a specific number being chosen is 1/100 . Probability that the specific set will be chosen is (1/100 * 1/100) . Since there are 50 sets, P=50*(1/100)*(1/100)=1/200 I'm of course assuming that 1 and 100 are included. But this was the wrong answer. Can anyone help me understand my mistake?
