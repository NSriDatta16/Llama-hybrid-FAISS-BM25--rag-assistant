I put your table into R and ran a chi-squared test of homogeneity, which gave the same results as in your question. If this test had rejected the null hypothesis, then you would have evidence that profiles of Likert scores across categories A, C, D are significantly different. Also, you would have the job of seeing which Likert scores accounted for the difference(s) among categories. You are correct that this chi-squared test ignores the ordinal aspect of the Likert data. A controversial alternative is to treat Likert scores as if they are numerical, so that it makes sense to add and average them. Pretending that Likert scores are numerical (and not far from normal) would lead to a one-way ANOVA with three levels A, C, D of the factor. We are treating Likert categories as if they corresponded to numbers 1 through 5. Here is how to run such an ANOVA in R. a = c(10,12,25,8,7) c = c(10,14,58,22,15) d = c(7,5,24,14,4) x1 = rep(1:5, a) x2 = rep(1:5, c) x3 = rep(1:5, d) x = c(x1,x2,x3) g = rep(1:3, c(62, 119, 54)) oneway.test(x ~ g) One-way analysis of means (not assuming equal variances) data: x and g F = 1.5024, num df = 2.00, denom df = 117.44, p-value = 0.2268 Controversial or not, this test shows no significant differences in the averages of A, C, D categories. The Likert responses in the three groups are too similar to use them to say anything about categories. Average Likert scores and standard deviations at the three levels are as follows: mean(x1); mean(x2); mean(x3) [1] 2.83871 [1] 3.151261 [1] 3.055556 sd(x1); sd(x2); sd(x3) [1] 1.190034 [1] 1.062765 [1] 1.088823 One difficulty trying to find differences among A, C, D groups is that all groups had very high proportions of 'Neutral' choices among the five Likert responses.
