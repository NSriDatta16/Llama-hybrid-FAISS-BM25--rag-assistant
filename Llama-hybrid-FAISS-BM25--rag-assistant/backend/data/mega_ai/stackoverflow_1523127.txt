Just out of interest - do you know how the Math SQRT function is implemented? If it is using an inefficient approximation algorithm, then it might be your culprit. Your best option is to create some sort of test harness that can get an average performance for each of the instructions that you are using. Another question - does increasing or reducing the precision of the operators (i.e. by using double value floats rather than singles) change the performance in any way?
