How to use a 'for loop' in place of a 'while loop'

Had to write the following program for an on line pre java class using, while, do-while and for loops. Looking for a little explanation. Thanks in advance! PS While looking for reference books is this Java or Javascript? Any suggestions for a good reference book? I get the concept, mostly, the devil is certainly in the details. public class ExamsFor { public static void main(String[] arguments) { int inputNumber; // One of the exams input by the user. int sum; // The sum of the exams. int count; // Number of exams. Double Avg; // The average of the exams. /* Initialize the summation and counting variables. */ sum = 0; count = 0; /* Read and process the user's input. */ TextIO.put("Please enter the first exam: "); // get the first exam. inputNumber = TextIO.getlnInt(); for (inputNumber!=0; sum += inputNubmer; count++ ) { // had the while loop below enter here, worked TextIO.put("Please enter the next exam, or 0 to end: "); // get the next exam. inputNumber = TextIO.getlnInt(); } /* Display the result. */ if (count == 0) { TextIO.putln("You didn't enter any data!"); } else { Avg = ((double)sum) / count; TextIO.putln(); TextIO.putln("You entered " + count + " exams."); TextIO.putf("The average for the exams entered is %1.2f.\n", Avg); } } // end main () } // end class ExamsFor /* Had the following 'while loop' in place of the 'for loop' while (inputNumber != 0) { sum += inputNumber; // Add inputNumber to running sum. count ++; // Count the input by adding 1 to the count. */
