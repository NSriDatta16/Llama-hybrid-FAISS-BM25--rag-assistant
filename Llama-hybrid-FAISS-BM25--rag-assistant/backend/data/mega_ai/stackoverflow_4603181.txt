How to implement EXCEPT boolean operator of ISYS using Lucene API

I've studied that EXCEPT is a boolean operator for queries in ISYS(which is an Enterprise search Engine).It has the following functionality. If this is the query First EXCEPT Second------>The retrieved documents must contain the first search term but only if the second term is not in the same paragraph as the first. Both terms can appear in the document; just not in the same paragraph. Now how do I achieve this in Lucene? Thank you :)
