Reorganize array of arrays to array of hashes and convert to JSON

I have the following array var arr=[[10,20,30],[12,21,33],[13,23,35]]; How can I convert that array to JSON. Desired result myJSONarr=[ {"x":10 ,"y":20,"z":30}, {"x":12 ,"y":21,"z":33}, {"x":13, "y":23,"z":35} ]; I'm guessing I will have to define sting array var objArray=["x","y","z"]; and do loop over these two values with the eval() function. Any help is greatly appreciated.
