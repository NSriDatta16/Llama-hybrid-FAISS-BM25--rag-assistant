One way I have studied this problem in the past is to construct the 'eigenportfolios' of the correlation matrix. That is, take the eigenvector associated with the $k$th largest eigenvalue of the correlation matrix and scale it to a gross leverage of 1 (i.e. make the absolute sum of the vector equal to one). Then see if you can find any real physical or financial connection between the stocks which have large representation in the portfolio. Usually the first eigenportfolio is almost equal weighted in every name, which is to say the 'market' portfolio consisting of all assets with equal dollar weights. The second eigenportfolio may have some semantical meaning, depending on which time period you look over: e.g. mostly energy stocks, or bank stocks, etc. In my experience, you would be hard pressed to make any story out of the fifth eigenportfolio or beyond, and this depends in some part universe selection and the time period considered. This is just fine because usually the fifth eigenvalue or so is not too far beyond the limits imposed by the Marchenko-Pastur distribution.
