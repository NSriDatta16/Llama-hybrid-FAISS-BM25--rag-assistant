If ObjectDataSource isn't the answer for a large application, what is?

Quoting the answer of Andrew Hare on the This Question . Object data sources are nice for small projects but they do not scale well as you are embedding data-layer information in the UI layer of your application. I would suggest that you only use them for very small applications and scratch-pad testing stuff. If you make a design decision to use them be prepared to struggle with scaling and maintenance issues in the future. Application Architecture = Maintainability + Scalability + ...... And I think, every article that I've read to start learning application architecture used some classes to build up the business data layer and used ObjectDataSource to connect the presentation layer with the business layer. Looks like I've got all wrong. What's really the best approach to use for the business layer and its connection with the presentation layer?
