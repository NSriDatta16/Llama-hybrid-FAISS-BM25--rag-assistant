Is there a good jQuery Drag-and-drop file upload plugin?

Is there a nice tidy jQuery plugin that allows including a single JS script then using a simple snippet to enable a form? Something like this: $j('#MyForm').enableDragDropUploads('.upload-area') With the upload target being the action of the form. Any solution must not prevent a regular file field from being usable (using traditional browse method). I only need one file at a time, though of course having the option for multiple isn't a bad thing. I've found a couple of drag-drop upload examples: http://www.appelsiini.net/2009/10/drag-and-drop-file-upload-with-google-gears http://www.appelsiini.net/2009/10/html5-drag-and-drop-multiple-file-upload But the code there isn't setup as a plugin. It's probably not too difficult to change it, but also no point doing so if someone else has already done that work and is simply evading my Google searches. I'm ideally looking for a pure HTML5/jQuery solution. A Google Gears one is acceptable, but a Flash solution is not.
