Weird libcurl error in PHP (Failed to connect to IPHERE: Unknown error 22)

I was finishing my script and suddenly libcurl stopped working. I thought the server I was connecting to was down or something, but invariably of where I try to connect I get the same sucky error. I even tried rebooting my box, same results. The code snippet where things happen is: public function navigate(array $data) { $ch = curl_init(); // Setup cURL curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, true); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_INTERFACE, $data['ip']); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEFILE, "/tmp/cookies.jar"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_COOKIEJAR, "/tmp/cookies.jar"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_FOLLOWLOCATION, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, $data['agent']); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_SSL_VERIFYPEER, false); // Visit homepage curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "SOMEWEBSITEHERE, MAKES NO DIFFERENCE"); $page= curl_exec($ch); var_dump($page, curl_error($ch), curl_errno($ch)); } The above var_dump() will produce this output (with www.yahoo.com as the URL): bool(false) string(51) "Failed to connect to 69.147.76.15: Unknown error 22" int(7) Login failed! I even tried sniffing the connection with wireshark, cURL doesn't even issue a connection request; only a DNS request. I'm clueless right now. I would really appreciate a hand with this. Thanks.
