I don't think it is possible to do without having the list in memory. You can obviously approximate with average if you know that the data is symmetrically distributed or calculate a proper median of a small subset of data (that fits in memory) - if you know that your data has the same distribution across the sample (e.g. that the first item has the same distribution as the last one)
