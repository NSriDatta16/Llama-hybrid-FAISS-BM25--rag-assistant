Usually, a Framework has a specific goal. A Framework might support a CMS, a 3D engine, a data-access system, etc... you may often see several frameworks used together to accomplish the ultimate goal, such as using Spring, Hibernate, and JavaEE to build a Java-based web application. From the look of it, you are collecting all of your assorted favourite functions into a single file (or do you group them into different files by functionality?). This can be useful, but I would not call this a framework - yet. It's really a library. If all of your functions are intended to support fancy email functionality, then learn OOP, and build a framework whose single goal is to provide an easy-to-use interface to fancy email functionality.
