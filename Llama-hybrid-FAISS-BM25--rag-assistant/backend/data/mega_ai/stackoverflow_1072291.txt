I think the Flickr API returns the json as type 'text/plain' which then will be displayed as text. You might try 'text/json' as a halfway point. Being easily viewed might outweigh being correct in your case. Also consider that should any client require the content type to be 'application/json' and refuse to work with 'text/plain' that client should specifically request the type it wants without ' / '. This then could be a case you look for when preparing the content type of your response, and you could document your service accordingly.
