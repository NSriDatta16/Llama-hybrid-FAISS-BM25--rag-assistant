One thing that you might try is to find some public syllabi for computer science classes. See what kind of projects they are doing and attempt them yourself. Consult books, forums, and SO as necessary when you need help. I thought the most foundational CS courses I took in undergrad were theory of programming languages, computer organization, operating systems, and theory/discrete math classes. Try taking a classic algorithm and implementing it in the 4 different types of languages. (try C#, LISP, Prolog, and C for example) Add some toy functionality to a local copy of the Linux kernel to see how it ticks. Write a distributed file system. These are some of the projects in school that taught me the most.
