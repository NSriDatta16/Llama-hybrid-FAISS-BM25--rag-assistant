There are two (three really) things that could have occured here. Your root masterpage was edited previously without cascading the change A number of your subsites have had thier masterpage edited independantly. For case 1. you should replace the child masterpages for all the subsites. For case 2. you have to figure out what changes were made and why. (There is also case 3 where both changes have occured.) You need to check on the "owners" of the subsites to know what is going on. In most organisations there are not that many people with the required permission level and skills to make modifications to a sites masterpage. Choosing to replace the child masterpages will completly replace them.
