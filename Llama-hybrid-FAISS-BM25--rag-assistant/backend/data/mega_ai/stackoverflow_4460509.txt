ValueError: invalid literal for int() with base 10: 'MSIE'

After I run my Python code on a big file of only HTTP headers, it gives me the above error. Any idea what that means? Here is a piece of the code: users = output.split(' ')[1] accesses = output.split(' ')[3] ave_accesses = int(accesses)/int(users) Basically the 'users' are users who have accessed a website and 'accesses' are the total number of accesses by the users to that site. The 'ave_accesses' gives the number of accesses to that site by an average user. I hope this is enough to clear things, if not I can explain more. thanks a lot, Adia.
