Does backcasting work the same way as forecasting?

Context: I have $K$ timeseries over the interval $[0,T]$ and $N$ timeseries over the interval $[S,T]$ , and would like to backcast the $N$ timeseries over the interval $[0,S]$ . I am quite new to this kind of problem and have a few questions. When backcasting, is possible to simply treat the problem by reversing the timeseries and forecasting the missing values, or is it a completely different problem entirely? If so, why is this allowed? What are some general approaches to backcasting, from both the classical ARMA and the more modern deep learning perspectives Are there any recommended papers to read for this problem?
