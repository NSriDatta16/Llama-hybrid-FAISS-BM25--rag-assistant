Identify the confidence of the impact of a proposed improvement initiative

Assume I have a manufacturing process that involves a moving train. It has failures of certain types like brakes and steering and also the weather. However, we can not do anything with regard to weather. Furthermore, there are more Brake failures than steering failures, we decided to tackle the brake failures. Using an engineering intuition we can assume that we can get rid of 50% of those failures by making some changes to the engineering design. However, as said previously, this is only an engineering intuition; hence my question is there a statistical technique to access the confidence that our improvement initiative will indeed reduce the brake failures. I understand that once we have implemented the initiative we can use t-tests and ANOVAs to ascertain the same. But my question is that is there anything I can leverage prior to embarking on the engineering change. Data for example could look like below: Equipment start_time end_time Reason duration Train1 201201130415 201201130445 Brake failed 0.5 Train1 201201130221 201201140336 Steering failed 1.25 Train1 201201130119 201201180349 Brake failed 2.5 Train1 201201131018 201201211148 Brake failed 1.5 Train1 201201130815 201201250945 Weather bad 1.5
