Windows stores the registered company name in the registry at : HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\RegisteredOrganization Import the following : using Microsoft.Win32; Read the value of the registry key required, like so: RegistryKey hklm = Registry.LocalMachine; hklm = hklm.OpenSubKey("SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion"); Object obp = hklm.GetValue("RegisteredOrganization");` Console.WriteLine("RegisteredOrganization :{0}",obp);` Or a one liner, as suggested by Xiaofu . However, the correct way is to use a double backslash. This is because the backslash is the C# escape character - that is, you can insert a newline character using \n, or tab using \t therefore to let C# know that we want a plain backslash and not some escaped character, we have to use two backslashes (\) or use @ in front of the string like (@"\somestring") : string org = (string)Microsoft.Win32.Registry.GetValue("HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows NT\\CurrentVersion", "RegisteredOrganization", ""); Note: The RegisteredOrganization key is not guaranteed to contain a value, as it may not have been filled in during the OS installation. So always use a try/catch block or check the returned value.
