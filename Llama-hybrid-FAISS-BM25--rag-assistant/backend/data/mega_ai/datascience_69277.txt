How fbprophet cross validation works

I am facing some issues to understand how cross_validation function works in fbprophet packages. I have a time series of 68 days (only business days) grouped by 15min and a certain metric : 00:00 5 00:15 2 00:30 10 etc 23:45 26 And I really donâ€™t know how to set up my cross_validation function. I have understand that initial parameter is the training data, but what are period and horizon ? I have 6528 rows, I want to forecast the next day so my period is 96 ? Because one day = 96 step of 15 min. Please can you explain me how I have to fill period and horizon parameters. The official documentation of Facebook Prophet is not very understandable. Thanks a lot.
