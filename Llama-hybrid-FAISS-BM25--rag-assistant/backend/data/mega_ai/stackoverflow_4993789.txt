This is due to the fact that the signature of Simulation.stop() method mentions some class that is package-restricted (non-public) to the simulation package. You solve it by either Move SSQSim to the simulation package so it can access the same classes as Simulation , or Make the classes required to extend the Simulation class package-public. To move a class from one package to another in eclipse, you can simply drag the source-code file into the desired package, and eclipse will refactor the code accordingly. (A side-note: As a rule of thumb, don't use the default package. The problem you ran into however, can occur even if you avoid the default package!)
