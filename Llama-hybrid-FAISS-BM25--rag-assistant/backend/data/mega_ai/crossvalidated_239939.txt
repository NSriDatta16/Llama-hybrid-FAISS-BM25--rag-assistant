Random Forest rolling

After implementing random forest (with randomForest package in R) with satisfactory results, I'm trying now to make a rolling version that updates at a preset frequency. So far I tried with the following approaches : use a 1 or 2 year rolling window to fit the random forest and predict over the following month use a 1 or 2 year incremental window to fit the random forest and predict over the following month Both approaches have been truly unsuccessful, as the results obtained have little to do with the results obtained from the static approach. I'm considering to keep the traditional in sample - out of sample structure, using an exponential weighting to give more importance to current data, and keeping constant the percentage of the data in sample. Any idea ? What else could work ? What is the best practice ? Thank you
