@BalusC is right, but I will say it more strongly, Singletons are evil in all contexts. Webapps, desktop apps, etc. Just don't do it. All a singleton is in reality is a global wad of data. Global data is bad. It makes proper unit testing impossible. It makes tracing down weird bugs much, much harder. The Gang of Four book is flat out wrong here. Or at least obsolete by a decade and a half. If you want only one instance, have a factory that makes only one. Its easy.
