Often, they are prepended to the hash and stored in the same field. There is no need to store them separately - the point is to use a random salt for each password so that a single rainbow table can't be used against your entire set of password hashes. With random salts, an attacker must brute-force each hash separately (or compute a rainbow table for all possible salts - vastly more work). If you had a more secure storage location, it would make sense to just store the hashes there.
