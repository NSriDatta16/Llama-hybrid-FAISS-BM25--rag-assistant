c# - embed activex control remote desktop

scenario: user 1 is presenting his or her desktop to user 2. user 2 can view what's happening on user 1 on his(user2)'s screen, but cannot control it. got a hint from somewhere that by embedding activex control rdp will allow me to do so but i do not know where to start? is this sort of like collaboration? any help would be greatly appreciated ! thanks in advance !
