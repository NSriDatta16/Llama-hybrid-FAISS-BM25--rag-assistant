Which time period of historical data to use

I’m working on a time series forecasting for monthly air traffic of an airport for the next 3 years. I’m provided with 20 years of monthly (240 months) of historical data. How do I determine which time period of the historical data should my forecast be based on? Is there any advantages or disadvantages of using just the past 5 or 10 years of data?
