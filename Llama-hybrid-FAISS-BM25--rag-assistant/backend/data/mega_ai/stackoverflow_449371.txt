Go back to the use case: what is the behavior you're trying to provide? If you have an asynchronous operation that you want to cancel, then you probably can best implement a method that lets you notify the other threadt via a flag or a semaphore. Sending a signal is a nice method to get it's attention, although I haven't looked into C#'s handling of signals. If you need to be able to cancel and undo, the Command pattern comes in handy.
