If it is a content that does not change dynamically between page loads, it should be generated on server, not by Javascript. If it is a dynamic content, it makes no sense to cache it. I would first think about your application design and then about advanced caching. Caching things on the client is mainly handled by the browser (and they are handled pretty well nowadays). If you want to cache results computed by Javascript, you have two storage possibilities: Cookies HTML5 API for storing JS data None of them is perfect for this purpose as none of them was designed for caching. For now I would go for Cookies as these are widely supported. After loading your page, simply check if a cookie exists and if so, just display its contents. Otherwise generate it using JS. On a side note - don't use for tabular data. The element was designed for that.
