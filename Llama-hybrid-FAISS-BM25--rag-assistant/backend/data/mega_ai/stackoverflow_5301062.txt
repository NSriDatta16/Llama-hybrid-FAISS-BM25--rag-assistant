need to count the frequency of each terms inside a document

i need to calculate the frequency of all the terms inside a document. How can i do that ? i do not ask for codes. I am just asking for guidance. Actually i am doing some similarity calculation between a document and query. I have calculated the term frequency for the query. But i do not know how to calculate the tern frequency for EACH words inside a document. Can anyone guide me ? Thank you for your attention.
