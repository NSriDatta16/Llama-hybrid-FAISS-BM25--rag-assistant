Peter, consider a simple example: patients nested inside doctors; each patient privides a single response value (i.e., time to some event, possibly censored); doctors are treated as "clusters. The use of an MLM in this setting acknowledges two things: That there is potential correlation among patient response values coming from the same doctor; That subject-specific inference is of interest (rather than population-average inference). So, when recommending the use of an MLM, both of these things have to be of interest. (Of course, it is possible to use an MLM to also get population-average inference, but that seems to be more complicated for some MLM models.) In cases where interest is in population-average inference, authors may resort to other means - for instance, GEE for clustered survival data (see https://lib.dr.iastate.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4062&context=rtd ). It is not clear from your description what modelling the authors actually used, but whatever they used, the question is: Is that modelling appropriate given the correlation structure of the data AND the inferential goals of the authors?
