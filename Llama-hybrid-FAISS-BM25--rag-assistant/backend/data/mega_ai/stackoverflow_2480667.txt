You could have a key called "posts" with a value of "1,2,3,4,10,12" and then update, retrieve it every time new post is created, updated, deleted. In any case, memcached is not a database replacement, it's a key/value storage (fast and scalable at it). So you have to decide what data to store in DB and what offload to memcached. Alternatively you could use "cachemoney" plugin which will do read/write through caching of your AcriveRecord in memory (even in memcached)
