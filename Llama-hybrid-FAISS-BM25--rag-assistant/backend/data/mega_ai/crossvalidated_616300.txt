Autocorrelation as a function: is that function random, deterministic? It's from the point of view of the autocorrelation function and its nature that one could shed some light on the idea of autocorrelated time series . When I first read the notion brought in the question, I thought that, maybe like the OP, talking about a time series being autocorrelated was awkward at best, both mathematically and from a semantic point of view. Autocorrelation, as has been reminded by the other answer's authors, refers to the correlation of that series with a time- (or sample-) shifted copy of itself. How could 2 identical signals not be correlated? In a long gone (and missed) past I worked in physical optics, where one measures the duration of ultra fast laser pulses using an autocorrelation operation; it was only possible because each laser pulses were exactly correlated with one another (they were copies of themselves). So that a time series (or more generally a signal or a function) be correlated with itself sounded obvious: there's no difference between it and itself . But as hinted, that is ignoring that autocorrelation should more accurately be referred to as an autocorrelation function . If that function is predictable (or even, deterministic) then the signal can be said to be autocorrelated. The article actually provides a good definition: When a time series is autocorrelated, this means that the current value of the series parameter is dependent on preceding values, and can be predicted (at least in part) on the basis of knowledge of those values. I'd like to illustrate the idea with few plots of time series and their autocorrelation function plots. A pure sine wave the same sine wave with added amplitude Gaussian noise the same pure sine wave with added same amplitude Gaussian noise and a Gaussian phase noise. As expected, the autocorrelation function has its peak when the shift (lag) is 0, for all versions of the sine wave (pure and noisy ones). For the pure sine wave, the autocorrelation has an attenuated cosine waveform. The interesting observation is for the autocorrelation function of the noisy sine waves: while the plots are also noisy, they do also have an attenuated cosine waveform, which could be predicted (with proper filtering) and/or approximated; this shows that samples in the time series at a time t have a certain degree of correlation with samples at earlier times. Following the definition of autocorrelated time series proposed in the article, one can say the 3 sine wave time series shown above are all autocorrelated. For a final visual illustration, here is the autocorrelation of the pseudo-random amplitude noise that was added to the pure sine wave. The autocorrelation is very low, this time series is not autocorrelated .
