Working with few data examples

I have been asked often in some interview, that how we should proceed when we have less data examples(say 50 or 100). What considerations needs to be made while choosing any algorithm. few points that came into my mind 1.check if the algorithm is flexible(SVM, kNN) and so avoid them as they would over fit the data easily. na√Øve bayes seems to be a nice choice as it would be more robust even when the data has some noise. 2.Use of regularization 3.Use of PCA or SVD perhaps to reduce the multicollinearity. any other things to be considered?
