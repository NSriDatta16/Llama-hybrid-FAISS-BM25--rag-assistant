Putting the increment operator after the variable means that the increment and assignment happens after the expression is evaluated... so The original statement x = x++; translates to 1. Evaluate x and store value in tyransient memory ... Now execute code called for by ++ operator .... (steps 2 & 3) 2. Increment value of x (in transient memory) 3. Assign Incremented value to x's storage location ... Now, continue with rest of the line's execution, to the left, there's an = sign... 5. So assign value stored in Step 1 (unincremented value) to expression on left of = sign... which is x
