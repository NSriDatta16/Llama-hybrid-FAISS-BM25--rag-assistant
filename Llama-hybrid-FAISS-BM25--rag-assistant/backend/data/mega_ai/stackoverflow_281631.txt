If speed/performance is a major concern for you, I would strongly suggest against UpdatePanels, as they cause a full page postback that drags the ViewState in the header, among other crap, and forces the page to go through the whole life cycle every time (even though the user doesn't see this). You should be able to (relatively easily) use PageMethods to accomplish your task. // In your aspx.cs define the server-side method marked with the // WebMethod attribute and it must be public static. [WebMethod] public static string HelloWorld(string name) { return "Hello World - by " + name; } // Call the method via javascript PageMethods.HelloWorld("Jimmy", callbackMethod, failMethod);
