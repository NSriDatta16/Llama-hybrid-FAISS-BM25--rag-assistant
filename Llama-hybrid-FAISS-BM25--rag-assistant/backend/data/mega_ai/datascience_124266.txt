I suggest to Gaussianize stock returns from heavy-tailed data to something that looks more like Gaussian. In particular, use Lambert W x Gaussian distributions to remove heavy-tails from data. This is available in both in the LambertW R package and in Python's pylambertw module. As an example of the ability to Gaussianize data with very heavy-tails consider the example of removing heavy-tails in a standard Cauchy random sample (a standard Cauchy does not even have a well-defined mean). import pylambertw from pylambertw.utils import plot import numpy as np np.random.seed(42) y = np.random.standard_cauchy(size=1000) plot.test_norm(y) Then you can use a Lambert W x Gaussian methods of moments (IGMM) estimator to train a transformer that normalizes the data. import pylambertw.igmm clf = pylambertw.igmm.IGMM() clf.fit(y) x = clf.transform(y) plot.test_norm(x) See also the Gaussianizer() transformer to operate on multi-dimensional X. See Goerg (2011 & 2015) for the original papers, with a detailed application of this methodology on stock return data [removing skewness & heavy-tails].
