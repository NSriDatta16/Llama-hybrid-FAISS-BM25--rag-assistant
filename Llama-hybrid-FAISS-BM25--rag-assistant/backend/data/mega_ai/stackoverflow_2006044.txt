In my experience with CI I've encountered some anomalies with its sessions, but for most day-to-day needs the library is good and easy to work with. As it was pointed out, Flashdata is a very nice feature. If you choose to stay with CI's sessions, I'd strongly suggest to store sessions in a database and, additionally, encrypt cookies: $config['sess_encrypt_cookie'] = TRUE; $config['sess_use_database'] = TRUE; $config['sess_table_name'] = 'sessions'; The database structure should be as follows: CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS `sessions` ( session_id varchar(40) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL, ip_address varchar(16) DEFAULT '0' NOT NULL, user_agent varchar(50) NOT NULL, last_activity int(10) unsigned DEFAULT 0 NOT NULL, user_data text NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (session_id) );
