You're simply mistaken. Unconditionally, $X_t$ and $X_{t-2}$ from a Markov chain aren't independent. As a result, you'd expect, with sufficiently large samples, to reject a test of independence. ( Conditionally on $X_{t-1}$, $X_t$ doesn't depend on $X_{t-2}$, because all the dependence comes through $X_{t-1}$.)
