next year prediction based on data of previous years using R

For my project in R, I took 5 years(2011-2015) of socio-economic data from different cities in the US, and using this data, I want to predict the amount of births in the year of 2016(I have the data of it) using R. For that I have a couple of questions: 1) the socio-economic data is counted by % out of the whole city population but the births data are in amount of births. I don't believe it will affect the model but it wouldn't hurt to ask if it will? 2) the 5 year data is organized in 5 tables- I can merge them with R but I don't know if it's best to merge by city(meaning I will have 5 times the columns, I honestly don't know whether that's a good idea), or a situation in which I have 5 times the rows(each city has 5 rows corresponding to each year), which will be a good organizing method? 3) should I pay attention to the total population(though the data is in % out of population so I don't think it will increase each year) and the years themselves(add a column of years), or it doesn't really matter for the train/test methods? 4) should I include the data for 2016(the whole socio-economic data for the year I'm trying to predict)? or should I only include the births? I'm basically trying to first check if there are connections between any of the predictors so that I will have a better idea of which model I should pick, then I can backstep or forwardstep to get rid of some of the predictors for a smaller model. I also want to know whether the train-test should come before I assume a model(for generalization, this question is connected to my 4th question about including the 2016 data). Any additional guidelines for a beginner like me will be gladly accepted. Attached are some of the columns(predictors) that I want to use, and how the data looks for each table(each representing 1 year).
