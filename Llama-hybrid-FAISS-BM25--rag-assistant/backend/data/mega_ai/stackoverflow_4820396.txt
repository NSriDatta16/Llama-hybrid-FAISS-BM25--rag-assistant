NoSQL DB and Reporting

I am in the architecture stage of an academic project involving billions of records. The project should be very lightweight in terms of computing power and highly scalable. The information structure is very simple: I need to store a list of items each one with different features. The feature are integers, decimals, dates, strings etc. When the data is imported the types of the feature is known. Also, features can be used to reference other items. I need to be able to get and sort a list of items by its features (more than one) - possibly using queries such as >, Reporting in the sense of sums, averages, grouping is also necessary by the demands for that are more relaxed - there is not need for a full cube capabilities, but more are better. I am very new to the whole NoSQL world. What would you recommend?.
