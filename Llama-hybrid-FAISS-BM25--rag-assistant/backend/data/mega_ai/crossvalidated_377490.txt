What does it mean to model data as binomial?

On Wikipedia it says [T]he binomial distribution with parameters $n$ and $p$ is the discrete probability distribution of the number of successes in a sequence of n independent experiments, each asking a yes–no question, and each with its own boolean-valued outcome: a random variable containing a single bit of information: success/yes/true/one (with probability $p$ ) or failure/no/false/zero (with probability $q = 1 − p$ ) My own data (viewable here ) deals with situations in which a favorite is playing an underdog in sports. I'm interested in whether a strategy of betting on the underdog should lose more money than a strategy on betting on the favorite, as theory would suggest . In this context I was encouraged in this comment to another question to model either the favorite or underdog data as binomial. Let's say I pick the favorite to model. Looking through my own data, I have 1434 trials in total, and so I guess for me $n=1434$ . Then I worked out that in those games the favorite won the game 1032 times, so for me $p = 0.72$ . However, I'm unsure on some deeper level what it means to model data as binomial. This is going to seem a hopelessly naive question, but I'm having trouble getting my intuition around this concept. In practical terms (either in general, or with reference to my particular situation) what does it mean to model data "as binomial", and how does it help?
