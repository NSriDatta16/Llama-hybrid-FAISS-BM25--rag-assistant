Writing past the array can be considered as an example of buffer overflow. You can do this how ever, but I don't know what you are trying to achieve by doing so. void aClass:: bufferOverflow() // Assuming this a member of aClass { for( int i=0; i Where does it live on the stack? Stack it self is a storage location. What do you mean by where it lives on stack.
