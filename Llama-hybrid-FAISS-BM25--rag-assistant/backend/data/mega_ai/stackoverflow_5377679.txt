When doing a cast conversion in Flex 4, can you cast convert "anything" to "anything?"

I'm building a custom component and I need to convert the event that is passed to the method into a mouse event. I can do this but it is telling me that I'm getting a null reference of an object. Here is how I am calling it. public function dragStart(e:MDIWindowEvent): void { var mouse:MouseEvent = (e.currentTarget as MouseEvent); trace(mouse.localX);// How can I go by converting the MDIWindowEvent to a MouseEvent? If I can at that.
