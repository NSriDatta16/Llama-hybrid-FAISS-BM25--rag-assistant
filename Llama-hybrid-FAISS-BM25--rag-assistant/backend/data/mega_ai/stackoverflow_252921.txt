Magento Custom Module. Redirect to another module and return to checkout

Magento shopping cart is built on the Zend Framework in PHP. This is the first time I've dealt with the Zend framework and I'm having the following difficulty... I'm creating a custom module that will allow users to upload images whenever they purchase products. I can overload the addAction() method whenever a user attempts to add a product to their cart. I can also create a custom module which presents the form to the user and accepts the file(s). However I'm not sure how to insert the code to run my module into my overloaded method: I suspect my difficulties come from my lack of knowledge of the Zend MVC way of doing things. I've studied all the Magento documentation/wikis/forum threads from top to bottom.
