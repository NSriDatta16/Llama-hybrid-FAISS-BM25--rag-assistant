Tracking two different user types with Google Analytics?

We've got a site with two types of users: Guests Registered users What we are looking for is a method to track both types of users within just one Google Analytics profile. We believe a registered user stays more in the site and has a higher page view count that a guest. Could this be possible within just one profile? Could there be a way to show custom reports in the profile page to show both user's average time and guests average time? I know Analytics is such a powerful application, but I'm no guru and I couldn't find anything on Google. Thanks. Bounty Update I know it has to do with filters. In your answer please share code and step-by-step instructions.
