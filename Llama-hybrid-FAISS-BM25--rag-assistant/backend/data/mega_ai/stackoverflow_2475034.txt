I hope I hope I'm misunderstanding what you wrote, but if by contain all the business logic in C# Web Services you mean something like this then you're already headed in the anti-pattern direction. Accessing your data from an ASP.NET application over web-services would just cause you to incur the serialization/deserialization penalty for pretty much no gain. A better approach would be to organize services you want to make available into a common layer that your applications are built on and access them directly from your ASP.NET application and maybe also expose them as Web Services to allow external sources to consume this data. You could also look into exposing data that is expensive to compute using a data warehouse that is updated at regular intervals (once or a couple of times/day). This would help with getting better read performance out of data (as long as you're willing to accept data being a bit stale). Is that the kind of information you're looking for?
