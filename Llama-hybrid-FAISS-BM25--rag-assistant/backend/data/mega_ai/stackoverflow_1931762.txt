Where is the "externalize strings" eclipse plug-in source code?

I need to look at "externalize strings" eclipse plug-in source code. I have to make a modified version of that functionality and don't want to start from scratch. I try to import the plug-in using File->Import->Plug-ins and Fragments, which I think is the right way to do it, but I don't have a clue of what is the name of the plug-in, and it has not an intuitive name (or at least I have not found it) :-/ Any ideas of what is the name of the plug-in or where else can I find the source code of that specific functionality? Thanks in advance
