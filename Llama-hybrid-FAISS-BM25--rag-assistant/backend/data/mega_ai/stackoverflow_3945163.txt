let rec f x = f (f x) This function never terminates, but it does have type 'a -> 'a . If we only allow total functions, the question becomes more interesting. Without using evil tricks, it's not possible to write a total function of type 'a -> 'a , but evil tricks are fun so: let f (x:'a):'a = Obj.magic 42 Obj.magic is an evil abomination of type 'a -> 'b which allows all kinds of shenanigans to circumvent the type system. On second thought that one isn't total either because it will crash when used with boxed types. So the real answer is: the identity function is the only total function of type 'a -> 'a .
