Is it possible to reverse-engineer a variable which has a moderation effect in a multiple regression, given the other variables?

I am interested in simulating a hypothetical variable Z which moderates the relationship between X (predictor) and Y (outcome variable), while controlling for C (covariate). All variables are continuous variables. This moderation effect is of theoretical interest and my ultimate goal is to use a machine learning model to predict the variable Z using some other data which I have collected. This would allow me to identify underlying patterns which moderate the X-Y relationship. I can use a two-step hierarchical multiple regression to establish whether a moderation effect exists. Step 1 = X + C, outcome = Y Step 2 = X + C + X*Z, outcome = Y If the X*Z interaction term is significant, then a moderation effect exists. If I already have X, Y, and C, is it possible to reverse-engineer or simulate the variable Z that would have a significant moderation effect in Step 2 of this model?
