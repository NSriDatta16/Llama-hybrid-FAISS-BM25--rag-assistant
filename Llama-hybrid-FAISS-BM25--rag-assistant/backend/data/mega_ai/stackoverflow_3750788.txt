HTML5 localStorage replace data to already existing key

I have the following localStorage key: localStorage.setItem(1, " value 1 other value "); Is it possible to replace, change only the second id, make the: value 1 other value turn into value 1 replaced value I do not want to delete this key and create a new one, just replace a part of it. Thank you.
