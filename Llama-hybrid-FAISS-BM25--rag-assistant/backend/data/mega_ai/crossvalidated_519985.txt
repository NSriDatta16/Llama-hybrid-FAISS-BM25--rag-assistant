The paragraph adresses the problem of multiple testing, and discusses why we cannot just do $p = 100$ individual hypothesis tests with $H_0: \beta_k = 0$ for each individual predictor at the significance level $\alpha = 0.05$ . Even if the null hypothesis is true there is still a chance that the specific $\hat{\beta}_k$ calculated from your sample leads to a rejection of $H_0$ . The probability of rejecting $H_0$ even if it is true is equal to your significance level. So, in the example from the paragraph with 100 hypothesis tests and a significance level of 5%, the expected number of rejections is $0.05 \times 100 = 5$ , even if all null hypotheses are true (assuming independence). And, as stated in the paragraph, the probability of observing at least one p-value below 0.05 is close to 1. If the multiple testing is not adjusted for, you will falsely conclude that there is evidence in your data at a 5% significance level of relation between predictor and response. The paragraph then suggest using the $F$ -statistic instead, and simultaneously test all $\beta_k$ 's.
