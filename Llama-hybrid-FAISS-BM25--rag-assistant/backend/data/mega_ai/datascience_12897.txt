recommendation system for eCommerce healthcare portal suggestion

I am trying to build a recommendation system. My system is basically a ecommerce application where our customers answers a bunch of questions related to healthcare (their basic health related question). Based on their ansers, we recommend some product. This process of recommendationis based of conventional rule base aapproach. Think of it as bunch of if-else condition. Now I am playing around with some machine learning technique nd want to see if this way will add any value in our healthcare system. I am at the very starting point and can use any suggestion from you guys. The suggestion could aim towards following: Any product that you feel which leverages ML technique with respect to health( considering HIPPA constraints ) Any product that you feel which leverages ML technique with respect to health What could be the first step towards building such a system.
