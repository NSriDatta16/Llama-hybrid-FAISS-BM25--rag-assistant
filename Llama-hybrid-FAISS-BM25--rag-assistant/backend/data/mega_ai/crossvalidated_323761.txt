The mean of means is not necessarily equal to the mean of the total population. E.g. if we have 2 subsets in the population one of size 5 (taking values 1,2,3,4,5) and one of size 2 (taking values 1,2), we would have the means $m_1$ of the first population subset and $m_2$ of the second subset. $m_1 = (1+2+3+4+5)/5 = 3$ $m_2 = (1+2)/2 = 3/2$ Taking the mean of the means $M = (3+3/2)/2 = 9/4$ however the total population mean is $M_{pop} = (1+1+2+2+3+4+5)/7 = 18/7$. Clearly $M \neq M_{pop}$, this is the case since we didn't take into account the sizes of the subpopulations. This can also happen in a more practical setting if these sizes are unknown and therefore it can be dangerous to take the mean of means. However if you are in luck and know the sizes of the subpopulations then a weighted average could solve this discrepancy. $M_{weighted} = \frac{5}{7}m_1+\frac{2}{7} m_2= 18/7$ So taking into account the right weights leads to $M_{weighted}= M_{pop}$.
