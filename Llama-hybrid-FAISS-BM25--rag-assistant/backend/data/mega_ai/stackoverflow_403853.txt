What happens when a user closes their browser waiting for a long running web service call?

I have a similar issue like here: http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/forums/en-US/biztalkgeneral/thread/87d5a6ec-04ee-4c6f-8267-f526ee105f0b I have an asp.net web page that calls a BizTalk web service. The BizTalk orchestration does its stuff and returns a response to the asp.net page. The process could take up to a minute or two. I get a lot of timeouts but it seems the BizTalk orchestration is returning within 30 seconds on average. I'm wondering, what happens if the user submits their request and then immediately closes their browser. Does the asp.net client stop waiting for BizTalk's request (and cause a timeout) or will it still wait for the request even if the user has closed their browser?
