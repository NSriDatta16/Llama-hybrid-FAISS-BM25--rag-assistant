"Text was truncated or one or more characters had no match in the target code page." may occur EVEN when: your source flat file is a UNICODE file AND your target column is defined as nvarchar(max). This took me a while to figure out. Cause SSIS infers data types in the source file from scanning the first N rows and making an educated guess. Due to endlessly repeated attempts to get it to work, it had parked the metadata for the data type (OutputColumnWidth) to 50 characters somewhere along the way, causing truncation internal to the package. Resolution Fiddling with the metadata in the Data Source's "Advanced" tab is then what you want to do to resolve the problem. Try to reset the whole thing by playing with the settings in "Suggest Types", or tweak settings on a field-by-field basis. A truly discouraging amount of iterations was needed in my case (broad input file), but eventually you can get it to work.
