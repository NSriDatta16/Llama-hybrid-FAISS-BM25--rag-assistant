"Typical time series models only depend on the time series data and not on external data." is not true unless you have no possible predictors. Time series analysis encompasses the utilization of both deterministic input series and stochastic input series. Additionally analysis can ferret out latent variables such as pulses, level shifts, seasonal pulses and time trends and particular time effects like day-of-the-month , week of the month , lead and lag effects of holiday/special effects. These models are generally referred to as transfer function models and sometimes as dynamic regression models and sometimes polynomial distributed lag models and sometime as autotregressive distributed lag models.
