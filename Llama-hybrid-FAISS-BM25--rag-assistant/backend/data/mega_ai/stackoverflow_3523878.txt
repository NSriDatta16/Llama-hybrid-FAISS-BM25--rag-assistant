Bugzilla displays browser data in the comments box after I submit a bug

I have recently been editing my bugzilla templates to create customised default text for comments boxes etc. Now when I commit a bug it seems to automatically add the browser details at the start of the comment in the edit page (comments section under the additional comments box). For example if I add the comment "Submitted by A.N. Other, bug needs to be fixed" The text in the comment list on the edit_bug page will read: "User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; en-US) AppleWebKit/533.4 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/5.0.375.126 Safari/533.4 Build Identifier: Submitted by A.N. Other, bug needs to be fixed Reproducible: Steps to reproduce" The extra text seems to be coming from comment-guided.txt.tmpl, I have checked comment.txt.tmpl and this still seems to have its original values. Does anyone have any suggestions as to whats causing this text to show up?
