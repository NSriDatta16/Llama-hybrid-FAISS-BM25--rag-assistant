Breakthrough/Cutting Edge Statistical Methods

I intend to deliver a short (1 hour) presentation to some interns and other staff (all of whom are quite statistically savvy, but are not statisticians -- mostly epidemiologists), on cutting edge statistical methods (especially if they are related to biostatistics, epidemiology/public health). I am hoping to provide a brief, non-technical overview of "cutting edge" methods. I am seeking any suggestions on topics that you think might be important to mention in this presentation. I'm looking for methods that may be quite familiar to statisticians, yet may not be to some graduate students with an epidemiology background for example. "Cutting edge" is also being loosely used here, since I intend to provide a brief overview of things like bootstrap and bootstrap aggregating techniques for variable selection and bootstrapping has been around for decades. It's just so important and might be familiar to these students, so I figured I'd include it. I also intend to present on propensity score analysis, a few machine learning techniques, etc. So my question is, if you had to deliver a similar presentation, what other methods/techniques might you present given the audience and time constraint of 1 hour (my last slide might be a simple list of other important techniques we don't have time to cover, but that might be of interest to the students).
