TeamViewer from http://www.teamviewer.com/ works very well. We use it for pair programming between London and Ukraine. Notes: We use Skype for voice. TeamViewer uses extremely low bandwidth - 4kbyte/sec on average for programming in Visual Studio 2008 @ 1024x768 resolution. Can swap roles from hotseat to viewer with a button. The remote view of the screen can be resized to fit in a smaller area with no loss in usability.
