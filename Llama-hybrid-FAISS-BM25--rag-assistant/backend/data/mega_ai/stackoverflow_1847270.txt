What's wrong with DCOM?

There seems to be a lot of enmity against DCOM, and I'm curious to understand why. For a company still writing to the Win32 SKD using C++, is there any real reason not to use DCOM in current or future development? Is some future version of Windows not going to support it? Is it too fragile and fails to work often? Is it too complicated to implement compared to other technologies? What's the deal?
