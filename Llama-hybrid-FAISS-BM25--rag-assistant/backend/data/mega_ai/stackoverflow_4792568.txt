Preloading huge amount of images

I'm trying to do a parallel preload of images using the logic implemented on the below link. http://blog.lieldulev.com/2010/05/21/parallel-image-preloading-in-js/ I have a huge amount of images, currently 350+ images with an average of 50KB file size each, amounting to a total of 20MB of images im trying to preload. I need the images for canvas drawing. Using the above logic of parallel downloading, I'm having issues of the browser waiting for 2mins to finish loading the whole page. sometimes, it stops the script. By the way, 20MB of images is currently the conservative amount of images. some set of images I need to preload my go to as much as 80MB!! Is it even practical to preload such an amount of images? And if i need to preload, What is the best approach to my requirement? Should i do non-parallel? How about partial preload? Thank you in advance Marv
