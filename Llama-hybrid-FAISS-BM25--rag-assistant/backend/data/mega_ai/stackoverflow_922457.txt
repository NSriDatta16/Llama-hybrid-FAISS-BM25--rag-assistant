If want to display this composite value as a string, then bind "Display Pattern 1" of a text field to the width property and "Display Pattern 2" (shown when you bind Display Pattern 1) to the height property. In the Display Pattern 1 binding, set the "Display Pattern" to %{value1}@ x %{value2}@ (yes, slightly unintuitive syntax). This will give a text field that displays "[width] x [height]" and will update on changes in either property. You can do the same with an NSTextFieldCell , e.g. as the cell in an NSTableColumn . The downside of this method is that the text field will not be able to edit the bound width and height values. You would have to write an NSValueTransformer if you need to be able to edit them.
