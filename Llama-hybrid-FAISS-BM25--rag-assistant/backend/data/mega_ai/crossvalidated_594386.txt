I can speak to the reality of sampling versus best practice from my job experience working in a corporate marketing business unit. I have been part of projects that create samples for marketing surveys and for experiments testing changes to pricing and procedures. Your first question is whether we constructed multiple samples or a single sample to calculate distribution: the short answer is yes because software has made this super simple if you have the data clean and accessible. For most purposes, sales data was the response variable of choice and it was in the company's best interest to keep that data clean and accessible. We used proprietary software and created a Shiny R dashboard that was pulling multiple samples from the "population" every time we needed a distribution to compare to our experiment sample. For surveys, which are costly no matter if you have one-off focused surveys versus constantly "on" surveys, we would not collect multiple samples. It's actually infuriating how often myself or anyone from data science would bring up bias and attempt to produce examples of well-balanced samples but for reasons usually due to time and money, the biased and skewed samples were deemed good enough.
