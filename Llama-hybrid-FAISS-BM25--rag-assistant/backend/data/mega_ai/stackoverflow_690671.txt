Is JavaScript ready for visualizing large datasets?

We've got some data (10-50 columns, hundreds of thousands of rows) that we usually visualize in Excel as a line graph or stacked bar chart. Users want to be able to zoom in and out of the graph to get down to the individual samples, but these kind of operations really bring Excel to its knees. I'm thinking about embedding the data into an HTML page, with inline JavaScript to handle the visualization in the browser. Something like the flotr JS charting lib would be leveraged for the charts. Is this a stupid idea? Is the browser ready for this kind of load? Is this a solved problem that I just should have googled more thoroughly before asking?
