I agree on needing two fields status and number (so I agree with KM and Scott ) The reasons included that if you have anything but numbers from the spreadsheet (this includes your -1 and also NULLs) then aggregate functions like SUM and average will not give correct answers. Having an extra field to give the status whose values include missing, N/A and numeric for when you have a number allows you to be able to query for these statuses. Using NULL is not myuch use here as it would not differentiate between the missing and N/A values
