WCF - How to send GUIDs efficiently (not as strings)

I have a collection containing a LOT of Data Transfer Objects that I need to send to a Silverlight client over WCF. I'm using the default DataContractSerializer and an HTTPS channel. Here's an example of one type of DTO. [DataContract(Namespace = Constants.OrgStructureNamespace)] public class EntityInfo : IExtensibleDataObject { [DataMember] public Guid EntityID { get; set; } [DataMember] public EntityType EntityType { get; set; } [DataMember] public IList EntityVersions { get; set; } [DataMember] public IList OrganisationStructures { get; set; } #region IExtensibleDataObject Members ... #endregion } The domain entities on the server side use GUIDs as primary keys. These get serialized to strings which are 36 bytes long. A GUID in binary form should only be 16 bytes long. Is there a trick to get the DataContractSerializer serialize my GUIDs as binary rather than as the verbose strings to increase performance?
