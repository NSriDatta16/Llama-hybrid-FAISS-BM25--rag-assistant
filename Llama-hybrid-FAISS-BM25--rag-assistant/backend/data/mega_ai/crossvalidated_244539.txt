If you are interested in the variability of the cdf of your random variable, probably that would be sufficient (depending on your question). This assumes some degree of stationarity. However, note that the time points are likely not indepedent, but are rather serially correlated (you can test this by plotting the acf). Maybe read here for some ways to address that: Most appropriate way to make a time series stationary? (i.e. remove serial correlation?)
