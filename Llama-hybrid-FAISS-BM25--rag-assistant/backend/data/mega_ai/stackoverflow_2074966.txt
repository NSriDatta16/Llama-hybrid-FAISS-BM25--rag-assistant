Detecting when a user is finished resizing SWT shell

I've got an SWT shell that's resizable. Every time it is resized, I have to do something computationally intensive. I can register a ControlListener on my shell, but this generates events continuously throughout the resize operation, and I have no idea when a resize drag type mouse operation ends. I'd like to be able to detect when the user is finished resizing the shell and then initiate my computationally intensive operation. Any ideas how to go about that?
