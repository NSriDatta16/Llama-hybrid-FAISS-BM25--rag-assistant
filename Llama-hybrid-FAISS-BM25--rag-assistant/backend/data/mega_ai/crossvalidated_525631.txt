So let's start by breaking down the formula for confidence intervals (CIs), Let's consider this in a little more generality then in your question. Let's say we want a confidence interval for an estimator of some parameter of the population, $\hat\theta$ (this could be the sample mean, or a regression coefficient, etc.). The population (true) parameter will be $\theta_0$ . The CI is given by $$[\hat\theta - c/\sqrt{n}, \hat\theta + c/\sqrt{n}]$$ $c$ is a critical value that we need to choose so that the CI will include $\theta_0$ with probability $1-\alpha$ . This is our significance level. Setting $\alpha = 0.05$ is where you get that 95% figure. So what we want is that, $$\Pr[\theta_0 \in [\hat\theta - c/\sqrt{n}, \hat\theta + c/\sqrt{n}]] = 1-\alpha$$ We can rewrite this probability as, $$\Pr[\sqrt{n}|\hat\theta - \theta_0|\leq c]$$ This is easy to see just subtract out $\hat\theta$ from the upper and lower bounds and multiply by $\sqrt{n}$ . Now I am not sure how much statistics that you have but $\sqrt{n}|\hat\theta-\theta_0|$ is a very common expression. In many estimators, this will have an asymptotic distribution that can be proven to be normal using the CLT. Given this normal asymptotic distribution, we can use what we know about normal distributions to pick a $c$ in which we have $1-\alpha$ coverage. To see this in action let's go back to your example of normal means. Let's let ${X_1, \dots, X_n}\sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)$ and iid. Let us assume both the mean and $\sigma^2$ are known for simplicity. Then $\hat\theta=\bar X_n$ or the sample mean. Then we have, $$\Pr[\frac{|\bar X_n - \mu|}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}\leq c/\sigma] = \Pr[|Z|\leq \frac{c}{\sigma}]$$ To see that notice that all we did was divide by $n$ and $\sigma$ on both sides (noticing both are positive). Now we immediately know that $\frac{|\bar X_n - \mu|}{\sigma \sqrt{n}}$ is a z-score and is distributed normal and so we replace it with $Z\sim N(0,1)$ . In other cases we will use the fact $\sqrt{n}{(\hat\theta-\theta)}\to^d N(0,V)$ to do the same thing. Now that we are this far all we need to do is invert the test and determine what $c$ should be for our desired confidence value. That is we want to find $z_\alpha$ such that, $$\Pr[Z\leq z_\alpha]=\alpha$$ To do this we need to look at the inverse of the normal pdf which is what you do when you look through a Z-table. Once we find this value we can set $c/\sigma=\sigma z_{1-\alpha/2}$ (two-sided stat). To get the confidence set, $$[\bar X_n - \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}z_{1-\alpha/2}, \bar X_n + \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}z_{1-\alpha/2}]$$ which will have $1-\alpha$ coverage. So to wrap up this is where the normal approximation is coming from and how the CLT is used. You will notice we never replaced the population mean (parameter) with the sample mean (parameter). Rather we just found a region around the sample parameter for which we can be sure (to a $1-\alpha$ level of confidence) that the population parameter lives in using our normal approximation.
