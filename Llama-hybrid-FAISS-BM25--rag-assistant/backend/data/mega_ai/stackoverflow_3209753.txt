Your site has probably been compromised by an attacker. This sort of thing can happen if you have any folders that are world-writable (check your folder permissions). Also check for new files that weren't there before (they could be named anything and could be in any folder within the site's root folder). For some more info on similar attacks, see: http://forums.techguy.org/virus-other-malware-removal/871970-strange-b1-html-tag-embedding.html and http://www.phpfreaks.com/forums/index.php/topic,274404.msg1297647.html#msg1297647
