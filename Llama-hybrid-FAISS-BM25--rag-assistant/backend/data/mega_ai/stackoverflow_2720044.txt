Well, I am not going to paste in a lot of code here, but this is how I do that: I keep a spatial index (rtree) where I insert all my objects. It is much faster to obtain list of items intersecting with a given one. I have a class that is also my scrollview's delegate. And every time scrollViewDidScroll: gets called I obtain visibleRect of the my content view, then using rtree index quickly locate items that are in the rect, and draw accordingly. You would only have to decide which image is "in the middle" in case yours are small, and there might be 4 fitting in the visible rectangle of the scroll view. Hope that helps, Robert
