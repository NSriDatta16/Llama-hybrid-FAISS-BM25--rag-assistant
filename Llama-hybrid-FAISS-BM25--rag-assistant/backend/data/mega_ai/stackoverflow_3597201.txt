Not sure about this but I think that you will need to create a class and project into that. This is how I would start by approaching it class UserStatistics{ MaxPrice {get; set;} CountAll {get; set;} } var list = OpenSession() .CreateQuery("SELECT MAX(p.price) as max_price, COUNT(p.id) as count_all FROM Order o left join o.Products p") .SetResultTransformer(NHibernate.Transform.Transformers.AliasToBean(typeof(UserStatistics))) .List (); then it should be a matter of Console.WriteLine(list[0].MaxPrice); Console.WriteLine(list[0].CountAll); Great Post explaining better.
