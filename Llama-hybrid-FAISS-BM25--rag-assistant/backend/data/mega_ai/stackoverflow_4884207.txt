If you feel the first form is cleaner/more elegant/more readable, then why not just stick with it? First, read this recent commit message to the Scala compiler from none other than Martin Odersky and take it to heart... Perhaps the real issue here is instantly jumping the gun on claiming it's sub-optimal. The JVM is pretty hot at optimising this sort of thing. At times, it's just plain amazing! Assuming you have a genuine performance issue in an application that's in genuine need of a speed up, you should start with a profiler report proving that this is a significant bottleneck, on a suitably configured and warmed up JVM. Then, and only then, should you look at ways to make it faster that may end up sacrificing code clarity.
