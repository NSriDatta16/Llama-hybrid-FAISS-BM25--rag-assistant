Deep Learning for non-continuous dataset

I am working with this dataset which is record of student academic details and I want to predict the student's performance. since the dataset is non-continuous I cannot apply CNN on this dataset. How can I apply Deep learning on this kind(non-continuous) of dataset. I searched online but could not find anything relevant Thank you!!
