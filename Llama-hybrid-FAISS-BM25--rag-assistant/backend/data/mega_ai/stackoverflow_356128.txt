Can I extend a class using more than 1 class in PHP?

If I have several classes with functions that I need but want to store separately for organisation, can I extend a class to have both? i.e. class a extends b extends c edit: I know how to extend classes one at a time, but I'm looking for a method to instantly extend a class using multiple base classes - AFAIK you can't do this in PHP but there should be ways around it without resorting to class c extends b , class b extends a
