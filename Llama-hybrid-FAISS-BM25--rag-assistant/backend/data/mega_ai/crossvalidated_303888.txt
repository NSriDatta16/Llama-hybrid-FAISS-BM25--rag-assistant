Group multiple transport orders to a tour and assign it to available vehicles based on previous behavior

It's difficult to say what I want to achieve in just a title. I hope it's not too misleading. If someone knows a better title, feel free to edit it. What I want to do is grouping multiple transport orders for tour planning in logistics and assign those groups to some vehicle. So I think I need to classify the vehicles based on for example their current location, the time the driver is allowed to drive, the space on the vehicle and so on. Next I need to group my transport orders to k tours where k is the number of available vehicles so that every vehicle has just as many transport orders as it can handle. The grouping maybe considers something like "who is the customer"(priority), "where is the freight shipped from", "where should it be shipped to" and so on. Update: I don't want to find the (nearly) optimal solution by solving the tsp, but the solution the human would have chosen like he did before. Therefore I have to learn from previous data instead of optimizing it. Can anyone point me into a direction of one or more algorithms to look at? Is there maybe an alternative to classification? I have excluded Reinforcement Learning since the set of states is unlimited due to additional transport orders in the future. Or is there some method that can handle this? The Reinforcment Learning techniques I've seen so far do only work in a markov space. I have a lot of data available to learn from: About 2 million planned tours with their corresponding transport orders and the assigned vehicles.
