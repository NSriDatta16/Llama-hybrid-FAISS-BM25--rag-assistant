How to analyze which site has most numbers

I am trying to determine which site in our organization is in greater need of upgrades to SEP 12, so when I run a query to count, I get these type of numbers Group Windows_SEP_11 Mac_SEP_11 Windows_SEP_12 Mac_SEP_12 Arizona\A 417 29 219 6 Arizona\B 380 20 282 15 Arizona\C 340 30 383 507 Arizona\D 310 104 186 857 Arizona\E 307 74 403 243 Arizona\F 285 171 522 14 Arizona\G 269 1 559 41 However, when I find percentages, I get these numbers Group Win_Sep_11_% Mac_SEP_11_% Windows_SEP_12_% Mac_SEP_12_% Boston/Site 1 100 0 0 0 Boston/Site 2 100 0 0 0 Boston/Site 3 94 0 0 5 And obviously, percentage isn't good indicator because Boston/Site 1 has only 3 computers, Boston/Site 2 only has 4 computers, etc. What is the best way to analyze data? I ultimately need a visual of sites that have many computers, and a great need for upgrades to SEP 12, i.e. if there are more computers with SEP 11 than SEP 12. Please point me in the right direction.
