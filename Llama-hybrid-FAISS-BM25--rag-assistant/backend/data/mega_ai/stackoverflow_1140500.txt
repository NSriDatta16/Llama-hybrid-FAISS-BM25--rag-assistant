Auto redirect to URL returned in XML?

Is there a way to automatically go to a URL returned via XML from an API call? For instance I call and it returns the XML file that I parse with simple_xml_load() and then I create a link like so, links->homedetails . "?scrnnm=Nexus-Software'>". $title->address->street . " But I do not want the user to have to click, is there a way to have the page automatically go to that returned link after submitting the form?
