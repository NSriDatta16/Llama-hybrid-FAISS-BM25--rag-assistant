Not elegantly... BUT YOU COULD FAKE IT ! 1) Drink enough to convince yourself this is a good idea (it'll take a lot) 2) Replace all your variables with variable variables: $a = 10 //becomes $a = '0a'; $$a = 10; 3) Reference $$a in all your code. 4) When you need to print the variable, print $a and strip out the leading 0. Addendum: Only do this if you are Never showing this code to anyone Never need to change or maintain this code Are crazy Not doing this for a job Look, just never do this, it is a joke
