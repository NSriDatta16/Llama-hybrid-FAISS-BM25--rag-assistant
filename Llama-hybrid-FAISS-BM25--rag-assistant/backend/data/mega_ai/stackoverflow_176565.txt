Just to clear up... or sum up... nchar and nvarchar can store Unicode characters. char and varchar cannot store Unicode characters. char and nchar are fixed-length which will reserve storage space for number of characters you specify even if you don't use up all that space. varchar and nvarchar are variable-length which will only use up spaces for the characters you store. It will not reserve storage like char or nchar . nchar and nvarchar will take up twice as much storage space, so it may be wise to use them only if you need Unicode support.
