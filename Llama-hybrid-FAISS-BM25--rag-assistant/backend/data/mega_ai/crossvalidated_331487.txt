My friend if you want to detect relations between datasets you must certainly use self organizing maps. which are also unsupervised nn.Now i can not tell you how you achieve that but there is a book you can check out MATLAB Implementations and Applications of the Self-Organizing Map by Teuvo Kohonen The Self-Organizing Map (SOM) is a data-analysis method that visualizes similarity relations in a set of data items. The meaning often given to automated data mining is that the method is able to discover new, unexpected and surprising results. Even in this book I have tried to collect simple experiments, in which something quite unexpected will show up. Consider, for instance, in which we find that the ferromagnetic metals are mapped to a tight cluster; this result was not expected, but the data analysis suggested that the nonmagnetic properties of the metals must have a very strong correlation with the magnetic ones! PLease if this is usefull for you mark my answer even it is not a full solition. I need points and i have only few ...
