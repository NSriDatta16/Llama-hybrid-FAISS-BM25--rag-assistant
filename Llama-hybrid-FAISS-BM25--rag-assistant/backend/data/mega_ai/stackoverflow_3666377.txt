I know it's kinda old question but because problem still exists and many sites still expose it's passenger and nginx version I give answer which works very well for me. The same solution applies to X-Runtime header. Just install 3rd party ngx_headers_more: http://github.com/agentzh/headers-more-nginx-module (you have to rebuild it from source). Add to your config (I created /etc/nginx/conf.d/security.conf for it): server_tokens off; more_clear_headers 'Server' 'X-Powered-By' 'X-Runtime';
