Connection between Hidden Markov models and logistic regression?

This question is inspired by a comment below this question on Hidden Markov models: "Have you considered logistic regression? For non longitudinal data, they are practically the same thing." My question What is the exact connection between Hidden Markov Models and logistic regression? How can this connection be shown (perhaps also intuitively)? And when to use which and why?
