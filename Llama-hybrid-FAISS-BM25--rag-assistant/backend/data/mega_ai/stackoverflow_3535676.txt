How to rename a directory in Mercurial and continue to track all file changes

I decided to rename some directories in my home/hobby Python package ( doc to docs , test to tests , util to utils ) because, now that I've thought more about it, I think the new names are more appropriate. My general thinking now is that if containers are named after their contents their names should be plural nouns. Now that I'm ready for my next hg commit I'm wondering how to tell Mercurial about these directory name changes. I am new to RCS software in general and have only been using Mercurial for a couple months. When I run hg status it shows all the the files in these directories being removed and added, so I'm afraid if I just do a hg addremove I will loose all the change history for the files in these directories, or at the very least the change history will become fragmented and untraceable. I've come across the hg rename command, but the docs only discuss its use for individual files, not directories. After further reading in Bryan O'Sullivan's 'Definitive Guide' it appears that maybe rename can refer to directories. So here's what I've decided to try: hg rename --after doc docs hg rename --after test tests hg rename --after util utils hg status hg addremove Can anyone tell me if this is the accepted and preferred method for renaming directories in Mercurial, and if not, how should I do it.
