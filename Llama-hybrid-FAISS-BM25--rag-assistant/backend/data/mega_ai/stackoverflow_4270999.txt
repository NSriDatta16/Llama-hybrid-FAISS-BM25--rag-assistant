Google Chrome --allow-file-access-from-files disabled for Chrome Beta 8

I have been developing an AJAX application using jQuery and Microsoft Seadragon technology. I need to have access to the html5 canvas function toDataURL. With Google Chrome, the same origin rule applies to this function which means that a page run locally (with the file:/// in the URL) failed to satisfy the same origin rule and an exception is thrown. With Chrome 7, starting the application with --allow-file-access-from-files option, allows to call canvas.toDataURL() from local files. However, it seems that starting the Chrome Beta 8 with the same option ( --allow-file-access-from-files ) does not allow the call canvas.toDataURL() on the local file. Does Chrome gave up on the --allow-file-access-from-files option or it has just been disabled since it is a Beta release and not a full release? Thanks!
