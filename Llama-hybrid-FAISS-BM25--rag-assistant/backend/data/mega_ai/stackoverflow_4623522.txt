To complement Kyle's answer: OrderedDictionary allows retrieval by key and index (it uses a hashtable and and array internally) but has a bigger overhead per item ListDictionary has a linked list as its internal structure, it does not perform well for insertion and retrieval by key but preserves the original insert order HybridDictionary is a ListDictionary if the dictionary does not contain many items and converts to a Hashtable if the number of items reaches a speficic limit (I personally think you should use Dictionary instead of it since C#2)
