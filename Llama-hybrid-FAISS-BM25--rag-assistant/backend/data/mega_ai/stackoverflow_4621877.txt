Is it a bad idea do divide the models into directories?

I have a over 100 models in my rails application, and just for organization, I'm dividing them into folders, all still under the main model folder, just to make it simpler to navigate on the project and see files that are related. Is this a bad idea? What is the rails way to do this?
