It is generally best practice to perform all feature engineering before applying classifiers. The two primary reasons are: Simplicity - If feature engineering is conditional on model performance then it is harder to find and debug edge cases. Handle of sample issues - Especially in text, there are novel examples (e.g., words that appear during prediction that do not appear during training). Applying feature engineering to as much as possible increases the robustness of the transforms.
