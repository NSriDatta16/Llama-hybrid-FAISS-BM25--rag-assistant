unit testing - per test code coverage for java

We use use junit for unit testing our java code. Today we use cobertura to get coverage numbers. It does not have an easy way of getting per test coverage number. Is there a tool to get per test code coverage - commercial/free? (cobertura has a patch to get per test coverage numbers, out of date with latest cobertura).
