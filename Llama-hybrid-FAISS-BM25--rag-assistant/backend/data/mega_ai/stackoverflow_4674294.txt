How should the system construct the domain object from dto after user submits the data back for validation? By retrieving it from the Repository/persistent storage. Should we use a factory or let the mapper/assembler construct the Domain object from DTO? Neither. If we use mapper to construct the domain object from dto then it break the factory rule :( Factory is the wrong thing to use. Factory is responsible for beginning an entity's lifetime. In your described scenario (as I understand it), you already have an entity that exists. It's lifetime has already begun. Retrieve it from your Repository, don't create another one. If we use the factory once again wont it recreate a new Application# for the domain object? Probably, which, again, is why Factory is the wrong piece to use here. I do have a question about your process here. You said: Prior to loading the TEST form a. Service Layer requests the TEST Application Factory to create a domain object b. Factory initializes an application # and other nested objects c. Factory returns the domain object d. Service takes help of an Assembler to create a DTO and return to the Presentation Layer But what that means is that you are creating a domain entity when a user views a page. That seems quite wrong. I guess I have trouble seeing how a request to GET a page should be considered a request to create a domain entity?
