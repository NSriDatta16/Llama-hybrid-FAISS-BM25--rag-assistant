Making a .NET 2.0 Windows Form Application backward compatible with .NET 1.1

I have created a Windows Form Application using Visual C# 2008 Express Edition with target as .NET 2.0. Now I need to build this project for .NET 1.1. The problem I am facing is that the designer classes are not supported in .NET 1.1. They use the partial keyword which is not supported in .NET 1.1. What steps do I need to follow to make my project backward compatible for .NET 1.1.? I would like to keep my .NET 2.0 project so that I can edit using the designer but during build time would like to convert to 1.1. Please let me know whats the easiest way to do this. Regards, Jagannath
