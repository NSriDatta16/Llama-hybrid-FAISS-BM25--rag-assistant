Store front-end features in Rails?

In the public folder we have stylesheets, javascripts and images. I want to add a front-end feature that has it's own css, js and images, but according to this hierarchy i have to store them like this: stylesheets/calendar/main.css javascripts/calendar/cal.js javascripts/calendar/cal2.js images/calendar/front.jpg images/calendar/button1.jpg images/calendar/button2.jpg images/calendar/button3.jpg I don't like that I split the feature up at all. Is there a way to organize files per feature instead? calendar/stylesheets/main.css calendar/javascripts/cal.js calendar/javascripts/cal2.js calendar/images/front.jpg calendar/images/button1.jpg calendar/images/button2.jpg calendar/images/button3.jpg That would be a better structure, following OOP pattern.
