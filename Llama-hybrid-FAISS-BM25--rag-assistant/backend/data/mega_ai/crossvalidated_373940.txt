For simplicity, let us assume that by "continuous sample space" you mean the real line $\mathbb R$ . The corresponding probability space is $(\Omega, \mathcal F, P)$ where $\mathcal F$ is the $\sigma$ -algebra of events defined on $\Omega$ and $P$ is the probability measure that specifies the probability of each event in the $\sigma$ -algebra. For the sample space $\mathbb R$ , one can take the $\sigma$ -algebra to be generated the intervals $(-\infty, x]$ and use any continuous nondecreasing function $F$ with limiting values $0$ as $x\to -\infty$ and value $1$ as $x \to \infty$ to define the probability of $(-\infty, x]$ to be $F(x)$ . If the highlighted paragraph above is gobbledygook to you, just ignore it, and concentrate on what follows next. It is straightforward to define a discrete random variable on this sample space $\Omega = \mathbb R$ . For example, one could define a discrete random variable $X$ as one that maps the outcome $\omega \in \Omega$ (this outcome is a just an ordinary real number) to $1$ if $\omega \leq 0$ and to $0$ if $\omega > 0$ . $X$ is then just a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p= P(\omega \leq 0)$ . The gobbledygook in the highlighted paragraph above just says that it makes sense to talk about the probability that the outcome $\omega$ is no larger than $0$ , or more generally, the probability that the outcome $\omega$ is no larger than a specified real number $x$ , and that this probability $P(\omega \leq x)$ is just the value of the function $F$ at $x$ . In whuber's answer, he has chosen $F$ to be $\Phi$ , the cumulative probability distribution function (CDF) of the standard normal random variable.
