$\eta(t)$ is a random process, its value at each time instant is a random variable, e.g. $\eta(t_1), \eta(t_2)$ etc. are all random variables. And, in general, they're different random variables. When you calculate the expected value for each of these variables, you get the mean process , i.e. combine $\mu_{\eta}(t_i)=E[\eta(t_i)]$ into $E[\eta(t)]=\mu_{\eta}(t)$ , which is another random process. In general, an estimation for the mean process is obtained via averaging across the process' realizations, not time-averaging across one realization, which gives . you only one value. When the process is assumed to be constant mean because it is stationary (or wide-sense stationary - WSS), or for some other reason, $\mu(t)=\mu$ . When the process is mean-ergodic , you approach $\mu$ if you take the time average of one sufficiently long realization, which saves you from creating several realizations. Of course, this is the theoretical aspect. In real world problems, you have to really know it or assume it (i.e. ergodicity, stationarity etc.). For the average surface elevation , you actually need to specify which average you're talking about before making any calculations and know what you get. If your process is constant mean and mean-ergodic, you'll get an accurate representation of $\hat{\mu}$ when you double average, or just take one long realization and apply just time-averaging. When you don't have constant mean, first obtain the mean process from realizations, and then decide if you really want to see the time-average of it. Discussion follows similarly for $\sigma^2$ (stationarity, ergodicity etc.).
