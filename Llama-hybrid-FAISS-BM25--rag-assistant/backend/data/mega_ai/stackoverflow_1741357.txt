Getting AJAX content into the DOM or registering an object with jQuery via an onClick event?

I have a code setup something like below, the image is part of a block of HTML and is being loaded with AJAX so I can't get a direct handle on it using it's class or id, so I'm passing the object into a function and then picking it up with jQuery from there. I don't like this method, is there any way of registering the image ( or preferably the whole HTML block ) with the DOM so I can get a direct handle on it with jQuery and be able to do something like $(".img").click(function(){}); or is there a more elegant way of doing what I'm trying to do below: My HTML Page: My JS page: function vote(object) { //alert('voted'); $(object).css('display','none'); } Edit: Thanks everyone who answered, +1 to all. I'm not sure who said it first, but it solved everything.
