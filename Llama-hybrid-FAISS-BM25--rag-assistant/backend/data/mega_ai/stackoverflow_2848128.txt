First of all I can forward you the my old answer Setting the content-type of requests performed by jQuery jqGrid . It shows how the ajax request looks like inside of jqGrid. So you should use ajaxGridOptions parameter of jqGrid instead of overwriting global settings with respect of $.ajaxSetup . Moreover in the same answer you can see how you serializeGridData parameter of jqGrid can be used to make your custom serialization. In How do I build a JSON object to send to an AJAX WebService? you can read how should JSON encoding of parameters look like. If you will stay have problem with using serializeGridData and ajaxGridOptions you should include in your question the code fragment of using jqGrid and the prototype of your server's method of the web service which you use.
