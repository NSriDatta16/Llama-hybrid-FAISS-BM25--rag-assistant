Is it possible to decompose fitted residuals into bias and variance, after fitting a linear model?

I'd like to classify data points as either needing a more complex model, or not needing a more complex model. My current thinking is to fit all the data to a simple linear model, and observe the size of the residuals to make this classification. I then did some reading about the bias and variance contributions to error, and realized that if I could calculate bias directly, it might be a better measure then working with the total error (residual or standardized residual). Is it possible to estimate bias directly with a linear model? With or without test data? Would cross validation help here? If not, can one use an averaged bootstrapping ensemble of linear models (I think it's called bagging) to approximate bias?
