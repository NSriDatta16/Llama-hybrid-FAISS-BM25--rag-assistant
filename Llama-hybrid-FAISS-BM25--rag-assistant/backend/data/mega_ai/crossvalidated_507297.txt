If you want to sample random correlation matrices from an empirical distribution, you can try to use generative models from machine learning to do that. One such example is CorrGAN: Sampling Realistic Financial Correlation Matrices Using Generative Adversarial Networks The basic idea is to fit generative adversarial networks (or variational autoencoders) to a set of empirical correlation matrices (having certain properties that are hard to capture/generate mathematically). Then, you can use these models to sample as much random correlation matrices as you want that verify the properties of the empirical ones. Depending on which networks you use, you may want to project the output (which may be not totally PSD) onto the set of correlation matrices ( with the Higham projection for example ).
