Statistical tests to be used as a basis for exclusion: standardised residuals leverage statistics Cook's distance, which is a combination of the two above. From experience, exclusion should be limited to instances of incorrect data entry. Reweighting outliers in the linear regression model is a very good compromise method. The application of this in R is offered by Rob. A great example is here . If exclusion is necessary, 'one rule of thumb' relates to Dfbeta statistics (measures change in the estimate when the outlier is deleted), such that if the absolute value of the DfBeta statistic exceeds 2/sqrt(n) then that substantiates removal of the outlier.
