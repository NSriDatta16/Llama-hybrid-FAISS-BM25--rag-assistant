The � is because new_user.php is an ISO-8859-1 file. XMLHttpRequest , which is used to fetch the page, defaults to UTF-8. Since XMLHttpRequest doesn't know about HTML, it will ignore the tag you have used to declare that encoding, and continue to use UTF-8, resulting in the failure to read the é encoded as a single non-UTF-8 byte. You should either have your script send back a real header('Content-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1'); , which both the browser's HTML parser and XMLHttpRequest can understand, or — probably better — just use UTF-8 for your entire site. Then you can send any Unicode character back and forth, not just a few accented letters from Latin-1. The styling looks OK to me. The only difference I can see is the lack of font replacement on the newly-loaded content. That happens because the font replacement stuff is only run at page load time. You could call Cufon.replace('h2'); after loading the new page to do the replacement again on the new heading, or maybe consider @font-face embedding, which is starting to take over this kind of thing.
