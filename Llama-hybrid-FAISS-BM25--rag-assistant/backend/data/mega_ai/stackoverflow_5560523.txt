NoSql With My Own Custom Binary Files?

Originally, I had to deal with just 1.5[TB] of data. Since I just needed fast write/reads (without any SQL), I designed my own flat binary file format (implemented using python ) and easily (and happily) saved my data and manipulated it on one machine. Of course, for backup purposes, I added 2 machines to be used as exact mirrors (using rsync ). Presently, my needs are growing, and there's a need to build a solution that would successfully scale up to 20[TB] (and even more) of data. I would be happy to continue using my flat file format for storage . It is fast, reliable and gives me everything I need. The thing I am concerned about is replication, data consistency etc (as obviously, data will have to be distributed -- not all data can be stored on one machine ) across the network. Are there any ready-made solutions ( Linux / python based ) that would allow me to keep using my file format for storage, yet would handle the other components that NoSql solutions normally provide? (data consistency / availability / easy replication)? basically, all I want to make sure is that my binary files are consistent throughout my network. I am using a network of 60 core-duo machines (each with 1GB RAM and 1.5TB disk )
