I am also relatively new to Bayesian Belief Networks (BBNs) and have tried to answer this myself. Without having data to work with, I thought it was worthwhile to mention M Lappenschaar et al. as a useful reference. Although you may have already come across this article, it has a great overview of the need for multilevel considerations in BBNs, with good examples. Based upon this paper, I believe you answered your own question, which is the structure of the DAG is important to ensure the multilevel aspect is considered. From the paper: "the BN is constrained in the sense that no edges exist from a lower-level variable to a higher-level variable", which you can see in the images below. Based upon this information, I believe you can likely implement the BBN of your choosing using bnlearn (in fact, the authors of this paper used bnlearn ), you just need to constrain the arcs as is specific to your application.
