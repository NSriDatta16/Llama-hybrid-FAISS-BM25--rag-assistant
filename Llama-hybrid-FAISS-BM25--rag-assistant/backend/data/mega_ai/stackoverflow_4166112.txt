There is an extremely comprehensive API for Wikipedia, and it has been covered before on stackoverflow: How to use wikipedia api if it exists? As for the question about a class/library specifically to leverage the API for CodeIgniter, there is none to my knowledge. However with that said there is very little need for any sort of libraries to leverage the API as you can use built in functions such as http_build_url to make API requests and the request can be returned in any format you desire: json, jsonfm, php, phpfm, wddx, wddxfm, xml, xmlfm, yaml, yamlfm, rawfm, txt, txtfm, dbg, dbgfm
