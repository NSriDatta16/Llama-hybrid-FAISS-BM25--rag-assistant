Pass sub report fields to another sub report?

I have a pretty complex report. I have managed to create it up till the 1st sub report. Now I have to summarize the 1st sub report's fields inside a 2nd subreport ' horizontally '. 1) How do I pass the fields from sub report 1 to sub report 2 (Name & totals) & list them horizontally/each year? 2) How do I get each summary to show in a way like (Client1, Year1...YearN). If I am inserting a section for the second sub report it shows the 2nd sub report right after (Client1,Year1). I set page after in section expert but its not in order I wanted :| I want to show this section after (client1,Year1-------YearN) Report is designed in a way like Main Report ---- Sub Report 1 Group (Client 1 Year 1) -------------------------------- Name Amount TotalAmount -------------------------------- John 1,000 300,000,000 End of Page ---------------------------------- (Client 1 Year 2) -------------------------------- Name Amount TotalAmount -------------------------------- John 5,000 400,000,000 End of Page ---------------------------------- Group (Client 2 Year 1) -------------------------------- Name Amount TotalAmount -------------------------------- Stevens 1,000 10,000,000 End of Page ---------------------------------- (Client 2 Year 2) -------------------------------- Name Amount TotalAmount -------------------------------- Stevens 2,000 40,000 End of Page ---------------------------------- End Sub Report 1 ----- Sub Report 2 ---------------------------------------------------------------- Name TotalAmount TotalAmount ....... TotalAmount ----------------------------------------------------------------- John Year1(TotalAmount) Year2(TotalAmount).... YearnN(TotalAmount) Stevens Year1(TotalAmount) Year2(TotalAmount).... YearnN(TotalAmount) End Sub Report 2
