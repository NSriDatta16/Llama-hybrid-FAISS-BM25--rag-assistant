Confidence interval for summation of time series

I have three time-series of denoting forecast means with confidence intervals around them. I want to add these three models and get a confidence interval for the final model. How should I approach that? I have tried: using the usual square root of the summation of variances plus covariances for each point in time, but that returned a much wider uncertainty interval than it makes sense (the summation of all consumption means falling entirely well within two standard deviations). Also, the distribution of each point in time is not normal. Adding sample forecasts from each model (these are Facebook Prophet models, so it's easy to sample forecasts) and using them to estimate the confidence intervals but then remembered that the samples wouldn't be correlated. Any other ideas?
