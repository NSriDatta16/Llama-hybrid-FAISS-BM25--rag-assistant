That won't work for all models. Here's an example where it won't work. Suppose the data comes from a random walk without drift: $$Y_t = Y_{t-1} + \varepsilon_t$$ The $h$ -ahead point forecasts are: $$\mathbb{E}(Y_{t+h} | Y_1,...,Y_t) = Y_t$$ You want to simulate the yearly sum $\sum_{h=1}^{12} Y_{t+h}$ conditional on $Y_t$ , which you can write as: $$\sum_{h=1}^{12} Y_{t+h} = (Y_t + \varepsilon_{t+1}) + \ldots + (Y_t + \varepsilon_{t+1} + \ldots \varepsilon_{t+12}) = 12Y_t + \sum_{h=1}^{12} (13-h)\varepsilon_{t+h}$$ The residuals are just the $\varepsilon_t$ , which in your suggestion you would resample. Let $\left(\tilde{\varepsilon}^{(1)},\ldots,\tilde{\varepsilon}^{(12)}\right)$ be such a sample. You would suggest to simulate from the yearly sum like this: $$(Y_t + \tilde{\varepsilon}^{(1)}) + \ldots + (Y_t + \tilde{\varepsilon}^{(12)}) = 12Y_t + \sum_{h=1}^{12} \tilde{\varepsilon}^{(h)}$$ This is not the same distribution. Here's an illustration: # Generate some data set.seed(123) x The issue is that you're just adding noise "on top" of the point forecast, but in many time series models, shocks are defined in a way that they are fed forward through the dynamics. That's how autocorrelation is constructed from independent shocks. In the random walk process, each new shock has a permanent effect on the future level and appears in the distribution of each value from then on. You need to do the same with resampled residuals so that you obtain the correct joint pathwise distribution and hence the correct summed yearly distribution. So, this won't work for most ARIMA models. There are models where your idea will work as-is, namely models that have a deterministic trend function $f$ and iid noise, like this: $$Y_t = f(t) + \varepsilon_t$$
