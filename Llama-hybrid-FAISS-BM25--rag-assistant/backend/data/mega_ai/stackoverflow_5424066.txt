One problem is that just selects the value of the first child text node, and outputs it. The easiest way to do this right is probably to use instead of . Then instead of and you can use which will apply the appropriate template to each child element and text node, in order, not skipping any. Here is a complete implementation: Note the , which operates on all children of the context node, including text nodes, by default in absence of an explicit select attribute. A default template is used for text nodes. This template simply copies them to the output. Sample input: Item 1 Text Item 2 Text This is a paragraph people! produces the desired output: Item 1 Text Item 2 Text This is a paragraph people!
