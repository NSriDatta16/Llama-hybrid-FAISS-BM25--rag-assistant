Ordering in VAR models

In Enders' 'Applied Econometric Time Series', I repeatedly stumbled upon the notion of the "ordering of a VAR model" and I am not sure I understand the concept right. As far as I understand it, the concept relates to the problem of recovering the true $\epsilon$ of the underlying structural equations. Looking e.g. at the following VAR in standard form: $y_t = a_{10} + a_{11}y_{t-1} + a_{12}z_{t-1} + e_{1t}$ $z_t = a_{20} + a_{21}y_{t-1} + a_{22}z_{t-1} + e_{2t}$ The problem is that the two errors are actually composites of the underlying shocks $\epsilon_{yt}$ and $\epsilon_{zt}$ of the structural equations, which we do not know. Here, Enders mentions that "(...) if the correlation coefficient between the $e_{1t}$ and $e_{2t}$ is low, the ordering is not likely to be important", and vice versa. My problem is that I do not grasp the concept of ordering and how it would affect the identification problem of the disturbances in the structural model. Does ordering refer to the order of the independent variables in the VAR?
