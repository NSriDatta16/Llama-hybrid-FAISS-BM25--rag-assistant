Validation of a linear regression model using R

I have created a multiple linear regression model with R using lm and glm . I am using lm on a training set and predict on a testing set to validate the model. In one test my results are within 80% of what they should be for 80% of the cases. It correlates with 40% for one response variable and with 63% for another response variable (but the response variable with 63% correlation isn't near the actual values of the prediction). I have 53 predicates. What is the probability of that occurring randomly? I've tried to build an multi-class svm off of the features using the predicates but so far the svm has been unable to properly predict the results.
