Sarcastic's reply is so much better than mine, but if you were working with filesystem paths, my ugly hack below could turn out to be useful too. (Translation: I typed it, so I'll be damned if I don't post it :) Path.Combine just slaps two strings together, paying attention to leading or trailing slashes. As far as I know, the only Path method that does normalization is Path.GetFullPath. The following will give you the "cleaned up" version. myPath = System.IO.Path.GetFullPath(myPath); Of course, there is the small issue that the resulting path will be rooted and the forward slashes will be converted to back slashes (like "C:\foo\bar\path.aspx"). But if you know the parent root of the original path, stripping out the root should not be a big problem.
