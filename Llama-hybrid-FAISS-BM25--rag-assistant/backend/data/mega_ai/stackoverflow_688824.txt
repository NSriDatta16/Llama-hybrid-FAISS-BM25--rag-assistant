Many control developers bundle their webresources using the second method you describe - adding them as embedded resources in the .dll. This way, you can distribute the controls without having to copy a bunch of folders and files into every website that wants to use them, and make sure the folder paths all match, etc. You also gain the advantage of much easier localization/internationalization of your resources. However, the WebResource.axd thing is a drawback. You can usually "debug" the URL's with something like Firebug to see what actually got returned from the request, but I agree, it can be a pain if something isn't working correctly. Another drawback is if you have dozens of resources for one server control, especially if they are referenced multiple times each (think of a treeview with hundreds of small images on the nodes) - then the URL's can add a ton of actual bytes to the final HTML output. If your distribution/localization needs outweigh your optimization/debugging needs, I would consider embedding the resources. If not, then you could definitely do #3 - copying everything into your website using Subversion. Check out SVN Externals for how to set it up. A little time invested into learning it now might save you tons down the road!
