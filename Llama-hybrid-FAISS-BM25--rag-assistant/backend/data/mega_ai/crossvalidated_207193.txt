P value for Markov table

I have the following two-state Markov chain: pre ...that produces the following plot: Is there something like a p value for this model that I can add to the plot? Something that would show whether the model differs significantly from, say, another hypothetical model where there are no differences in probabilities from one state to the other? For example, from the plot wec can discern that after each sunny day, there is 20% chance of another sunny day and 80% chance of a rainy day. How do I know whether this 20/80 differs from 50/50 significantly (p value would be 0.05). I did run chisq.test(transitionMatrix) with the resulting value of 1 but I don't think that's the correct way to test the model.
