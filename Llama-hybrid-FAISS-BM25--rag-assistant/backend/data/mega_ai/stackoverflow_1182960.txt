Re access speed: I have seen an Apache https: SVN sever needing a hardware update. I seem to remember it was mainly lack of memory which slowed down the numerous Apache processes which competed for the machine's resources. But that was 20 developers collaborating on a project with a checked out tree of 20GB (lots of binaries in there, which often changed). And the update to a moderately equipped server solved the problem. Also, in that very project, I had to learn that SVN on a ext3 FS under Linux was at leas an order of magnitude faster than on NTFS under Windows. Mark that: The Linux in a virtual machine running on Windows took a tenth of the time for an update competing with the Windows box the VM ran on . (We always meant to try that OS ext3 driver for Windows and see if this wouldn't make SVN faster on Windows than its native FS. However, I left the project before we ever got around trying.) Anyway, it is not like what you decide for is cast into stone for eternity. You can try out one thing, test it thoroughly in a real project, and switch to a different server and protocol later. (There's even an SVN command to switch the URL of a checked out tree . This you can use to switch protocol without having to check out everything anew.) Here's what I would consider to decide about the protocol: If you have a working AD or LDAP infrastructure that you would like to leverage for login into SVN, try one of the http / https: protocol options. If you don't have this, and you won't need it, and you are fine doing login by SVN's own means, why not use the speed provided by the svn: protocol? I have never seen an SVN repo that people used WebDAV access to. IME they always want to have the history when accessing per web (WebDAV doesn't provide this, AFAIK), so they used one of the web frontends for SVN. I've never checked, but I just assume that stuff like ViewVC and the like don't care which protocol they use for accessing the repo. As for which distribution you want to use -- I think that's mainly down to personal preferences, as the code underneath is the same anyway. I prefer downloads I don't have to register for and distributions that explicitly aim at the platform I want to install them on. But that's probably just me. However, there's one hard fact you might want to consider if your repository is accessible from the Internet: When the SVN project made a new dot release, how long did it, in the past, take the different distributions to catch up. Since these might be security fixes, you might prefer the ones that, usually, provides the fixes faster.
