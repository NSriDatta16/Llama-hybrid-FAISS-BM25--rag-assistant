Yes. There has been work on using computer vision techniques to detect screen elements, to aid testing of GUIs and for automation. See, e.g., the following papers: Tsung-Hsiang Chang, Tom Yeh, Robert C. Miller. GUI Testing Using Computer Vision . CHI 2010. Tom Yeh, Tsung-Hsiang Chang, Robert C. Miller. Sikuli: Using GUI Screenshots for Search and Automation . UIST 2009. This led to the Siku software package . There's probably lots of other work out there; those are just two papers I happen to be familiar with. The actual machine learning needed is not too sophisticated. This is a basic object detection task. If you put together a good training set and train a convolutional neural network, I would imagine that the result should be pretty effective.
