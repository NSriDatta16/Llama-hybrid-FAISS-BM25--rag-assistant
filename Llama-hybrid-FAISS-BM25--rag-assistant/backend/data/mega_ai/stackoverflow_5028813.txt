You problem here is probably actually twofold. First, you have to get all of the parameters just right for the AudioRecord, ie, I can see that you tried all the various sampling rates and channel configurations, but did you try different bit depths? If you don't get it all just right, it doesn't work. Furthermore, it would appear that some android devices seem to report the wrong minBufferSize. But, I think the actual problem you are experiencing is that the AVDs cannot record Audio/Video (even though they may not complain if you configure it so): http://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/index.html From paragraph three: Note that the emulator doesn't have hardware to capture audio or video, but actual mobile devices are likely to provide these capabilities, accessible through the MediaRecorder class.
