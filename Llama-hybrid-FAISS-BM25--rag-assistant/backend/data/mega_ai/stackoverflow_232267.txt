How do you debug Qt layout problems

I've got a complex dialog, and it is full of whitespace and I can't shrink it. In Designer, it has lots of components that then get dynamically hidden, and a few which are dynamically added. I've added dumping of size policies, size hints, and minimum sizes, but still can't figure out why Qt won't let me drag it smaller. There must be some tools or techniques for troubleshooting this. Please share.
