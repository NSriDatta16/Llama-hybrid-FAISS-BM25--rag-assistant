Access files on WM6 phone using USB connection

Windows XP shows my Windows Mobile 6 phone (HP iPAQ 514) as "Mobile Device" in "My computer". Using Windows explorer, I can copy files from/to the device and its storage card. Which possibilities are there to access these files programmatically? Any way to access them using normal filenames or special paths? Note that I'm searching for a solution that works with the phone connected via USB, not via Bluetooth/Wi-Fi. Question is tagged Python, but I'd like to hear any working solution.
