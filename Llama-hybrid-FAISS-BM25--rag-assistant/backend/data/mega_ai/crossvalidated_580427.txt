Why does Anderson-Darling statistic increase as Frequency is increased for my data?

I have been carrying out sieve analysis to estimate the median particle size of a powder. I wanted to check if the data so far followed a normal or lognormal distribution, as I have come across resources on sieve analysis that use exp(mu) to find the median. I have been recording the percentage mass of the powder in each interval. For my frequency I tried using the average percentage mass per interval. Minitab rejected the percentages as invalid data, so instead I multiplied the percentages by different multiples of 10 and treated the new values as counts. I found that every time I multiplied by 10, the Anderson-Darling statistic also increased by a multiple of 10. Why is this? Also, can I get Minitab to accept these percentages as frequency without causing this increase in the A-D statistic? See the pictures below for context, (In the picture with the values, Opening Size refers to the diameter of the gaps in the mesh, i.e on average 0.767% of the particles have a diameter greater than 2000 micrometers. Also the last ln(C1) is only there so I can have a data point to graph for diameter less than 180 micrometers).
