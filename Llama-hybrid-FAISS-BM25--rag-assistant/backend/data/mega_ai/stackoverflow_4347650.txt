How do I specify a new package configuration location using the /Set parameter when using dtexec?

I'm using dtexec to run an SSIS package from the command line. According to this page: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms162810.aspx I should be able to change the location that the package loads design-time configurations from using the /Set parameter. Here is the relevant text: You can use the /Set option to change the location from which package configurations are loaded. However, you cannot use the /Set option to override a value that was specified by a configuration at design time. To understand how package configurations are applied, see Package Configurations and Behavior Changes to Integration Services Features in SQL Server 2008 R2. However, I have no idea what the syntax for this is. The only examples I can find online are for using /Set to change variable values. How do I use /Set to specify a different location for my package configurations? Notes: The package is a raw file on the file system, it is not installed on a server or in a package store. Similarly, the config file I want to use is also just a plain file in the filesystem. I am aware that I can run my ssis packages in other ways (install it to a server, use SQL agent etc.) but due to operating environment limitations I have to use dtexec on the command line.
