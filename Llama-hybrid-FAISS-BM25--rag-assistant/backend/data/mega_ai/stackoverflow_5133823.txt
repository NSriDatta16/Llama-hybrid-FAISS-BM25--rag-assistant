This looks like a typical entity-attribute-value approach. This model is fine, especially for high traffic websites, but it does not lend itself well to SQL. Instead of: select * from Listing_table where postdate > '2011-02-01' You'll find yourself writing queries like: select * from Listing_table lt where (select value from field_table ft where lt.list_id = ft.list id and field_name = 'postdate') > '2011-02-01' And that's just for a simple date compare. This gets complex really really fast. Basically, EAV is a tradeoff where you use the database mostly for persistant storage and less for logic and report generation.
