I do not believe it is necessary to secure the database by moving it to an outside network. Rather, you can solve these practices by limiting the privileges of the accounts themselves. The data access should not be user specific, and instead leverage a system account with an encrypted connection string configured in the web or app config file. User authentication and authorization should be handled separately from DB access. The system DB account itself should ONLY have privileges to perform the tasks necessary to operate the system. This means only granting access to the procedures that the application executes, and possibly read access to any tables or views read through LINQ to SQL.
