As previously stated, yes, you can use logistic regression even when there are no continuous variables. Your model will then find additive relations (how much does X1 increase the probability of Y=1). You can enrich it by adding interaction features of the form X1*X2 which will add nonlinear effects to the model (maybe the effect of X1 and X2 are small on their own but if they are both 1 there's a large effect?)
