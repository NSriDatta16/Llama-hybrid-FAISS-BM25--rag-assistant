Reading through this, I was troubled by several things. First, you don't ever say why you are doing this, what your data set is, why you have so many variables, what those variables are, why your N is so small relative to the number of variables and so on. We need context. Second, your PCA should raise some warning flags. PCA is, in my experience, usually much more efficient. What data set could possibly need 150 dimensions to describe it? This gets back to the first point and adds - why these variables? Third, your cluster analysis didn't work at all. You tried several methods. The unfortunate conclusion (especially in light of the above) is that your data don't cluster. It seems, in fact, like you might have data that is either all noise or, at least, so noisy as to make analysis impossible. So, I would suggest going back and figuring out not what is wrong with your methods, but what is wrong with your data and with the basic problem.
