From what I understood, you are trying to synthetically create the label column using a function. If the function is good enough to label the data correctly in that case you can use the same function to label new data as well. In a supervised machine learning algorithm, you want to predict the target variable by predicting the function(model) from the given features. Here you are defining the function your selves to IMHO you do not need a ML model to do that.
