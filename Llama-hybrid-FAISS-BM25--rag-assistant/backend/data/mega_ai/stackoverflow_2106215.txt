Do any software developers know what the General Systems Model or an Organizational Model is?

Apparently the General Systems Model and Organizational Model are part of requirements phase of a software development project using the waterfall model (according to my professor), but we did not learn about this in my software engineering course, neither of my two software engineering books mention them, and Google doesn't seem to know what they are either. I'm not a business developer and I don't have to do any of this stuff normally, so I am in unfamiliar territory. I have to have the requirements, analysis, and design phase of a software project finished by tomorrow (it was assigned yesterday) and I can't proceed on the requirements section because my professor is requesting these unusual things for it. I would ask my professor if I thought there was even a remote chance of getting a response, but that is unlikely.
