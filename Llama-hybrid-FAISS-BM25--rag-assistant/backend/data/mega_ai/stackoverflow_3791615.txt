Cocoa Touch - UIButtons - Subclassing UIButton

Hey all, can anyone please explain how I can subclass UIButton and override some method so that when the user drags off a button it comes up right away? The problem is that when I drag out of the button frame it remains active and down. I want it to stop as soon as the finger leaves the button frame. Any ideas? (Cocoa Touch)
