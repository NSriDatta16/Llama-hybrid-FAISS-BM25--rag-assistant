There are agents other than purely visual ones. For those, the underlying elements can be important. We're not just talking about the accessibility and non-mainstream browsers that sadly many visual designers like to ignore; the case even they are concerned about is the search engine. A search engine knows that text in an is more significant than text in a . A search engine knows that text in a flows together to form contiguous phrases with its surrounding inline text, whereas text in a is a separate line (even if you've used CSS display: inline to change how it appears). You don't really get anything by using instead of the semantically-most-appropriate element. You might want a few more reset-CSS rules if you're using , or , but that's about it.
