SSH requires a "leap of faith" to secure the initial handshake against future tampering. (You initially trust the key the server gives you) One currently avaliable but not well known approach is to use SSH-SRP. This uses mutual password knowledge to both authenticate you and provide session encryption keys necessary to securely encrypt your ssh session. Its MUCH more secure than SSH's initial "trust me" and does not require long term storage of keys.
