It is mentioned in " Re: Bug? git svn fetch: "unable to create temporary sha1 filename /home/andres/git/public/crystal.g ": After repacking the repository the problem is gone. Really rather strange. Did you try a repack ? git-repack is used to combine all objects that do not currently reside in a "pack", into a pack. It can also be used to re-organize existing packs into a single, more efficient pack. A pack is a collection of objects, individually compressed, with delta compression applied, stored in a single file, with an associated index file. Packs are used to reduce the load on mirror systems, backup engines, disk storage, etc. And did you try to upgrade to the latest version of Git ? You have different commands to run in order to "clean" your repository, from the safest to the more aggressive ones: $ git-prune $ git-gc --aggressive $ git-repack $ git-repack -a $ git-prune-packed As mentioned in " Git Garbage collection doesn't seem to fully work ", a git gc --aggressive is not sufficient on its own. The most effective combination would be adding git repack , but also git prune : git gc git repack -Ad # kills in-pack garbage git prune # kills loose garbage
