Do neural networks work with high-dimensional small sample data?

Are neural networks used for the classification of high-dimensional small sample data like gene microarray data, where the dimension may be on the order of 1000 features per sample with around 100 samples? Do they work well in this setting, and if not, then what kind of classifiers are usually used with this kind of data?
