Storing Tables of Information on the Android Platform

I have about twenty pages of information that is stored in tables that needs to be stored in my Android application. Each column is a designated stop on a bus route and the column is filled with times that the bus will be at the stop. There is also certain information that needs to be associated with some times, such as if the bus is handicap accessible at a certain time. Here is an example of one of the tables: Bus Times I have thought about using a SQL lite as that seems as though it would be able to store these tables quite easily; but when I think of using SQL I think of dynamic data storage and this shouldn't be changing more than once a year. Is SQL appropriate for this application? Is there a better way to do this? Thanks, Rob
