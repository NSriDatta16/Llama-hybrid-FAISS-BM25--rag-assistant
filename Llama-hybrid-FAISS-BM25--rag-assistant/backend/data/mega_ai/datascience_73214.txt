Depending on your model there may be some better model-specific approaches than SHAP. It is also important to note that SHAP is an approximation of Shapley value, with the main assumption of not having too much correlation between your features. That being said, taking the mean instead of the mean absolute values seems to be the most efficient approach in the continuity of what you are doing. Just keep in mind that : SHAP don't have a "physical" interpretation, in terms of direct impact on the output. It may lack some meaning for real life users. Taking the mean can "hide" skewed SHAP profile : a variable with high impact on a small subgroup of instances and no impact on the rest may get the same average than a variable with small impact on every instance.
