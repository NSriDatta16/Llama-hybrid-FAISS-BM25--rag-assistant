How to deploy ML models in production?

Have been learning Machine Learning concepts and doing hands-on past few months. Now got a bit different doubt than implementation of code. This is regarding measures to be considered while deploying in a Prod environment, say something like " A newbie's checklist to ML production " example - Are Feedback loops always considered? Is cross-validation done in final prod model or only during train/test the model? How the auto-suggestion in Amazon or any ecommerce website works? - Meaning does the model get trained on every page load or already pre-trained and just predicts (suggests) based on user selections? I know the questions are too general and newbie, but will help many to understand the concepts relating to real-world. Please advise. Let me know for any further information and I will be happy to furnish/respond.
