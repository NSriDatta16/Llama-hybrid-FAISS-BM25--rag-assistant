Available RAM on shared hosting provider

I'm building business app that will hold somewhere between 50,000 to 150,000 companies. Each company (db row) is represented with 4-5 properties/columns (title, location,...). ORM is LINQ2SQL. I have to do some calculation, and for that I have lot of queries for specific company. Now, i go to db every time when i need something, and it produces 50-200 queries, depending on calculation complexy. I tried to put all companies to cache, and for 10,000 rows (companies) in db, it takes around 5,5MB of cache. In this scenario, I have only one query. This application will be on shared hosting server, so my resources are limited. I'm interested, what will happen if I try to load, let say 100,000 companies (rows, objects)? Or put that in cache? Is there any RAM limit that average hosting company give to ASP.NET application? Does it depend on dedicated Applcation Pool (I can put app to dedicated pool)? Options are : - load whole table to c# objects. Id did some memory profiling, 10,000 objects needs 5MB RAM - query db to get referenced objects when needed. Task is : for given company A, build tree of connected companies. Table and columns : Company : IdCompany, Title, Address, Contact CompanyConnection: IdParentCompany, IdChildCompany
