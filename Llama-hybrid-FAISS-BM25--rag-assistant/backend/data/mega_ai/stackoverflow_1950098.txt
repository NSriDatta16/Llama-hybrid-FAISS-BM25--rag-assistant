Does Python have any for loop equivalent (not foreach)

Python's iterators are great and all, but sometimes I really do want a C-style for loop - not a foreach loop. For example, I have a start date and an end date and I want to do something for every day in that range. I can do this with a while loop, of course: current = start while current This works, but it's 3 lines instead of 1 (in C or C-based languages) and I often find myself forgetting to write the incrementing line, especially if the loop body is quite complex. Is there a more elegant and less error-prone way of doing this in Python?
