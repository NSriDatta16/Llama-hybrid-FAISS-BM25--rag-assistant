Why did you conduct this experiment on 15 different days, rather than just on day 1 and again on day 15? Are you interested in how the intervention plays out over time? (Is most of the change early on and then steady? Is there not much change at the start and then the importance of intervention becomes clear? Do some rats change immediately, while others take a while? Does the progression differ from group to group?) Your first method (averages over rats) is sound as far as it goes, but it ignores information on 'progression of effect over time'. If you use this method, you might supplement it by looking at 25 graphs showing changes over time---one graph for each of the 25 rats. Then follow up, if you find anything interesting. As your description of the second method stands, there is no discussion of how you keep one rat from looking like 15 different rats. Without any particulars, the comment by @user158565 seems to address this issue. You might do an ANOVA for a partially hierarchical design with three factors: Day $(\delta_i, i=1, \dots, 15),$ Group $(\gamma_j, j = 1, \dots, 5)$ and Rat $(R_{k(j)}, k=1, \dots 5$ within each $j),$ where Greek letters are for fixed effects and Latin for random, and parentheses denote nesting. (Perhaps you'd include a Day-by-Group inteaction.) Other approaches might be an ANCOVA model or a regression model. For this particular experiment, your intuition and knowledge of the field of study may have led you to an experimental design that will give answers to most or all of your questions. However, it is best to decide on a design and a model for analysis ahead of time. One advantage would be ability to do 'power and sample size' computations that tell you in advance, for example, how many rats you need to use per group in order to have a good chance of detecting effects of intervention that are sufficiently large to be of practical importance.
