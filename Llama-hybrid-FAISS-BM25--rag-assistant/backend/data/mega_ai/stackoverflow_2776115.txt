Consider this simple interface: Public Interface IWeightedValue Public ReadOnly Property Weight As Double Public ReadOnly Property Value As Double End Interface Without even writing any more code, I can start dealing with this concept in other parts of my code. For instance: Public Function GetWeightedAverage(ByVal points As IEnumerable(Of IWeightedValue)) As Double Dim totalWeight As Double = 0.0 Dim totalWeightedValue As Double = 0.0 For Each point As IWeightedValue in points totalWeight += point.Weight totalWeightedValue += (point.Weight * point.Value) Next Return totalWeightedValue / totalWeight End Function And voila -- now for any class I write, if I just make it implement IWeightedValue then I can calculate the weighted average for a collection of instances of this class .
