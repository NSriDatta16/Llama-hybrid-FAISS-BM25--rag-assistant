Usually, code signing is useful for when your product is software or you work in an environment where every piece of software is under scrutiny. By signing your office's custom software, you can place it in a higher trust relationship than others. Usually, you generate the private key and then when you go to build, you can attach that private key on a build server. This prevents developers around the company having access to the private key. What you sign is completely up to you. I would say the modules that are most prone to absolutely not working given a certain trust environment need to be signed....for example, DLLs that access file system objects or database connection strings. I would just get in the habit of signing the least amount of code and then build up from there, otherwise, you risk having everything signed and then it is assumed that everything in your organization is safe to run. Again, it all depends on your level of security concerns in your organization.
