Do you mean you want to ensure that the header file is included once and only once? The standard solution to this is using an include guard . I.e. surround the contents of your header with #ifndef MY_HEADER // a unique identifier for each header #define MY_HEADER ... #endif This is guaranteed to work in all platforms. Some compilers also provide a #pragma to achieve the same effect with less hassle, e.g. in Visual C++ you can add #pragma once at the start of your header file.
