I'd recommend approaching your concerns as 'suggestions'. Make a suggestion and ask for their opinion on it, that way they feel as if they are still in control even though you've planted the seed and are directing the conversation. Regardless of how long you have been with an organization, you are there and you are there for a reason (they hired you for your input). Find your voice and how to best approach your team members with suggestions and/or concerns. This is a crucial part of being a team member and will increase your value.
