JSONP - Access-Control-Allow-Origin and MIME type errors

I am trying to both create the Server and client side of a jsonp request, and I cannot seem to make it work. I've looked around at numerous guides, blog posts, etc, but pretty much everyone shows only the client side. Here's my client code $.ajax({ dataType: 'application/json', data: params, jsonp: 'jsonpCallback', url: settings.domain + '/httpext.dll?json_cc', success: function (data) { //determine the return status }, error: function (response, status, error) { //error handling } }); //end ajax right now, the server is returning a hard coded value like this jsonpCallback({"username":"meltingice","posts"1234}); My problem is that I cannot get the request and response to work together. Currently, the response is returning application/json, so if I change my request ro expect jsonp it errors with Resource interpreted as script but transferred with MIME type application/json. Uncaught ReferenceError: jsonpCallback is not defined First off, as you can see, I have jsonpCallback defined. Now, if I change the dataType to application/json, then I get this error XMLHttpRequest cannot load http://myserver/httpext.dll?json_cc&sid=adsfhasjdkfhajksdghjk%3Basdhg&action=SALE&ccCard=&ccNum=&ccExMM=0&ccExYYYY=0&ccCVV2=&holdersName=&totalDue=0&dueDate=11%2F19%2F2010. Origin http://localhost:59905 is not allowed by Access-Control-Allow-Origin. As you can see, it is not putting callback=? into the url. It's rather frustrating. How do I set up the server side so I can call it using jsonp? What do I need for the response type? How do I format the data returned so my client side code can pull back the data?
