Design-Time validation of library

I have a library that I would like to license and distribute. I know how to license a class/library for runtime. I've done that several times, actually. I know how to license a user control. I've also done that several times. What's got me stumped is how to license a library (that has no drag/drop user control or component) for development only. How do you license a library for design-time? Any thoughts/hints?
