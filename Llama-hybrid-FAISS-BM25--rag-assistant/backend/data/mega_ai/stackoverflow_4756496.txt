All the web frameworks do it differently. As you say, Python is not a templating language, so there is no automatic way to handle HTTP requests. There is a cgi module which is part of the standard library, and which you can use to access POSTed data via cgi.FieldStorage() - but serving an app via standard CGI is horribly inefficient and only suitable for very small-scale stuff. A much better idea is to use a simple WSGI framework (WSGI is the standard for serving web applications with Python). There are quite a few - my current favourite is flask although I hear good things about bottle too.
