Fitting a Logistic Regression via Brier Score or Mean Squared Error

Is there a name for a logistic regression model that has been fit using the Brier score (or equivalently the mean-squared error) rather than the cross-entropy? I realise this isn't maximum-likelihood, but the model would still asymptotically estimate the conditional mean of the targets (which would be the posterior probability of class membership for binary targets) and similar things were done using neural networks back in the day. I haven't been able to find anything on this, but perhaps that is because I am using the wrong terms?
