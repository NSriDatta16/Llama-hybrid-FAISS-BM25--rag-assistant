The original approach by Gareth Roberts et al. is to investigate the limiting distribution of the first coordinate process $X^{(1)}_n$ , accelerated by a factor $d$ . This leads to the limiting process $Z_t = X^{(1)}_{\lfloor t d \rfloor}$ . If you put $\alpha (large steps), it can be shown that asymptotically none of the proposed moves are going to be accepted, so that the process $(Z_t)$ is constant almost surely. Similarly, if $\alpha > 1/2$ (small steps), asymptotically all moves are going to be accepted but the moves are so small, so that again the limiting process $(Z_t)$ is constant almost surely. Finally, only for $\alpha = 1/2$ , we get a non-trivial limiting process (which happens to be a Langevin diffusion). This is the way in which $\alpha = 1/2$ can be considered an optimal choice. For a more precise statement and proof of this result, consult the original research paper which is very readable. Roberts, G. O., Gelman, A., & Gilks, W. R. (1997). Weak convergence and optimal scaling of random walk Metropolis algorithms. The Annals of Applied Probability, 7(1), 110â€“120. https://doi.org/10.1214/aoap/1034625254 The result is later extended in various ways: e.g. looking at different functions of the high-dimensional process (instead of the first coordinate), and more general distributional assumptions. Also different Metropolis-Hastings algorithms have been studied, for example the MALA algorithm, which was shown to require a time speed up of only $d^{1/3}$ instead of $d$ in order to converge. This is also discussed in the survey paper you are reading.
