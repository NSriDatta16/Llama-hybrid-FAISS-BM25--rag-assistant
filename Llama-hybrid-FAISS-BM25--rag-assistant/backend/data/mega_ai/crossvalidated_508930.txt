Any good tutorial on SARIMAX model time series?

I know it's kind of a naive question, but somehow I am unable to find a good tutorial on the SARIMAX time series model. The online content is usually an API implementation that is more of a black-box. However, since I am in a learning stage, I wish to get a feel of the mathematics that goes on at the backend. Any help in this direction will be highly appreciated.
