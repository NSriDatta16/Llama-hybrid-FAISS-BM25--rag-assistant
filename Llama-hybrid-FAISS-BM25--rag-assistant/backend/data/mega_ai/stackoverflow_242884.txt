DLLs that require registration, used in different programs

How do you organize installing different programs if these programs use the same DLLs which require registration . The problem: if the user uninstalls the program that is installed later the other program will stop working as the registry entries now point to the missing DLLs. One possible solution is placing the common DLLs in a common folder - perhaps under Application Data or in Program Files\Company Name\ and then using the shared file counting mechanism of Windows. How do you handle this?
