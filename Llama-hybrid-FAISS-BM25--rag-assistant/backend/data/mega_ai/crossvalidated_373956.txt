Interesting question, which already generated some interesting answers. In the simplest of cases, regression is used to help uncover the linear relationship between two quantitative variables X and Y in a population of subjects. For example, we can use regression to estimate the relationship between X = Age and Y = Blood Pressure in a population of patients, assuming the relationship is linear (e.g., Blood Pressure tends to increase with Age for patients in this population). For this example, assume we randomly select a sample of 100 patients from the population and measure their Age and Blood Pressure. Using the data from these subjects, we can estimate the intercept and slope describing the linear relationship between the two variables in the population of patients. In a prediction setting, we would select an additional patient from the population at random and record his/her Age. (Let's say that this patient has an Age of 60 years and this age falls within the range of observed ages for the 100 patients in the sample.) Then we would want to predict the patient's Blood Pressure using what we learned about the relationship between Age and Blood Pressure in the population from which the patient came from. Our best guess of what the unknown Blood Pressure value would be for this patient would indeed be given by a + bx60 where a and b are the estimated values of the intercept and slope describing the linear relationship between the Age and Blood Pressure in the population of patients. This guess is what we refer to as a point prediction (i.e., a single, known value used as a guess for the unknown Blood Pressure of the randomly selected patient with known Age). We cannot add a random error term to this guess as that would make it unknown , which defeats the whole purpose of the prediction exercise. However, we can construct a a so-called *prediction interval" where we have a high degree of confidence that the unknown Blood Pressure value can be expected to lie. The range of values encompassed by this prediction interval will incorporate information about the variability of Blood Pressure values for patients with age 60 about the average Blood Pressure value for these patients. This variability is unknown but can be estimated from the data contributed by the sample of 100 patients.
