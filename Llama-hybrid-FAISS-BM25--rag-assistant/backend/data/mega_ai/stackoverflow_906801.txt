Create a method in your view controller (if nothing else, you should have a RootViewController in you project). Let's say your method is -(void) buttonClicked { code code code } In the controller's header file (for example RootViewController.h) you then put: -(IBAction) buttonClicked; And in IB you right-click your button/radio dial/whatever. You will see a list of events and you can drag FROM the connector of the event you want your controller to receive, to the object in IB that represents the controler (probably First Responder). This depends on how your IB structure is set up, but it should be straightforward. Another alternative is to learn how to create UIViews programatically, and forget about IB for the time being. Opinions are divided about whether it's better to learn to use IB at the outset, or whether it's better to learn how to do everything in code and save IB for later. In any case, it's necessary to learn both ways of setting up an interface at some point.
