Is it valid to derive a mean from categorical data?

I am working on a study to quantify average working hours for doctors. However, when I leave it empty for respondents to fill up, it remains unfilled. Changing it into categories as above yield better responses. (categories of working hours; 1 to 10, 11 to 20, 21 to 30) Now is it possible for me to derive a mean from these categorical data? n1 x midpoint of category 1 + n2 x midpoint category 2 ..... divide by total n
