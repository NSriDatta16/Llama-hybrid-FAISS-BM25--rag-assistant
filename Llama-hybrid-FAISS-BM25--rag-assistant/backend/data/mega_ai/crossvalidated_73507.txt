Comparing two survey items with a third variable

I want to compare the results of two items by age category and do not really know what test to use. I tried a Cochran–Mantel–Haenzel–test at first, but I don't think it is testing what I really want to know. We have two items (both dichotomous yes/no). We are interested in the proportion who said yes to item 2 if they said yes to item 1 and if this differs by age category. Anyone have any ideas? I thought about doing a logistic regression with the "events" as those who chose item 2 and the "trials" as the number who chose item 1, with the age category as the dependent variable. Does that make sense?
