Get starting and end index of a highlighted fragment in a searched field

"My search returns a highlighted fragment from a field. I want to know that in that field of particular searched document, where does that fragment starts and ends ?" for instance. consider i am searching " highlighted fragment " in above lines (consider the above para as single document). I am setting my fragmenter as : SimpleFragmenter fragmenter = new SimpleFragmenter(30); now the output of GetBestFragment is somewhat like : " returns a highlighted fragment from " Is it possible to get the starting and ending index of this fragment in the text above (say starting is 10 and ending is 45)
