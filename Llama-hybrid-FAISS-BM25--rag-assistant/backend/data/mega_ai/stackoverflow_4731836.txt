So, while it's true that the object is valid afterwards because the collection retains it, I'm not sure it's useful to think of it that way. If you intend to use the object in that method after adding it to the collection, you shouldn't release it until you're done with it. The way to think about it is this: 1) I have a claim of ownership of this object I created 2) Now the collection and I both have ownership of this object 3) Now just the collection does, and I shouldn't use the object because I don't have ownership of it and ignore the fact that you can technically get away with not paying attention to 3 in this case. This allows you to keep using the NARC (new-alloc-retain-copy) rule for thinking about what retains objects.
