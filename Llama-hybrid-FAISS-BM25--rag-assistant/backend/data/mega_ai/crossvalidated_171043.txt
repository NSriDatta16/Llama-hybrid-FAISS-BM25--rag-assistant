How to tune hyperparameters of xgboost trees?

I have a class imbalanced data & I want to tune the hyperparameters of the boosted tress using xgboost. Questions Is there an equivalent of gridsearchcv or randomsearchcv for xgboost? If not what is the recommended approach to tune the parameters of xgboost?
