I would guess your modal form is probably blocking messages. If you're in some kind of loop, doing some kind of processing trying to update the mainform with progress. Application.ProcessMessages is one way of getting those messages to be handled, but imho not very elegant. When I've had this type of problem before, I've implemented the processing in the Application.OnIdle event. Basically, what you need to do is split up your processing into small chunks. So let's say you are processing some loop. Make one iteration of the loop as one chunk of the task. put that code in a method with the following signature : procedure DoIdle(Sender: TObject; var Done: Boolean); The make sure Done is set to False. If your code was previously : for i := 1 to ProcessCount do DoProcess(i); this then becomes : procedure MyDoIdle(Sender: TObject; var Done: Boolean); begin Inc(TaskCount); If TaskCount and set things up as follows : TaskCount := 0; Application.Idle := MyDoIdle; The code is then run whenever the Application is Idle, and the message loop is handled as normal. Remember to set the Application.OnIdle to nil when done. If DoProcess is a little too fast you can elect to do say 5 or 10 iterations per call to onidle.
