In plain English, what are Django generic views?

The first two paragraphs of this page explain that generic views are supposed to make my life easier, less monotonous, and make me more attractive to women (I made up that last one): https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.4/topics/generic-views/ I'm all for improving my life, but what do generic views actually do? It seems like lots of buzzwords are being thrown around, which confuse more than they explain. Are generic views similar to scaffolding in Ruby on Rails? The last bullet point in the intro seems to indicate this. Is that an accurate statement?
