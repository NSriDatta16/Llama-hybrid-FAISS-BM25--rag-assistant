Take a look at RRDTool . It's a round robin database. You define the metrics you want to capture but can also define the resolution that you store it at. For example, you can specify for the las hour, you keep every seconds worth of information; for the past 24 hours - every minute; for the past week, every hour, etc. It's widely used to gather stats in systems such as Ganglia and Cacti .
