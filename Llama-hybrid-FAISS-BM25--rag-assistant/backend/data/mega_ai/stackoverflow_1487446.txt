Select based on the number of appearances of an id in another table

I have a table B with cids and cities. I also have a table C that has these cids with extra information. I want to list all the cids in table C that are associated with ALL appearances of a given city in Table B. My current solution relies on counting the number of times the given city appears in Table B and selecting only the cids that appear that many times. I don't know all the SQL syntax yet, but is there a way to select for this kind of pattern? My current solution: SELECT Agents.aid FROM Agents, Customers, Orders WHERE (Customers.city='Duluth') AND (Agents.aid = Orders.aid) AND (Customers.cid = Orders.cid) GROUP BY Agents.aid HAVING count(Agents.aid) > 1 It only works because I know right now with the HAVING statement. Thanks for the help. I wasn't sure how to google this problem, since it's pretty specific. EDIT: I'm pinpointing my problem a bit. I need to know how to determine if EVERY row in a table has a certain value for a field. Declaring a variable and counting the rows in a sub-selection and filtering out my results by IDs that appear that many times works, but It's really ugly. There HAS to be a way to do this without explicitly count()ing rows. I hope.
