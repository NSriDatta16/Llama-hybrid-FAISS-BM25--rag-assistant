"Defects" is presumably a count variable. The first thing that comes to mind would be a GLM; depending on circumstances I'd start by considering a binomial, Poisson, quasi-Poisson or negative binomial model (or possibly a zero-inflated version of one of those). Those models can all deal with skewed data, including (in some cases) highly skewed data. If you're looking at averages, normality isn't your only problem to consider - count variables tend to be heteroskedastic as well. The above GLMs are able to handle the kinds of heteroskedasticity that most often tend to occur with count data. These will allow you to fit models that allow a test for a comparison of means as well as more complicated models.
