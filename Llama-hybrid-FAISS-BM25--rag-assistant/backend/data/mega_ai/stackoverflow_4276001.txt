Well, if that's all you want to do, all you need to do is result = string.sub('{', '').sub('[', '').sub('}', '').sub(']', '') Of course, that's a terribly inelegant solution, and doesn't consider things like unmatched brackets, etc. A better solution would probably be: pattern1 = /\{(.*?)\}/ pattern2 = /\[(.*?)\]/ match1 = pattern1.match(string) result = string.sub(match1[0], match1[1]) match2 = pattern2.match(result) result = result.sub(match2[0], match2[1]) This could probably be simplified, but that's what comes off the top of my head :) BTW, if you want to replace all instances, all you need to do is use gsub instead of sub
