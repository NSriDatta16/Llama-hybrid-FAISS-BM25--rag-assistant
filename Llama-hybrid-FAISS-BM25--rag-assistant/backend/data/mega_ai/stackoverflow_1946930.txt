How can I create a photo slider on iPhone Safari with jQuery?

I'd like to create an product image viewer for an iPhone version of an ecommerce site, and have it behave something like the Photos app. Ideally, you would be able to slide images to move back and forth in the product image gallery. This will all be done in mobile Safari. I did a little experimenting with jqTouch, but its doesn't look like it would support this idea (it has swipe support, but there's no apparent way to link sliding to dragging an image). Any plugin or implementation ideas? Thanks!
