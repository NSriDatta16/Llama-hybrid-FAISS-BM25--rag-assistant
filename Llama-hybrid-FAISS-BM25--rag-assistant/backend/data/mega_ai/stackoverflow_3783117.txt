EntityFramework mappings - what is wrong with this mapping?

I'm kind of stuck working out where I'm going wrong with the below entity framework mapping. What I've done is: a) created a Sqlite database (see below, noting Sqlite doesn't allow FK constraints) b) created a blank Entity Data Mode & then created the model from the database c) issue is then trying to add the Model association so it picks up and uses the "ProcessNameId" column I've created in the database in the USAGES table. I've been trying to use the GUI Table Mapping pane to do this but it doesn't seem too intuitive. Issue - I'm getting the following error: Error 3 Error 3021: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 85: Each of the following columns in table Usages is mapped to multiple conceptual side properties: Usages.ProcessNameId is mapped to Error 4 Error 3025: Problem in mapping fragments starting at line 85: Must specify mapping for all key properties (Usages.Id) of table Usages. Question - So the question is what changes to the XML do I need to make to have the association work correctly? SQL CREATE TABLE "ProcessNames" ( "Id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL , "Name" VARCHAR NOT NULL UNIQUE ) CREATE TABLE "Usages" ( "Id" INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT NOT NULL , "ProcessNameId" INTEGER NOT NULL , "Amount" INTEGER NOT NULL , "Datetime" DATETIME NOT NULL ) Model Config thanks
