You have text of arbitrary line length (in terms of characters) and you want to scale it to fit inside a fixed amount of space? The only way I can think of to rescale text to a fixed size is to place it inside an svg element and then scale the SVG to that size: Resizing Text It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine! However, as seen above, the viewBox on the encapsulating svg element needs to be set to the width of the text, which you presumably don't know. If you're referencing this SVG inside a user agent with scripting available (e.g. a web browser) then you could easily write a script to capture the width of the text or tspan element and set the viewBox accordingly.
