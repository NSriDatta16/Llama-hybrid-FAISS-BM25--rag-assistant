I am intrigued by this "feature" also and how to avoid it. Reading the post: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=4536 (read the comment #10). I quote the relevant part below: Workarounds are: 1) Don't use an activity, do everything from a service. 2) Have some kind of intermediate Home (WidgetLocker HomeHelper, QuickDesk, PowerStrip, etc). These do a startActivity immediate to start the "real" Home and this bypasses the 5 second rule. This is a bad idea as Android prioritizes keeping the system Home in memory but not whatever secondary Home the intermediate set. So it can lead to Launcher reloads which is no fun. Plus it's very confusing to users. 3) Root can start activities during this period. Among those, I believe the best way to do it is to create a "Home Helper"-like activity . So, instead of starting a new activity, you would call this one instead . This is specially true, since you are creating a launcher app. As I said in my previous comment to the question, I would contact the WidgetLocker developer about it. Alternatively, you can use APK Manager to see how he implemented it (he even encouraged the use of the APK Manager to create different mods to his app, the link to the xda-developers thread is in the comment above)
