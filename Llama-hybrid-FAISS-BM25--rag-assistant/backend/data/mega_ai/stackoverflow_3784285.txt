How to pass AWK output into variable?

I have a small bash script that greps/awk paragraph by using a keyword. But after adding in the extra codes : set var = "(......)" it only prints a blank line and not the paragraph. So I would like to ask if anyone knows how to properly pass the awk output into a variable for outputting? My codes: #!/bin/sh set var = "(awk 'BEGIN{RS=ORS="\n\n";FS=OFS="\n"}/FileHeader/' /root/Desktop /logs/Default.log)" echo $var; Thanks!
