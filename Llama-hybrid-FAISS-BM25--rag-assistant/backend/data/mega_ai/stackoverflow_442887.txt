I can't get to make the plugin work with ganymede (linux version). When setting the jadclipse class viewer i get the following error in the log file of the workspace (.metadata/.log) java.lang.IncompatibleClassChangeError at net.sf.jadclipse.JadclipseClassFileEditor.doOpenBuffer(JadclipseClassFileEditor.java:101) at net.sf.jadclipse.JadclipseClassFileEditor.doSetInput(JadclipseClassFileEditor.java:45) at net.sf.jadclipse.JadclipseActionBarContributor.setActiveEditor(JadclipseActionBarContributor.java:87) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.EditorActionBars.partChanged(EditorActionBars.java:335) at org.eclipse.ui.internal.WorkbenchPage$3.run(WorkbenchPage.java:628) .....(i don't think the rest of the stack trace is important) Perhaps jadclipse isn't compatible with the version of its eclipse dependencies (on this line jadclipse makes a call to a class defined in the JDT plugin), but i didn't have the time to figure this out. EDIT: i've simply recompiled the jar using the svn repository and created a new jar for java 1.5 and it seems to work ( Download here ). Just download my jar and put in the plugin folder of eclipse and remove the old one.
