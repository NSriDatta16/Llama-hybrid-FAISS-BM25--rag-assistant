How do I calculate the previous business day in ksh shell script?

What is the most elegant way to calculate the previous business day in shell ksh script ? What I got until now is : #!/bin/ksh set -x DAY_DIFF=1 case `date '+%a'` in "Sun") DAY_DIFF=2 ;; "Mon") DAY_DIFF=3 ;; esac PREV_DT=`perl -e '($sec,$min,$hour,$mday,$mon,$year,$wday,$yday,$isdst)=localtime(time()-${DAY_DIFF}*24*60*60);printf "%4d%02d%02d",$year+1900,$mon+1,$mday;'` echo $PREV_DT How do I make the ${DAY_DIFF} variable to be transmitted as value and not as string ?
