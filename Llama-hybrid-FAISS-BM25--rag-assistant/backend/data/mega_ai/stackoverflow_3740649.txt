Using multiple source files to organize your code can dramatically improve not only compile times but also workflow. It can allow more people to work simultaneously with less chance to step on each others toes. Breaking classes into multiple header files is not always the best method, and can often lead to confusion and problems compiling the code. I wouldn't always recommend only one class per header file, but definitely only one header per class.
