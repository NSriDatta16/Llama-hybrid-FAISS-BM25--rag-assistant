MDI Child.show() displays the form in a weird manner

I have a main form that has 5 MDI children. When the main form is created, the mdi children are created and shown as well. I assign them different locations on the screen, but when they're shown they start with the default location and move in a disturbing way to the new locations. I tried to assign the location before I show the forms , but as expected after calling the.Show() they tend to go to some default location. Is there anyway to avoid showing this movement from the default to the new locations? Here's a code fragment groupSettingsForm.Show(); groupSettingsForm.Location = new Point(0, 0); dsForm.Show(); dsForm.Location = new Point(groupSettingsForm.Width, 0); dPlots.Show(); dPlots.Location = new Point(groupSettingsForm.Width, dsForm.Height); alertsForm.Show(); alertsForm.Location = new Point(groupSettingsForm.Width, dsForm.Height + dPlots.Height); dataValuesForm.Show(); dataValuesForm.Location = new Point(0, groupSettingsForm.Height); I tried this, but it didn't work for me groupSettingsForm.Location = new Point(0, 0); groupSettingsForm.Show(); dsForm.Location = new Point(groupSettingsForm.Width, 0); dsForm.Show(); dPlots.Location = new Point(groupSettingsForm.Width, dsForm.Height); dPlots.Show(); alertsForm.Location = new Point(groupSettingsForm.Width, dsForm.Height + dPlots.Height); alertsForm.Show(); dataValuesForm.Location = new Point(0, groupSettingsForm.Height); dataValuesForm.Show();
