Xgboost can use deep or shallow trees (you can set a maximum tree depth). The default xgboost tree depth is 6; see the xgboost documentation . Likewise, random forest can use deep or shallow trees for the same reason. For example, the implementation in sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier has no maximum depth by default, so the behavior is "nodes are expanded until all leaves are pure or until all leaves contain less than min_samples_split samples."
