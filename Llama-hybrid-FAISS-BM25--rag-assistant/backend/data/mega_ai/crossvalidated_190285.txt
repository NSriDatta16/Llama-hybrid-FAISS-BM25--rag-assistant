Local Response Normalization(LRN) type of layer turns out to be useful when using neurons with unbounded activations (e.g. rectified linear neurons), because it permits the detection of high-frequency features with a big neuron response, while damping responses that are uniformly large in a local neighborhood. It is a type of regularizer that encourages "competition" for big activities among nearby groups of neurons. src- https://code.google.com/p/cuda-convnet/wiki/LayerParams#Local_response_normalization_layer_(same_map)
