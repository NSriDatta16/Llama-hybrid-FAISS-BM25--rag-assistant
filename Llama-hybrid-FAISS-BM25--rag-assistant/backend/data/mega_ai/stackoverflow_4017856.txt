Creating a data structure to compare 300 elements with each other

First of all, I'm looking at the interactions between around 300 elements. Each element will interact with all others and itself. In a minority of these cases, a reaction will occur, and I will mark that reaction. Since this is basically a matrix with around 90,000 possible interactions, I want to manage this data with code so I can easily test the interactions however I would like to until I have them all tested. Since I obviously won't do all of them in one sitting, the data would have to be stored on disk somehow. Here's my question: What would be the ideal data structure design for this? I generally use relational databases for data storage, and this particular problem doesn't seem to mesh very well with an RDB. Please let me know if I'm not being clear.
