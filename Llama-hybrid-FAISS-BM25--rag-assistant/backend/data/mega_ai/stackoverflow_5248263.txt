Your question is unclear to everyone. If you want to calculate the median value, use this approach:- Sort array in ascending order If array length is odd, the median is the middle value from the array. If array length is even, the median is the average of lower middle value and upper middle value from the array. If this is not a school homework, then you can use Commons Math to cut down the amount of code to write. For example:- DescriptiveStatistics ds = new DescriptiveStatistics(); ds.addValue(10); ds.addValue(10); ds.addValue(30); // median is basically 50th percentile System.out.println(ds.getPercentile(50)); // displays 10
