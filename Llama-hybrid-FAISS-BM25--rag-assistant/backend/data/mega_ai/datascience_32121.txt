How can I infer no target in a target classification problem based on deep learning?

Let's take the MNIST dataset (My application is different) with a lot of noise, I am going to train a deep NN to classify the letters. What's the right way to infer, there's no letter possibility? or a letter not included in the training set? Do I have to add the class "not a letter" and try to pick or simulate the part of the dataset that has no letters but noise, Or, I can do it without adding the extra label?
