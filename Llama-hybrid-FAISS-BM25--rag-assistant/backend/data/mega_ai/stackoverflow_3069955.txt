rake stats will give you a simple comparison based on line count. Rcov will give you a good picture of your test-coverage. But you should absolutely check out metric-fu ! Includes all kinds of packages, all analysis tools can be run from with a simple rake metrics:all , and generates nice reporting ... in short: awesome ;) Hope this helps :)
