The following paper shoud be relevant: Abstract.Differences-in-differences (DID) is a method to evaluate the effect ofa treatment. In its basic version, a “control group” is untreated at two dates,whereas a “treatment group” becomes fully treated at the second date. However,in many applications of this method, the treatment rate only increases more inthe treatment group. In such fuzzy designs, de Chaisemartin and D’Haultfœuille(2018b) propose various estimands that identify local average and quantile treat-ment effects under different assumptions. They also propose estimands that canbe used in applications with a non-binary treatment, multiple periods and groupsand covariates. This paper presents the Stata commandfuzzydid, which com-putes the various corresponding estimators. We illustrate the use of the commandby revisiting Gentzkow et al. (2011). de Chaisemartin, C., D’Haultfœuille, X., & Guyonvarch, Y. (2019). Fuzzy differences-in-differences with Stata. The Stata Journal, 19(2), 435-458.
