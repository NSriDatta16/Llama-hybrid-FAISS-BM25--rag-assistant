SQL server total/pivot

I have a question about how to “pivot/total” (for want of a better word) some data around in SQL server. The data is basically staff shifts and then hours lost from those shifts. So for example I have a record in one table Staff_ID Shift_start Shift_end 37 09:00 17:30 And then we would give that person a lunch in another table Staff_ID Start End 37 13:00 14:00 Of course we have more agents throughout the day and the scheme above is simplified but you get the idea. This is then transformed into the number of staff in 15 minutes Interval Staff 09:00 5 09:15 7 09:30 6 And so on. At the moment SQL server stores all of this but to “total” the agents up I have to bring things into Access and using arrays work out the number of staff in each 15 minute period and then save this data back to the database. It’s a quick process ( Am I barking up the wrong tree with this one? EDIT: I'm using SQL server 2008R2 Express
