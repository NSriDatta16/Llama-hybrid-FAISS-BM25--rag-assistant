Why only Google? Microsoft has launched a CDN too and these days I am linking to the MS CDN instead of Google to fetch Jquery. If I rephrased your question to read 'What is the advantage of linking from a CDN?', I would answer it thus. The CDN will have a number of servers and there might be one closely geo-located and better serviced than yours (faster), though it won't matter cause typically JQuery will be a small fragment of your data. That's it. I can't think of any other advantage. None. Nada. Nil. In fact I can think of a disadvantage that you are going to have slightly less control over your content. Don't think that the big corps are being generous with their money giving you free bandwidth. Being in control of your website is their business.
