There are many good natural language processing (NLP) toolkits which will do sentence identification and extraction. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing_toolkits for a list. Your requirement for "similar sentences" needs clarification. Maybe you are looking for a treebank ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Treebank ) where sentences are parsed and compared.
