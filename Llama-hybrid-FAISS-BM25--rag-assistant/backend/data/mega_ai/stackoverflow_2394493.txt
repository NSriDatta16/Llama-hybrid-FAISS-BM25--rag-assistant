Migrating data from Plone to Liferay, or how could I retrieve information from Plone's Data.fs

I need to migrate data from a Plone-based portal to Liferay. Has anyone some idea on how to do it? Anyway, I am trying to retrieve data from Data.fs and store it in a representation easier to work, such as JSON. To do it, I need to know which objects I should get from Plone's Data.fs. I already got the Products.CMFPlone.Portal.PloneSite instance from the Data.fs, but I cannot get anything from it. I would like to get the PloneSite instance and do something like this: >>> import ZODB >>> from ZODB import FileStorage, DB >>> path = r"C:\Arquivos de programas\Plone\var\filestorage\Data.fs" >>> storage = FileStorage.FileStorage(path) >>> db = DB(storage) >>> conn = db.open() >>> root = conn.root() >>> app = root['Application'] >>> plone_site = app.getChildNodes()[13] # 13 would be index of PloneSite object >>> a = plone_site.get_articles() >>> for article in a: ... print "Title:", a.title ... print "Content:", a.content Title: Conent: Title: Conent: Of course, it did not need to be so straightforward. I just want some information about the structure of PloneSite and how to recover its data. Has anyone some idea? Thank you in advance!
