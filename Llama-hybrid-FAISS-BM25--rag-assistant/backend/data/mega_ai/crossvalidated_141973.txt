As an initial approach, I'd try first to fit a logistic regression. I don't get why you are working with the log(variables). If poor performance is present then try to plot the error as a function of the size of the data to check if the poor performance is related to bias/variance issue. In case of high variance try more powerful models as Neural Networks etc...
