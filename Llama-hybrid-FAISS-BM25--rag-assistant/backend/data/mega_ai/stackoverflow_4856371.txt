If this is an enterprise-wide or web-delivered app run by hundreds or thousands of users, pay particular attention to color depth, gradients, and frivilous animations. Especially that last one. A 16x16 spinning "sync" icon won't eat too much bandwidth, but larger things may generate a lot of traffic. Gradients look crappy when the color level goes down, and they don't compress well. Color levels go down when network/system admins need to squeeze more out of the network. You may not be able to control it. These concerns would also apply to Citrix apps, which typically run without a full desktop. One extra consideration with that, is that users won't see the system tray notification area.
