Basically what you should do is write a CLR profiler and use the profiler API in c++ You need to implement the ICorProfilerCallback interface. What you are looking for is in the JITCompilationStarted callback. This method is called each time a managed method gets called and before the jit compiler compiles the IL into machine code. Any code insertion work during run time should be done in JITCompilationStarted. You can look at the open source coverage tool part cover as an example how to do it.
