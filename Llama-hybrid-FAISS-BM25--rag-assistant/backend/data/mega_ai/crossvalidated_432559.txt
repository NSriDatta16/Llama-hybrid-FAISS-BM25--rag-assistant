Partitioning of a Self Organizing Map (SOM) in n clusters

I created the following 9x9 SOM (yellow = small distance between two neurons, red/black = large distance): I know that I can regard each neuron as a separate cluster and that neurons with small distances can be regarded as bigger clusters but I am wondering if there is any (algorithmic) approach to split the whole SOM into n clusters. Looking at my map I would suggest to split the map into 3 clusters.
