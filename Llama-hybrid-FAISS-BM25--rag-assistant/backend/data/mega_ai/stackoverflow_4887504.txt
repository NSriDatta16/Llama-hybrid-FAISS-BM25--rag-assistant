Can XMLHttpRequest data be stored in localStorage?

I am writing a Safari extension that makes an XMLHttpRequest for some XML data using jQuery.ajax. If I do console.log(data) in the process data function, I get an item Document which I can traverse. I want to store this ajax data in localStorage. So in the first few lines of the processDocument function I have this: function processResponse(data) { localStorage.removeItem("myData"); localStorage.setItem("myData", data); console.log('post-load: there are ' + localStorage.length + ' items in the local storage array.'); console.log("post-load data: " + data); console.log("post-load myData: " + localStorage.myData); The console.log will show me: post-load: there are 1 items in the local storage array. post-load data: [object Document] post-load myData: [object Document] So it looks like I have valid data here. But the messageHandler function when it responds to the button on the toolbar also polls the local storage like this: console.log('There are ' + localStorage.length + ' items in the local storage array.'); for (var x = 0; x The console log here will show: There are 1 items in the local storage array. 0: undefined myData is defined Is there something I need to do in order to properly store this XML data in localStorage? Shouldn't localStorage preserve the integrity of this object? Perhaps I am missing something here.
