Alternatively, you could let MySQL format the date for you on retrieval (makes for cleaner code in building your XML): SELECT event_date, DATE_FORMAT( event_date, '%W %D %M' ) AS event_date_formatted FROM ... Then in PHP: $xml_output .= "\t\t " . $row['event_date_formatted'] . " \n"; Also: MySQL date formatting functions are a bit more flexible, as they don't depend on unix timestamps that much (if you use DATETIME fields, that is). Admittedly a bit unlikely perhaps; but if your event_date exceeds the unsigned 32 bit integer timestamp boundaries, your pretty much screwed with php's date function. Try formatting a date before January 1st 1970, or after January 19th 2038, and you will see what I mean.
