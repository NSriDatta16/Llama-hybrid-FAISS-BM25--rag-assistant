How can I use data on customer interactions to drive communication strategy?

I have data on my customers (age, location, gender) and number of interactions with customer by channel (#calls, #sms, #letters) and data on whether they have bought a product (yes/no). I would like to predict what combination of interaction (e.g. 3 calls, 2 letters) is the best approach when contacting different types of customers. What would be an appropriate statistical/ machine learning technique to use to calculate this?
