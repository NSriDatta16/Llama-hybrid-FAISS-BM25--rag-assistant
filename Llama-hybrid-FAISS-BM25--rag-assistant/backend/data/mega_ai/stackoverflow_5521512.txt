I recommend using LINQ To XML and storing the XML files in isolated storage. The technology is great. It has intellisense in VS and the syntax is similar to SQL so you should be able to pick it up easily. Ive used this for a similar scenario like yours and the performance was good. Here is a link to a sample to help you get started: LINQ TO XML Sample The nice thing is once you learn this you can use it when reading web services, writing to xml files, updating etc. Let me know if this helps. Update: With mango we now have access to SQL Server Compact. All the info is at MSDN .
