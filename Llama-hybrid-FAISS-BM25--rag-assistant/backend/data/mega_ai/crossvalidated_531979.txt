Logistic Regression - Feature Interpretation

I have fit a logistic regression to predict a given binary outcome, and the estimated coefficient associated with one of the features, feature $x$ let's say, has a value $\theta$ . The interpretation of this coefficient is that an increase by one unit of feature $x$ , will increase the odds of the outcome by a factor of $e^\theta$ . Is it possible to quantify/approximate by how much the "probability of the outcome" (not the odds) will increase/decrease given an increase by one unit of feature $x$ ?
