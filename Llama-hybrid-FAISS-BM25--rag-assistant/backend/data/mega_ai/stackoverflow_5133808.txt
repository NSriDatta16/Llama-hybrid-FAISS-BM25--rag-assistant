You can always store current id in some variable in ActionScript. Then You will be able to rewrite the whole query string. I think You can write something like this: stmt.text = "SELECT * FROM cardItems WHERE id > " + current_id + " ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1;"; The current_id is an ActionScript variable. This should be good enough for sqlite. You may set current_id to 0 for the first record. If a user click a next button, You should store there current id from the already received record. The second option is to use OFFSET . It exclude some records from the beginning of returned set of rows. stmt.text = "SELECT * FROM cardItems ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1 OFFSET " + your_offset + ";"; The your_offset is an ActionScript variable. It is 0 if You want get the first record, 1 for second, 2 for third and so on. === Try this code. protected function button6_clickHandler(event:MouseEvent):void // pushed --> button { var cardNumber:int = parseInt(cardNumberLabel.text); /* Deleted */ var sqlresult:SQLResult = stmt.getResult(); stmt.sqlConnection = conn; conn.open(File.applicationStorageDirectory.resolvePath("FlashCards.db")); /*Edited two lines*/ stmt.text = "SELECT * FROM cardItems WHERE id > ? ORDER BY id ASC LIMIT 1"; stmt.parameters[0] = cardNumber; stmt.execute(); trace(sqlresult.data); // value = [object Object] stext1.text = sqlresult.data.cSide1; trace(sqlresult.data.cSide1); // value = 'undefined' cardNumberLabel.text = sqlresult.data.id; trace(sqlresult.data.id); // value = 'undefined' conn.close(); moveEffectRPart1.play(); moveEffectRPart1.addEventListener(EffectEvent.EFFECT_END, nextMoveRPart); }
