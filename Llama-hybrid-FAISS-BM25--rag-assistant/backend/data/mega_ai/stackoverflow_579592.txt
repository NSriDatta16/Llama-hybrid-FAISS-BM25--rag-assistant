I think what you call it depends on the nature of the conversation. If the conversation is behavior oriented (i.e. I want this area to change based on x, or these to be drag gable) than a solution agnostic term like dynamic is probably best. If you are speaking about a specific solution it would be best to use the language/technology specific terminology for clarity.
