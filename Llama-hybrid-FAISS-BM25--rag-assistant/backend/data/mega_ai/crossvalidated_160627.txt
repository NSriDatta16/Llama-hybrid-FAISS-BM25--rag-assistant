Does ARIMA(0,1,11)4 exist?

I have, without luck, searched to find what an ARIMA model that is differenced once, and has two moving average terms (one at lag 1 and one at lag 4) is called. The equation for what I am asking for is the following: $(1-B)Y_t= (1-0.5B-0.2B^4)a_t$. What I have come up with of possibilities are: ARIMA(0,1,2)4 ARIMA(0,1,1,1)4 ARIMA(0,1,1 1)4
