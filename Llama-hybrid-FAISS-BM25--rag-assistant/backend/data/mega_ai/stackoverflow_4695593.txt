What's the simplest way to detect a touch on the iphone screen?

Despite the accepted answer, I'm still hoping for a more detailed one, with examples. I got many views and I just want to, wherever the user is, gather the touch input on the screen. How can we, despite the warnings , detect the touch from any class without worrying about other views? edit: I've tried using touchesBegan on the front most view (which is working fine) and [super touchesBegan ...] or [self.nextResponder ...] but that didn't trigger it from the main class. I also tried using UIImage from the back view with no success. Lastly I though of using some alert, but I'm not sure if it's possible to tweak it as to make it invisible, so I decided asking first what's the best way. Specially good if it's iOS3 compatible.
