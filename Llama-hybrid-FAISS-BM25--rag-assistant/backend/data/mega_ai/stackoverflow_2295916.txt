You should use a digital sigantures scheme of some sort, or some other mechanism that is aimed to solve the integrity problem of your scenario. The encryption itself isn't enough. How would you know that the decrypted messege is what it should be? Decrypting a cookie encrypted with the right key will surely provide a "valid" cookie, but what happens when you decrypt a cookie encrypted with the wrong key? or just some meaningless data? well, you might just get a cookie that looks valid! (the timestamps are in the range you consider valid, the username is legal, the random number is... uh... a number, etc.). In most asymmetric encryption algorithms I know off, there is no built-in validation. That means that decrypting a message with the wrong key will not "fail" - it will only give you a wrong plaintext, which you must distinguish from a valid plaintext. This is where integrity comes to play, most commonly - using digital signatures. BTW, RSA is long studied and has several "gotchas", so if you plan to implement it from scratch you better read ahead on how to avoid creating "relatively easy to break" keys.
