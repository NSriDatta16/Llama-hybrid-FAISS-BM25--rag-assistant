MSTest.exe not finding app.config

I'm currently trying to run MSTest.exe from NCover, but I believe the question could apply generally to running MSTest.exe from the command line. If I have the "/noisolation" argument, then MSTest.exe appears to find and use the app.config as expected. Without it, NCover doesn't capture any coverage information. From my research so far, it seems NCover needs /noisolation. So the question is how to get my *.config files to work when that argument is passed. My NCover settings are: Application to Profile C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\MSTest.exe Working Folder C:\Documents and Settings\MyProfile\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\XYZ\XYZ.CoreTest\bin\Debug Application arguments /noisolation /testcontainer:"C:\Documents and Settings\MyProfile\My Documents\Visual Studio 2008\Projects\XYZ\XYZ.CoreTest\bin\Debug\XYZ.CoreTest.dll" Update: I added a trace showing that my config is (not surprisingly) trying to read from "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 9.0\Common7\IDE\MSTest.exe.Config". Update 2: If at all possible, I don't want to edit MSTest.exe.Config. That just isn't terribly portable.
