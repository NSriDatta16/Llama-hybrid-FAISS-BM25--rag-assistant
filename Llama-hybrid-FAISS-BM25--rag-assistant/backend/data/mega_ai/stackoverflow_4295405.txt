Use Audacity. Take a small recording of typical speech, and cut it down to one wavelength, from one peak to another peak. Subtract the two times, and divide 1 by that number and you'll get the frequency of your wave in Hz. Example: In my audio clip, my waveform runs from 0.0760 to 0.0803 seconds. 0.0803-0.0760 = 0.0043 1/0.0043 = 232.558 Hz, my typical speech frequency This might give you a good basis to create an analyzer. You'd need to detect the peaks, and time between the peaks of the wave and do an average calculation of the result.
