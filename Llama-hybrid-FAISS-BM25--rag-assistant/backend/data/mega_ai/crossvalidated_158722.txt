Reproduce this chart using the provided equation

I am trying to reproduce this chart: which depicts the probability of various a gene is insert in a mutant screen by a transposon. Apparently the graph is constructed from the following equation: where Pi s the probability of finding one insert within a given gene, x is the average length of a gene transcript (1.7 kb), y is the total length of transcribed region in the gene space (113.1 Mb), Rtr is the probability of insertion into a transcription region within the gene space (0.573), Rgs is the probability of insertion into gene space in the whole genome (0.786), and N is the total number of Tnt1 inserts required. However when I try and use this equation to generate the data, say for a 1.7Kbp gene I get this: N Where the values are nothing like the chart. I have tried converting the kb and mb values to the same units but this did not help. I feel that I must be interpreting the equation wrong and must be super obvious and staring me in the face but I just cant see it. To be clear, I am fine with recreating the aesthetic effects I just need help regenerating the data.
