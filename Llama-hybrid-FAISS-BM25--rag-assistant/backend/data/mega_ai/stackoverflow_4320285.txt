jQuery UI: Drag Sortable from within Accordion to Outside

I have two sortable lists that are connected. One is simply on the page, the other is within an accordion. (I'm using the accordion as a container for the other list) My goal is such that a user can open the accordion and pull items out of that list and onto the page. It works - except the placeholder disappears upon leaving the accordion. I've tried helper: 'clone' and increasing the zIndex. Here is a simplified version of the code: $(document).ready(function(){ $( "#inside" ).accordion({ collapsible: true, fillSpace: true, active: false }); $("#ulOutsideList, #ulInsideList").sortable({ opacity: 0.7, revert: 100, scroll: true, helper: 'clone', zIndex: 50000, connectWith: ".connectedSortable", }); }); outside 1 outside 2 outside 3 container inside 1 inside 2 inside 3
