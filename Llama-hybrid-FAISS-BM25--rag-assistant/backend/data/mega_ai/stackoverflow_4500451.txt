Of course I'm late to this but nevertheless wanted to mention for the record that this issue was discussed last year on the git mailing list and it looks like not much has changed since. This particular issue stems from splitting and attempting to edit the same hunk. The analysis, as originally posted by Jeff King, of the underlying problem essentially is: Hm. OK, I see. The "does this diff apply" check feeds both parts of the split patch to git-apply. But of course the second part will never correctly apply, because its context overlaps with the first part, but doesn't take it into account. Doing the check with just the edited patch would work. But that doesn't take into account that your edited patch will potentially fail to apply in the long run, depending on whether or not you accept the other half of the split patch. And we can't know that yet, because the user may not have told us (they could have skipped the first half, and then come back to it later after the edit step). Jeff concludes his post with a very pragmatic workaround that always succeeds, and is thus highly recommended: So in general, I think splitting and editing the same hunk is inherently dangerous and is going to lead to these sorts of problems. And because editing provides a superset of the functionality, I think you should just edit and either allow the first part of the hunk to be applied or not depending on your preference. By only choosing to edit a hunk not previously split, you will not have to deal with the line numbers.
