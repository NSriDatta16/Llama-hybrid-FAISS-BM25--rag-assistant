Control the period for daily time series in tsibbles

I am using Rob Hyndman's fpp3 packages and his tsibbles. I struggle to understand how to define the period of a daily time series. If I have say two years of daily data, I have the choice to define the period to be 7 or 365.25. But I don't know how to do this. Example code: set.seed(3011) day.sequence % as_tsibble(index = Day) Where do I define the proper period in the call to as_tsibble()? Or do I need to define when I fit an exponential smoothing model? Thanks!
