Signal's listener must be initiated before calling the signal - try to import ragbackend.py in models.py before registering a signal - if it will start working you have the clue about solution. Also do not use print, use python built-in logging module instead. You could also run debugging session with ie. ipdb to see if the signal is received and if the user is created, ot you could write simple unit-test or doctest to verify that.
