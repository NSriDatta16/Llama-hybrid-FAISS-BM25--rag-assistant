feature selection of multivariate time series forecasting with fsMTS package

The fsMTS package uses the following example: # Load traffic data data(traffic.mini) # A tibble: 6 x 4 datetime rnd_86775 rnd_92909 rnd_87171 1 2017-07-30 00:05:00 25 0 25.5 2 2017-07-30 00:10:00 14.5 0 13 3 2017-07-30 00:15:00 49.5 -0.5 12.5 4 2017-07-30 00:20:00 12 2 22.5 5 2017-07-30 00:25:00 19 -1 28 6 2017-07-30 00:30:00 2.5 0 7 # Scale and exclude the first column - it contains timestamps data How do I interpret the output of the cutoff function above? For example, if rnd_86775 is the target feature that I want to forecast and I want a lag of 3, which one of the last three rows do I use? The row corresponding to rnd_86775.l3 doesn't include my target feature in that case, and only indicates to select rnd_92909.l3 .
