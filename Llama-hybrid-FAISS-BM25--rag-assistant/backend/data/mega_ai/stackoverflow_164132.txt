If I'm looking for a collection class and I need thread safe capabilities and your class doesn't have them, I'm immediately going to skip to the next offering out there to see what they provide. Your collection won't get any more of my attention. Note the "If" at the beginning. Some customers will want it, some will not, and some won't care. If you're going to build a tool-kit for consumers, then why not offer both varieties? That way I can choose which one to use, but if I want thread-safe you still have my attention and I don't have to write it myself.
