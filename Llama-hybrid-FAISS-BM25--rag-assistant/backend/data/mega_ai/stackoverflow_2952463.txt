You'd do something along the lines of: =IF(A1="Y","Yes","No") This would put the word Yes in the cell the formula resides in if the value in cell A1 = Y. You can then drag that out using the fill handle (little black square in the bottom right corner of the cell) to copy for the rest of the column.
