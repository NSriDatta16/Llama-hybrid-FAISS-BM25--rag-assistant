Deprecate Typedef

I have a few TypeDefs that I want to deprecate. I am doing this to retain backward compatibility with code that already exists. Is there an elegant (or maybe not so elegant) solution to this? I would like it to be platform independent but if there is a Visual Studio only solution, that will do as well.
