Time series analysis: multiplicative model and seasonal adjustment of data

I am trying to help a friend in statistics and this question involving time series came up and I did not know what to do. I tried searching different stack exchange forums for answers, but I believe this might be to basic because I could find none. Now to the problem at hand: The product sales in a business (billions of swedish crowns, SEC) have been the follwoing during the last three years. +------+------+-------+--------+-------+ | Year | Q. I | Q. II | Q. III | Q. IV | +------+------+-------+--------+-------+ | 2012 | 2.4 | 2.9 | 2.8 | 3.8 | +------+------+-------+--------+-------+ | 2013 | 2.7 | 3.2 | 3.2 | 4.3 | +------+------+-------+--------+-------+ | 2014 | 3.2 | 3.7 | 3.6 | 4.8 | +------+------+-------+--------+-------+ a) Seasonally adjust the time series with multiplicative model. I am sorry for the bad table, this was the best I could do. How do we seasoanlly adjust the data? I know that this means that we try to account for the variability of different seasons, but how do we go about this in this example? I have found out that the multiplicative model is \begin{align} \hat{y} = T\cdot S\cdot C\cdot I \end{align} where $T$ , $S$ , $C$ and $I$ denote trend, seasonal, cylical and irregular component, respectively. So how do I compute these components? (I found this on wikipedia ).
