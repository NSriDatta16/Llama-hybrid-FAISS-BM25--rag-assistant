how to organize country data?

how do i organize country data (countries, states and cities etc) in mysql? cause every country has 3 tables: countries, states and cities. should i have each country in separate set of tables or should i have them all in these 3 tables? if i have all of them in same tables, im afraid that the amount of rows will be huge cause i tend to have a lot of countries! what is best practice for this?
