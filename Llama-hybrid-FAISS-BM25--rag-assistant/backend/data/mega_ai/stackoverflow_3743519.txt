How to balance binary tree in PHP without rotating parent?

I will try to make myself as clear as possible. Based from Adjacency List Model: http://articles.sitepoint.com/article/hierarchical-data-database I need a way to balance this tree 0 / \ 1 2 / / \ 3 4 5 \ \ 6 7 to something like: 0 / \ 1 2 / \ / \ 3 4 5 6 / 7 Based from the sample Code: I modified the code so it can output a flat html table like this: $super_parent = '0000' left Node entries into flat list: ____________________________________________________ | No. | Date of Entry | Account ID | Placement| ------------------------------------------------------ | 1 | 2010-08-24 11:19:19 | 1111a | a | | 2 | 2010-08-24 11:19:19 | 22221a_a | a | | 3 | 2010-08-24 11:19:19 | 33_2aa | b | | 4 | 2010-08-24 11:19:19 | 33_2Ra | a | | 5 | 2010-08-24 11:19:19 | 22221a_b | b | | 6 | 2010-08-24 11:19:19 | 33_2ba | a | | 7 | 2010-08-24 11:19:19 | 33_2bb | b | ------------------------------------------------------ But I need a way to reorganize all this into a balanced tree without moving or rotating the parent. Although I can think of creating a duplicate table in the db and do a second query to display or create another Binaray tree, I thought it may be possible to reorganize a flat tree like this into: 0 / \ 1 2 / \ / \ 3 4 5 6 / 7 From left to right. 0 represents the parent or super_parent 0000. The reason I would like to do this is so I can create a virtual tree from the original tree that will be the basis of another algorithm in my project. Thanks in advance. Bob
