I'm dogbane ! I've been participating in SO (and other Stackexchange sites) for a while now and I believe the time is right for me to step up and become " more than just a member ". If I am made moderator I will be able to contribute my knowledge and experience to helping members and to keeping this forum clean and free of spam (and duplicate questions!). I will ban the spammers, rule breakers, flame-baiters and rep-whores. But will encourage and protect the underdog. I will try my best to work hand-in-hand with users whilst trying not to abuse my powers. If a conflict arises, I will put myself in the other person's shoes to see things from their perspective and make a fair and unbiased decision. Vote for a new age. Vote dogbane.
