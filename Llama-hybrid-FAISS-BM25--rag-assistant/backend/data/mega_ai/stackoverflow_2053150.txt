I tried @nobugz method and it worked. Once you set the properties of each *.xml file to: The best way to organize it is to add the .xml files to your project with Project + Add Existing. Select them in Solution Explorer and in the Properties window set Build action = None and Copy to Output Directory = Copy if Newer. Build. That puts the files in the same directory as your .exe. Then put this to get your path for each case in your switch case replacing "filename" with each filename you have. string[] YourVar = getKeywords(string.Format("{0}\\APIs\\filename.xml", Path.GetDirectoryName(System.Reflection.Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly().Location)));
