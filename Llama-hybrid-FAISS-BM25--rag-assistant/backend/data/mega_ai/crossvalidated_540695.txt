I'm going to assume that determining whether two time series' data has the same distribution truly is the only thing that matters here, and that there's no other question being asked. You need to assume that your time series has a stationary solution. This means that despite there being potential dependence in the observations, there is a distribution that can describe any observation's potential value at any point in time ( not conditioning on any other observation in the time series' value), and this distribution does not change over time. If the time series is stationary, then yes, you can compare the distribution of the two time series, via K-L or any other functional of the (empirical) distribution of the observations.
