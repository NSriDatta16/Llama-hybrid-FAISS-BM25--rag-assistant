Don't forget CDI/JSR-299, part of Java EE 6. You can use weld-wicket to integrate wicket with CDI. (as long as you're using the weld implementation (as GlassFish v3 and JBoss 6 do), but the weld-wicket is rather small so you could probably adapt it if needed). I managed to get Wicket 1.4 + weld-wicket + wicket-contrib-javaee + EJB 3.1 + JPA 2.0 + wicket-security (SWARM) + Spring Security 3 + Spring 3 running together in a small proof of concept application. That's a bit too many frameworks though, will probably drop spring-security & spring as they appear redundant.
