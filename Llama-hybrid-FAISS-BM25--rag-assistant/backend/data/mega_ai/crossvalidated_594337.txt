Logistic regression is a fine approach even in this case. The problem is that a simple linear relationship (on the log odds scale) is insufficient to model this relationship. You need to introduce non-linearity into the conditional mean, and this is most easily done with a spline. Rather than let $$\operatorname{logit}(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x $$ let the linear predictor be $$\operatorname{logit}(p) = \beta_0 + f(x)$$ Where $f(x)$ is some spline function. Because splines can be represented as linear combinations of non-linear functions, we can estimate this using the same machinery we do for linear models. Shown below is an example. In red is the true conditional mean, which was used to generate the black dots. In black is the estimated conditional mean using a natural spline.
