Normally you create a Lucene index in application servers like JBoss and Tomcat in the current directory (.), index folder is created in bin folder, which is not a good idea at all. You can either store your index files in database (or virtually any other storing device) using Compass or store it in a path on the file system. There is no special per-application storage as far as I know in Java EE containers.
