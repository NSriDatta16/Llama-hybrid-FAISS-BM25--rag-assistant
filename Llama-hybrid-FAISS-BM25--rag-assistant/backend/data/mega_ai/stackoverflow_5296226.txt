T-SQL query to get Index fragmentation information

I've been developing a query to get index fragmentation information using DMVs. However, the query gives more results than expected. I believe the problem is in joins. Any thoughts? select distinct '['+DB_NAME(database_id)+']' as DatabaseName, '['+DB_NAME(database_id)+'].['+sch.name+'].[' + OBJECT_NAME(ips.object_id)+']' as TableName, i.name as IndexName, ips.index_type_desc as IndexType, avg_fragmentation_in_percent as avg_fragmentation, SUM(row_count) as Rows FROM sys.indexes i INNER JOIN sys.dm_db_index_physical_stats(NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,'LIMITED') ips ON i.object_id = ips.object_id INNER JOIN sys.tables tbl ON tbl.object_id = ips.object_id INNER JOIN sys.schemas sch ON sch.schema_id = tbl.schema_id INNER JOIN sys.dm_db_partition_stats ps ON ps.object_id = ips.object_id WHERE avg_fragmentation_in_percent <> 0.0 AND ips.database_id = 6 AND OBJECT_NAME(ips.object_id) not like '%sys%' GROUP BY database_id, sch.name, ips.object_id, avg_fragmentation_in_percent, i.name, ips.index_type_desc ORDER BY avg_fragmentation_in_percent desc
