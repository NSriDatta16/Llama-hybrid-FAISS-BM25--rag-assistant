Random Forest regression: Input variables most likely to maximize output variable

I have a large number of observations of the form: i1, i2...in -> output I "trained" a random forest using two thirds of the data and verified the predictions made using the random forest on the last third. The "fit" is good and the predictions are of very high quality. Now, I would like to figure out which arrangement of input variables tends to maximize the output variable. I know random forests never yield output values that exceed the maximum output value found in the training dataset. I also realize random forests are not designed for that type of work, but I can imagine a dominant arrangement of input variables that is most likely to approach the maximum value. All input variables are continuous in this case. Any ideas? Based on the feedback below, here is a data sample: 99.5980361 100.1584786 100.1582278 100.1579779 100 100.3943218 100.3142184 98.59044636 100.5968869 99.36127373 100.1594392 99.75728155 99.43227899 100.4893964 99.51298701 100.6525285 100.3241491 100.8077544 98.74569242 99.34908777 100.0746469 99.66352624 99.79743417 100.67659 99.59677419 100 99.52766532 101.3559322 101.1724732 99.33385205 The last number is the result variable. I sorted the observations in descending order by the result variable values. Let's say I take all observations for which the result variable value is greater than 99.5 and then average average the values of all predictor variable values for those observations. Would the resulting array of averaged predictor variable values correspond to the arrangement of predictor variables most likely to maximize the output variable?
