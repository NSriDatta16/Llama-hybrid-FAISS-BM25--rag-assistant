It's a bit too late but just in case; A Sample may refer to individual training examples. A “batch_size” variable is hence the count of samples you sent to the neural network. That is, how many different examples you feed at once to the neural network. TimeSteps are ticks of time. It is how long in time each of your samples is. For example, a sample can contain 128-time steps, where each time steps could be a 30th of a second for signal processing. In Natural Language Processing (NLP), a time step may be associated with a character, a word, or a sentence, depending on the setup. Features are simply the number of dimensions we feed at each time steps. For example in NLP, a word could be represented by 300 features using word2vec. In the case of signal processing, let’s pretend that your signal is 3D. That is, you have an X, a Y and a Z signal, such as an accelerometer’s measurements on each axis. This means you would have 3 features sent at each time step for each sample. By Guillaume
