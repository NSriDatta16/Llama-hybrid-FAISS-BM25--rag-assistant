NFOP performance problem

We're using NFOP in a project (C#, ASP.NET 2.0) to ultimately return PDF files to the user. The process currently goes like this: Stored Procedure -> XML XML -> XSLT -> XSL-FO XSL-FO -> NFOP -> PDF This works fine, the PDF is generated BEAUTIFULLY. The problem is that it takes 300+ seconds to do it. The ANTS profiler indicates that the problem is sitting in the driver.run() method inside of NFOP. It's not like this is a gargantuan amount of data, the size of the xsl-fo source going into the nfop driver object is ~980k. What's the most likely source and resolution of this problem? ANY hints or tips or answers are most appreciated, we were supposed to head to VA scan at 11 am. :|
