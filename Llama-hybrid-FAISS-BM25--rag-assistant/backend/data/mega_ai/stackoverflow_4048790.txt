How best to implement Drag & Drop in MSIE? And what's the oldest MSIE which supports it?

I'm looking to implement drag & drop in MSIE (must be, a bonus for other browsers, but just "nice to have"). I'm looking at a sort of drawing package - let's say flowcharts for example. The user can drag flowchart elements from a palette and position them in the browser. When complete, I will need to know the type and position of each element, probably some other data too. Can this be done? If so, what's the most powerful technology to do so? HTML 5? Ajax? JS? Something else?
