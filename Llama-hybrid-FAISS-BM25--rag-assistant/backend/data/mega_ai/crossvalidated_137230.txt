This is the answer I posted at Statalist: http://www.statalist.org/forums/forum/general-stata-discussion/general/790265-average-hazard-rate-with-cox-proportional-hazard-model-always-larger-than-the-hazard-rate-without-any-explanatory-variables I note that there you presented code only for a single explanatory variable. The two averages will be close, but I can think of some reasons they might be systematically different in a single sample. The estimated model is incorrect: have you checked the model fit via estat phtest (test of proportional hazards) or linktest (tests of linearity and (with other covariates) interactions)? Bias of the default Breslow likelihood method in the presence of heavily tied data. Random variability in the estimated regression coefficients in a single sample. The estimated hazards with coefficients are the average of non-linear terms in $\hat{\beta}$, with weights that depend on the estimates. So I'd expect systematic bias even if the true $\beta$ were substituted, bias that would diminish as the size of the risk sets increased.
