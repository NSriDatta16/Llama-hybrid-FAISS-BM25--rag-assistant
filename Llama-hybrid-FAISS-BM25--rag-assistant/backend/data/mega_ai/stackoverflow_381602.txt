Basically, you need to put any code which works with the returned data either in the callback itself or in functions called from the callback, because the data doesn't exist until then. For example: // Getting xml file; jquery parses the file and give me back a DOM fragment // saveXML is the callback $.get(requestTarget, {}, saveXML); // the callback function saveXML(xmlDom) { // the xmlDom here is DEFINED ! alert(xmlDom); }
