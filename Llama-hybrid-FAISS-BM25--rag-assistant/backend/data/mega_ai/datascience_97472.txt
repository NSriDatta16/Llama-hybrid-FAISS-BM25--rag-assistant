Neural Network is just one form of machine learning algorithm that can be used for unsupervised learning... Supervised and Unsupervised learning refers to whether you learn this distribution using a target label for setting the loss function or not. Meaning, in unsupervised learning using NN you will try to make the network 'learn' the training distribution while in supervised learning you'll learn this same distribution in the context of a specific target.
