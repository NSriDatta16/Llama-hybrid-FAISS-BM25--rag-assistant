Sampling For Correlation

Suppose we have population P that is split into large number of close size sub-populations (e.g. country is split to zips). For each sub-population a small sample was drawn and average of a variable X was calculated. The researcher has only access to the average values and he/she needs to study a correlation between X and a random variable Y that researcher has the full access to the population data. What is the correct way to organize the correlation calculation? Concern #1 is that the researcher doesn't have access to the individual instances used for the sampling of Y. So if he/she take a ratio between the mean of X and mean of Y it might not be the same as the mean of the ratio X/Y. Concern #2 is the small size of the X samples. However, since the number of sub-populations is large the same forces that lead to the CLT will be applied to the correlation.
