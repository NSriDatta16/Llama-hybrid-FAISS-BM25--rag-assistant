You probably haven't set the framebuffer to the correct size. If you are on an iPhone 4, the most common mistake is to use the reported view dimensions, which are the same as for the earlier models, even though the iPhone 4 has twice the resolution. Here's how I do it in my app (Important Caveat: this is all black-magic to me, so take it with a grain of salt, and please don't ask me to explain it): - (BOOL)resizeFromLayer:(CAEAGLLayer *)layer { glBindRenderbufferOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, colorRenderbuffer); [context renderbufferStorage:GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES fromDrawable:layer]; glGetRenderbufferParameterivOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, GL_RENDERBUFFER_WIDTH_OES, &vWidth); glGetRenderbufferParameterivOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, GL_RENDERBUFFER_HEIGHT_OES, &vHeight); glBindRenderbufferOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, depthRenderBuffer); glRenderbufferStorageOES(GL_RENDERBUFFER_OES, GL_DEPTH_COMPONENT16_OES, vWidth, vHeight); if (glCheckFramebufferStatusOES(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_OES) != GL_FRAMEBUFFER_COMPLETE_OES) { NSLog(@"Failed to make complete framebuffer object %x", glCheckFramebufferStatusOES(GL_FRAMEBUFFER_OES)); return NO; } return YES; }
