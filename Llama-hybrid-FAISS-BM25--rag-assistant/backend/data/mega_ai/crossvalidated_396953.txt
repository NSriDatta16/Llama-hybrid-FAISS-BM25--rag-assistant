regression with z-scores as composite variables?

So I have 5 IV's- a,b,c,d,e and one DV. a is fine as is. b & c measure the same concept and since their ranges are the same, I averaged the scores to create a composite variable. d & e measure the same concept but their ranges are very different, so I averaged their z-scores to create a composite variable. MY questions are- 1. Is this an apprpriate way of creating composite variables in order to do regression? 2- If I use z-scores for one composite variable, should I do the same for the composite variable for b&c and also use the z-score for a? 3- By using the averaged z-score, does it effect the interpretation of my regression results?
