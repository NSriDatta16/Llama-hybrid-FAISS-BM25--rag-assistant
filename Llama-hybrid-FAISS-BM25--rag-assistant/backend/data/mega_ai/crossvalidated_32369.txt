If removal of autocorrelation is all you want, filtering with an appropriate filter may be an option. If you do not know which filter to use, fitting an AR model or similar to each series can help. But this is not the same as making the time series stationary. You might have series which are uncorrelated and still non stationary (for example. they migh have a trend in variance). Since you have 56 subjects, perhaps a regression analysis with blood pressure as response, and exercise levels plus any other covariates you may have (age,...) as explanatory could be an option. A subject effect, fixed or random, could be among the explanatory variables.
