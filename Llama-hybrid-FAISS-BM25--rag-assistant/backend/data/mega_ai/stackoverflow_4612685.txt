How to force a node inside tiny mce?

I'm using tiny mce for my project and want to validate the node inside the tiny mce. On click of a text element, let's say a paragraph with some id, I load editor for the element. But, sometimes if user replaces the whole content, the node and its HTML is lost. I want to retain this node and only the content is removed. The node can be a paragraph or heading or ul or ol. EDIT : I'm providing dummy text such as "Lorem epsum .....". User will be removing this dummy text and add his content. EDIT2 I want to allow the user to change the content only and the surrounding HTML and styles should remain intact. How can I accomplish this ?
