(very) beginner's example Markov Chain

Person X is on holidays for T weeks. At the end of each week, she gets a mosquito-bite, which infects her (for the following week) with a probability of 0.2. The state-space $Y_t$ is hence either I ("infected") or N ("no disease"). $Y_1$ is "N" - the person starts out healthy. No medication is available, so once infected the person is infected until the end of the holidays. The tasks are now to (a) specify $P(Y_1)$ as well as $P(Y_t | Y_{t-1})$ for t = 2,3,...,T (b) to draw the transition diagram and (c) to determine the probability that person X is not infected in $Y_4$, i.e. in the fourth week. My ideas and questions: (a)..? $P(Y_1)$ is obviously 1..? Am I missing something? For $P(Y_t | Y_{t-1})$ I would just specify the transition matrix P as follows (row 1 = infected, row 2 = not infected): $ \left[ {\begin{array}{cc} 1 & 0 \\ 0.8 & 0.2 \\ \end{array} } \right] $ is there another way to specify $P(Y_t | Y_{t-1})$? (b) The transition diagram contains two states, from the state "I" there is only an arrow to itself with probability 1, from the state "N" an arrow to itself with probability 0.8 and an arrow to "I" with probability 0.2. Regarding (c), I would calculate the respective entry in $P^3$, calculating first the respective entry in $P^2$ we get 0.2*0+0.8*0.8 = 0.64, and then $P(Y_4=N)$ = 0.64*0.8 = 0.512, the probability that X is not infected after 4 weeks of holidays. Are my solutions correct? Thanks for your help!
