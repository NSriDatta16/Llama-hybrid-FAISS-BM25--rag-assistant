MCMC and BO solve different problems. The purpose of MCMC is to sample from a given probability distribution, whereas the purpose of BO is to minimize a (possibly stochastic) black box function. BO proceeds by sequentially choosing points at which to evaluate the objective function. It maintains a probabilistic model of the objective function, and uses it to choose the next point according to an 'acquisition function'. The acquisition function strikes a balance between exploring new regions to reduce uncertainty about the objective function, and exploiting known structure to improve its value. The query points selected by BO are not samples from a user-specified probability distribution. Rather, they're chosen in a way that hopefully lets us find the minimum of the objective function quickly. Therefore, BO is not suitable when the goal is to sample from a given distribution, and is not comparable to MCMC in this context.
