The logistic regression is not "semi-parametric". It has only parametric component. For parametric model, the number of parameters is fixed and does not depend on the number of training data, but only depends on the model itself. This is true for logistic regression since if you have $n$ variables $X_1,\ldots,X_n$ you have $n+1$ parameters $w_0,\ldots,w_n$ to define the logistic regression model, and the number of these parameters does not increase or decrease based on the number of training data. Note that for non-parametric models you also have parameters, but the number of parameters is not fixed and depends on the number of training examples.
