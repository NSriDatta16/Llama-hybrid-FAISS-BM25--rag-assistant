The main question is what are you going to do with that data. If you just need to store the data and files are fine then binary serialization + compression (zlib, lzo...) will work best. CSV won't do you any good.. will probably occupy more than the XML. Database (for example, Sqlite) is the most expensive it terms of storage but you can manage and search the data more easily.
