I answered this question some time back... it only scrolls horizontally, but you should be able to adapt it to scroll vertically as well. It includes click and dragging the image using the mouse and using the mousewheel (for horizontal panning in the demo, I don't know what to tell you about getting the wheel to work in two dimensions).
