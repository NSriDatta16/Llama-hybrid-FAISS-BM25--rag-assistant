Propensity to pay modelling

I am trying to build a propensity to pay model given an intervention to a customer. Context: The population I am dealing with are customers who were supposed to pay some amount on a certain date but have not paid. such customers are contacted via Call centres to remind them of the payment to be made some customers pay, some don't Problem statement: Build a propensity to pay scores for these customers. My current approach: data: calls made via call centre on a certain month if a customer has made a payment within 6 days of intervention, tag them as 1, else 0 considered few demographic features as well as few operational metrics those may be correlated to a customer Making a payment build a classification model (maybe logistic regression) to get the propensity scores. Questions: does the approach mentioned make sense what is the need of propensity scores matching the data is not experimental, its observational, can I use the target variable with tag 1, mentioned earlier as a test group and tag 0 as the control group. Any input on this will be very helpful. Thanks in advance!
