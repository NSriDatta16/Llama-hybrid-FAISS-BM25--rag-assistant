Certificate Authority for myself/small organisation

I need a small CA software which meet following criteria: CLI Interface (we all really hate gui things for server software, don't we?) Issuing certificates for websites. So I just can install one root certificate on client machines to get rid of that warnings) Issuing user certificates (as p12 and other stuff, so I can authenticate using them) with predefined values. I was looking at tinyca but it's somewhat outdated and didnt worked for me well. Openssl can do all of this, so I can code a bunch of shell scripts (or maybe Makefile) to automate this task. So I was wondering if already somebody did this?
