I'd store it off for two reasons 1) If you ever change how you generate the PDF, you probably don't want historical items to change. If you generate them every time, either they will change or you need to keep compatibility code to generate "old-style" records 2) Disk space is cheap. User's patience isn't. Unless you're really pressed for storage or pulling out of storage is harder than generating the PDF, be kind to your users and store it off. Obviously if you create thousands of these an hour from a sparse dataset, you may not have the storage. But if you have the space, I'd vote for "use it"
