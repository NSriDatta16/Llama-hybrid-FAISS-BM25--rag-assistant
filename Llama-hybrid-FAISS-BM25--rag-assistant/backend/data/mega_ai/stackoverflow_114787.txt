Stress-testing ASP.NET/IIS with WCAT

I'm trying to setup a stress/load test using the WCAT toolkit included in the IIS Resources. Using LogParser, I've processed a UBR file with configuration. It looks something like this: [Configuration] NumClientMachines: 1 # number of distinct client machines to use NumClientThreads: 100 # number of threads per machine AsynchronousWait: TRUE # asynchronous wait for think and delay Duration: 5m # length of experiment (m = minutes, s = seconds) MaxRecvBuffer: 8192K # suggested maximum received buffer ThinkTime: 0s # maximum think-time before next request WarmupTime: 5s # time to warm up before taking statistics CooldownTime: 6s # time to cool down at the end of the experiment [Performance] [Script] SET RequestHeader = "Accept: */*\r\n" APP RequestHeader = "Accept-Language: en-us\r\n" APP RequestHeader = "User-Agent: Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.2; .NET CLR 1.0.3705)\r\n" APP RequestHeader = "Host: %HOST%\r\n" NEW TRANSACTION classId = 1 NEW REQUEST HTTP ResponseStatusCode = 200 Weight = 45117 verb = "GET" URL = "http://Url1.com" NEW TRANSACTION classId = 3 NEW REQUEST HTTP ResponseStatusCode = 200 Weight = 13662 verb = "GET" URL = "http://Url1.com/test.aspx" Does it look OK? I execute the controller with this command: wcctl -z StressTest.ubr -a localhost The Client(s) is executed like this: wcclient localhost When the client is executed, I get this error: main client thread Connect Attempt 0 Failed. Error = 10061 Has anyone in this world ever used WCAT?
