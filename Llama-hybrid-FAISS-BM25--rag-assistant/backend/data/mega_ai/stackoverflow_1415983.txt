Thanks useRs, I have tried the forecast package, that too as a composite of arima and ets, but not to much acclaim from aic or bic(sbc), so i am now tempted to treat each of the time series to its own svm(support vector machine) because of its better genralization adaptability and also being able to add other variables apart from lags and non linear kernel functions Any premonitions?
