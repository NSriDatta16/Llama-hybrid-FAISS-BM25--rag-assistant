I think the inequality does not hold for all $z$ (the support of $Z$) $I(X;Y|Z=z)$ is a function of the random variable $Z$, $g(Z)$ it can take different values for different realizations $z$. $I(X;Y|Z)$ is the expected value of that function, $E_Z[g(Z)]$, a weighted average that must lie between the largest and smallest value g(Z) can take.
