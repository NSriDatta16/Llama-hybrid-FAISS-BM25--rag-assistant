I would not normalize it. Nothing much to be gained. we aren't running databases on 8-bit computers with 8 mb of ram and a 32mb hard-drive anymore. This is specific to this example. Complex data structures should be normalized. The only real space saver is the phone number, and its on average 10-char wide, if you normalize that out and replace it with a bigint-foreign-reference you don't seem to gain much but runtime joins :P, and on top of that you need a int that represents what type the phone number is.
