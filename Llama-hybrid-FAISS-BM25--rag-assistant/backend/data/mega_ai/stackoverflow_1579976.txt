Data types not only optimize storage, but how data is indexed. As your databases get bigger, it will become apparent that it's quicker to search for all the records that have a 1 in an integer field than those that have a "1" in a varchar field. This becomes especially important when you're joining data from more than one table and your database engine is having to do this sort of thing repeatedly. (Daren also rightly points out below that it's important that the types of the fields you're matching on are identical as well.) The level at which these inefficiencies become an issue depends greatly on your hardware and your application design. We have big enough iron these days that if you're building moderate-scale apps, you may not see an appreciable difference. (Aside from feeling a little bit guilty about your database design!) But establishing good habits on small projects makes the bigger ones easier when they come along.
