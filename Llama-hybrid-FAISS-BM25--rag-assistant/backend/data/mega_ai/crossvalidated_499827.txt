Bayesian number guessing

This is a personal learning exercise: Suppose an agent knows the range of values that a number (N) can take but is only given feedback about how right or wrong he is after he makes a guess (os given a reward of zero or some higher value reflecting how accurate his estimate is). And after 30 trials this number (N) will change, so the agent's belief needs to be constantly reevaluated. N is drawn from a normal distribution with a mean of 20 and std of 5. Can you expand in detail on how such a problem may be solved using Bayesian updating (with conjugate distributions). It would be great if you also provide pseudocode for your answer.
