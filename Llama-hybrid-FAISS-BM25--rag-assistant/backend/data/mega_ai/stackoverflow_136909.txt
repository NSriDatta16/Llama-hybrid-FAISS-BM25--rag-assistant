It's already been beaten to death that you shouldn't use home grown crypto in a product. But I've read your question and you clearly state that you're just doing it for fun. Sounds like the true geek/hacker/academic spirit to me. You know it works, you want to know why it works and try to see if you can make it work. I completely encourage that and do the same with many programs I've written just for fun. I suggest reading this post ( http://rdist.root.org/2008/09/18/dangers-of-amateur-cryptography/ ) over at a blog called "rootlabs". In the post are a series of links that you should find very interesting. A guy interested in math/crypto with a PhD in Computer Science and who works for Google decided to write a series of articles on programming crypto. He made several non-obvious mistakes that were pointed out by industry expert Nate Lawson. I suggest you read it. If it doesn't encourage you to keep trying, it will no doubt still teach you something. Best of luck!
