Your question reeks of "Premature Optimization". On my computer, System.arrayCopy() can copy 1 million elements of data in roughly 13ms . So I suggest to measure whether this is really an issue. In the general case, ArrayList is faster and has a better memory performance than any other similar data structure. Using a LinkedList would make all operations on the list (including remove() ) slower since you will now have to traverse half of all list elements for each operation (on average). So most operations would go from O(1) to O(N/2).
