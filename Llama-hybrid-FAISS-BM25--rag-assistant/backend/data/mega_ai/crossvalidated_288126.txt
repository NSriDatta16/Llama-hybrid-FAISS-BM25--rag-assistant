Yes, it is possible that small changes, inperceptible for human can cause huge difference in network output, and you can even control the network's output. It is a known issue for neural networks in general. Please take a look at the following papers: Nguyen A.; Yosinski J.; Clune J. (2015) Deep Neural Networks are Easily Fooled: High Confidence Predictions for Unrecognizable Images. In Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR '15), IEEE Goodfellow, I. J.; Shlens, J.; Szegedy, C. (2015) Explaining and harnessing adversarial examples. ICLR 2015
