web & GUI applications interface with humans .. back-end applications interface with services and databases .. As such your specifications need to include significant consideration of your user's mental model - making things behave as people expect them to. And doing that - understanding how users think - is not always easy or logical. You may have elegant algorithmic solutions that simply fail to engage, because people don't always think logically. Many times, quite elegant UI's are extremely twisted coding-wise .. which is very contrary to system->system programming Depending on problem-space, much of this can be more art than science.
