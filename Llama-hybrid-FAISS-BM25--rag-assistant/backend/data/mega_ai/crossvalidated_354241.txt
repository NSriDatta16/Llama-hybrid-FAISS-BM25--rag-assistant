Diversity of generated samples in VAE

In a variational autoencoder (VAE), it is possible to generate new samples (i.e. images) based on the latent space. After having read quite a few papers about VAE, I still wonder what drives the diversity of generated (hallucinated) samples? Put differently, what can be done in a VAE to generate samples that are more diverse besides having more data to train on?
