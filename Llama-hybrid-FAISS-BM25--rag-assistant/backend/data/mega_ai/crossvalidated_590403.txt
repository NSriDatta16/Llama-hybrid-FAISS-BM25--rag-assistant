Calculating an effect of intervention on two groups with very different values

Imagine I run a marketing campaign in two cities with very different number of citizens (like A: 1000 and B: 1000 000). Purchases_A and Purchases_B define the number of products sold in each city: month Purchases_A Purchases_B Campaign January 100 100 000 0 February 120 150 000 0 March 90 70 000 0 April 100 100 000 0 May 80 120 000 0 June 90 110 000 0 July 120 80 000 0 August 180 220 000 1 September 200 300 000 1 October 190 220 000 1 November 180 200 000 1 December 180 220 000 1 The campaign was launched in July. I need to test if the average effect of the campaign was greater in one of the cities, but the numbers of both variables are very different. Is it ok to conduct a Min-Max-Scaling on both Purchases_A and Purchases_B and then conduct the t-test or Mannâ€“Whitney U test on the variables Purchases_A and Purchases_B in range or is there a better approach to solve this problem...?
