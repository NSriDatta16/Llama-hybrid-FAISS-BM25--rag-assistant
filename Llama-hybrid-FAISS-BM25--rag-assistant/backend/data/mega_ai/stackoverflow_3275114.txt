thanks so much for the fast response. Right after I've receive it I augmented the timeout to 10 seconds. Now it is all running without problems, but of course I would need to wait another day or two to have sort of confirmation, but only after 5 days I'll be sure and will come back with the results. I see now that 140K request went well already, having so hard experience on this one I would wait at least another 200K. What you were proposing about auto adaptation of timeouts (without putting the system down) sounds also reasonable. Would the right way to go be in creating a small class (e.g. AutoTimeoutCalibrator) and embedding it directly into serial.py? Yes - being pragmatical is the only way without loosing another 10 days trying to figure out the real reason behind. Thanks again, I'll be back with the results. (sorry, but for some reason I was not able to post it as a reply to your post)
