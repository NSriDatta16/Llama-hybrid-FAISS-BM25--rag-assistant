As the predictors are all auto-correlated i.e. what a student achieves in Year 2 will be correlated with what they achieved in Year 1 you'll need to look at some form of time series analysis such as ARIMA modelling. I'd suggest taking the average score achieved by all students for each time period and fitting an ARIMA model. You can then forecast future grades for each student by imputing their particular time series of grade averages. If you use R then this is a good resource to get started: https://www.otexts.org/fpp/8
