Can Swing tell me if there is an active tooltip?

Is there an elegantish way in Swing to find out if there are any tooltips currently being displayed in my frame? I'm using custom tooltips, so it would be very easy to set a flag in my createToolTip() method, but I can't see a way to find out when the tooltip is gone. ToolTipManager has a nice flag for this, tipShowing, but of course it's private and they don't seem to offer a way to get to it. hideWindow() doesn't call out to the tooltip component (that I can tell), so I don't see a way there. Anyone have any good ideas? Update: I went with reflection. You can see the code here: private boolean isToolTipVisible() { // Going to do some nasty reflection to get at this private field. Don't try this at home! ToolTipManager ttManager = ToolTipManager.sharedInstance(); try { Field f = ttManager.getClass().getDeclaredField("tipShowing"); f.setAccessible(true); boolean tipShowing = f.getBoolean(ttManager); return tipShowing; } catch (Exception e) { // We'll keep silent about this for now, but obviously we don't want to hit this // e.printStackTrace(); return false; } }
