I would stay away from Bayesian, follow the giants. Soviets had an excellent book series for secondary school students, roughly translated into English as "'Quant' little library." Kolmogorov contributed a book with co-authors titled "Introduction to a probability theory." I'm not sure it has ever been translated into English, but here 's the link to its Russian original. They approach explaining the probabilities through combinatorics, which I think is the great way to start. The book is very accessible for a high school student with decent maths. Note, that Soviets taught math rather extensively, so the average Western high school students may not be as well prepared, but with enough interest and will power can still handle the content, in my opinion. The content is very interesting for students, it has random walks, limiting distributions, survival processes, law of large numbers etc. If you combine this approach with computer simulations, it becomes even more fun.
