First, it's worth pointing out that glm does not perform bayesian regression. The 'weights' parameter is basically a short hand for "proportion of observations," which can be replaced with up-sampling your dataset appropriately. For example: x=1:10 y=jitter(10*x) w=sample(x,10) augmented.x=NULL augmented.y=NULL for(i in 1:length(x)){ augmented.x=c(augmented.x, rep(x[i],w[i])) augmented.y=c(augmented.y, rep(y[i],w[i])) } # These are both basically the same thing m.1=lm(y~x, weights=w) m.2=lm(augmented.y~augmented.x) So to add weight to points in JAGS or BUGS, you can augment your dataset in a similar fashion as above.
