Is the p-postulate (equal p-values provide equal evidence against the null) true?

The p-postulate is the notion that equal p-values provide equal evidence against the null hypothesis. Wagenmakers et al (2008) write: If p-values truly reflect evidence, a minimum requirement is that equal p-values provide equal evidence against the null hypothesis (i.e., the p-postulate). According to the p-postulate, p = .05 with 10 observations constitutes just as much evidence against the null hypothesis as does p = .05 after 50 observations. They cite Royall (1986) as the source for their definition of the p-postulate. They also go on saying that this postulate is false. Is it? Royall, R. N. (1986).
