Comparing performances during a race between 2 groups, which test should I use?

Imagine I organized a race between 2 types of ants. Type A and B. At the end of the race, I have the ranking, which looks something like : 1 A1 2 A3 3 B5 4 A4 5 B2 ... Where, in A1, A is the ant type and "1" the ant ID. Ants do not interfere between each other during the race. If I plot the proportion of A or B every 10% of the ranking it gives this (fake data): Maybe bar plot is better here. But one needs to read it as follow : There are 1000 ants in the race, I arbitrary divide the ranking in 10. When N = 1, that is the first 100, there are 54 Bs and 46 As. N = 2, there are 50 As and Bs N = 3, 55 As and 45 Bs N = 4, 61 As and 39 Bs etc.. My question is : I have just ranking results and I want to known whether there is some bias in the ranking as a function of the type. eg. For a given ant, can one predict where it will rank ? For instance, how can we say whether A-ants are very good at arriving in first positions 10%), and B-ants are very good at arriving in the 30-50% of the ranking, or not, but both are equally good at performing bad. (I don't want to test for this, but how can I end up with results of that kind). I have many replicate of this experiment. I don't really know how to test for this. I was thinking of: dividing the ranking in N parts (how to choose N ?) Doing a $\chi^{2}$ test for each part, where I expect 50% of type A and B under null hypothesis. : No because parts are dependants. I don't know. How would you do, and why ? Note that the ranking doesn't include values (eg. time), so we only have ranking information. In case we would have the time value, how would you do, if different ? I would appreciate some re-wording of the problem, since I'm not a statistician and it prevents me to search in books (because I don't known where to search) Thanks
