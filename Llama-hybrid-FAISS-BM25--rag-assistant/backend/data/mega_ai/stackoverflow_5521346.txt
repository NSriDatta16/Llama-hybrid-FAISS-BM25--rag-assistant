As you are already using jQuery, you can use the jQuery version of SWFObject , it would replace the div slider with flash if flash is detected. It sets a variable to true if flash is detected so can do: if($.flash.available){ //do flash } else { // start slider } SWFObject is also very reliable for cross browser embedding.
