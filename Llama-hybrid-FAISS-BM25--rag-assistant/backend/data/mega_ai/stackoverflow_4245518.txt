asp.net SelectCommand SQL JOIN problem

I'm a database noob so please bear with me. I'm trying to join three tables together in the SelectCommand attribute of a SqlDataSource. Here's my select command at the moment: SelectCommand="SELECT DISTINCT a1.[CreateDate], a2.[UserName], c1.[name], c1.[organisation], c1.[address], a1.[IsApproved], a1.[UserId] FROM [aspnet_Membership], [aspnet_Users] a2, [clients] c1 INNER JOIN [aspnet_Membership] a1 ON c1.userid = a1.UserId INNER JOIN [clients] c2 ON c2.userid = a2.UserId AND a1.IsApproved = 'False'" It's kinda mucky because I've been playing with it. I'm trying to display the registered date from aspnet_Membership (CreateDate), username from aspnet_Users (UserName) and other details from my custom clients table. But my joins aren't working. I managed to get aspnet_Membership to join fine with clients to display CreateDate, but I can't join aspnet_Users to show the username. I keep getting errors saying "aspnet_Users.UserId could not be bound". Any ideas? I'm pretty sure the problem is in the joining, but not matter how many tweaks I make to the command I can't get any results. Any help would be much appreciated :)
