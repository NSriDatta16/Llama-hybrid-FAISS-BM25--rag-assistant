Where is the bomb: How to estimate the probability, given row and column totals?

This question is inspired by a mini-game from Pokemon Soulsilver: Imagine there are 15 bombs hidden on this 5x6 area (EDIT: maximum 1 bomb/cell): Now, how would you estimate the probability to find a bomb on a specific field, given the row/column totals? If you look at column 5 (total bombs = 5), then you might think: Within this column the chance to find a bomb in row 2 is double the chance to find one in row 1. This (wrong) assumption of direct proportionality, which basically can be described as drawing standard independence-test operations (like in Chi-Square) into the wrong context, would lead to the following estimations: As you can see, direct proportionality leads to probability estimates over 100%, and even before that, would be wrong. So I performed a computational simulation of all possible permutations which led to 276 unique possibilities of placing 15 bombs. (given row and column totals) Here is the average over the 276 solutions: This is the correct solution, but due to the exponential computational work, I would like to find an estimation method. My question is now: Is there an established statistical method to estimating this? I was wondering if this was a known problem, how it is called and if there are papers/websites you could recommend!
