Is it valid to use the posterior of a model as a dependent variable for regression?

Given data from feature $i$ in sample $j$ from group $k$ with some group covariates $X$ , I have a random effects model: $$ y_{jk} \sim N(X_k\beta_{ik\cdot}, \sigma_{ik}) \\ \beta_{ik\cdot} = (\beta_{ik1}, \dots, \beta_{ikp}) \\ \beta_{ikl} \sim N(\beta_{i0l }, \tau_{il}) $$ $X_k, \beta_{ik\cdot}, \beta_{i0\cdot}$ all include intercept and slope terms (say $l \in \{1, ..., p\}$ arbitrary covariates). I don't specify priors for $\sigma, \tau, \beta_0$ here as they're not relevant. I can fit this model jointly using standard Bayesian inference methods. However, could I also fit separate models for each $k$ group, and then regress against these posterior distributions to estimate the random effect? Specifically, could I fit this model for each $k$ : $$ y_{ijk} \sim N(\mu_{ik}, \sigma_i) $$ and post-hoc , use samples from these posterior distributions to estimate the random effects $$ \mu_{ik} \sim N(X_k\beta_{ik\cdot}, \xi_i) \\ \beta_{ik\cdot} = (\beta_{ik1}, \dots, \beta_{ikp}) \\ \beta_{ikl} \sim N(\beta_{i0l}, \tau_{il}) $$ where $\mu_k$ is sampled from the previously-generated posterior distributions at each step of a new MCMC sampler. This is a much simpler model than I am really interested in; I'm mostly interested in whether this approach is valid, or if it would be valid using a point estimate (e.g., MAP). Obviously this would lose a lot of the benefit of partial pooling and shrinkage - I plan to compare the joint approach with the (I suppose) "split and combine" approach. I'd be grateful for any suggested reading on the topic also.
