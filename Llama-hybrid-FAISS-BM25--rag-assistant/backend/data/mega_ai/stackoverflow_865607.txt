You could fake the call by introducing an intermediary. For instance: public static class NetworkUtils { private static bool? forcedIPv6Support; /// /// Use this instead of Socket.OSSupportsIPv6 to /// allow for testing on different operating systems. /// public static SupportsIPv6 { get { return forcedIPv6Support ?? Socket.OSSupportsIPv6; } } /// Only use in testing! public static void ForceIPv6Support(bool? value) { forcedIPv6Support = value; } } It's not entirely pleasant, but it lets you do what you need to. ChrisW's answer is similar, but using an interface. Normally I'd be a fan of the interface solution, but it feels like it's making the production code and configuration more complicated. My solution is certainly less "pure" but possibly more pragmatic. I'll let you judge :)
