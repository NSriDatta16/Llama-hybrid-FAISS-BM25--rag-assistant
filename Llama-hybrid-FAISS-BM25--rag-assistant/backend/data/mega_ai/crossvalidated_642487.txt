Is the assumption that the 'hidden' states evolve on a daily timestep? If so it sounds like you need a State-Space model that allows the unobserved states to evolve on a regular timestep, even though observations may not occur on every time step. There are various software packages for setting up such models, for example the MARSS R package or my own package, mvgam . You may find these applied time series analysis lectures useful for a broader overview.
