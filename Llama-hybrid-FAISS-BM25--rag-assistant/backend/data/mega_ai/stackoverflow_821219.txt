embedding flash in rich text editor

I've been trying to embed a flash widget inside a rich text editor ( http://code.google.com/p/lwrte/ ), by adding an tag to the iframe's HTML using mozilla's .insertHTML function ( http://www.mozilla.org/editor/midas-spec.html ), but for some reason it never shows up - using firebug i can see that the embed tag is there, but it has stripped out the closing tag. any suggestions? how do other RTEs do this? thanks
