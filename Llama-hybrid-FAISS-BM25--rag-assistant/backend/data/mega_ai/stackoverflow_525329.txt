Embedding icon in .exe with py2exe, visible in Vista?

I've been trying to embed an icon (.ico) into my "compyled" .exe with py2exe. Py2Exe does have a way to embed an icon: windows=[{ 'script':'MyScript.py', 'icon_resources':[(1,'MyIcon.ico')] }] And that's what I am using. The icon shows up fine on Windows XP or lower, but doesn't show at all on Vista. I suppose this is because of the new Vista icon format, which can be in PNG format, up to 256x256 pixels. So, how can I get py2exe to embed them into my executable, without breaking the icons on Windows XP? I'm cool with doing it with an external utility rather than py2exe - I've tried this command-line utility to embed it, but it always corrupts my exe and truncates its size for some reason.
