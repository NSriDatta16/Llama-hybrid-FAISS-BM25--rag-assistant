No, this is not possible for desktop browsers. I suggest embedding an image that's appropriate for typical screen resolutions, then detecting the canvas size, and rewriting the image's src attribute to reflect that. In any case, you don't want to look at the screen resolution, you want to look at the canvas size. Not everybody uses their browser with a maximised window, especially those with large screens. If you use the screen resolution, then you'll end up serving images that are way too big for some people.
