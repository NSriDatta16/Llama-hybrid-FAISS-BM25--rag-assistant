I am trying to make a Classifier using Machine learning to detect malwares,am I headed in the right direction?

I am trying to make a malicious software detector using machine learning.I have obtained a dataset from internet which containes md5 hash and other features of pe files.I fed this databse to weka to find out the most important features,which came out to be only one(static_prio).I tried running the K-NN algorithm on the data using only one feature(static_prio) and I got 99.82% accuracy but I am a little confused about my approach here.I am naive with machine learning so please help by putting me on the right track.Thank you.
