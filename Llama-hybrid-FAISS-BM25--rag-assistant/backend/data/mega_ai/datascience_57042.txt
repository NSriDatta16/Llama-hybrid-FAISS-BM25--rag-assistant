In tendance: having one model will deliver better results since you include more information. Having many classes is not really a problem. Some models for image recognition are trained on 1000+ classes. The question is more if you have sufficient data (rows/observations). 300 images on average per class sounds reasonable. So I would give the large model (including all classes) a try. Also if I understood you correctly, you use a pretrained model, which can be very beneficial.
