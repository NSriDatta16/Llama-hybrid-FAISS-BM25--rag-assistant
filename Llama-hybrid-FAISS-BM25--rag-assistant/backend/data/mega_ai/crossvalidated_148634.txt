Interpretation of the Odds-Ratio for percentage value in logistic regression

Running a logistic regression , I have a dependent variable Loyal Customer can be 0 or 1 and an independent variable Return.rate is a continuous percent value from 0 to 1 If my odds ratio for Return.rate is 5, how do I interpret the result in words? What is a unit? 1 which is 100%? Or 0.01 which is 1%?
