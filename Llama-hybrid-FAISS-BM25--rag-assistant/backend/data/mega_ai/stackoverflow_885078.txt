Initially, no, they're not necessary. If you had perfect coverage, extracted the class and did nothing more, you would still have perfect coverage (and those tests would confirm that the extraction was indeed a pure refactoring). But eventually - and probably soon - yes. The extracted class is likely to be used outside its original context, and you want to constrain its behavior with tests that are specific to the new class, so that changes for a new context don't inadvertently affect behavior for the original caller. Of course the original tests would still reveal this, but good unit tests point directly to the problematic unit, and the original tests are now a step removed. It's also good to have the new tests as executable documentation for the newly-extracted class.
