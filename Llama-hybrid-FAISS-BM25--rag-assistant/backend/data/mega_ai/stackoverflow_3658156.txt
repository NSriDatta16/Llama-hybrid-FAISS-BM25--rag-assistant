NOTE: This process is heavily simplified in XCode 4 (although not personally tested by me) with importing and exporting of developer profiles through the Organizer window (Developer Profile section). This is how I got it working. 1) Login to the iOS Provisioning Portal as the Agent. 2) Run through the process of making the Distribution Certificate Signing Request / Provisioning Profile: http://developer.apple.com/iphone/manage/distribution/index.action . These instructions a re super long, but pretty clear and necessary. 3) Pay extra attention to the section "Obtaining your iOS Distribution Certificate" > "Saving your Private Key and Transferring to Other Systems" on that page. It describes how to generate and save the Agent's .p12 file. 4) Now invite other developer(s) to be part of the team in the Member Center: https://developer.apple.com/membercenter/index.action#invitations 5) Back in the iOS Provisioning Portal, download the app's Distribution Certificate (Certificates > Distribution (tab)). Should be named "distribution_identity.cer" 6) Now download the Distribution Provisioning Profile (Provisioning > Distribution (tab)). Should be named "whatever_you_named_it.mobileprovision" 7) Email those two files along with the Agent's .p12 file to your other developer machine. 8) On the developer's machine, double-click the distribution_identity.cer file and it should load up in Keychain Access 9) Drag the .p12 file to Keychain and it should automatically put the identity under the certificate 10) Drag the whatever_you_named_it.mobileprovision file into XCode. 11) In each of the Project and Build's Info windows, set the Code Signing Identity to the "iPhone Distribution - Your Company" identity which should now be available. Hope that helps. Rob
