Bias/variance tradeoff tutorial

I'm looking for a good tutorial about bias/variance tradeoff. In particular, I'd like to find someone that explains how different algorithms in machine learning play in this tradeoff, and possibly how other things (feature selection/extraction, scaling, etc...) may affect this trade-off.
