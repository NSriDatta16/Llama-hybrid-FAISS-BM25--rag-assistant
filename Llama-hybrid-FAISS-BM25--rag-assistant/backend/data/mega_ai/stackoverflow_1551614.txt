As you suggested, I would (and have done before) override the make_file method of a FieldStorage object. Just return an object which has a write method that both accepts the data (into a file or memory or what-have-you) and tracks how much has been received for your progress indicator. Doing it this way you also get access to the length of the file (as supplied by the client), file name, and the key that it is posted under. Why does this seem to break down the CGI implementation for you? Another option is to do the progress tracking in the browser with a flash uploader ( YUI Uploader and SWFUpload come to mind) and skip tracking it on the server entirely. Then you don't have to have a series of AJAX requests to get the progress.
