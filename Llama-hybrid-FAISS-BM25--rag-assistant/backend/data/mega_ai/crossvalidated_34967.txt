Dimensionality reduction on a huge binary matrix

I have a 0/1 sparse matrix with 500 k columns and 3 M rows and I want to do reduce the number of columns. Clearly I cannot load this into R , as is, so prcomp is out. (I cannot even create the Gram matrix in R : too many elements specified .) However, it appears that I should be able follow this path: Reduce the number of columns to 200 k by dropping very sparse ones Compute the Gram matrix by scanning the input file without loading the whole thing Compute the Gram matrix eigenvectors in R . Any better suggestions?
