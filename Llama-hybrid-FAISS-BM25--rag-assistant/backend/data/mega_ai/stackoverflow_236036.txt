Firstly I'd look at why you need to compress the data in your session / cache. Compression should be an act of last resort, better programming should be the first. Are you running out of memory, and if so, which objects are consuming the most? This should point you in the direction for code improvement to reduce the amount of memory used. If your app is optimised the best it can with the objects it needs, you may want to look at out of memory storage such as a database or file system to cache larger objects (which is where serialisation comes in handy). You could also place InProc sessions on a different server to the webserver to improve scalability and distribute the site over a web farm.
