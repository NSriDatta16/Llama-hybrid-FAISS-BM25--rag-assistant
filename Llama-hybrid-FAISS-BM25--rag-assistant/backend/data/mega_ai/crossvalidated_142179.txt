You may be able to figure out everything you need to know from my answer here: Simulation of logistic regression power analysis - designed experiments , which is quite comprehensive. The basic procedure for simulating a power analysis is to: Simulate data according to your preferred scenario (the alternative hypothesis). Run the test you intend to use. Do this many times, and see what percentage of the time your results are significant. If you want to solve for the required $N$ to achieve a given power, do the above with different $N$s and find the one that yields the power you want. In your case, you need to apply the binomial test with the null proportion set to $.01$. Here's an example in R (note that your code had errors): set.seed(8063) p = 0.3 # from sample size 1:100, I generated 1000 binomial random variable k = matrix(NA, nrow=1000, ncol=100) for(n in 1:100){ k[,n] = rbinom(1000, n, p) } p.mat = matrix(NA, nrow=1000, ncol=100) for(i in 1:1000){ for(n in 1:100){ p.mat[i,n] = binom.test(x=k[i,n], n=n, p=0.01)$p.value } } power = c() power = apply(p.mat, 2, FUN=function(x){ mean(x .8)) # [1] 5 power[4] # [1] 0.763 power[5] # [1] 0.82 Brute force search: tl = NULL tl[paste("n", 1:10, sep="")] = list(NULL) pl = tl for(n in 1:10){ tl[[n]] = 0:n for(h in 0:n){ pl[[n]][h+1] = binom.test(tl[[n]][h+1], n, 0.01, "g")$p.value } } msig = lapply(pl, function(x){ min(which(x .8)) # [1] 5 pow[4:5] # n = 4 n = 5 # 0.75990 0.83193
