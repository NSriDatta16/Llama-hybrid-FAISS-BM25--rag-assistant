I finally did achieve this by going from invoice->order->customer as 'Anda B' suggested. I am just pasting my solution here as a reference, but will be using this solution from clockworkgeek , since it seems much cleaner. And my solution still needs to be made cleaner by getting the 'id' of eav_attribute (agent_id) from the database at runtime, instead of hard coding it, as pasted here: class Myproject_Adminhtml_Block_Sales_Invoice_Grid extends Mage_Adminhtml_Block_Sales_Invoice_Grid { const AGENT_ID_ATTRIBUTE_ID = 118; protected function _prepareCollection() { $collection = Mage::getResourceModel($this->_getCollectionClass()); $collection->join('order_grid', 'order_id = order_grid.entity_id', array ('order_entity_id' => 'order_grid.entity_id')); $collection->getSelect()->join( 'customer_entity', 'customer_id = customer_entity.entity_id', array('customer_entity_id' => 'entity_id', 'email')); $collection->getSelect()->joinLeft( 'customer_entity_int', 'customer_entity_int.entity_id = customer_entity.entity_id AND attribute_id = ' . Myproject_Adminhtml_Block_Sales_Invoice_Grid::AGENT_ID_ATTRIBUTE_ID, array('attribute_entity_id' => 'customer_entity_int.entity_id', 'attribute_id' , 'value')); //Apply Desired Data Filters here $this->setCollection($collection); return $collection;
