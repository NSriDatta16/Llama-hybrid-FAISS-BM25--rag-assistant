Scrum might be more than you need as a single developer, but if you have a stake holder and a QA person then Scrum can still be helpful. Remember they are apart of your team, and should be at your standups to trade information with the team. If you are truly alone there are other agile practices that might make more sense to you. For example, Kanban might be a better fit. You don't have iteration overhead, retros, sprint planning, etc. You just have a backlog that you pull tasks from. This works well as a way to organize your work, allows stake holders to adjust priorities, and works well for a single developer or small team where you can break up work without a lot of need to synchronize between developers. Maybe you have a product built that only has small features that doesn't need a lot of architecture being built to support new features. Or lots of small projects that are independent say for advertising firms, etc.
