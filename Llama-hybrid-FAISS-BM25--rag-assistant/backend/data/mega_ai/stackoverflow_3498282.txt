Application-level sockets do not allow for MAC filtering. The only way to get the MAC is to have direct access to the TCP/IP headers themselves, which sockets do not provide access to. Unless you use a low-level intercept driver, like WinPCap, then you are just better off putting the server behind a real hardware firewall/router and let it do the MAC filtering for you.
