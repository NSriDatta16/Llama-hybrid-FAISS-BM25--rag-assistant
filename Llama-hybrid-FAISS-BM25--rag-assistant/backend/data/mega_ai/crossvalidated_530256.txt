Why different results for the same factor once using Oneway and once Twoway ANOVA?

I am currently analysing data of eggs of laying hens that were fed with different forage. There were two forage in total, and eight group of laying hens. Four groups under forage 1 and four groups under forage 2. I am using R and am performing some ANOVAs for different factors and dependant variables. Right now, the factor of interest is the eight groups of hens. When I set the parameter "shell strength" (measured in N) as the dependant variable in an ANOVA test with factor groups, then I get two different p-values. With an Oneway ANOVA, I get a p-value of 0.03186 which is significant. On the countrary, with a Twoway ANOVA, I get a p-value of >0.05 which in my case is not significant. I am quite a beginner in stats and also in R so I do not quite understand why the results differ. Maybe someone has an explanation for me? On researchgat.net, someone suggested to check the explained variance of both tests. In my case I get an explained variance of 0.69 for the Oneway and of 0.63 for the Twoway ANOVA. He then recommended to take the p-value of the test with the greater explained variance. What do you think? Every response will be greatly appreciated! Best regards Edit: Here is the code. -BF stands for "egg strength", dependant variable -Abteil stands for "group", there are 8 of them # Oneway ANOVA fac2 $Abteil) # Factor group (8 levels) onewayANOVA BF ~ fac2) summary(onewayANOVA) # Twoway ANOVA fac1 $Verf) # Factor forage (2 levels) fac2 Abteil) # Factor group (8 levels) twowayANOVA Here are both outputs I get. > fac2 $Abteil) > onewayANOVA BF ~ fac2) > summary(onewayANOVA) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) fac2 7 1109 158.50 2.221 0.0319 * Residuals 392 27978 71.37 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 > fac1 $Verf) > fac2 Abteil) > twowayANOVA summary(twowayANOVA) Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value Pr(>F) fac1 1 365 364.8 5.111 0.0243 * fac2 6 745 124.1 1.739 0.1107 Residuals 392 27978 71.4 --- Signif. codes: 0 ‘***’ 0.001 ‘**’ 0.01 ‘*’ 0.05 ‘.’ 0.1 ‘ ’ 1 Dataframe that is being used: > head(sheet_all) # A tibble: 6 x 21 Stall Abteil Verf LP `Ei-Nb` EG BF Dotterfarbe Flecken Eiklarhöhe 1 2.1. 11 K 9 1 71.7 43 11 0 9.6 2 2.1. 11 K 9 2 70.7 41 11 1 7 3 2.1. 11 K 9 3 73.5 57 11 0 9.6 4 2.1. 11 K 9 4 62.6 54 12 1 8.8 5 2.1. 11 K 9 5 72.6 47 10 0 10 6 2.1. 11 K 9 6 61.3 45 11 0 8.7 # ... with 11 more variables: Haugh_units , Dottergewicht , # Dotter_percent , Schalengewicht , Schalen_percent , # Eiweissgewicht , Weiss_percent , Schalendicke1 , # Schalendicke2 , Schalendicke , Date
