Perl regex which grabs ALL double-letter occurrences in a line

Still plugging away at teaching myself Perl. I'm trying to write some code that will count the lines of a file that contain double letters and then place parentheses around those double letters. Now what I've come up with will find the first occurrence of double letters, but not any other ones. For instance, if the line is: Amp, James Watt, Bob Transformer, etc. These pioneers conducted many My code will render this: 19 Amp, James Wa(tt), Bob Transformer, etc. These pioneers conducted many The "19" is the count (of lines containing double letters) and it gets the "tt" of "Watt" but misses the "ee" in "pioneers". Below is my code: $file = '/path/to/file/electricity.txt'; open(FH, $file) || die "Cannot open the file\n"; my $counter=0; while ( ) { chomp(); if (/(\w)\1/) { $counter += 1; s/$&/\($&\)/g; print "\n\n$counter $_\n\n"; } else { print "$_\n"; } } close(FH); What am I overlooking?
