I believe you have confused the meaning of expected value. We can now assume that after 17.64 samples that we have a 50% chance to obtain said monster because we know 17.64 is the average number of samples it takes to obtain said monster. This statement is incorrect, and doesn't make fundamental sense (you cannot do 17.64 trials) An expected value of 17.64 in this case does not mean this, (I used 18 as approximation): X~B(18, 0.0567) P(X=1) = 0.5 or P(X>=1) = 0.5. The expected value of 17.64 means that if you draw many many trials from this process, we expect 1 success with the average interval of 17.64 trials. Note that this says nothing about the probability of seeing success or not. In fact to find the probability that in 18 trials you will observe 1 or more successes: X~B(18, 0.0567) P(X=1) = 0.378357850443551 P(X>=1) = 0.65029888269312 i.e. your chance of getting exactly one success for 18 trials is 38%, and getting 1 or more is 65%. However if you are insistent on defining an "average" as number of trials needed for the cumulative chance of 50% to obtain at least 1 success or more, then General Abrial's answer is the perfect way to calculate it. i.e. "Average" = What is the needed number of trials n, to have a 50% shot at getting at least 1 success? Although, from a gamer perspective, why is it so important to use 50% cumulative chance? Personally I would rather go for something more significant, like 80~95% cumulative chance to get at least 1 success. Say if the summon (presumably powerful) is needed to beat a boss (or win a PvP), would you rather calculate for 50% chance of making it or 80% chance of making it.
