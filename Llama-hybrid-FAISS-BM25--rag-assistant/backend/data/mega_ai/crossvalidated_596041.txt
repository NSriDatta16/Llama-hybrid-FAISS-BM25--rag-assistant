Prediction with normalization of features

I am working with a time series data (date column and a value column) and I have extracted date features(weekday, weekend etc) and rolling means or the prediction. For features to be given equal importance, I used min-max scaling i.e., all integer features are converted to range (0,1). My question is Do I also need to normalize the value column? and somehow after prediction since prediction would lie in range of (0,1) Can I de-normalize it back?
