In Django, I'd suggest having a property on the User (or Profile) model that calculates a user's reputation on-demand. Then, cache the reputation with your caching framework and/or store to the database for fast retrieval. This way, in addition to having the records of what impacts reputation, you can change your reputation criteria at will.
