Identifying differences among calibration curves: ANCOVA?

I've got a large number of calibration curves (i.e. instrument response vs. analyte concentration), and I'd like to check whether they are different from each other. Exactly one curve is associated with each unique combination of the levels of two factors (day and treatment). So, in R, the data look like this: set.seed(0) day = gl(2, 6, labels=c("day1", "day2")) treat = gl(2, 3, 12, labels=c("A", "B")) conc = rep(0:2, 4) response = conc + rnorm(12)/2 df I'd like to know whether one or both of the factors influences the slope of the calibration curve (I don't care so much about the intercept). If they're different, I will use a different calibration curve for each corresponding dataset; if they're not different, I will average them to increase the precision of the measurements that are based on the calibration curves. Is it correct to use ANCOVA to test for differences among the slopes, using the interaction of day and treat ? If so, is the correct R code model EDIT: To be clear: along with each calibration curve, I have measured data, which I will calibrate using the calibration curve. I am trying to understand whether I should use a separate calibration curve for each timepoint & treatment (which would improve accuracy, if there is an effect of timepoint and/or treatment) or whether it is acceptable to average the calibration curves (which would improve precision). Therefore I'd like to know whether treatment, timepoint, or treatment and timepoint influence the slope of the calibration curve. Actual data as a csv file is here (the number of days will increase in the future). EDIT2: Thanks to all involved in the conversation below. To clarify, I'm trying to understand what model will tell me whether there are significant differences in the slopes of the response-vs-conc curve, by either day OR treatment OR both. It might be instructive to look at my actual data, posted here , rather than the fake data I generated for simplicity. require(ggplot2) df So, it looks like there is an effect of day on the slope of the response-vs-conc plot. ggplot(df, aes(x=conc, y=response, colour=treatment)) + geom_point() + geom_line() + facet_wrap(~day) It is not as clear that there is an effect of treatment on the slope of the response-vs-conc plot. int It also looks like there is an effect of treatment on the intercept of the response-vs-conc plot.
