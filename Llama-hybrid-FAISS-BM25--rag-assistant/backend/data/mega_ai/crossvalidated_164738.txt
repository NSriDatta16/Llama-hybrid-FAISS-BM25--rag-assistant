Confidence interval of ratio estimator

As an example, consider a program that executes on two computers, A and B. Measuring the execution time of 3 executions each shows the following results: System A: 10s, 10s, 4s System B: 8s, 8s, 2s With these values, we can calculate the mean and the confidence interval for both systems (considering Student's t distribution for a confidence of 90%): A: 8s +- 5.84 B: 6s +- 5.84 We can now calculate an average speedup between System A and B as 8s/6s = 1.33. My question is : Is it possible to calculate an error or confidence interval for this speedup? If yes, how?
