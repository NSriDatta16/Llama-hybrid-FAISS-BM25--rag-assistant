FWIW: I found this article a good read Efficient substring searching It discusses several variants of Boyer-Moore although it's not in JavaScript. The Boyer-Moore-Horspool variant (by Timo Raitaâ€™s -- see first link for link) was going to be my "suggestion" for a potential practical speed gain (does not reduce big-O though -- big-O is upper limit only !). Pay attention to the Conclusion at the bottom of the article and the benchmarks above. I'm mainly trying to put up opposition for the Knuth-Morris-Pratt implementation ;-)
