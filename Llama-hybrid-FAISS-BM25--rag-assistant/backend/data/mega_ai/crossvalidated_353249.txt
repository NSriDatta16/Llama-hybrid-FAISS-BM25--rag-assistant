Can removing high correlations with binary data be used for feature selection?

I want to remove all my highly correlated features (>0.7) as feature selection process for machine learning. The thing is, that all my data is binary (or a 1 or a 0). I made a correlation matrix (with the cor() function in R), which provides me a matrix with all the correlations. Questions: Can I use correlations, based on binary data (does that make sense?) And if so, can I use it for feature selection for machine learning?
