Hiding a Mac application from the dock

I am trying to create an application with the only purpose to implement a Applescript dictionary, and extend Applescript. I have read of faceless applications ( agents ), but my application allows Applescript scripts to show some dialog boxes. What can I do to avoid my application icon appears in the dock when it is invoked by Applescript?
