Not really...linq is a query language and is not intended to mutate data structures. You can sort of get around this, but you shouldn't consider your code wrong just because it isn't linq. The only line you could add to the code you posted to 'linq-ify' it would be to change dict.ContainsKey("Key1") to dict.Any(x => x.Key == "Key1") , but don't do this as it will no doubt be slower . I actually think Darin's answer is quite elegant and recommend you use it!
