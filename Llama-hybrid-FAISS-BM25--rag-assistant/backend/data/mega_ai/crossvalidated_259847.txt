How to use the Index calculated using Factor Analysis in future surveys?

I calculated an index using factor analysis from a survey data set. What I did is, I used exploratory factor analysis (PCA method) and derive 6 factors after varimax rotation. Now, using the factor scores of the 6 factors I calculated the index by summing up the factors multiplied by its weight: index = weight1*factor1 + ...... + weight6*factor6 where weight is = % of variance explained/ %total variance explained i got the procedure from this paper http://www.cup.ualberta.ca/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/SEICUPWebsite_10April13.pdf since this survey is done every year, my aim is to get a yearly comparison of the data. Questions: 1. How will I be able to compare from year1 to year2 based on the index i calculated from year1? I plan to use this procedure: calculate the factor scores of each record in the dataset of year2 using the loadings from year1 factorscore1 = loading of variableA in year1 * value of variableA in year2 + ...+ loading of variableN in year1 * value of variableN in year2 The chosen variables are the variables with high loadings in year1 for factor1. Same procedure is followed for the other 5 factors. For year 3 dataset: factorscore1 = loading of variableA in year1 * value of variableA in year3 + ...+ loading of variableN in year1 * value of variableN in year3 Is this procedure valid? Some questions are added and deleted. Will my procedure above still valid? Thanks!
