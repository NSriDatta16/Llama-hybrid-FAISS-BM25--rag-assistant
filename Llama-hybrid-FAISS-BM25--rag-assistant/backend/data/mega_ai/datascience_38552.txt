How many Layers in the original Yoon Kim CNN implementation?

I saw some implementations of Yoon Kim's Convolutional Neural Network (Paper: http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/D14-1181 ).... ...in some implementations they put one more Dense(..) Layer before the output layer (with softmax activation). In my opinion there is no additional Dense(..) Layer in the original paper: So what's the original implementation?
