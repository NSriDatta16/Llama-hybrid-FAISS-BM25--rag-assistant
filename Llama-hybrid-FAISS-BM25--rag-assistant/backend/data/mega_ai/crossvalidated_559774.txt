Query-By-Committee with abstention

I’ve some difficulties understanding how abstention works in Active Learning. A teacher asked me to implement the active learning algorithm Query-by-Committee which helps a committee to ask the better points to the oracle. I’ve understand how the algorithm works but he also asked me to implement QBC where the oracle has the possibility to abstain from giving labels of some inputs. Actually, I read things about abstention in active learning but I’m unable to put things together. Besides, I find a contradiction with my teacher's tips (that’s certainly because I don’t understand how abstention works). For me, QBC finds the most uncertain point for the committee (with vote entropy or average KL divergence for instance) and asks their label to the oracle. But my teacher tells me that, in QBC with abstention, the oracle abstains on the most uncertain points… But that’s precisely the labels we want to… Does somebody know the high-level idea behind QBC with abstention?
