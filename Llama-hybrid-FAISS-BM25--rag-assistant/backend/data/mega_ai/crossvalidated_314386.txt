expected value of random variables in coin toss case

I was reading law of large numbers when I ran into this confusion. I am asking this doubt in context to coin-toss or dice-throw scenario. We are having i.i.d random variables $X_i$, $X_2$....$X_n$, and we define the sample mean of it as $(X_1 + X_2 + ... X_n)/n$. What does this sample mean signify ? Option 1: There are $n$ coins (or dices) and each one of them has been thrown once. We obtained the results and we represent the average of obtained results by sample mean Option 2: We are having one coin (or dice) and we toss (or throw) it $n$ times and take the average of whatever values we got and represent it with sample mean. Is there any other interpretation to this ?
