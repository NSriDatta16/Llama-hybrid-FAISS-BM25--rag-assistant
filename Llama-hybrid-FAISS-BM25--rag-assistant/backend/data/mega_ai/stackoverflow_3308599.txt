Just let Eclipse generate the directory structure. Create two projects. One for J2ME as JavaME> MIDlet project (assuming that you've correctly installed the Mobile Tools plugin) and other for JavaEE as Web > Dynamic Web Project (assuming that you're using Eclipse for Java EE and/or have installed Web Tools plugin separately). Run the J2ME project on the mobile client and run the JavaEE project on Tomcat server.
