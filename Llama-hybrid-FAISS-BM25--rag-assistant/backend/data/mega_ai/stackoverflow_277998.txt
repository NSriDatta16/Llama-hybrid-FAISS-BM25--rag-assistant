As a long time (business) Excel user and programmer, I recommend starting with a good VBA book that focuses on the key features of the Basic language, and how to communicate with the Excel objects (workbooks, sheets, etc). I wouldn't worry about userforms, initially - I haven't used those for years - and I wouldn't worry too much about databases at first either. I suggest focusing on two areas in particular, starting with the Basic language itself, writing output to the Immediate window with Debug.Print and ignoring the fact that Excel is attached. You can get very good practice in this by solving some of the Euler problems , which favour pure code solutions with no user interface. After that, I would learn how to talk to the Excel objects, and read as many Excel forums and web pages as possible to pick up tips. For example, it is much faster to read and write many cells at once, than one at a time. And yes, VBA is not as full featured as most 'professional' languages, but it has one crucial advantage over most of them - it is much easier to write and for the average user to check, modify and maintain - and checkability and flexibility are crucial in the business world. Together with Excel, it is an amazing business tool.
