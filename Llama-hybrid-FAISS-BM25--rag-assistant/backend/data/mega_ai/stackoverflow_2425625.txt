If I understand correctly you just want to learn if a URL is good or bad. A SVM is not appropriate, SVM's are only appropriate if the dataset is very complex and many of the information points are close to the hyperplane. You'd use a SVM to add extra dimensions to the data. You'd want a few thousand URL's ideally to train your dataset. The more the better, obviously you could do it with just 100 but your results may not produce good classifications. I'd suggest you build your data set first and use Weka http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/ You can measure which algorithm gives you the best results.
