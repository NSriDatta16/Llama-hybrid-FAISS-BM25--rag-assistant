Clearing Magento Log Data

I have a question regarding clearing of the log data in Magento. I have more than 2.3GB of data in Magento 1.4.1, and now I want to optimize the database, because it's too slow due to the size of the data. I checked the log info (URL,Visitors) and it shows more than 1.9 GB. If I directly clear those records, will it affect any functionality in the site? How can I clear the log details? By clearing those data will I have or lose any data on my site?
