I figured it out! All I had to do was make sure the cssclass was draggable via javascript using Jquery. Apply .draggable to the class, and make sure that this bit of js is in the and not of the page. Also learned that my method of creating controls in a table format does not seem to work, I had to put a container panel where I wanted the controls, then add them individually to the panel. Works great!
