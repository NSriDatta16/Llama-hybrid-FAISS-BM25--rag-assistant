Database design for a product aggregator

I'm trying to design a database for a product aggregator. Each product has information about where it comes from, what it costs, what type of thing it is, price, color, etc. Users need to able to search and filter results based on any of those product categories. I also expect to have a large number of users. My initial thought was having one big table with every product in it with a column for each piece of information and an index on anything I need to be able to search by but I think this might be inefficient with a lot of users pounding on this one table. My other thought was to organize the database to promote a tree-like navigation of tables but because you can search by anything I'm not sure how I would organize the tables. Any thoughts on some good practices?
