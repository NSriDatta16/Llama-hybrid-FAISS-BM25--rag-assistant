Is there any way in .NET to programmatically listen to HTTP traffic?

I'm using browser automation for testing web sites but I need to verify HTTP requests from the browser (i.e., images, external scripts, XmlHttpRequest objects). Is there a way to programmatically instantiate a proxy or packet sniffer for the browser to use in order to see what its sending? I'm already using Fiddler to watch the traffic but I want something that's UI-less that I can use in continuous build integration. Can I easily get the HTTP-specific information from WinpCap?
