How can I measure model performance with weighted logistic regression?

I am working with some survey data that uses probability weights. A number of sources explain that likelihood-based tests and fit statistics like likelihood-ratio, AIC, and BIC are not valid in the context of the weighted MLE . Are there other tests, statistics, or graphics that one can use in this context to get an idea of how one model performs relative to another model?
