SubSonic 3 Installation Doesn't Work?

Ok I have following the tutorial here as best I can http://subsonicproject.com/docs/Setting_up_SubSonic_3.0 As the files you get in the download are nothing like what is shown in the video?? So I am literally just guessing which files to use?? Then I drag the files / folders into Visual studio (As the video shows) and NOTHING happens?? It just adds the files to my solution?? Or adds the folders to my solution as normal files... Nothing gets executed as shown in the video?? I realise Rob has spent a lot of time on this off his own back, and I am trying not to be a whining old women BUT... How are we expected to use it, if the installation video is completely different to the actual files you get in the download AND when you drag the files into VS2008 nothing happens - Which is completely different to the video? My VS does not recognise TT files as being anything special... I really want to use this new version, as I loved v2.1 but I'm loosing faith RANT OVER
