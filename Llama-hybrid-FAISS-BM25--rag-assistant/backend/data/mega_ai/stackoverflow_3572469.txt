Magento is locked into an MVC framework, so replacing the framework code with an arbitrary PHP file is going to be difficult. If you give more details on what you would like to do differently than the core code, we can help you figure out what changes to make. Thanks, Joe Shooting from the hip, take a look at this tutorial on how to create a controller. Generally, what you'll be doing here is to create an action that will receive your form post, then execute whatever code you need. So you'll be defining http://mystore.com/somecontroller/something by creating MyModule_controllers_Somecontroller with a method called somethingAction . With some more detail, I can find you more specific examples.
