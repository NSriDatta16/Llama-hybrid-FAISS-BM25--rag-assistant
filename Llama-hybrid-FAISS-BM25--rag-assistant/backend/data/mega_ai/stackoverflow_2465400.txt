You can pass a uri to _trackPageview that would permit you to log the request in whatever format you'd like, including however your user's requesting the page. Remove/replace the original call to pageTracker._trackPageview with the following: pageTracker._trackPageview('/topcategory/subcategory'); You'd just need to plug in the topcategory and subcategory info. If the info is available in the URL you could parse it out using js on the fly.
