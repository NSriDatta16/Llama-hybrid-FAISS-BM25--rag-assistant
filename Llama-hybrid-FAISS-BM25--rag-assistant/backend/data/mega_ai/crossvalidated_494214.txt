Distance matrix time series analysis? (Ecology/diversity)

I am trying to analyze a time series of ecological data. Each time point in the series is a matrix of animals-by-foods (that they were observed to eat). For each of these time points, I compute the distance between each pair of animals' foods to generate a distance matrix of food dissimilarity between animals in each time point. What I want to investigate is how food-consumption dissimilarity changes through time. For example, how does season influence food-consumption similarity. It's not clear to me how I would go about doing that. On the one hand, I thought that I could simply take the mean dissimilarity for each time point and regress that against season. However, this seems sub-optimal since it obviously reduces the data greatly. A friend suggested a mixed-model approach where the response is the vector of all pairwise distances with a fixed effect of season and separate random effects for each of the animal IDs associated with each pairwise distance but I haven't found much online backing up the validity of this suggestion. Finally, multivariate approaches don't seem appropriate because my response variable would be several different distance matrices rather than one. Any and all suggestions welcome! Example of raw data where a-d (rows) represent each animal. Columns represent different food items and their proportional abundance in an animal's diet $Summer_Year1 food_1 food_2 food_3 food_4 food_5 food_6 a 0.00000000 0.00000000 0.46124791 0.00000000 0.5387521 0.00000000 b 0.00000000 0.45506757 0.12772222 0.02664421 0.3704323 0.02013374 c 0.23193584 0.03589622 0.07236377 0.02344589 0.2364787 0.39987961 d 0.09437105 0.27949426 0.00000000 0.24855345 0.1562197 0.22136156 . . . $ Winter_Year2 food_1 food_2 food_3 food_4 a 0.2634612 0.1876040 0.3021284 0.2468064 b 0.2364633 0.7635367 0.0000000 0.0000000 c 0.2496862 0.2261279 0.2936277 0.2305582 d 0.5786246 0.1852360 0.0000000 0.2361394 From these animal-by-food matrices, I computed animal-animal dissimilarities in diet composition (here using Bray-Curtis dissimiliarity with vegan::vegdist in R): $Summer_Year1 a b c b 0.5018455 c 0.6911576 0.6116817 d 0.8437803 0.5175081 0.4687056 . . . $ Winter_Year2 a b c b 0.57593268 c 0.03852387 0.53740882 d 0.31516336 0.57830069 0.33451958 So my aims are to assess how animal-animal diet dissimilarity changes between seasons where I feel like I could: (1) Average the diet dissimilarity at each time point to reduce each collection period to one measure of diet dissimilarity between all animal species (2) Use all pairwise values across all distance matrices in my analyses but include some model structure to account for the non-independence of data points Or, (3) some other approach.
