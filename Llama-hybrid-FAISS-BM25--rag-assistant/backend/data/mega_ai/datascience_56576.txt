First Approach: You can probably train a CNN ( Convolutional Neural Network ) on the images you have. If the number of images is less, I prefer you to use Transfer Learning . In Transfer learning, we have a highly trained model ( like Inception, ResNet ) and we modify it so that it can classify images which we need. Second Approach: Use object detection. You need to localize an object ( card ) from the image and then classify that cropped image. This could be tedious if you're a beginner. You can refer to these links: https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/training.html https://towardsdatascience.com/creating-your-own-object-detector-ad69dda69c85 https://pythonprogramming.net/training-custom-objects-tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial/ You need to train a localization model which can track and crop your images ( of cards ).
