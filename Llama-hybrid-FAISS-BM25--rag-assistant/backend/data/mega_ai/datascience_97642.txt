Every machine learning algorithm suffers from the curse of dimensionality to different degrees. The primary issue is the sparsity of observations as the number of dimensions increases. Since decision trees are greedy, they are one of the most robust machine learning algorithms to sparsity. Decision trees will always find the single feature that creates the most pure regions. This process is recursively repeated. Decision trees learn to ignore less informative dimensions.
