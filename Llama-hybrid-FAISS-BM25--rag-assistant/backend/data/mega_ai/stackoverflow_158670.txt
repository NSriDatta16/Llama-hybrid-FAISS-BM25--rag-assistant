Programming is a tool of computer science. In many area's of programming, math is in the back seat. If you don't know how to quick sort, download a module to do it for you. You don't understand elliptical curves, no problem, buy an AES encryption module. Now for computer science. Yes, you need higher level math. No doubt about it. Cryptography, operating systems, compiler construction, machine learning, programming languages, and so on all require some form of higher math (calculus, discrete, linear, complex) to fully understand.
