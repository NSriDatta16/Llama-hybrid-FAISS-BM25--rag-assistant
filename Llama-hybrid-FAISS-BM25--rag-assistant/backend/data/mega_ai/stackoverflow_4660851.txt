Some things that come up instantly: Make sure you don't confuse the C++ "char" and the C# "char". You probably know that a "char" in C# is not really one-byte primitive. So, in the process of porting you might get confused, pay attention that in C# you port the C++ "char" to "byte". As Brennan Vincent said, C++ supports multi-inheritance while C# doesn't. You'll probably have to re-think the hierarchy, if your classes are "complex". Pointers are NOT native in C# as in C++. Again, it depends how you wrote your C++ app but I can bet you're using pointers there, so make sure the usafe corresponds with C#'s because it handles them differently, transparently from the programmer (in most cases). I might add a few more later, nice question!
