To answer this question depends on which variable you consider to have more weight. Based on your data points, I'm going to assume that 100% of the work is equivalent to investing 100% of the money. int getPercentageOfA(double moneyA, double workA, double moneyB, double workB) { // Perhaps you may assume that workA == 0 aWorkPercentage = getPercentageOfAForWork(double workA, double workB); aMoneyPercentage = getPercentageOfMoney(double moneyA, double moneyB); weightMoney = 1; weightWork = 1; result = ( weightWork*aWorkPercentage + weightMoney*aMoneyPercentage) / 2 return result; } Compute each variable separately and then average them together. The advantage of this formula is that if person A and person B decide to treat work as being more valuable than money or vice versa, then the "weights" could be adjusted to reflect the final percentage.
