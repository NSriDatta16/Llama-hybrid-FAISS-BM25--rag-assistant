No, you can't use user name and password in the connection string. You may create a WindowsIdentity and impersonate it before opening the connection, that will connect using the impersonated identity, but that is extremely discouraged. Technically you can also run the application under a 'netonly' credential (ie. it has one identity for local resources, and another identity for network resources) using runas /netonly , but this is just as bad as hard coding the impersonated context. Having the application run under one credential and then use a different credential to connect to the database is very bad. You must either run the application under the credential created for you to connect to the database, either grant the application's credential the privileges to connect to the database. Having two separate identities doesn't make any sense.
