You dont say what version of Access you are using. I used to use Access 97 and Access 2003 with a FE/BE situation and I have a lot of disconnects and corruptions. We paid for M$ technical support after many months of mission critical apps just failing or getting corrupt daily. What we were told was for mission critical, use Access as your FE and some other RDMS as your backend. We already had Oracle running for other things so we used that. MySQL would work (free) and there are others still. Switching solved our issues completely. Our databases were anywhere from 5mb to 1.2gb and they all were getting corrupt. We did also have about 20 users in the apps too. We have about 45 apps as well. I did Y2K on all of these What a drag that was! Hit em up if you need anything else....
