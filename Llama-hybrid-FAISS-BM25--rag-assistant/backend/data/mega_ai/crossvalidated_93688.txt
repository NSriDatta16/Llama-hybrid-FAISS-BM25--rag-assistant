I think the simplest thing to do is to make two models: One for people who had no previous cancer and one for those who did. If you try to make a model for all the people, you will run into both nonsensical things like the margin size of a cancer that isn't there and collinearity issues. Another option within logistic regression is to include "missing" as a value for the variables, but 1) There could still be collinearity and 2) That removes the possibility of using those variables numerically. Yet another would be to use a classification tree.
