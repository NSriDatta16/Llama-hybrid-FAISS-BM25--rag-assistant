PHP Framework OOP model

I think I am experienced procedural PHP programmer. I've implemented a few bigger projects. Now I would like to try OOP PHP on lesser one (framework for DB import/export + user authentication). Since I've never tried OOP on such a project I have problem with object design. I would like to implement the framework the way, I'll just need to create one instance of the object to use whole framework. I would also like to keep the code well arranged, so I won't implement only one class for all methods/properties. How could I split one big class in to few lessers to keep them organized (in more php files)? I think I'll have to implement one base class and then extend it using the others. But that way I'll have many of small classes, not big one. How would you solve this problem? I hope I explained the problem well. Thanks for any help.
