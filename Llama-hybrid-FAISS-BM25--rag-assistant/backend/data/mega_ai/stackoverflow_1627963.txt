Can one CSS page reference another?

Let's say I have css1.css and css2.css. Just for the sake of keeping files organized and small on my file system / Source control I would like to split them up however in my content, I still want to use all the definitions in both files. Rather than link reference both in my content page, can css1.css just make css2.css available.
