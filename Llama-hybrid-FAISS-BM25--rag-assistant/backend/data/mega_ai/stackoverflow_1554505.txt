OK, so here's the deal. It's not a bug, at least not on Silverlight's part! It's a bug on the part of the developer! If you look closer at the gradient used in the resource, only the first two hex values change (see below). This is, of course, the Alpha channel, along with all Fs following that, I'm really just going from one level of transparency to another. Now, becuase this is a component that's being injected into a larger page, the background is set by the larger page. So in Blend, the background is BLEND's background, which is a gray color, which makes the whole thing look like it has a gray gradient in Blend, but it's simply white with various levels of transparency. When the control is injected into the main page which has a white background, you can't see it. So, what's moral of this story? Pay attention to the color you're working with!
