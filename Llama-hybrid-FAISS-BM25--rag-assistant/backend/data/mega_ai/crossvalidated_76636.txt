BIC and AIC can both be regarded as (asymptotically) Bayesian (under different situations), but they can also be regarded just as penalized (/regularized) maximum likelihood, for example. That is, using BIC to do model selection doesn't mean you're being inherently Bayesian; a frequentist might choose to use it based on the fact that in many situations its frequentist properties are quite reasonable. On the other hand, you could treat both halves of the procedure as Bayesian - after all, the ML estimates can be Bayesian ... if you use flat priors and your estimates are MAP . So you can reasonably claim to be frequentist twice or Bayesian twice. However , that is not to say that - regarded as either a frequentist or a Bayesian procedure - the approach you're discussing is wise ... but that wasn't the question.
