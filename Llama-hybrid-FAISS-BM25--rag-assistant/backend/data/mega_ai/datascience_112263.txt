You can use sklearn GridSearchCV , which has a parameter called n_jobs , and according to the documentation n_jobs : int, default=None Number of jobs to run in parallel. None means 1 unless in a joblib.parallel_backend context. -1 means using all processors. See Glossary for more details. So by setting n_jobs=-1 you'll be running several experiments at the same time, and the overall time to get the best hyperparameters will be reduced. However, there are better techniques than grid search, for example, bayesian optimization. With bayesian optimization, you let the information of past rounds guide where to look for the best hyperparameters, so with less iterations you can get better results than in grid search. Optuna is a python library that allows you to do bayesian optimization, and also allows you to easily parallelize the tuning .
