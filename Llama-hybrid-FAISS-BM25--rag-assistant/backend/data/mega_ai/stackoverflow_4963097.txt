Size of a graph using adjacency list versus adjacency matrix?

Suppose there are 2 36 web pages and on average each web page has 2 4 hyperlinks. Consider the directed graph with one vertex per web page and an edge between two vertices if there is a hyperlink between the web pages the vertices represent. How many terabytes would it take to represent the graph using an adjacency matrix? Using an adjacency list? My question is what would be the main difference between the list and the matrix?
