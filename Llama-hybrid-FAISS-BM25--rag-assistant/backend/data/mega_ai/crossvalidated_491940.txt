classic multi dimensional scaling example

I am reading this note. http://fourier.eng.hmc.edu/e176/lectures/MultidimensionScaling.pdf P.17 it has a Distance matrix, D = array([[0, 1,1,1], [1, 0, 1,1], [1, 1,0,1], [1,1,1,0]]) then it mentioned "leading to the gram matrix B(4Ã—4) with eigenvalues (.5, .5, .5, 0)." I would like to ask how get the gram matrix from D? I tried to appl G = I -D/2(?). (from here: https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2240429/pairwise-distance-matrix ) But when i get the PCA, i got [ 0.062 0.062 0.062 0. ] from sklearn.decomposition import PCA G = 1-D/2 pca = PCA() pca.fit(G) print(pca.explained_variance_) must be something wrong.
