Problem with two layers: how to predict?

Let me get straigt into it: Think of an scheduled operation. There is a surgeon and, say, three other medical personel that carry out various tasks. For instance, a nurse, an anesthesiologist, and a backup. Each one reports to duty at a certain time. However, with some probability p (to be predicted) one or many member(s) of the team won't show up for work. If an individual does not show up for work, but his particular skill set is still covered due to the backup, then the operation is done. Otherwise, it is cancelled. For instance, if the backup is a certified anesthesiologist, absence of the scheduled anesthesiologist does not prevent the surgery from taking place since a minimum required skill mix is given. If, however, the backup is a nurse, and the anesthesiologist does not show up, then the surgery has to be cancelled. This problem involves two layers: Does an individual team member show up for work? Is an individual team member's skill critical for the execution of the surgery. My goal is to predict cancellation of the surgery, which involves step 1 and step 2 simulataneously (alternatively, you could think of step 2 being conditional on step 1). I have a good understanding of how to use standard machine learning algorithms to predict 1. But how do I generate final predictions taking both layers into account? The problem set up seems reasonably general so that I would assume there exists a "standard" method?
