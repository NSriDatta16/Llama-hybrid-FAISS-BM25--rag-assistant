I'd approach this problem from a programmers angle; I'd have a separate table (or storage area somewhere) that stored the max,min and sum values associated with each field in your original query and update those values every time I updated and added a table record. (although deleting may be problematic if not handled correctly). After the original query to populate these values is complete (which is the almost the same as the query you posted), you're essentially reducing your final query to getting one row from a data table, rather than computing everything all at once.
