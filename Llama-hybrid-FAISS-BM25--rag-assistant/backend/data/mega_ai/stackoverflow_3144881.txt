How do I detect a HTML5 drag event entering and leaving the window, like Gmail does?

I'd like to be able to highlight the drop area as soon as the cursor carrying a file enters the browser window, exactly the way Gmail does it. But I can't make it work, and I feel like I'm just missing something really obvious. I keep trying to do something like this: this.body = $('body').get(0) this.body.addEventListener("dragenter", this.dragenter, true) this.body.addEventListener("dragleave", this.dragleave, true)` But that fires the events whenever the cursor moves over and out of elements other than BODY, which makes sense, but absolutely doesn't work. I could place an element on top of everything, covering the entire window and detect on that, but that'd be a horrible way to go about it. What am I missing?
