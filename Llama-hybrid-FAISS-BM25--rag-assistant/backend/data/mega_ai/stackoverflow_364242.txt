As keithwarren7 suggested, do some Google-ing, and you will see (as per your comment) that it is totally NOT cool to do this. (Ok, it is in some cases, but almost always not, IMO.) What is cool, and much more rare than you would think, is using relational databases in the way they were intended to be used, with a well-thought-out schema design. You will find this gives you better data integrity, performance, uses less storage, and is generally a whole lot easier to work with than the Entity-Attribute-Value model is. There are some clear pitfalls you will read about, e.g., you will be responsible for enforcing referential integrity yourself, rather than the db. At any rate, research this idea carefully (beyond stackoverflow) before you go ahead with it, as it is a really big deal to change your mind once you have implemented this way.
