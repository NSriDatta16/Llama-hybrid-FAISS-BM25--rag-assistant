One possible way to approach training on additional data while maintaining performance on previous data is to have unit tests on model performance. If the updated model weights do not pass the unit tests, then do not accept the updated model weights. If there is reduced performance on previous data points, those data points can be passed into the model again so updated model weights are encouraged to fit to important previous data points also.
