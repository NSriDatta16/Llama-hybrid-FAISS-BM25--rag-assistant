The best option is not to try and redirect based on user-agent sniffing, but to put your mobile content onto a specific url, and make those options available. User-agent sniffing is ok up to a point, but you cannot rely on it 100%. Related to this, PPK's post on javascript detection is good reading. That said, if you are dead set on doing user-agent redirection, you will need to have some way to be able to update your list of devices, and user-agent strings - something like codeigniter's user agent class will be more useful over the long run.
