It's a bit of a stretch to call your approach caching, because caching is usually on demand (or lazy caching), as opposed to pre-caching where content is loaded before it is actually required. You can switch from pre-caching to lazy caching If you have to do pre-caching, you can keep cache in some sort of persistent storage, but close to your server. For Azure you have a choice between Table or Blob storage and SQL Azure. With persistent cache you don't load it every time your role instance updated or restarted. If you can wait a little, AppFabric Cache would provide you a lot of flexibility and scalability, so you don't have to maintain separate cache on each of your role instances.
