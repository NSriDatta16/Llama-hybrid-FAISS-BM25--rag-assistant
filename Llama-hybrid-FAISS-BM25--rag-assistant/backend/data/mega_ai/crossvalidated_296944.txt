Can Q-learning adapt?

I am new to reinforcement learning, i have studied about its basics and principles, however, i have one question: If I implemented q-learning to a robot, for example, to make my robot learn to navigate around the house to pick up a ball, then the optimal policy for the robot in that house is found If i am to change the environment, such as, moving the ball to another place, change the place of my furniture, or make the robot find a ball in my friend's house instead Can the robot adapt to the new environment, and how fast will it be? Thank you
