From sampling only once, you can conclude that the probability of drawing a dinosaur is greater than zero. Any other conclusion would depend on having prior knowledge about the problem. One example that gets a lot of attention is modeling presidential races. If you only knew who won (a singular sampling), you wouldn't be able to conclude much about the chances the candidates had of winning before the election besides that the winner had a non-zero probability of winning and the loser had a less than one probability of winning. Edit: for a continuous variable, I would conclude that the probability density function at the value sampled is non-zero.
