I have solved this problem by using exec to generate code from a string using icontains instead of in. I admit, it's sloppy and not elegant, and should be audited for security but it worked. see the untested/pseudocode: query = "product_results = Product.objects.filter(" for word in words: query += "Q(title__icontains(word))|" query += "Q(brand__icontains(word))|" query += "Q(description__icontains(word))|" query = query[:-1] # remove the trailing | query += ")" exec("product_results = "+query) Again, this is probably not advisable, and I'm sure there's a better way to do this, but this fixed me up in a pinch once so I thought I would share. Also note, I don't use this code anymore as I've switched over to sqlalchemy which makes these kinds of dynamic queries a bit easier since it's "or" object accepts a list.
