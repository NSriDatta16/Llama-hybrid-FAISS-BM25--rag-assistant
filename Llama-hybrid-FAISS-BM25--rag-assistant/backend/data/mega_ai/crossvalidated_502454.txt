Bayesian regression for large dataset/matrix

I have encountered issues of fitting BKMR in large dataset. A BKMR model was constructed with binomial link. model_bkmr of which y is an vector of 600000 numbers (0/1), X is a matrix of numeric predictors with 6 cols and 600000 rows, X is a numeric covariate matrix with 7 cols and 600000 rows, group is an vector of 600000 numbers (1-6) indicating six groups for the 600000 rows. The model can not be fitted due to the expensive matrix computations, is there anyway to cope with such situation?
