iphone - passing an object on an UIToolbarButton action

Is that possible to make a UIToolbarButton pass an object to its target by using some exoteric method (as it seems not to be possible using regular button use)? I mean something like UIBarButtonItem *Button = [[UIBarButtonItem alloc] initWithImage:buttonImage style:UIBarButtonItemStylePlain target:self action:@selector(doSomething:) **withObject:usingThis**]; I know I can trigger a method that will launch the full method with the object, but for the sake of elegance I was trying to minimize the code... I suspect it is not possible, but as you guys out there are insanely good you may come with an transcendental answer... who knows...
