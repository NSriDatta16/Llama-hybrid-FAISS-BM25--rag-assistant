What is the fundamental assumption for using resampling methods?

Suppose that I observe a set of non-i.i.d. data (time series) $\mathcal{L} = \left\lbrace (y_{t}, x_{t}) \right\rbrace_{t=1}^{T}$ with $x_{t} = (x_{t1},\ldots,x_{tP})$ a real valued vector of $P$ inputs. Suppose for simplicity that the output and the inputs are stationary. I'm trying to model the relation between my output and my inputs using a Random Forest that I denote $\psi(., \theta)$ , with $\theta$ a vector of parameters and hyperparameters. I further assume that $$ (H1): ~~ \forall t, y_{t}=\psi(x_{t}, \theta) + \varepsilon_{t}$$ such that the $\left\lbrace \varepsilon_{t} \right\rbrace_{t=1}^{T}$ are i.i.d. with $\mathbb{E}(\varepsilon_{t}) = 0 $ and $\mathbb{V}(\varepsilon_{t}) = \sigma^{2} $ . The disturbances and the inputs are assumed to be independant. Question1: Knowing that the data are clearly not i.i.d., is $(H1)$ a sufficient condition to use K-fold cross validation ? Should the i.i.d. assumption relate to the data or the disturbances ? According to the papers I read, it is necessary to have independent training and test sets. Yet, Bergmeir, Hyndman & Koo (2018) argues that CV can be used as with i.i.d. data even if it involves using the future to predict the past. Question2: Knowing that the data are stationary and that resampling overlapping blocks of data as in Kunsch (1989) doesn't generate independent training and test (out-of-bag) samples, is there an interest in using block-bootstrap methods for generating the bootstrap samples of the RF ?
