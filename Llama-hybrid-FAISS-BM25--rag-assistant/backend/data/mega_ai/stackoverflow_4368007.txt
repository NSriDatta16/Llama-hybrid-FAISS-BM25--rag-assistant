Can I use a "Screen name" while registering as 'standard individual' in iPhone Developer Program?

I am thinking about registering into iPhone Developer Program, with an enquiry about the name to register. I can only register as 'standard individual', but I do not want my real name showing in the AppStore in the future, which seems absurd, with your personal name public when you are not a public figure. But I do not have a company as well. So I wonder whether we can register with real name as 'standard individual', but using a "screen name" in AppStore? Does Apple allow this? (I know if this is allowed loosely, there will be a lot of confusion in the AppStore as all sorts of strange names will show up, but I really expect there is a way out, like controlled "Screen names"?) New findings: A friend just told me that "umbrella organisations" such as a department of university can register with a team, with a team "agent", several "admin"s and "member"s. It has "Company/Organization ID" in the iOS Developer Program, and the "Account Type" is "Company/Organization". Obviously it is not a "registered company/organisation" or independent trading entity (I guess only the university itself, not its many departments, is an independent trading entity?) If a department can register as a "company/organisation", does it mean there is some kind of middle-ground between an officially registered company and personal name?
