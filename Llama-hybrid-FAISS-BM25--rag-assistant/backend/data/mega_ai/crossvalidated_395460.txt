The case when the Metropolis-Hastings proposal $g$ is symmetric as in $g(x\mid y)=g(y\mid x)$ (and the above excerpt from Metropolis et al. 1953) does not imply that the stationary distribution $\pi$ associated with this proposal and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is uniform, but only that the Metropolis-Hastings acceptance ratio $$1\wedge\frac{\pi(x')g(x\mid x')}{\pi(x)g(x\mid x)}=1\wedge\frac{\pi(x')}{\pi(x)}$$ does not depend on $g$ . Even though $g$ itself as a Markov kernel is associated with a uniform measure, due to the acceptance step in the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, the stationary distribution of the algorithm is not the stationary distribution of the proposal. This is the whole idea and appeal of the algorithm that the acceptance probability modifies the stationary distribution of the Markov chain thus generated.
