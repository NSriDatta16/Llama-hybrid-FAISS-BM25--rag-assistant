I've seen examples of clean, modular BASIC code that predate VB. In general, you can use any programming approach with any syntax, although some syntaxes encourage a particular style. The BASIC language is free-form enough that the style it tends to encourage is "messy". Over the years Microsoft has made an effort to introduce features in VB that promote more structure.
