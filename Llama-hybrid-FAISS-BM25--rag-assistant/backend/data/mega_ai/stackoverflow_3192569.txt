Move the listbox items instead of the "selector bar"

1-Is it possible to move the listbox items instead of the "selector bar". In that way, the selector bar has a static position but the items will move. what Im trying to achieve is something like the scrollbar at the bottom of this image: http://i.afterdawn.com/storage/pictures/plex_netflix_addon_3.png 2-is Listbox with horizontal orientation the appropriate tool to implement a thumbnail viewer like the one in the example? 3-I want it to be animated in the future updates? possible?
