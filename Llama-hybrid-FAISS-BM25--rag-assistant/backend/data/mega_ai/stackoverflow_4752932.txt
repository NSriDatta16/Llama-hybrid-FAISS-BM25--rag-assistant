I am assuming you want to avoid going an ajax route. If so, just put the message string in a cookie and test for the presence of a message in your view. If there is a message, display it. Since it is in a cookie you can retrieve the message even if you redirect after processing a successful post. Make sure to clear the cookie after you show the message! We've formalized this process at my company and refer to it as the "Flash" (like Ruby on Rails used to, or maybe still does). Ideally you could wrap the message setting, retrieval and display logic into a helper class to abstract its implementation from your view. That way you could use cookies, viewdata or even session values and your views and controllers would not have to change behavior.
