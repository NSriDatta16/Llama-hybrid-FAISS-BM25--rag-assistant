Kudos on your presentation . The problem you are running into maybe due to the model that you are specifying . Hourly data is often quite dependent on daily activity which in turn can often be described (instantiate in your words) by deterministic effects. We have found that a two level approach can be useful Hidden markov model to detect Stock outs in Hourly sales Time series data where 24 hourly models are developed using as a predictor the daily totals. It appears that your non-significant predictor may be driving the downward forecast but I would have to delve much further into your data to substantiate that reflection . I have also seen the inclusion of a non-significant trend constant can lead to your circumstance.
