Determine by AUC and RMSE if Logistic Regression or Decision Tree is a better model?

I am using Linear Regression and Decision Tree to predict whether an e-mail is spam or no spam. I have built both models and got different values regarding AUC and RMSE. Can I determine by AUC and RMSE which model is better? Is there an unconditional model-leader? For example, I have for Logistic Regression: AUC = 89.87% RMSE = 34.75% Accuracy = 84.86 % for Decision Tree: AUC = 89.73% RMSE = 32.99% I would be very, very grateful about some advice.
