Question 1: how many groups should I create? There is no rule of thumb but typically if you have n categories of data you may want to set k as 10*n. This has known to work well, however you can always change this number by looking at the accuracy on your validation data set. Question 2: Creation of histograms Let us say you extract m features from each image and your dictionary contains k words, for each of these m features you would find the closest match to the k words and assign this word to that particular feature. This way you will have m number of visual words taking one of the k values. Now you count the occurrence of these visual words and creating a normalized histogram out of it. So each image will have a normalized histogram of the k visual words. Question 3: Classification Now that we know how to extract a histogram for a given image, we would compute the histograms on the training data and given a test image we extract its histogram. Now, how we classify this is entirely up to you. You could just find the closest match in the histograms of training data using euclidian distance or do a weighted sum etc. A simple way of obtaining probabilistic data is to train a neural network with softmax at the output layer and given a test image pass its histogram through the network and obtain the probabilities.
