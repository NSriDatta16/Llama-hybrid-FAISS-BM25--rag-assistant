Localhost Unable to POST

So I have working version of a graph that I made with the Google Charts API, and I post the Chart data/configuration like this: $context = stream_context_create( array('http' => array( 'method' => 'POST', 'content' => http_build_query($chart)))); fpassthru(fopen($url, 'r', false, $context)); It works great! But when I check it out on my local windows box and try to run it with Xampp I get this error: Warning: fopen(http://chart.apis.google.com/chart?chid=982f36) [function.fopen]: failed to open stream: HTTP request failed! HTTP/1.0 400 Bad Request in C:\xampp\htdocs\graph\image.php on line 226 I have had a look at my php.ini file on the localbox and it has this under fopen wrappers: ; Whether to allow the treatment of URLs (like http:// or ftp://) as files. ; http://php.net/allow-url-fopen allow_url_fopen = On ; Whether to allow include/require to open URLs (like http:// or ftp://) as files. ; http://php.net/allow-url-include allow_url_include = Off ; Define the anonymous ftp password (your email address). PHP's default setting ; for this is empty. ; http://php.net/from ;from="john@doe.com" ; Define the User-Agent string. PHP's default setting for this is empty. ; http://php.net/user-agent ;user_agent="PHP" ; Default timeout for socket based streams (seconds) ; http://php.net/default-socket-timeout default_socket_timeout = 60 ; If your scripts have to deal with files from Macintosh systems, ; or you are running on a Mac and need to deal with files from ; unix or win32 systems, setting this flag will cause PHP to ; automatically detect the EOL character in those files so that ; fgets() and file() will work regardless of the source of the file. ; http://php.net/auto-detect-line-endings ;auto_detect_line_endings = Off What could be the problem here? Any advice would help Thanks!
