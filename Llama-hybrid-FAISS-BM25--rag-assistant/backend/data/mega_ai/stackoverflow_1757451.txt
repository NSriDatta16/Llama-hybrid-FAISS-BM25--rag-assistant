finding parent of nested resource that has multiple types of parents

Given a model like: class PhoneNumber :personal_phone_numbers has_many :households, :through => :household_phone_numbers has_many :organizations, :through => :organization_phones end When viewing a phone number, I'm probably going to be viewing it as a nested resource, so the controller is going to have a params item of one of person_id , household_id , or organization_id I need the view to have a link_to "Return", ... that returns to the correct resource that we came to the phone number from. How should I do this?
