You never never ever never want to build a SQL statement using user input that will be then directly executed. This leads to SQL injection attacks, as you've found. It would be trivial for someone to drop a table in your database, as you've described. You want to use parameterized queries, where you build an SQL string using placeholders for the values, then pass the values in for those parameters. Using VB you'd do something like: 'Define our sql query' Dim sSQL As String = "SELECT FirstName, LastName, Title " & _ "FROM Employees " & _ "WHERE ((EmployeeID > ? AND HireDate > ?) AND Country = ?)" 'Populate Command Object' Dim oCmd As New OledbCommand(sSQL, oCnn) 'Add up the parameter, associated it with its value' oCmd.Parameters.Add("EmployeeID", sEmpId) oCmd.Parameters.Add("HireDate", sHireDate) oCmd.Parameters.Add("Country", sCountry) (example taken from here ) (also not I'm not a VB programmer so this might not be proper syntax, but it gets the point across)
