Is machine learning successful in solving combinatorial optimisation problems in NP-hard? Discuss problem of scheduling using machine learning

Chess is Exp-complete. I assume Alpha GO is also Exp complete. Correct me if I am wrong. Now deep reinforcement learning has been successful in tackling this problem. What about other more practical problems like scheduling, bin-packing, and routing? In particular, what is the state of the art for scheduling applications using ML techniques? How should one start in this direction?
