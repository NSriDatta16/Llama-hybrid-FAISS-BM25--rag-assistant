You would have to store the information about which pages were visited before. Personally I would use a server-side solution for that (session or database) but if you want to do it client-side you would have to use something like cookies or local data storage. For a client-side solution, you can use a combination of html5 local data storage for browsers that support it and cookies for the rest.
