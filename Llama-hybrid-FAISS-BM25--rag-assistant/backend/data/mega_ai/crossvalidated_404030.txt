Conflict between predicated outcomes in logistic regression

I was using caret in R to use logistic regression to make prediction. I only have one predictor named OEI and the outcome variable is pass/fail. However, although I was able to perform that task and get confusion matrix, etc, I was trapped in a conceptual question about the transformation of logistic regression TO convert everything between probabilities between 0-1. When I print out the predicted probabilities for the 'pass' cases, there are obviously probabilities higher/ lower than 0.5 which were further translated into pass/fail based on 0.5 cutoff However, as I was trying to plot the relationship between the only predictor (OEI) and its associated probabilities of 'pass', all the predicted probabilities are above 0.5 which means all the data should result in a 'pass' outcome, but this is obviously not true based on the result from the previous step. Here is my R code to plot the the relationship above: Can anyone please help resolve this conflict?
