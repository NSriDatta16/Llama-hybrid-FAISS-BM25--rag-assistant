If you only require to simply move a column without any fancy drag-drop animation, the following JS should do the trick: $(function() { jQuery.each($("table tr"), function() { $(this).children(":eq(1)").after($(this).children(":eq(0)")); }); }); Replacing the numbers as necessary. The concept works It seems that writing this as a one liner isn't really possible. including td in the selector, even with the row selector seems to hold each td on a separate index, ignoring rows. A jQuery grid plugin should do the trick otherwise. Although I have no experience with such plugins.
