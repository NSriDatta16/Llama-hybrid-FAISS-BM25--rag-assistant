How do I install PDT 2.0 in Eclipse Ganymede?

I've been trying to install PDT in Eclipse 3.4 for a few hours now and I'm not having any success. I have a previous installation of the Eclipse for Java EE developers (my main deal) distro and I just want to add the PDT to my install so I can also work on some of my websites in Eclipse. I've done my best to follow the instructions at the PDT Wiki and I'm just not having any success. The specific message that it barks at me when I attempt to select the PDT Features option in the PDT Update Site section of the available software dialog is thus: Cannot complete the request. See the details. Cannot find a solution satisfying the following requirements Match[requiredCapability: org.eclipse.equinox.p2.iu/org.eclipse.wst.web_ui.feature.feature.group/ [3.0.1.v200807220139-7R0ELZE8Ks-y8HYiQrw5ftEC3UBF, 3.0.1.v200807220139-7R0ELZE8Ks-y8HYiQrw5ftEC3UBF]]. What is the solution?
