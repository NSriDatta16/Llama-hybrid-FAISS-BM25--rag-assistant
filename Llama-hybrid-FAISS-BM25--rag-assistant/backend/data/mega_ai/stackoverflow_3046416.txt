Solution: download Natlink - http://qh.antenna.nl/unimacro/installation/installation.html It's not quite as flexible to use as SAPI but it covers the basics and I got almost everything that I needed out of it. Also, heads up, it and Python need to be downloaded for all users on your machine or it won't work properly and it works for every version of Python BUT 2.4. Documentation for all supported commands is found under C:\NatLink\NatLink\MiscScripts\natlink.txt after you download it. It's under all the updates at the top of the file. Example code: #make sure DNS is running before you start if not natlink.isNatSpeakRunning(): raiseError('must start up Dragon NaturallySpeaking first!') shutdownServer() return #connect to natlink and load the grammer it's supposed to recognize natlink.natConnect() loggerGrammar = LoggerGrammar() loggerGrammar.initialize() if natlink.getMicState() == 'off': natlink.setMicState('on') userName = 'Danni' natlink.openUser(userName) #natlink.waitForSpeech() continuous loop waiting for input. #Results are sent to gotResultsObject method of the logger grammar natlink.waitForSpeech() natlink.natDisconnect() The code's severely abbreviated from my production version but I hope you get the idea. Only problem now is that I still have to returned to the mini-window natlink.waitForSpeech() creates to click 'close' before I can exit the program safely. A way to signal the window to close from python without using the timeout parameter would be fantastic.
