I know you already answered the question, but figured I'd chime in with a cent or two. I recently did a similar nginx install, but chose to go with RVM for managing Ruby versions, which requires us to NOT use sudo. I recommend this route because all versions of Ruby and all your gems are organized neatly in your home directory. Doing so will also require you to compile nginx manually, which certainly helps understand the pipes a little. You can compile nginx manually using the "--add-module=/home/user/path_to_passenger_gem/ext," but you'll want to read up RVM's instructions very carefully...really, don't skip a line as they are very concise. Here's a link to RVM's instructions: http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/passenger/ and to the Nginx manual instructions (which you probably already skimmed). http://www.modrails.com/documentation/Users%20guide%20Nginx.html#_installing_phusion_passenger_for_nginx_manually
