Testing significance of groups formed by classification tree leafs

I used mvpart to produce a classification tree (response variables concerning travel behaviour, explain variables are socio-demographic). In the output I can see the averages of the travel behaviour variables for the different segments formed by the tree. Is there a way to test if these differences are statistical significant different from each other? Note: In the output I only see the summed SME, nog SE for every travel behaviour variable.
