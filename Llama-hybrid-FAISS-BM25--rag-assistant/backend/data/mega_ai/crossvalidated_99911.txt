calculate Levenshtein Distance for web click stream data

I want to calculate Levenshtein Distance between to web click paths. I have a web page list around 500. user id path 1 abc,cde,eg,ba 2 abc,cde,ba 3 abc,yz,zx,eg 4 abc,cde,eg,ba 5 abc,cde 6 abc 7 cde,eg,ba I converted this in to integer list like following. id path 1 1234 2 124 3 1563 4 1234 5 12 6 1 7 234 But the problem with my situation is I have 500 web pages. How to differentiate page 3 and 7 and 37? Is there more elegant way to convert this?
