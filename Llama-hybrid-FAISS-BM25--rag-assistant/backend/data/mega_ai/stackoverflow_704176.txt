How to implement check availability in hotel reservation system

I am developing website for my friend's very small resort, please see www.shivgangaresorts.com/dev This resort has 8 rooms in total and all rooms are of the same type, so every room is equally priced. I just need code or logic to check availability of given no. of rooms on given check-in and check-out dates. When somebody makes a reservation, details that go in reservation table are: booking_id customer name email check-in date check-out date no. of rooms Please help. This is very critical as I will be integrating PayPal also, so there should be no confusions...
