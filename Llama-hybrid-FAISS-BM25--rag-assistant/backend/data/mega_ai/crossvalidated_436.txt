The answer would most definitely depend on their discipline, the methods/techniques that they would like to learn and their existing mathematical/statistical abilities. For example, economists/social scientists who want to learn about cutting edge empirical econometrics could read Angrist and Pischke's Mostly Harmless Econometrics . This is a non-technical book covering the "natural experimental revolution" in economics. The book only presupposes that they know what regression is. But I think the best book on applied regression is Gelman and Hill's Data Analysis Using Regression and Multilevel/Hierarchical Models . This covers basic regression, multilevel regression, and Bayesian methods in a clear and intuitive way. It would be good for any scientist with a basic background in statistics.
