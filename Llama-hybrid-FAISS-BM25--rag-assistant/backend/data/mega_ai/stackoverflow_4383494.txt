error using sessionStorage

I am trying to use sessionStorage on a page but it is giving me an error. Here is the code: sessionStorage.setItem("classname", "value1"); sessionStorage.setItem("classdesc", "value2"); The error I get from firebug console is: Operation is not supported" code: "9 When I try to use localStorage it works fine, so why does sessionStorage cause an error?
