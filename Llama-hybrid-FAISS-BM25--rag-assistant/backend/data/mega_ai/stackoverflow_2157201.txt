How do I select html injected from jQuery with Selenium IDE?

I'm currently using Selenium IDE to fill a form. The form has a select box for countries: Canada England The province options above is not generated until a country with provinces is selected. jQuery takes care of that generation: options = ' Alberta Ontario '; $('#id_province').html(options); My Selenium IDE workflow looks like the following: Command Target Value select id_country label=Canada select id_province label=Ontario After Canada is selected, Alberta shows up as the default province but Ontario is not selected and I get the following error in my log: [error] Option with label 'Ontario' not found Does anyone know which Selenium IDE command I should specify to properly select a generated HTML from Javascript?
