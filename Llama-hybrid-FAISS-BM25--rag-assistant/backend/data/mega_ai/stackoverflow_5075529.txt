It sounds as though there is an issue with the way that the server is responding to the AJAX calls rather than a problem with the form or the javascript. I would suggest that you need to debug a couple of key areas. Ideally, you would debug this with Xdebug on your Apache hooked into your IDE (Netbeans, Eclipse, other). My personal preference/setup is Netbeans, but others will work fine. If you can't use live debugging, you can insert print_r/echo statements through the code blocks and trace the call that way. Mage_CatalogSearch_AjaxController The javascript on form.mini.phtml should be sending the request to Mage_CatalogSearch_AjaxController and the suggestAction . Set breakpoints/trace messages either side of the first if statement in this method. If the breakpoint/trace doesn't get hit, try manually hitting the action by putting http://hostname/catalogsearch/ajax/suggest?q=query in your browser address bar. If that doesn't work, there's something broken with the config of the catalogsearch module, probably to do with the section. Use Alan Storm's Configviewer or CommerceBug modules to debug that. Mage_CatalogSearch_Block_Autocomplete The AjaxController creates an instance of Mage_CatalogSearch_Block_Autocomplete which does the actual query. Set a breakpoint/trace just before $suggestData = $this->getSuggestData(); to check that the Block is getting instantiated. After that line, the block calls it's own getSuggestData() method. Continue to trace through the code to see where the error occurs. Mage_CatalogSearch_Model_Query::getSuggestCollection() The Block calls this method to retrieve the values that match the q param, in particular the setQueryFilter() method which inserts the param into the SQL query criteria. Again, trace through here to find the error. I can't emphasize enough how much easier you will find this (and most Magento issues) when you're using live debugging in your IDE. Have a read of my answer here if you want tips on this process. Make sure that you have the server in Developer Mode to output as many errors as possible.
