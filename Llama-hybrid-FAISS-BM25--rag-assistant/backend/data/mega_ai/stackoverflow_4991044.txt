Winforms : Intercepting Mouse Event on Main Form first, not on Controls

There is certainly a convenient way to do this : I have implemented a "Move Window" on mouse drag behavior on my main form, and I would like the MouseClick/Move event to be intercepted by the form, not by controls that are in it. I would like to find an Equivalent to/replicate the "KeyPreview" property for Mouse Events Besides I want to avoid Redirecting the Mouse Event to the Main Form Method 12 times in 12 Controls' Mouse events individually (which is the ugly workaround I have Found so far) Any Ideas ?
