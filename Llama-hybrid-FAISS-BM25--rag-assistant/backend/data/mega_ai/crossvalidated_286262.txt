Could you downsample all of the images to the same resolution and then feed it into a CNN? You can try to create more images as well if you use data augmentation. For road segmentation, do you mean labeled data detecting lane lines? Data augmentation could be flipping all the images horizontally, or other techniques. I think you could also try starting with a pre-trained model using transfer learning. These are just my thoughts, I'm sure some others know far more than me and could give much better answers.
