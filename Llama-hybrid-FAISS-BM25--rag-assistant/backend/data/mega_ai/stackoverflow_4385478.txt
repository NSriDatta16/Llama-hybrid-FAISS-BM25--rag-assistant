I haven't found an elegant solution for this problem, but if your program is short running and you can live with a few instances here and there, you can just use the run command. Its default shortcut is Ctrl+F11 . Every time you press this, your application will restart. BUT! If you press this while your application is still running, another instance will be run because the "old" instance won't be automatically terminated. There are ways to really terminate your application using shortcut keys, but that requires setting breakpoints and then using the "terminate" command, and that isn't very elegant.
