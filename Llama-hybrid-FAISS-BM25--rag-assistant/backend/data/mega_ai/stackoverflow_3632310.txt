If the set is sorted, finding the median requires O(1) item retrievals. If the items are in arbitrary sequence, it will not be possible to identify the median with certainty without examining the majority of the items. If one has examined most, but not all, of the items, that will allow one to guarantee that the median will be within some range [if the list contains duplicates, the upper and lower bounds may match], but examining the majority of the items in a list implies O(n) item retrievals. If one has the information in a collection which is not fully ordered, but where certain ordering relationships are known, then the time required may require anywhere between O(1) and O(n) item retrievals, depending upon the nature of the known ordering relation.
