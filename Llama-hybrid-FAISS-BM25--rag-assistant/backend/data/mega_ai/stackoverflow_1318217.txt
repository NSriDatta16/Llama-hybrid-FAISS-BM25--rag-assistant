Juhu. I've solved it. Don't know wheather this is the most elegant way but it works :) jpsilvashy your getscript(); has done it :) I've included these two lines in my content which should be loaded: $.getScript("js/tutorial-1.js"); $.getScript("js/jquery.ahover.js"); that works. For everyone who has the same problem there's a small hint. You should delete the body and head tags. If they are included it doesn't work. But now there's still a question: Why do i need to include this in the loaded content? I think the JavaScript has to be loaded after the content was loaded into the dom. But that only some assumption! Thanks for your great help!
