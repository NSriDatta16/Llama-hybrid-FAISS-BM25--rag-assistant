Time series structural analysis with R's strucchange package: Interpreting breakpoint dating with respect to breakpoint testing

I am working with a short time series consisting of 21 annual observations, and I want to detect structural breaks using the strucchange package (Zeileis et al. 2002). When I run the breakpoints() function to date an optimum number of breakpoints chosen by BIC, I get 3 breakpoints occurring at locations that make sense with respect to exogenous information I have about my system. When I run sctest.efp(), though, I do not get any sufficiently extreme values of the empirical fluctuation process to identify statistically significant breakpoints. When I run sctest.Fstats(), which tests for just a single breakpoint, I get a highly significant peak corresponding to one of the breakdates identified by breakpoints(). I'm confused by how to interpret these results. Is the nonsignificance of sctest.efp vs. the significance of sctest.Fstats due to the shortness of my time series and the corresponding lack of statistical power for detecting multiple breakpoints? Can the optimal breakpoints identified by breakpoints() be legitimately interpreted with respect to exogenous information apart from finding formal significance using sctest()? In other words, does BIC support for > 0 breakpoints constitute statistical support for structural change despite negative results in sctest(), or should I instead interpret the results of breakpoints() as mere putative breakpoints pending the results of sctest()?
