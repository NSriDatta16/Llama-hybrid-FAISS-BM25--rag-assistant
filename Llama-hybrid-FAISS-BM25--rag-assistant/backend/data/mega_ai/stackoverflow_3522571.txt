to solve issues while coding for email html template, dont be shy to use the traditional tag to organize your content. there's a huge issue in email client compatibility, some renders it right, some renders it weirdly...etc in your case here, so far so good.. now you decided to have all these in a single ... , right.. if you want to move the Text content (h1, h2, p..etc) to be placed below the img logo, i think you can just add at the end of the img. logically this should work, right? eventough h1 itself is a block element, but things could be be rendered differently in email client. or, just add another .. after the tr for logo.. make sense? OR, old-skool style, "Nested Table"! :D off course i dont recommend that.. let us know if it help. :)
