I haven't touched Ada since 99/00 so my memory may be a bit sketchy but when we were working on a graphical windows app in Ada we needed to do some stuff in C++ (non mission critical) and the way we incorporated the two was to have the c++ stuff in a dll(s) and then create a C wrapper to that DLL and then use a pragma interface that specified the c wrapper and then we could call the methods within the dll from that interface. I think it amounted to some triple maintenance because the method signatures had to be updated in the pragma interface and the C wrapper if they changed in the c++ dll. Basically it was a pain. I think we had to use a Win32 Lean and Mean precomplier directive in the C wrapper. Anyway, that is all the three of us who worked on the project can remember.
