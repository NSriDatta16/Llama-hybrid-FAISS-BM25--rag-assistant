This worked NSString *mystring = @"blood cz TheDeAtH TBH DragonFire Scotsman King Kot BobLeeSwagger AffeMitWaffe Jackobo D L fatality Jack bobo telex apa Tiger zip Guronzan noobmaster fear piotrekjankiewi RoCJackal"; NSString *mystring2 = [mystring stringByReplacingOccurrencesOfString:@" " withString:@";"]; NSCharacterSet *separator = [NSCharacterSet characterSetWithCharactersInString:@";"]; NSArray *chunks = [mystring2 componentsSeparatedByCharactersInSet:separator]; for(NSString * myStr in chunks) { NSLog(myStr); } You still have to left trim the names (cutting of leading spaces) but I left some work for you. Also I want to add that this is best called a "hack". Because it will NOT WORK anymore if a user enters a double space in a name. So I would take a step back and ask myself why I get such a lousy string to interpret and try to solve the problem at the source of the problem ... This is my core answer: Check out whether you could get a better string.
