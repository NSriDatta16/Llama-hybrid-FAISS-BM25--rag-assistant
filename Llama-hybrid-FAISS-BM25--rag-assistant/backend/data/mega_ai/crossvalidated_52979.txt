Adding decays to time series in R

Working with my time series data I need to add decays to a certain variables. That is, when the variable consists of a series of impulses, I need to prolong these effects of these in order to better depict the true underlying nature of the effect. I would also like to experiment with different types of decay lengths (number of observations before cut-off) and types (e.g. linear and exponential). Moreover, the code should be able to cope with summing decays when impulses are within each others decay length. Demo data time impulse 1 0 2 100 3 0 4 0 5 0 6 0 7 0 8 200 9 100 10 0 11 0 12 0 13 0 14 0 15 0 16 0 17 0 18 60 19 0 20 0
