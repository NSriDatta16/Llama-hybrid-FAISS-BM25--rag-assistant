I'm dealing with a dataset that has many variables, and I've found that the model I've created with interaction terms has a lower R and R squared than the model without the interaction terms. This is completely unsurprising since more variables will reduce the RSS, even if they are not truly associated with the outcome. What would you do in this case? Its a bit late to do this now, but if you're going to compare models like this you need to pre-specify the comparison and then perform an F test between the two models. As of now, you're doing something like stepwise regression, and stepwise is known to be a poor method for model selection let alone inference. I would encourage you to search this forum for mentions of stepwise and read some of the more popular answers.
