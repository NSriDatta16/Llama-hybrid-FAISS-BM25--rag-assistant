It appears that you're looking for a Circular Buffer . Here's a .NET implementation on CodePlex. You may also want to look at this question: How would you code an efficient Circular Buffer in Java or C#? From the sample you've provided, it isn't clear how exactly this relates to an online-mean algorithm. If the only operation allowed on the buffer is to append; it should be trivial to cache and update the "total" inside the buffer (add the new value, subtract the removed one); making the maintaining of the mean an O(1) operation for every append. In this case, the buffer is effectively holding the Simple Moving Average (SMA) of a series.
