What are available methods for modeling startup survival rates?

I am interested in modeling startup companies failure and success rates to describe what is the representative startup. I have 40 companies in a dataset. Each company is represented as a list of all the investment financing rounds it has gone through. For example: Company 1: Seed Round, Series A Round Company 2: Seed Round, Series A Round, Series B Round Company 3: Seed Round, Series A Round, Series B Round Company 4: Seed Round, Series A Round, Series B Round, Series C Round Company 5: Seed Round Company 6: Series A Round, Series B Round Company 6: Series A Round And so on. I can see that each round can be represented as a state in a Markov Chain, and transitions are only allowed from earlier stages to later stages. I can go from Seed to Series A, and from Series A to Series B, but not from Series B to Series A. So we have N-order markov chains (production data has N The output I'm looking for is a binary tree chart showing each stage as a node and each node can either transition to the next node or to a final state meaning the company has failed. This problem can also be seen as a real options model... Any ideas on how to implement this model? I can code in Python or Ruby (but I am no expert).
