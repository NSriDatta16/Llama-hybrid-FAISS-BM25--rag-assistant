WPF Drag & Drop: How to literally drag an element?

Say I have a ListBox with some items and say I implement drag and drop functionality for that list. If I want to drag an item from that list box, how can I actually move the dragged item? I want to achieve the effect of having the list box item under my mouse cursor and to be able to move with it as I drag it on the window. By following this example , all I get is a cursor change based on the DragDropEffects enum choice.
