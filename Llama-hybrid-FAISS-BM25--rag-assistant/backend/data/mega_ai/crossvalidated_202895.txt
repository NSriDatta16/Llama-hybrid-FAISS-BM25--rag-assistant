Linkage is how you compute the distance between clusters in hierarchical clustering. So linkage is a part of hierarchical clustering. minimum of pairwise distances = single linkage maximum of pairwise distance = complete linkage average of the pairwise distances = average linkage (there are two; depending on how you weight the averages) For 1-element clusters, all the linkages reduce to the regular point-to-point distance. So they only matter for clusters.
