In Windows, dropping a file on an exe just executes the command line: fileprocessor.exe " " So you should be able to just call the exe directly in your batch file, passing the path to each file that you'd like to process. EDIT: Look into the For batch command to do this for a series of files. You should be able to specify the wildcard and then call the command for each. For %%a in (*.drag) do fileprocessor.exe "%%~fa"
