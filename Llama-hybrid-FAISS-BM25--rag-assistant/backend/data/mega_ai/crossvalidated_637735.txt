There is some debate about terminology and method in mediation analysis. I'm not sure what PROCESS does (I don't know SPSS well at all) but here are my thoughts: First, stop paying so much attention to significant, not significant, and what changes from one to the other when comparing models. See Andrew Gelman's article "the difference between 'significant' and 'not significant' is not, itself, statistically significant". Look at effect sizes and how they change. When you write it up, you can, if you like, avoid using the term "mediation" and just say what happened. How you should say this would depend on the sophistication of your audience. For a less statistically schooled audience, I like using actual predictions, rather than just parameter estimates and their standard errors and p values. Second (and here's where definitions come in) to me, "mediation" means that adding the mediator to the model makes meaningful changes to the relationship between the IV and the DV. The data analyst (perhaps in consultation with a substantive matter expert) can decide what is meaningful. And, to me, either a large increase or decrease could be called "mediation". But, whatever you call it, such a relationship is important to look at.
