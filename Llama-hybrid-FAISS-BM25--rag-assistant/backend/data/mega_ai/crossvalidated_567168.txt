Hoaglin & Welsch (1978) say Thus we use the hat matrix to identify "high-leverage points." If this notion is to be really useful, we must make it more precise. This suggests the term 'leverage' is not widely used at that point, and I don't have an earlier reference. Tukey (who also coined the term 'hat matrix') uses 'leverage' in a related sense in a 1965 paper , talking about the amount of information in subsets of a sample, but not for regression. It's not used in the paper by Cook defining Cook's distance for measuring influence.
