why use branches in svn?

i know that you could organize your files according to this structure in svn: trunk branches tags that you copy the trunk to a folder in branches if you want to have a seperate development line. later on you merge this branch back to trunk. but i wonder why me and my group should do this. why should one copy the trunk to a branch and work with this copy just to merge it back to the trunk, and mean while the code is frequently updated/commited to stay in sync with the trunk. why not just work with the trunk then? what is the benefits with creating a branch? would be great if someone could shed a light on this topic. thanks in advance
