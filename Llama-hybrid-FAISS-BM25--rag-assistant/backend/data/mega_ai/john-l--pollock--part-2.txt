 to the mainstream in philosophy because of John Pollock, in the short time between the publication of Knowledge and Justification and the second edition of Contemporary Theories of Knowledge. OSCAR / How to Build a Person Pollock devoted considerable time later in his career to a software project called OSCAR, an artificial intelligence software prototype he called an "artilect". OSCAR was largely an implementation of Pollock's ideas on defeasible reasoning, but it also embodied his less well known and often unpublished ideas about intentions, interests, strategies for problem solving, and other cognitive architectural design. OSCAR was a LISP-based program that had an "interest-based" reasoner. Pollock claimed that the efficiency of his theorem-prover was based on its unwillingness to draw "uninteresting" conclusions. Although OSCAR did not benefit from the contributions of a large number of professional programmers, it must be compared to CyC, Soar (cognitive architecture), and Novamente for its inventor's ambition. Pollock described Oscar's main features as the ability to reason defeasibly about perception, change and persistence, causation, probabilities, plan construction and evaluation, and decision. He described the evolution of Oscar in the Fable of Oscar in his book. OSCAR grew out of the Prologemena on How to Build a Person, which colleagues must have assumed was a facetious use of personhood at the time. However, Pollock's own attitude toward OSCAR was more machinating: he looked forward to future cognitive taxonomies that would classify OSCAR generously as a legitimate anthropomorphic form. Nomic Probability Nomic Probability and the Foundations of Induction, Oxford, 1990 was Pollock's deep investigation of the relationship between defeasible reasoning and the estimation of probability from frequencies (direct inference of probability). It is a maturation of ideas originally found in a 1983 Theory and Decision paper. This work must be compared to Henry E. Kyburg's theories of probability, although Pollock believed that he was theorizing about a broader variety of statistical inferences.
