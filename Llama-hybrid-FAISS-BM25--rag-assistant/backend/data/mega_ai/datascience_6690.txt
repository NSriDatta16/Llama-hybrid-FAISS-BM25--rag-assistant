Maybe the best answer for Your question is recommenderlab package for R available from CRAN. Here's the link to vignette . It has CF algorithms implemented and Jaccard coef. for 0/1 user feedback case. Only similarity(distance) computation in base stats R package there is dist function. But it's limited to few distance measures. I know that when I search for distance measures in R package called vegan claimed to have many methods implemented. But I have never used it. IMHO most basic recommender systems algorithms are really simple. It worth spending few minutes and implement it to get a better understanding and intuition how it works. Nevertheless, below my quick and dirty user-based kNN implementation for Your case. The code can be rewritten in better way (Adv.R is really good resource) - but this is only example for learning purpose and I do not take responsibilities for any damages :-) require(reshape2) ratings % dcast(Item ~ User) ProductNames
