alto is right, it sounds like a reinforcement learning setting. Although most RL examples involve a robot, RL can be applied to various other interactive problem domains. You should read this free ebook by Sutton and Barto , which is the standard work for RL. There have been loads of developments since the original writing of the book though. I recommend that once you can phrase your problem in RL formalities, you come back and ask what kind of algorithms can be used for that.
