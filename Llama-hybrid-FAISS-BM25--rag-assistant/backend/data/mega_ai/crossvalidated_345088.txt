You might consider adding the best naive classifier you can think of, assign classes based on some simple historical average, or assign randomly based on expected distribution. (Perhaps that's the 'random dummy'.) Then do a chi-square test on the confusion matrix of each test vs. the naive classifier to determine the likelihood of the improvement being due to chance.
