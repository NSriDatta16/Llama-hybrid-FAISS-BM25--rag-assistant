If I understand you correctly you want to estimate a statistic per state and that average that statistic to get a bootstrapped estimation of the overall statistic. Stratified sampling does something different. It ensures that the label is samples representatively in each sample. I do not think that is what you want to do. You could do this manually without being hacky . Using the dplyr , tidyr and purrr package from the tidyverse this becomes transparant and clean code. library(tidyr) library(dplyr) library(purrr) dat % nest(x) %>% mutate(stat = map_dbl(data, boot.stat2)) More information on the pipe %>% using dplyr nesting and unnesting using tidyr mapping values using purrr
