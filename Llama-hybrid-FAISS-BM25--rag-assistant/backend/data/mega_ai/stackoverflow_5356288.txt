Here is one way: R> lines con df$time df$hour df time count hour 1 2011-03-15 05:13:52 5 5 2 2011-03-11 13:23:52 0 13 3 2011-03-13 09:48:52 1 9 4 2011-03-16 04:18:52 4 4 5 2011-03-12 12:28:52 1 12 6 2011-03-14 08:53:52 1 8 7 2011-03-10 17:03:52 9 17 8 2011-03-09 20:43:52 14 20 R> tapply(df$count, df$hour, FUN=mean) 4 5 8 9 12 13 17 20 4 5 1 1 1 0 9 14 R> Your data doesn't actually yet have multiple entries per hour-of-the-day but this would average over the hours, properly parsed from the POSIX time stamps. You can adjust with TZ info as needed.
