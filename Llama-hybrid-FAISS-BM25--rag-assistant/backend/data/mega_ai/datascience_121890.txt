Is this the best method for comparing different approaches nd selecting the best model in machine learning?

My objective is to experiment with various approaches for different algorithms, identify the best approach for each algorithm, and subsequently determine the best overall algorithm from among these top approaches. To accomplish this, I employed k-fold cross-validation to evaluate each approach. After conducting the evaluations, I selected the approach that yielded the most optimal metric. To simplify things, let's consider linear regression. I tried different approaches by changing techniques and steps. To assess their performance, I evaluated each approach using k-fold cross-validation. Let's say I found that approach 2 performed the best for linear regression. Without training the model with new data, I moved on to the next algorithm, which was ANN. Following a similar process, I evaluated different approaches for ANN using k-fold cross-validation. This time, approach 3 turned out to be the best. Finally, I compared approach 2 for linear regression with approach 3 for ANN and chose the superior approach. I then trained the model using the selected approach and model. Am I proceeding in the correct direction ?
