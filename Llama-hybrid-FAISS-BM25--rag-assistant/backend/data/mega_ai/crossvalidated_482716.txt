Why would PCA score plots potentially show outliers?

If you plot a scree plot of the eigenvalues you can get the “elbow” component. For clarities sake say that a particular data set shows the elbow at four. From this you can plot $PC4$ against $PC3$ and $PC5$ against $PC4$ . These two plots may show outliers. Disregarding the problems of fitting PCA in the presence of outliers, why would these plots potentially show outliers?
