Rails Caching (content vs. page/action/etc)

What's content caching (like this plugin here: http://blog.codahale.com/2006/04/10/content-only-caching-for-rails/ ) vs page/action/fragment caching that Rails has built in? I'd like to do caching on my Rails application, but I don't quite know which type to use. My application has mostly dynamic, user specific data on every page. Is caching even possible with this?
