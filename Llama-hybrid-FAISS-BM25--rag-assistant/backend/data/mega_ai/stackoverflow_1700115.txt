If you want to create a link with just the fragment, you need to "trick" the url function a bit. As it will append the basepath to all internal urls, '' will become http://example.com . What you need to do is to set the external option to true: l('link', '', array('fragment' => 'namedanchor', 'external' => TRUE)); This will give the desired link Alternative you could give the full url like Jeremy suggests.
