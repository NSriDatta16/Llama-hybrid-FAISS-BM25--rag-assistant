Yes, you can use multiple observations of the same patients taken at different times. I recommend consulting with a statistician for details on how to do time series regression. Using XGBoost or fancy ML tree algorithms won’t help here, though, and chances are they won’t be all that useful. All of these algorithms are designed for fast nonparametrics with large datasets, where computation time is an issue and variance isn’t. Instead, I would recommend a much simpler model like ARMA with random effects, or a simple Markov model.
