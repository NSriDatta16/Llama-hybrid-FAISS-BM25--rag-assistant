grep doesn't modify files. The best you can do if you insist on using grep and not sed is grep -v "$varName" config.txt > $$ && mv $$ config.txt Note that I'm using $$ as the temporary file name because it's the pid of your bash script, and therefore probably not a file name going to be used by some other bash script. I'd encourage using $$ in temp file names in bash, especially ones that might be run multiple times simultaneously.
