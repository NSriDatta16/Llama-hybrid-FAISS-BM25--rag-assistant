Neural network input data, cartesian plane x/y coordinates, correlate with Handwriting

I am very curious about making a handwriting recognition application in a web browser. Users draw a letter, ajax sends the data to the server, neural network finds the closest match, and returns results. So if you draw an a, the first result should be an a, then o, then e, something like that. I don't know much about neural networks. What kinda data would I need to pass to the NN. Could it be an array of the x/y coordinates where the user has drawn on a pad. Or what type of data is the neural network expecting or would produce the best results for handwriting?
