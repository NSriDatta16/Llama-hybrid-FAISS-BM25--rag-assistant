Distribution in logistic regression

Suppose we have $n$ observations. For example, consider $n$ people who each have their blood pressure ($x_1$), pulse ($x_2$), and blood glucose ($x_3$) levels measured. So there are are $3$ explanatory variables measured for each person. The outcome variable is presence or absence of obesity ($Y$). In this case, does logistic regression assume that the data are distributed as $\text{Bernoulli}(p_i)$? For example, for the first person, we measure $x_1,x_2,x_3$ and compute $p_1$ (the probability of observing this)?
