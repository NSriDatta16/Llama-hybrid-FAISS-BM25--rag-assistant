Securing Office web content from redistribution without RMS

I’m looking for a mechanism that can be used to distribute Microsoft Office content over the web without using Rights Managements Services whilst minimising the ability for it to be printed or redistributed. I know any solution is always going to be a compromise and never entirely secure but I’d be interested in any mechanisms which increase the degree of difficulty to redistribute. The frontrunner at the moment is to use Flashpaper with the print and selection tools disabled and convert the documents to this format as required. The business need to provide sales reps with material about products which can not easily be redistributed externally in electronic format. Has anyone come up with something more elegant? Any other thoughts about limiting the ability to redistribute without investing in other DRM technologies?
