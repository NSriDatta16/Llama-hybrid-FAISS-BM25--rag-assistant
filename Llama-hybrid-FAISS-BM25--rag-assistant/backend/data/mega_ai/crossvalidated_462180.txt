How to determine the best model based on ROC curves

I have created four models of Logistic Regression (binary classification) and have developed the ROC curves of those 4 models. However, I am not able to understand how to scientifically determine the best model of the four and thereby finalize the best model of the four. I request someone to kindly help me out with determining the best reasoning to finalize the best model.
