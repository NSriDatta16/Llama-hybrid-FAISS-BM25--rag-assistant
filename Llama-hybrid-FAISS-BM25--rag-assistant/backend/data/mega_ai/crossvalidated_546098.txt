Which model to use for multiple outputs in classification problem

I want to predict roles based on name, experience, soft skills, technical skills . Based on all these variables I want to predict Roles now the roles predicted should be 2 or 1 or may be 5 etc. based on the input variables. Can someone give me some insight how can I approach this type of problem. Variable Role has 16000 unique values each observation has one role. (but I want to predict similar Roles based on input data) (Prediction) Technical Skills are categorical (can apply TF-IDF) Soft Skills (can apply TF-IDF). Average experience (numerical) can apply binning method.
