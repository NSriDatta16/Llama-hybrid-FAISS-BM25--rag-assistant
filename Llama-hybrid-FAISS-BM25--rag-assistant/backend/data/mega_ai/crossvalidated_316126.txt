Reinforcement learning (Q-learning) under constraint

I want know how to add a constraint to Q-learning. I have an action resulting in two rewards every time (reward 1= delivery cost , reward 2= delivery time). I want to minimize the cost while ensuring max delivery time limit is not violated. Is there a standard/formalized way to do this?
