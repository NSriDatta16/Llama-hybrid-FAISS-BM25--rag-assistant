The datastore identifies entities using keys (you can also see the Java docs on keys , though I believe the Python docs explain a bit more). The article on storage breakdown is a bit out-of-date, but still useful too. The bottom line is that entities are identified by their full path in the datastore, this includes the entity's parent. So to identify the child, you will need to include the parent's id as well.
