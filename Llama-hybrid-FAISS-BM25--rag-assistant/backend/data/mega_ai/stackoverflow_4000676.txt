The earliest point at which you can run a Javascript function with access to the DOM (without waiting for page load) is by placing a tag right after the opening tag. Scripts inside the will run before this occurs, but there won't be access to the elements on the page. Try this code alert("Some elements shouldn't even be visible when this shows"); ... rest of the page See this example with some Gangsta Lipsum text.
