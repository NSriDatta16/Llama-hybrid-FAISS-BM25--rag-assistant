Use the LMS algorithm to train a single perceptron neural network by finding the weights for a given data

Basically, I have data set contain inputs and outputs for unknown system, I want to use the LMS (Least Mean Square), to train a single perceptron (neuron) NN, and find the weights $ w_1, w_2, ... $, for the given output.
