android, cannot align icons on the right in listview's row

I am currently working on my first android app. In a listview, I need to have the following organisation in each row: On the left: one main icon on which takes the whole height of the row On the middle: 2 texts, one below the other On the right: 2 icons, one below the other I end up with a row.xml file like this, but that does not work as I expect. Do you know if something obvious is missing in this file ? Thanks a lot, Luc
