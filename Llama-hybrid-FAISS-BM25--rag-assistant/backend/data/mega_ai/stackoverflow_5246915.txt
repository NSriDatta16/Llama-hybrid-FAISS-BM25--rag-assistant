In modes other than "Reg RAM", EWF needs a special version of the Windows bootloader (NTLDR) and some unpartitioned disk space for creating an overlay volume. I don't know whether your HP PC has been configured with those. There are some EWF system requirements listed here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-ca/library/bb499124.aspx EWF usually creates its overlay volume during the First Boot Agent (FBA) process. You could check fbalog.txt for errors. There are some instructions for reconstructing an EWF volume here: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms913271(WinEmbedded.5).aspx The file not found error may be due to a missing ' : ' in your second command. Try ewfmgr c: -enable instead.
