From some reason, Microsoft decided that MDI is wrong. There is a lot of information about this when searching it in Google. I believe that it is wrong to kill something that so many people liked and in forums I visited, some people point to a new Microsoft example that works in MDI to stress the point that it is legit way to build an application. I hate swimming against the stream, so I quit as soon as I understood that despite it is possible to create an MDI application with modern Microsoft application such as silverlight, wpf and maybe even windows-phone, microsoft really discorage it and doesn't offer any support (as far as I know). Hope it helps to others that wonders what happened to our good old MDI "Father".
