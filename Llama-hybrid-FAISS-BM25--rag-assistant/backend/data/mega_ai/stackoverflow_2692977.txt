Enterprise Native Mobile Application Development

I tend to believe that developing mobile applications in an enterprise environment is best suited by developing intranet web applications. That said I have been asked to think about whether there are specific enterprise applications that could only be accomplished or would be more successful as native applications. I am curious as to what the Stack Overflow community thinks. Note : As an organization we primarily use BlackBerry devices but are other platform curious.
