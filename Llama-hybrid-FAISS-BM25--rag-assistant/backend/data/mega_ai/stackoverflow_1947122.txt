Is there a simple way of obtaining all object instances of a specific class in Java

Currently I am working on a Java agent to assemble memory stats. With the help of the instrumentation API I can get a hold of the classes (and manipulate them). With plain Java I can get an estimate of the resources used for each object. So far, so good. The question I am faced with right now is "how to get a hold of every Object instance of a specific class". I can do byte code manipulation in order to get a hold of the object instance, but I was hoping there is another API I am not aware of, helping me to accomplish my goal without such a rather heavy intrusive step. At the end, the performance impact should be kept to a minimum. Any ideas?
