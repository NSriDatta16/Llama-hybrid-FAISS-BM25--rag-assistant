How to do low scale time series prediction?

I have a small time series data with 10 observations Each observation is spaced at 20 days gap For example, I have sales revenue from day 1, day 21, day 41, day 61 till day 221... Now I would like to predict what will be the sales revenue on day 500th day amd 850th day? How can we predict using short timeseries data (which has only 10 observations)? Is there any specific technique that I should follow? Can you guide me on how would you guys do this? What are some of the topics that I should learn to do this? Can someone please help me with list of steps on how to do this?
