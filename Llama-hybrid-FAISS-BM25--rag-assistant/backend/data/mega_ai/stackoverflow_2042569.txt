We found that a huge part of the timing issue was the location of the files being archived. The numbers above are for object and archive files located on a NAS device. Doing the same operation on a local hard disk (temporary storage) reduces the time to ~20 - 40 seconds. Copying all the files, doing local archive, and copying the result back takes longer than archiving directly on the NAS, but we're looking at moving our entire build process to local temporary storage, which should improve performance substantially.
