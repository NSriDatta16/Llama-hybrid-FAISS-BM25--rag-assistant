I think you have some misunderstanding on what PCA is. PCA is one of the "unsupervised methods", which means it explores the structures in data, but cannot be used to predict a outcome. You can apply PCA to data to extract principle components. These principle components are some transformation of your original data and have some nice properties. However, we do not get any "prediction" out of it. (you may also noticed when apply PCA, we do not need to specify the response variable using R formula, right?) I will make an analogy to conclude my answer. Think about a computer vision problem. Supervised methods can classify an image to a cat or dog. But PCA is just rotating and scaling the image.
