How about Robotics (specifically, humanoid robots)? Specifically I think the challenge in robotics is to combine a set of technologies that in themselves are quite well developed: Computer vision: the robots need fast processing of the visual world Internal modelling of the world: they also need to know how they can affect the world, and how to connect the visual landscape with their movement Speech recognition: we want to be able to talk to them, right? Speech synthesis: and we want to hear what they have to say! Reinforcement Learning: they should be able to learn through trial and error, etc. Bayesian reasoning: at some point they will probably need to have probabilistic notions of objects in the world in order to facilitate decision making It would be easy enough to give them chess- or go-playing capabilities as well ;-) I think the only trouble with this, from the Drosophila point of view, is that there is a significant cost in terms of hardware. However there's no reason why the robot couldn't live in a simulated world . And perhaps there is something in the gaming world like this, where you can create your own AI bot that can interact with the physics engine using multiple modalities?
