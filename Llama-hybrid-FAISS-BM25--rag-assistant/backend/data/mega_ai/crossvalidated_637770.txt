Why is the noise included in the posterior predictive distribution in bayesian regression?

Assume the following model: $y = b_0 + b_1 * x$ where we set some priors to $b_0, b_1$ . Let $I$ denote our historical data and $x^*$ denote future inputs. Let $p(b_0, b_1|I)$ denote our posteriors. We can then define the posterior predictive distribution as $p(y^*|I, x^*) = \int p(y^*|b_0, b_1, x^*)p(b_0, b_1|I)$ . Now my question is, why do we also sample the noise in the likelihood term $p(y^*|b_0, b_1, x^*)$ and not just disregard it and just use the posterior samples to compute the desired quantity? Does this procedure have a name?
