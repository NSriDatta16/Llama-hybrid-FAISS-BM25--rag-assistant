Detrend only $X$ or also $y$ for stationarity?

I'm curious about time series analysis in machine learning. Naturally, when we use standard techniques like ARIMA we want to remove the trends of the data to introduce stationarity through differencing. Now, it seems like stationary data could also improve a machine learning model. The question I have is when we remove the trend of a dataset do we only remove the trend of the explanatory variables, or do we also remove the trend of the response variables as well? My gut feeling is we only detrend the explanatory variables - however I'd like some confirmation on this and a reason why this is important. Can anyone help me here?
