Your updated code is wordy, but should work. Except , you have a typo that is breaking one of the metatables: --Modem inherits from ElectronicDevice Modem = setmetatable({},{__index,ElectronicDevice}); should read --Modem inherits from ElectronicDevice Modem = setmetatable({},{__index=ElectronicDevice}); The existing fragment made the Modem metatable be an array where the first element was almost certainly nil (the usual value of _G.__index unless you are using strict.lua or something similar) and the second element is ElectronicDevice . The Lua Wiki description will make sense after you've grokked metatables a bit more. One thing that helps is to build a little infrastructure to make the usual patterns easier to get right. I'd also recommend reading the chapter on OOP in PiL . You will want to re-read the chapters on tables and metatables too. Also, I've linked to the online copy of the 1st edition, but owning a copy of the 2nd is highly recommended. There is also a couple of articles in the Lua Gems book that relate. It, too, is recommended.
