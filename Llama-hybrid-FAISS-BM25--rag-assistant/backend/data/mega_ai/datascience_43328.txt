If Deep learning or Machine learning is blackbox then why companies are still investing?

I was wondering whether there is mathematical evidence or proof of functions that are happening at the backend of deep learning/machine learning. Particularly in training and testing operations. Secondly, deep learning is invented many years ago but still very minimal hardware systems to do something real. Is this a dark secret of artificial intelligence?
