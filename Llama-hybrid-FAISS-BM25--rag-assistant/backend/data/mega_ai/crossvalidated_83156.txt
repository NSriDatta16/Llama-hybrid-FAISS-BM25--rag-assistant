SVM - combining binary and continous representation of the same feature?

How would this influence the accuracy of the SVM model? Let's suppose that I have one variable which max value is 100 and minimum is 0. Currently, I send it to SVM as a single continuous feature, for example, if the value is 8 I send it as 0.08. I am wondering though, what would happen if I were to represent this variable as a set of 100 dummy variables? For example if the variable has a value of 56, I set the feature number 56 to 1 and the rest stays at 0. Would this work worse than a one continuous feature? How about combining these two approaches? Would that improve the accuracy or lower it? Or maybe it would make no difference?
