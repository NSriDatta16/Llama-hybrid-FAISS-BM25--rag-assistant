We have a big enterprise application written in Java and Gwt, so lots of JS on the client. We tried in the past to use selenium to test it, but we never did more than some smoke tests because of the complexity and fragility of it. Now we started a completed UseCases Scenario testing with cucumber+watir+webdriver. Tests are written in Ruby and Gherkin (cucumber DSL) and run against our application. We integrated that with Hudson and we have nice screenshots for any errors (and soon also .avi) So far QA and BA people are enthusiast, and the developing effort already repaid itself considering the saving on retesting features manually compared to run the suite and going for a coffee. ;)
