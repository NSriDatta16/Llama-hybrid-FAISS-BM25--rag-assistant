- (BOOL)validateMenuItem:(NSMenuItem *)menuItem Some details in the docs . Update: NSMenus do not hide NSMenuItems if validateMenuItem: returns NO . The according NSMenuItem gets disabled (Which tells the user that the functionality is there, but currently not applicable). This behavior is also suggested in Apple's HIG . (See the second paragraph in the "Naming Menu Items" section) Two other notes about NSMenuItem's enabled state: setEnabled only works if autoenablesItems: of the hosting NSMenu is set to YES The default implementation of validateMenuItem: seems to traverse the responder chain to check if the target/action of a NSMenuItem is available.
