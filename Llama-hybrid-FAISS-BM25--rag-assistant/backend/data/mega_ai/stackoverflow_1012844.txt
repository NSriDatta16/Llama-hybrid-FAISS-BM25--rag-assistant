This is a good reference on the various types of code coverage: http://www.bullseye.com/coverage.html . MCDC : To improve MCDC coverage you'll need to look at some_condition . Assuming it's a complex boolean expression, you'll need to look at whether you're exercising the necessary combinations of values. Specifically, each boolean sub-expression needs to be exercised true and false. Path : One of the things mentioned in the link above as being a disadvantage of path coverage is that many paths are impossible to exercise. That may be the case with your example.
