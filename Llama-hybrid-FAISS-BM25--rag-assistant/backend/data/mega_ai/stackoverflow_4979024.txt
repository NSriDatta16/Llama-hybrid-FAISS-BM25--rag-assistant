If I were doing it, I think I'd probably start by computing a moving average of the number of "likes" for each source. Then compute the percentage difference between the number of likes for a particular article compared to the moving average for that source. In the long term, this should give roughly the same distribution as giving equal weight to every source, but it still allows (for example) two particularly well-liked articles from a single source to show up as the top two articles in the list.
