A statistician, as in a Mathematical that is specialized in Statistics, as in my experience, has a basic set of theorical knowledge in: Probability Theory (most importat one) Mathematical Inference Mathematical optimization Regression Basic Programming Exploratory Data Research Stochastic methods Keep in mind that, even if it's not as complex as other fields of the Mathematics at face value, it's deeply rooted in Mesure theory, so it's still a specialization of an already specialized cience that it's the mathematics. Now, recently, due to the technological advancement, computer knowledge has become a very sought after skill in the field, so knowledge in Big Data and basic Data Science it's becoming the 8th item in the list above. Every statistics degree with a rigorous basis of theorical knowledge would contain every element in the list above.
