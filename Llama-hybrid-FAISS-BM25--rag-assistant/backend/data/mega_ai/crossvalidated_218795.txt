Evaluating intervention statistics for a given observation

My desired procedure is the following: A time series is imported. One or more observations are flagged as events/outliers. An automated procedure determines what type of outlier each event is and its impact (or possibly says that there are no visible outlier effects at that/those observation/s). A revised time series is given, with the outliers de-effected. I am aware of several R packages that deal with outliers, however, most of them either automatically detect outliers or require you to provide all the outlier statistics. Is there a ready-made solution for this in some package, and if not, how should I go about writing my own solution?
