Normalization of test data when performing PCA projection

To briefly explain what I've been working on, I have two datasets: one as a reference(larger) and another for validation. I performed the PCA analysis with my reference dataset to create the corresponding PC space (1). Then, I tried to project my test data on this PC space created with the reference set (2). The two datasets I have are of same type (gene expression data) but were generated from different sources(or cohorts/studies). I read that it is recommended to scale and center the data when running the PCA analysis, so I did them on step (1). And the output provided the scaling coefficients and centering factors used. My question is: When I project my test data on the PC space created with the reference data, do I just normalize the data with the scaling coefficients and centering factors obtained from the PCA analysis using the reference set and multiply it by the rotation matrix ? OR, is it okay if I initially normalize my test data (Z-score normalization within itself), then use these values for the projection (apply scaling coefficients and centering factors + rotation matrix derived from the reference dataset)? Sounds like the second question is to normalize the test data twice (within itself and with the values from the reference). I've tried both and found that the results are quite different. If my second question is of misconception, can you please explain me why? I'm not proficient at data science techniques or stats, so my questions might sound silly but I would really appreciate it if you could provide a sincere answer.
