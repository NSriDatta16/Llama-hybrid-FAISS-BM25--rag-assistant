You can't use Int32 and Test interchangeably because semantically they're different types, even if they do happen to use the same underlying storage mechanism. If you need an Int32 then use an Int32 ; if you need a Test then use a Test ; if you need to convert between them then use an explicit cast. (And, of course, the language could easily have been spec'd to allow these conversions implicitly, but such a "feature" would probably create more problems than it solved.)
