The exponential distribution has support on the entire positive reals; your distribution has support over the positive integers (it is a discrete probability distribution), and it is called the geometric distribution . ( W ) [The probabilities are usually written in terms of a parameter that is 1−(your p), but that's a trivial detail.] Actually, your choice of picking the geometric distribution is a good one when you know just the mean: Among all discrete probability distributions supported on {1, 2, 3, ... } with given expected value μ, the geometric distribution X with parameter p = 1/μ is the one with the largest entropy. Your problem is interesting (how to incrementally fill buckets given the distribution of their sizes), and I don't know of the best answer, but assuming there are sufficiently many items, the following stupid algorithm will work: While there are items left: Pick a "bucket size" k according to the desired distribution /* E.g., for the geometric distribution with mean 1.5, you could toss a coin with bias 0.667 until you get a head, then you'll get k=1 for 66.7% of the time, k=2 for 22.2%, k=3 for 7.4% etc., with k being 1.5 on average (in expectation) */ Put the next k items into one (new) bucket. Note that you don't need to know the number of items. Assuming the number is sufficiently large, issues (such as variance in the distributions, and "leftovers" at the end) will not matter much.
