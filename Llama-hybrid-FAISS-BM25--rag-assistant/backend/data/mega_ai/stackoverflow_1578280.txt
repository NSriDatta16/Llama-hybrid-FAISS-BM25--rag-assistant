I would recommend using the playbin ( reference page , documentation ) or the decode bin ( reference page , documentation ). These greatly simplify the process of creating gstreamer pipelines for different types of video files. With each you can use a video sink using the GstXOverlay interface. See Embedding the video window in your application for more details.
