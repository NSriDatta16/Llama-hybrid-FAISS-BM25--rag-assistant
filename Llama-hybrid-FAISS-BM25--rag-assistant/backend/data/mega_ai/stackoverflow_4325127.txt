Frankly speaking, there is no official name for this internal shortcut into a specific class. But I know that the first part before slash is called "class group", it is not the module name, because Magento can share different classes from different modules in the same group (via rewrite statement). Yes, there is initial module which defines default class prefix, but you can change this prefix via config files merging. The second part I would like to call a model/model resource/block/helper name. And in general it might be called: model path for Mage::getModel() and Mage::getSingleton() block path for Mage::getBlockSingleton() and $layout->createBlock() helper path for Mage::helper() But there is no official name for this construction. So it is not the rule for calling it that way :) UPDATE : In Mage_Core_Model_Config::getGroupedClassName() this construction is called Class Id, so maybe this name is more clear.
