Here's how I would answer this question using a diagram. Let's say we weigh 30 cats and calculate the mean weight. Then we produce a scatter plot, with weight on the y axis and cat identity on the x axis. The mean weight can be drawn in as a horizontal line. We can then draw in vertical lines which connect each data point to the mean line - these are the deviations of each data point from the mean, and we call them residuals. Now, these residuals can be useful because they can tell us something about the spread of the data: if there are many big residuals, then cats vary a lot in mass. Conversely, if the residuals are mainly small, then cats are fairly closely clustered around the average weight. So if we could have some metric which tells us the average length of a residual in this data set, this would be a handy way of denoting how much spread there is in the data. The standard deviation is, effectively, the length of the average residual. I would follow on on from this by giving the calculation for s.d., explaining why we square and then square root (I like Vaibhav's short and sweet explanation). Then I would mention the problems of outliers, as Graham does in his last paragraph.
