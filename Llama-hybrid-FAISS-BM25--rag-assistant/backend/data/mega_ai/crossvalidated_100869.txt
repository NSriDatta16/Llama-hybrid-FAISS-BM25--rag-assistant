Can anyone suggest me articles where they have used multivariate logistic regression models and explored in detail about the role of each predicor?

I am doing logistic regression analysis using multiple predictors for a binary outcome.I had about 10 predictors and tried to find the best model using 'glmulti' package in R. I have got a significant model with four predictors. Now I want to explore the effect of each predictor on the outcome according to the model. I thought of keeping the continuous variables at mean values and predicting probabilities for categorical predictors. Also I am trying to compute predicted probabilities for a range of continuous variable at each level of categorical predictor and plot the graph. But I need to see published medical articles where people really explored the multivariate logistic model and explained in detail about the derived model in terms of the contribution of each predictor to the outcome. Can anyone give statistical advice and also refer few articles ?
