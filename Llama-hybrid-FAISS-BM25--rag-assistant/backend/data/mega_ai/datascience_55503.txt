Visualize/analyze data before or after imputing missing values?

My understanding is that we impute missing values in order to preserve those training examples so our Machine Learning algorithms have as many training examples as possible. To me, it would make intuitive sense to visualize/analyze the data before imputing the missing values, as imputation will skew distributions and may lead to false assumptions about the real data before imputation. I can see a case for doing both before and after, but that adds time to the feature analysis. On the other hand, I can see a case for not imputing values if the % of missing values is high enough to affect the data's distribution. In Python I imagine using something along the lines of pd.Series.dropna() to isolate the existing values. TL;DR: Should one impute missing values before or after visualizing the data and pulling insights from it?
