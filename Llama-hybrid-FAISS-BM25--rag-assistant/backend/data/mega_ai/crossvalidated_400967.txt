Estimating the standard deviation of Bayesian regression

When developing a Bayesian multiple linear regression model, how do you estimate the parameters of the standard deviation? From my understanding, the standard deviation is associated with each predictor variable, however what happens when multiple predictor variables are present? Or am I completely turned around in my understanding of this? Additionally, when setting up a prior for μi in the example below, does each β get a prior? or does only get a μi get a prior? Ex: μi=α+βxi+β2x2i yiN(μi,σ1,σ2) Thanks!
