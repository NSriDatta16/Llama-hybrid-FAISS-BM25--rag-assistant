Organizational Model basically is something on top of which you shall lay your software on. OM is description of how one organization is khm organized - e.g. how is the hierarchy of employees structured - or what are the requirements of some job position to do it's job (data wise) ... You apply different models business logic on the basis of Organizational Model . Business Logic is probably more familiar term (hint: MVC). Now, GSM is more abstract than that. 'cause systems are more abstract things than organizations - but its role in software development project is basically the same as OM, just on more abstract level. All in all that is just another useless matter to learn that, if you are lucky, would be applied in background thinking about your software while the software is in preparation phase, in another words, never :) Cheers
