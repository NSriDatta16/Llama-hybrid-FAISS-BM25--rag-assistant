The problem arises because both your Route uses {sku} and your form field is called sku. The {sku} from the route supersedes the sku form field (it would seem). A (fairly pragmatic) solution could be to have them named differently, so your controller action would be something like: public void ActionResult ViewProduct(string routeSku, string sku) { sku = sku ?? routeSku; // same as before } This would cause the "sku" parameter to be "null" in the initial get request (an routeSku will be whatever is in the URL), when using the submit button routeSku will be the same since you are posting back to the same URL but sku will be the form value. The logic will then select the sku value from the form if this was set.
