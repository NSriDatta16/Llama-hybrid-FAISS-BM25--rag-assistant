Although late , i hope this will help : https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02664763.2011.610445?journalCode=cjas20 The FACTOR stand alone factor analysis program ( Urbano Lorenzo Seva) offers many other useful alternative for ordered scales, Available at: https://scholarworks.umass.edu/pare/vol19/iss1/5 https://scholarworks.umass.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1317&context=pare In general for ordinal scales the exploratory factor analysis is performed with PCA then you switch to PAF method because it outperforms the PCA . The Maximum Likelihood Factor Analysis under confirmatory method outperforms both PCA and / PAF . I would pay attention to the multivariate normality assumptions ( mardia statistic being one helpful index) given the scales in use have ordinal nature . MLFA requires a big sample size analysis however , a sample size in excess of 400 and better above 600 subjects are good to begin with . Warmest Jordanian Regards.
