Distribution of sum of fourth powers of two independent normal random variables

Let $X_1, X_2$ be i.i.d. $\sim \mathcal{N}(0, 1)$ . How can I find $P(X_1^4+X_2^4 ? There is a similar question , but instead of the sum of squares of $\chi^2_1$ the question is about the square of their sum. It seems like a possible solution is to take the integral of joint density function of two normal random variables with those borders, but I'm wondering if a more elegant solution exists.
