How is the prediction variance defined?

I wonder how the output $var.pred returned by ar.ols() in R is defined? It is not the variance of a prediction value, is it? I guess no, because the variances of $n$-step ahead forecasts may be different for different $n$, correct? Does it equal the covariance matrix of the forecast error? Does it equal the residual covariance matrix? From ?ar.ols() var.pred: The prediction variance: an estimate of the portion of the variance of the time series that is not explained by the autoregressive model. Following is an example ( x is a bivariate time series): > output = ar.ols(x, aic = F, order.max = 2, demean = F, intercept = T) > output Call: ar.ols(x = x, aic = F, order.max = 2, demean = F, intercept = T) $ar , , 1 TS1 TS2 TS1 0.5592 0.3561 TS2 -0.1555 0.1147 , , 2 TS1 TS2 TS1 -0.3455 0.5119 TS2 0.2105 0.4648 $x.intercept TS1 TS2 2.195 3.891 $var.pred TS1 TS2 TS1 1.583 1.582 TS2 1.582 18.446t Thank you so much!
