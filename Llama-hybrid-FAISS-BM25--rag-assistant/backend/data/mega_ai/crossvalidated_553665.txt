If the aim is not just forecasting but trying to get a good handle on which predictors are most important in some sense, in my view PCA is likely to be a distraction and its use to turn out to be a detour. You would be better off applying some flavour of regression directly. That is unlikely to be trivially easy and selection of predictors is a deep and difficult art, but you are more likely to get a good handle on which are the important predictors. The longer answer on what does important mean and how do you find a good model is covered by every worthwhile regression text. All that said, I am unclear how PCA leads to predictions in time unless you are using something else as well.
