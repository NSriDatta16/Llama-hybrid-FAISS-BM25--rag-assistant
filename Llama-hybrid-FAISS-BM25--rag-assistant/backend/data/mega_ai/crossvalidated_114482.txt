Regression Random Forests have been used to estimate probabilities/risk for binary outcomes. See open-access article cited below. Apparently the key is to avoid end node purity - thus the nodes are limited in size to 10% of training sample size. The article is unfortunately poorly written (impressively so) and thus find it hard to have confidence in the methods suggested.
