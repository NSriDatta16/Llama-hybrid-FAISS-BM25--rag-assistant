Each individual barrier is likely to be differently frequent, and each person to have a different propensity to endorse barriers, so your response is going to be a sum of binaries with different p(1). If your model captures the variation in p's you may be able to model the individual answers as Bernoulli in a mixed model, but even so, the sum will be Poisson binomial since the P's differ. I'd be tempted to look at a Bayesian glmm for the individial answers - 17 per subject - estimated via some MCMC approach, and then sum them if need be.
