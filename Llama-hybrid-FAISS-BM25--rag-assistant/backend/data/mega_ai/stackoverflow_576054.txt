How To Retrieve "AverageValue" Performance Counter?

I am trying to retrieve windows performance counter and display it in ASP.NET page. However, I am having dificulty to retrieve the average type of counter. Say, I want to retrieve counter like how many page request per second? I have no idea to calculate that value, since the PerformanceCounter class only give me RawValue and NextValue which always zero. Please advice.. Thanks..
