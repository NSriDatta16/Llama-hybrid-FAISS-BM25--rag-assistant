I am going to propose a very pragmatic protocol based on the following rationale: a high number of high average ratings should be ranked very high a low number of high average ratings probably should be ranked high a low number of low average ratings probably should be ranked low a high number of low average ratings probably should be ranked very low Step 1: convert the average ratings to standardized values (z-scores): $z \in \mathbb{R}$ Step 2: convert the number of ratings to percentiles: $p \in (0,1)$ . Step 3: set the rating quality measure to $r = (e^z)^{1+p} \in (0,\infty)$ Step 4: if needed, convert $r$ to its relative rank $R$ . I have implement similar rescaling strategies in other projects, but I do not have any references that I can easily provide (sorry about this).
