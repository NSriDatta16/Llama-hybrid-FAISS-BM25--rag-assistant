Amazon AWS EC2 usage

I have two questions on Amazon AWS EC2 usage computation: If I installed a packaged AMI that is fedora core 5, tomcat mysql based and configure it to point to my subdomain demo.mydomain.com, I am interested in finding out how computational hours are calculated. The application that I am publishing is not really mission critical, more towards a demo for a web based tutorial that I am hosting to showcase my application development portfolio. Therefore, it makes sense for me not to invest in a full blown remote virtual dedicated server or something similar. Say, in a 24 hour window: 0000 (hours) - Accessed by one user for 15 mins 0100 (hours) - Not accessed 0200 (hours) - Not accessed 0300 (hours) - Accessed by one user for 30 mins . . . 1300 (hours) - Not accessed 1400 (hours) - Accessed by one user for 15 mins . . . 2200 (hours) - Accessed by four users for 60 mins 2300 (hours) - Accessed by eight users for 60 mins 2400 (hours) - Not accessed Total: 180 mins (3 hours) Assuming that the average use is consistent based on the above hours for 30 days (to get a monthly total). 30days x 3 hours = 180 hours (per month) Here are my questions: Am I billed for the time that the service is not accessed although the web application is available online? Are the charges based on per block hour used or per minute based used mileage? i.e 0000 hours, the service used was for 15 minutes, am I getting charged for the rest of 45 minutes? Would anyone be able to advice? Thanks
