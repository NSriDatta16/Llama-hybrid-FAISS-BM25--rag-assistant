Selectively predict time series

Say I have a time series ${y}$ and a number of features $f_1, f_2, ...$. Most of the time, it is hard to predict ${y}$, but in some scenarios I can get good results. How do I set up the model, and how do I discover when to predict("bet") on the next value of $y$? For example, how can I differentiate between needing better features, and unpredictability of the time series at certain occasions?
