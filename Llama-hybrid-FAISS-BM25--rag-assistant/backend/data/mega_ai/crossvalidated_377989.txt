Expectation of E(g(X + c))

This is from Time Series Analysis from WS Wei If, where Approach - We have to find Var(Z) So, since and I have simulated this scenario on computer with and the answer seems to be ~ 0.5 Is my approach correct? Further, I'm not able to move ahead with the integral. Any help is greatly appreciated SAS Code: /* Generate time series data - 20 time points. repeated samples of 20 points each */ data TS2; omega = constant("pi")/4; do runs = 1 to 5000; /* each run is a 20 time sample */ do t = 1 to 20; A = rand('NORMAL'); pi = constant("pi"); /* rand('UNIFORM') generates uniform random variates from (0, 1) */ theta = 2*constant("pi")*rand('UNIFORM') + -constant("pi"); Z = A*sin((omega*t)+theta); output; end; end; run; data dssub1(rename = (Z = Z1)); set TS2(where = (t = 1)); /* Retrieve t = 1 for each of the runs */ by runs; if first.runs; run; proc univariate data = dssub1; var Z1; run; Variance - 0.49702 Next, Part B of the question - find if are independent For this we need to check, RHS is zero since = 0 for any t LHS: - (a) Considering, and using the identity (a) = (since the second term is zero) This means they are not independent? Are the steps okay or anything wrong. Please let me know.
