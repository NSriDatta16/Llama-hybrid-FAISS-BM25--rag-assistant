Problem with header files of ARToolkitPlus after making the ARToolKitPlus dylib!

I'm writing this Augmented Reality app for the iPhone and I'd decided to use ARToolKitPlus for it. Using QMake, I created the xcode project file and subsequently the libArToolKitPlus.dylib I tried to compile and run the sample files "simple" and "multi" which worked well. Now all other attempts that I tried to create another project and use the library have failed due to header files not being found. If I drag the "include" folder to the xcode project I get 8 errors instead of just one; The one is for the main include not being found is solved but then it includes 8 other headers that cannot be found (although they are in the same folder) #include "ARToolKitPlus/TrackerSingleMarkerImpl.h" I get a error: ARToolKitPlus/TrackerSingleMarkerImpl.h: No such file or directory If I drag the include folder then some of what I get: error: ARToolKitPlus/TrackerSingleMarker.h: No such file or directory error: ../src/TrackerSingleMarkerImpl.cpp: No such file or directory error: expected class-name before ',' token class TrackerSingleMarkerImpl : public TrackerSingleMarker, protected TrackerImpl Having the dylib doesnt make a difference as far as I can tell. What do you think I should do?? Would creating a framework help??
