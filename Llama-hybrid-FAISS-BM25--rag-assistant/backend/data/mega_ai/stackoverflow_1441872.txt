Flash Video automatically starts downloading (don't want them to)

This question might be specific to SoThink Video Encoder v2.5, but it might not. I've transcoded some videos [from AVI] to SWF/FLV for embedding in a web page. I used SoThink Video Encoder. The problem is I have 9 videos on a page, and as soon as the page loads, they ALL start downloading. I would like them each to start downloading when the play button on each video is clicked. Is this a Flash Param I'm not aware of or not using correctly? Is this a setting in the or the tag? Or is this setting likely in the player+video that was created by the SoThink software? Thanks! Marc
