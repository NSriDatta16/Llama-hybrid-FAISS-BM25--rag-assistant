The following quote from the 2002 review paper explains the role of preset initial layers in neural networks for image processing. "According to Perlovsky, the key to restraining the highly Flexible learning algorithms for ANNs, lies in the very combination with prior (geometric) knowledge. However, most pattern recognition methods do not even use the prior information that neighbouring pixel=voxel values are highly correlated. This problem can be circumvented by extracting features from images first, by using distance or error measures on pixel data which do take spatial coherency into account, or by designing an ANN with spatial coherency [LeCun1989] or contextual relations between objects in mind" [Egmont-Petersen2002].
