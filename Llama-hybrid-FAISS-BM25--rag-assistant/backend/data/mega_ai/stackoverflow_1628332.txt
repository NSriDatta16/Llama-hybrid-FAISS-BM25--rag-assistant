Mercurial repository layout for multiple branches

I have a number of quasi-related projects that I want to version control. In SVN I would set them up as multiple directories within a single project /scripts #updates in sync with project1 & project2 /project1 #requires database /project2 #requires database /database Naturally other SVN layouts are possible for this toy example, but this layout has advantages: I can copy files between branches while preserving history I can check out only a subset of projects, eg svn co repo/project2; svn co repo/database . This saves a considerable amount of storage & time if project1 is large. Easy repository management, since user access is defined once for all projects This paradigm doesn't map well to mercurial since you can't clone a single directory of a mercurial repo . So my question is: what is the most common way to store large, closely related projects in mercurial? My ideas: Multiple repositories - loses history of files which move between projects Forests - seems stalled, and I'm not sure how stable this extension is Named branches with mostly unrelated content SubRepos - Unfortunately I'm running Ubuntu 9.04, which only ships hg 1.1.2. Otherwise this would look like a good option
