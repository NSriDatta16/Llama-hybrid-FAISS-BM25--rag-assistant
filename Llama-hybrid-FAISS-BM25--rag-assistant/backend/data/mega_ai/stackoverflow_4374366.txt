You can pass optional properties to the MSBuild script to call MSDeploy (Assuming you have it setup on both the client/server). /p:DeployOnBuild=True – This will let us deploy after build /p:DeployTarget=MsDeployPublish – This set how we will deploy, using MSDeploy /p:MSDeployServiceURL=http:///MsDeployAgentService /p:DeployIISAppPath="Default Web Site" – The path where the app will be deployed /p:CreatePackageOnPublish=True – Create a package to deploy the App /p:MsDeployPublishMethod=RemoteAgent – Server where the MSDeploy is installed. The possible values for this are: RemoteAgent – When the MSDeploy is deployed at another machine InProc – Deploy to the Local IIS /p:AllowUntrustedCertificated=True – Connect to the MSDeployServiceURL without trying to use certificate. To use a certificate you should use another URL on the MSDeployServiceURL. /p:UserName=username – The username of a user with permission to Deploy the application /p:Password=password – a VALID password for that user :) Taken from Allmatech ALM Team
