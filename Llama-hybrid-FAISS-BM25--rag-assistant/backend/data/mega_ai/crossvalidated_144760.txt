Is there a rising trend in Number Series

I am trying to build a stock screening utility. What I am trying is to find if there is a rising trend in a time series of profit margins of a company. I know there can be dips in some years but I want to find if mathematically that overall there is a rising trend as well as towards the recent years there is higher margins as compared to previous years. Is there any way we can find it mathematically? Profit Return Year,Company A,Company B,Company C 2005,38.97,20.44,22.01 2006,22.4,20.59,20.63 2007,22.4,20.59,20.63 2008,21.56,22.01,23.87 2009,25,20,23.52 2010,25,22.38,18 2011,30,24.13,24.85 2012,32,25.43,27.47 2013,30,20,22 2014,35,27,20
