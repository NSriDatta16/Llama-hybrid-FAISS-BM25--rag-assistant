Personally I find the "similar to Google Docs" and "Transparent desktop integration" requirements a bit vague, IMHO. But judging from the question you are more concerned about the backend and document storage, and looking more on using a more open source stack (with integration with AD)? Anyway, personally I'm using KnowledgeTree as our Document Management System and their implementation is that all files resides on a file directory and the database will keep track on the path, corresponding metadata, access logs and versioning information. They basically kept several versions of the same file if a document has been updated - which I think was a fair enough idea implementation wise considering Microsoft Office documents are mostly binary (up until 2003). You may want to understand how much documents they currently have and how many documents that they are sort of expecting to flow into this system on a daily basis. (Or from a different point of view, what kind of documents they are planning to store would generally give you hints on what kind of load your server is supposed to handle) My guess is that most likely you could get away with the setup of having local filesystems and database storing metadata stuff unless you are sure that the system is expected to be handling a massive load of documents on a daily basis (imagine being Flickr for documents ;) ).
