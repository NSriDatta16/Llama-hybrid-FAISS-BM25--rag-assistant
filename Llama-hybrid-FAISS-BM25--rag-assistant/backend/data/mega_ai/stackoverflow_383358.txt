The invisible default submit action is a reasonable approach and doesn't drag JavaScript into the equation. However form elements with 'display: none' aren't generally reliable. I tend to use an absolutely-positioned submit button before the others on the page, positioned off the left-hand-side of the page. It's still pretty ugly, but gets the job done.
