IEnumerable yield return combined with .AsParallel()

I've written some code to try and describe my concern: static void Main(string[] args) { IEnumerable marks = GetClassMarks(); IEnumerable students = GetStudents(); students.AsParallel().ForAll(p => GenerateClassReport(p, marks)); Console.ReadKey(); } GetClassMarks uses yield return in it from my weird data source. Assume that GenerateClassReport does basically a marks.Sum()/marks.Count() to get the class average. From what I understand, students.AsParallel().ForAll is a parallel foreach. My worry is what is going to happen inside the GetClassMarks method. Is it going to be enumerated once or many times? What order is the enumeration going to happen in? Do I need to do a .ToList() on marks to make sure it is only hit once?
