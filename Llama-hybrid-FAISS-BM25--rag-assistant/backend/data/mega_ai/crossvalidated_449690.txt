Using splines to address non-linearity in logistic regression

I was wondering if the following is a reasonable way to proceed: I have a number of logistic models, fitted using glm , that I want to use to make predictions. The models have a continuous variable (call it cont_var ), and for some of the models, a Box-Tidwell test suggests a non-linear relationship between cont_var and the logit of the outcome. Should I worry? Here's what I'm thinking: For any model where there might be non-linearity, I use splines to fit that model, replacing cont_var with ns(cont_var, df = 4) . Then, I make the same predictions I made with the original, non-spline model, and see if they give radically different predictions. If not, I conclude that any non-linearity isn't affecting my predictions. Does that make sense?
