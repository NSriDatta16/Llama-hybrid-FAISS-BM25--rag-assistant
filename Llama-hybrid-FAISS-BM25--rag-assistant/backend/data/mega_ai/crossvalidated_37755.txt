Since you have counts that are presumably accurate for alive, dead and missing at each site you can construct a 3x3 contingency table for your analysis. The columns would represent each of the three sites and the rows would be the categories alive, dead and missing. Tests like Fisher's exact test or the approximate chi-square test would be options to use to determine if the distributions of alive, dead and mssing differ among sites. I will not go into the details or the assumptions for each test. A really nice example is given by Zen's answer to this recent question which also includes some informative discussion. The recommendation for contingency table analysis and the one that suggested chi-square were probably both really the same as the approach I have described. Exactly how regression might be applied I am not sure (unless the person is thinking of multinomial logistic regression with site as a covariate).
