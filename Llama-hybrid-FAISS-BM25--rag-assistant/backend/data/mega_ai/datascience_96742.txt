It all depends if your data was initially randomized or not. If the data was well organized in a specific order, you must shuffle it first, and then split to train/test sub datasets. Otherwise, your prediction will be wrong because a learning model need to study various potential configurations, and the best way to do it, is to use random train data and random test data. Of course, the training requires more data (usually between 70% to 80%) than test data (20% to 30%) in order to ensure that many configurations are learned.
