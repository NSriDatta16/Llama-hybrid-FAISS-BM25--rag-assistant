caching of generated xml in asp.net

I am generating XML using linq to XML (XElements etc) from the database and with specific times. The biggest issue is that this XML will not change that often so i am trying to cache it in the code behind. Basically my code looks something like this: XDocument x = new XDocument( new XElement(ns + "SomeRandomDate", DateTime.Now()) ); Response.Clear(); Response.ContentType = "application/xml"; Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddSeconds(60)); Response.Cache.SetCacheability(HttpCacheability.Public); Response.Cache.SetValidUntilExpires(false); Response.Cache.VaryByParams["Category"] = true; x.Save(Response.Output); Response.End(); My biggest issue is that this does not seem to be working. Any ideas?
