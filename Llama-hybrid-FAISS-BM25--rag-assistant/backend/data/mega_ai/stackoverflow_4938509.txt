There appears to be a bug with Magento 1.4.x that does not allow user account registration at the checkout process. You can select register, walk through the checkout, and you'll get paid and it will all look successful and everything, but Magento will fail to create the customer account, thus making it impossible for the users to download their product. It totally sucks. I have a store that is useless until I can figure out how to get this fixed, as I only use the express checkout method, and all my products are downloadable.
