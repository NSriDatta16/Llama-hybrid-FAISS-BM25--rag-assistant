svm optimization problem

Suppose we have the dataset: {(3,1),(3-1),(6,1),(6,-1)} {(1,0),(0,1),(0,-1),(-1,0)} the first set represent the positive label, and de second the negative. I want manually find the support vectors, solve the equations and determine the coefficients W and bias w0 of the separating hyperplane. I know that the SVs are {s1=(1,0),s2=(3,1),s3=(3-1)} after i wrote a system of equations: α1k(s1,s1) + α2k(s2,s1) + α3(s3,s1) = -1 α1k(s1,s2) + α2k(s2,s2) + α3(s3,s2) = -1 α1k(s1,s3) + α2k(s2,s3) + α3(s3,s3) = -1 Where k(x,y) is the dot product xy the resolution of this system is impossible, can someone tell me where I'm wrong?
