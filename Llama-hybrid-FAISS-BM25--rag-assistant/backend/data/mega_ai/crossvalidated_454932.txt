Quantify the correlation of arbitrarily sized collection of time series

Given a set $N$ of continuous time series of equal lengths, is there a metric for how well they all correlate with each other? I've considered a metric; average Pearson, $\hat{P}$ , given by calculating the Pearson coefficient $P$ between all pairs $\{(T_i,T_j)\in N\}$ of time series and taking the average: $$ \hat{P}(N) = {\sum_{i=1}^{\vert N\vert} \sum_{j=1}^{\vert N\vert} P(T_i,T_j) \over{\vert N\vert}}$$ Can I use that to imply that we can (better) estimate/predict the value of a time-series $T_i$ at time-step $t$ denoted $T_i(t)$ , given the value for all other time-series $\{T_j(t) \in N | j \neq i \}$ ? (especially If necessary, assume you we know all values of all time-series except the value of $T_i(t)$ .
