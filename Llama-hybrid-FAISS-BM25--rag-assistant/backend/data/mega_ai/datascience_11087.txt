You can't retrospectively do it just with counts of unique visitors per day. If you represent the unique users on each day by sets $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$, the union can be as small as $|A_1|$, if all sets are equal, or as large as $|A_1| + \dots + |A_n|$ if all sets a pairwise disjoint. If you could estimate average number of days r per month a user visited the site (over the users that visited at least once), then there were exactly $(|A_1| + \dots + |A_n|)/r$ unique visitors that month. A nice proper way to do this, starting with new online data, is to use Hyperloglog or other memory-efficient approximate counting algorithms, as Marmite Bomber suggests.
