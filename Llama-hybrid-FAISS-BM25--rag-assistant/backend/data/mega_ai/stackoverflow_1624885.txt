PHPass is a lightweight, variable cost password hashing library using bcrypt. Variable cost means that you can later turn up the 'cost' of hashing passwords to seamlessly increase security without having to invalidate your previously hashed user passwords. The field size used for hash storage is constant even when increasing 'cost' due to increasing not the size of the hash, but the number of iterations required to produce it.
