How Do I Rank the GPA of Students from Different Colleges?

I have data from 100 students, each at a different college would like to rank them by GPA. I have the following data for each: The student's GPA: example 3.25 The all student average: 3.10 The highest possible GPA on that students campus, this is usually 4.0 but in some cases, MIT for example, the GPA is on a 5.0 scale. The lowest possible GPA, in all cases 0. The problem is that there is a wide range of all student GPA averages on the campuses, for example ranging from 2.5 to 3.5. Half of the student are above their all campus GPA and half are below. I do not want to take any other factors into considerations, such as Northwestern University in Chicago being a "better" school than "Northwestern Podunk University. We can make the assumption that on any campus there is a normal distribution of GPA.
