Any key has a finite space and a sufficiently determined person/group can and will generate all combinations. What's important is not so much the key but how you organise it's validation and what it authorises. If you are operating the validation/authorisation entirely through the Guid then that's probably not appropriate as potentially all Guids are valid, you'd be better off with something like SeriousBit Elipter . If you are using an authentication mechanism that records that a particular Guid has been issued and that it has now been used for activation then Guid isn't such a bad choice as it's a pretty big key space.
