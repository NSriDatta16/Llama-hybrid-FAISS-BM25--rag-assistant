Well... I guess I can't imagine how you could have forced all decisions into both the true and false conditions without having covered every block. The condition coverage doesn't seem like it guarantees decision coverage, though, unless you are saying that every single cell in the truth-table made up by all of the conditions has been hit. Is this purely academic, or does it support a more practical argument such as "do we have enough test coverage?"
