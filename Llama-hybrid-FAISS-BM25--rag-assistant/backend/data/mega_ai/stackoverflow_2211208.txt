http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/present/styles.html#h-14.6 14.6 Linking to style sheets with HTTP headers This section only applies to user agents conforming to versions of HTTP that define a Link header field. Note that HTTP 1.1 as defined by [RFC2616] does not include a Link header field (refer to section 19.6.3). So basically, this is not standard in http 1.1.
