Loss function definiton for relabelling

Taken from the appendix to the paper (Yongning Wang & Ruey S. Tsay) of this (2019) paper Clustering Multiple Time Series with Structural Breaks . Appendix to be downloaded her Appendix To fix label switching, the following loss function is defined. The most probable thing is that I misunderstand the definition of $G_{sk}$ . s is indicating a given regime, $k\epsilon\{1,\cdots,K\}$ is giving the group and $n\epsilon\{1,\cdots,N\}$ is the individual. If I want to select n s.t. $n\epsilon G_{sk}$ , I imagine $G_{sk}$ looks somewhat like $\left(0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,...\right)^{T}$ So in case of K=3 and N=50, you get $dim(G_s)=50\times3$ , but then I would need discrete optimization with $K^N$ possibilities of a $KN$ , matrix, which will never get stored. This does not seem reasonable. For context, it pertains to a loss function for label-switching. The main question remains, there is no definition of $G_{sk}$ given anywhere, and as the "action" of the loss function, the use of $n\epsilon G_{sk}$ in the summation of the loss function confuses me. I guess my question is, what do the authors mean by it.
