Filtering time periods where relationship is swiched on/off

Sorry for the "unmathematical" formulation of the problem to come, but I am not sure where to place my problem: Suppose there exists a relationship between the variables x and y. I can observe both variables over time. However, this relationship is switched off at certain times and later switched on. E.g. people behave rational in some times, leading to x causing y and in other times they behave irrational and y becomes random. So, when I run the time series regression y ~ x + 1, I will find no significant x due to the switched-off periods. When I "pick" the right period, however, I do. My question: How would I formulate my problem in the language of statistics and is there any way to filter the times where the relationship hold?
