Summary: The first sentence in the quoted BBC paragraph is sloppy and misleading. Even though previous answers and comments provided an excellent discussion already, I feel that the main question has not been answered satisfactorily. So let us assume that a probability of a plane crash on any given day is $p=1/365$ and that the crashes are independent from each other. Let us further assume that one plane crashed on January 1st. When would the next plane crash? Well, let us do a simple simulation: for each day for the next three years I will randomly decide if another plane crashed with probability $p$ and note the day of the next crash; I will repeat this procedure $100\,000$ times. Here is the resulting histogram: In fact, the probability distribution is simply given by $\mathrm{Pr}(t) = (1-p)^t p$, where $t$ is the number of days. I plotted this theoretical distribution as a red line, and you can see that it fits well to the Monte Carlo histogram. Remark: if time were discretized in smaller and smaller bins, this distributions would converge to an exponential one; but it does not really matter for this discussion. As many people have already remarked here, it is a decreasing curve. This means that the probability that the next plane crashes on the next day, January 2nd, is higher than the probability that the next plane will crash on any other given day, e.g. on January 2nd next year (the difference is almost three-fold: $0.27\%$ and $0.10\%$). However , if you ask what is the probability that the next plane crashes in the next three days, the answer is $0.8\%$, but if you ask what is the probability that it will crash after three days, but in the next three years, then the answer is $94\%$. So, obviously, it is more likely that it will crash in the next three years (but after the first three days) than in the next three days. The confusion arises because when you say "clustered events" you refer to a very small initial chunk of the distribution, but when you say "widely spaced" events you refer to a large chunk of it. That is why even with a monotonically decreasing probability distribution it is surely possible that "clusters" (e.g. two plane crashes in three days) are very unlikely. Here is another histogram to really get this point across. It is simply a sum of the previous histogram over several non-intersecting time periods:
