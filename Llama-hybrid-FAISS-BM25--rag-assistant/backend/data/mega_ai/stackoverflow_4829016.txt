How reliable is detecting mobile devices by screen resolution?

This sounds a bit too good to be true, so please tell me if it is. If I have just one single version of a mobile website (no variations for different devices, just one website for all mobiles), how reliable it is to detect mobile devices by screen resolution? And simply serve the mobile version if screen resolution is NOTE: My question assumes that javascript is enabled. Also,I'm aware there's user agent detection, but I'd like to do without it.
