Distribution of values of the chi square pdf

In short: if $Z$ is chi square with $n>1$ degrees of freedom and $f_Z$ its density function, and $X=f_Z(Z)$ , what is the distribution of $X$ (in particular its mean and variance)? Explanation: I want to estimate a value $x$ and have candidate estimates $x_1,...,x_n$ . For each candidate I can calculate a chi square score with 4 degrees of freedom comparing it to $x$ ; call it $z_i$ . I am then forming the weighted average $$ \frac{\sum_i f_Z(z_i)x_i}{\sum_i f_Z(z_i)} $$ as my estimate of $x$ , so, assuming the necessary independence, the variance of my estimate will be a complicated formula for the variance of a quotient that I found, which breaks down into linear combinations of $E(X)$ and $\mathrm{Var}(X)$ with $X$ as in the first paragraph. Bonus question: Is what I'm doing at all legitimate or a known method? In case it isn't clear, while I have a grounding in probability, I know next to nothing about statistics. Many thanks for any pointers or alternative suggestions.
