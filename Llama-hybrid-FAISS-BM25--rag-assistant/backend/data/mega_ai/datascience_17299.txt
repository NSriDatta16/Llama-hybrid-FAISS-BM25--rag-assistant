Orange Infrared

I must say Orange has really done great job in the world of machine learning. I have 3 questions. (1) I have found "Orange Infrared" has been added recently. But I haven't found any kind of data regarding infrared spectra. I would like to know how to get that Infrared data? Whether the IR spectra data from Gaussian software can be used to be trained in Orange? (2) I have seen a video orange has Neural Network classifier, But I downloaded and installed orange 3.3.12, No neural network model has been found. (3) What is CN2 rule Induction, by any means is it related to Convolution Neural Network.
