According to my Lex & Yacc book there is a function yyrestart(file) . Else (and I quote a paragraph of the book: This means that you cannot restart a lexer just by calling yylex(). You have to reset it into the default state using BEGIN INITIAL, discard any input text buffered up by unput(), and otherwise arrange so that the next call to input() will start reading the new input.
