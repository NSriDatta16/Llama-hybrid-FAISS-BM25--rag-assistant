I donâ€™t know if I'm understanding you correctly but I think what you want is responding to user events from interface components. In Cocoa the term "event" is only used for objects that describe the actual event, like a touch down or key up. To respond to higher level events, like dragging a slider or pushing a button, Cocoa uses the target action paradigm. You set up a UI component (a UIControl derived view class) to send a given message to a given target whenever the component detects a change of its state. To set the target and the action method you can use Interface Builder or the UIControl method addTarget:action:forControlEvents: .
