Yes, it will. Triggers work in scope of the DML statement's transaction (either started by you explicitly or by the DML statement itself implicitly) When this transaction is rolled back, all changes made by the triggers are also rolled back. However, if you put PRAGMA autonomous_transaction into the trigger definition, the trigger will start its own transaction which you should commit before the trigger completes.
