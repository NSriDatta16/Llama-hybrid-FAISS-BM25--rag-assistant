player height and width is unfortunately not equal to video resolution. The video resolution is determined by jw player by reading the video metadata. If the size is not specified there, it defaults to 4:3 aspect ratio, and adds the black bars your seeing. I don't believe adjusting the video player size, as suggested above, will not work to display the video correctly - it just adjusts the frame size. I wish I had an answer for this outside of embedding the size data into the video, but unfortunately do not.
