The RaPSor project appears to be a java based ray-tracing simulator. It actually stands for Radio Propagation Simulator and was developed initially to support radio signal propagation for things like projecting dead spots in the WiFi coverage in buildings. Reading through some of the use case paper for it shows that it does ray tracing and can be extends to support acoustic ray tracing. The blog article that tipped me off refers to the idea of figuring out the acoustic sound field for a room, but I don't see why it needs to be limited to in-air propagation. Also, it was built using the NetBeans project.
