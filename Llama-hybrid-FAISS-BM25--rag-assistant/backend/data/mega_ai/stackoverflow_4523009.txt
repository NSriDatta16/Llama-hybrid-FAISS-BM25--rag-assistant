I'm not quite clear. I presume you have data in Oracle that is encrypted. You want to pull that data from the table, then use the Oracle function to decrypt it. When you encrypt data you generally want to store is a RAW or BLOB because it is no longer a string and you don't want any string like character set conversion to happen on it (eg removing accents from characters). An alternative to RAW/BLOB storage is converting the bytes to a hexadecimal representation, but that wastes a lot of storage so I wouldn't recommend it. So the first step is to determine whether the Oracle data is stored as RAW/BLOB, HEX or whether they've used a VARCHAR2 and have used the same characterset throughout to avoid any conversion issues. If the latter, determine the database character set (the DBA should be able to get this from v$nls_parameters, if he doesn't know it off hand). Basically you need to ensure that exactly the same bytes are pushed into the decryption algorithm as were pulled from the database. Depending on the architecture you may be able to simply do a SELECT decrypt(encrypted_column,:key_variable) FROM table WHERE id = ....;
