Prediction results for two response variable from random forest

Would any R expert explain the predic function in the randomforest package to me? I want to get two prediction results for numberic response variable A and B seperately from following regression result I can get one prediction result. But prediction is neither A nor B. I can get the prediction results for both A and B from Mvpart and party package. Thanks in advance!
