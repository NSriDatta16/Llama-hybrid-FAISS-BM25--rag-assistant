to newer models, including GPT-4 Turbo, during peak usage periods. It would also give access to the Copilot GPT Builder, which lets users create custom Copilot chatbots, access to features inside Copilot Labs, an early-access program for in-development features, and allow for higher resolution in images generated by Microsoft Designer's Image Creator. Chatbots Several default chatbots are available in Microsoft Copilot, including the standard Copilot chatbot as well as Microsoft Designer, which is oriented towards the use of its Image Creator to generate images based on text prompts. Others include "Travel Planner", "Cooking Assistant", and "Fitness Trainer". Plugins Copilot supports plugins for Instacart, Kayak, Klarna, OpenTable, Shop from Shopify, and Suno AI. Copilot Voice Copilot Voice allows users to engage with Copilot in real-time voice conversations. The feature utilizes OpenAI's GPT-4o model, which has the capability to understand and generate audio. Copilot Labs In October 2024, an early-access program for features in-development, Copilot Labs, was revealed, exclusive to Microsoft Copilot Pro subscribers. Features available through this program include "Think Deeper", which uses the OpenAI o1 models to let Copilot "reason" through more complex queries, and Copilot Vision, which lets Copilot view and converse about websites while browsing them. According to Microsoft, content used during Copilot Vision will not be stored or used to train models during the preview. Languages Copilot is able to communicate in numerous languages and dialects. PCMag journalists conducted a test to determine translation capabilities of Copilot, ChatGPT, and Gemini, comparing them to Google Translate. They "asked bilingual speakers of seven languages to do a blind test". Languages tested were Polish, French, Korean, Spanish, Arabic, Tagalog, and Amharic. They concluded that Copilot performed better than Google Translate, but not as well as ChatGPT. Japanese researchers compared Japanese-to-English translation abilities of Copilot, ChatGPT with GPT-4, and Gemini with those of DeepL, and found similar results, noting that "AI chatbots' translations were much better than those of DeepLâ€”presumably because of their ability to capture the context". The markup language copilot uses for mathematical output is LaTeX. Technology Copilot utilizes the Microsoft Prometheus model. According to Microsoft, this uses a component called the Orchestrator, which iteratively generates search queries, to combine the Bing search index and results with OpenAI's GPT-4, GPT-4 Turbo, and GPT-4o foundational large language models, which have been fine-tuned using both supervised and reinforcement learning techniques. Windows Microsoft Copilot in Windows supports the use of voice commands. By default, it is accessible via the Windows taskbar. Copilot in Windows is also able to provide information on the website being browsed by a user in Microsoft Edge. In 2024, Microsoft began to establish standards for "AI PCs" powered by Windows 11. These include a hardware AI accelerator, as well as a Copilot button on the keyboard, which replaces the menu key and launches Windows Search if Copilot is disabled or is not available in the user's region. During a Microsoft Surface hardware event on May 20, 2024, Microsoft officially announced the "Copilot+ PC" branding. Mobile Standalone Microsoft Copilot apps are available for Android and iOS. Microsoft 365 Copilot can be used to rewrite and generate text based on user prompts in Microsoft 365 services, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and PowerPoint. According to Jared Spataro, the head of Microsoft 365, Copilot for Microsoft 365 uses Microsoft Graph, an API, to evaluate context and available Microsoft 365 user data before modifying and sending user prompts to the language model. After receiving its output, Microsoft Graph performs additional context-specific processing before sending the response to Microsoft 365 apps to
