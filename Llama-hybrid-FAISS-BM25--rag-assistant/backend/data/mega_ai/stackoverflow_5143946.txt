Check if form is changed in ext-gwt and highlight save button

this might be a simple question. we have a form with different widgets, tables and etc. in that form we need to highlight save button and enable/disable other action buttons right after a user changed form data. do you know about any elegant way to handle dirty forms I like http://plugins.jquery.com/project/dirtyform but this is not gxt. Thank you, SLava
