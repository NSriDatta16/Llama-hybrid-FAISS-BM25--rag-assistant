I think t works out of the box with VC 2005 but I am not sure if they are provided with all versions. If you jsut attach the /openmp option you also have to include the open mp header #include This is important because this header will add the manifest to your application which enables it to load the vcomp.dll from the correct system path. So it is normally no longer allowed to copy vcomp.dll or other system dlls beneath your executable but you have to pimp the manifest of your application to load the dll from the correct location. This is none automatically by the omp.h header. So the minimum code if you do not want to modyfy your manifest on your own is: #include // has to include this header to build the correct manifest to find vcom.dll or vcompd.dll int main(int argc, char* argv[]) { double sum; #pragma omp parallel for for(int i = 0; i
