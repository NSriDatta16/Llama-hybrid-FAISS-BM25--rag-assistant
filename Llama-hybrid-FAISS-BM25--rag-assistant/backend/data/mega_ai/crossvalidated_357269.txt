It is unclear to me what you call an analytical posterior $\pi(\theta)$ and hence why this analyticity should preclude one from using MCMC. Even for a posterior distribution that is available in closed form, including its normalising constant, which is how I understand analytical in this setting, there is no reason for Bayes estimates to be available in closed form, as solving the minimisation problem$$\min_\delta\int_\Theta \text{L}(\theta,\delta)\,\tilde\pi(\theta)\,f(x|\theta)\,\text{d}\theta$$when $\tilde\pi(\cdot)\propto\pi(\cdot)$ strongly depends on the loss function. When the normalising constant $$\int \tilde\pi(\theta)\,\text{d}\theta$$is not available, finding a posterior mean or median or even mode [which does not require to know the constant], most often proceeds through an MCMC algorithm. For instance, if I am given the joint density , when $x,y\in(0,1)$, $$f_\theta(x,y)=\dfrac{1+\theta[(1+x)(1+y)-3]+\theta^2(1-x)(1-y)) }{[1-\theta(1-x)(1-y)]^3}\qquad\theta\in(-1,1)$$inspired by the Ali-Mikhail-Haq copula : it may be properly normalised (and is indeed), but the conditional expectation of $\Phi^{-1}(X)$ given $Y=y$ under this density, when $\Phi(.)$ is the Normal cdf, is not available in closed form. This is however a question of primary interest . Note also that the maximum a posteriori estimator is not the most natural estimator in a Bayesian setting, since it does not correspond to a loss function and that closed-form representation of the density, even up to a constant, does not make finding the MAP necessarily easy. Or using the MAP relevant.
