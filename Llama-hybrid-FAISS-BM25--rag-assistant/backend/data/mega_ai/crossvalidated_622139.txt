DID with Panel data (FE) - insignificant results

I run a DID with Panel data (FE) in Stata. I have two groups, Treatment Group (N=75); Control group (N=54). And have a time series of 6, 3 pre treatment and 3 post treatment. I am getting insignificant results, and do not know how to explain it? I run a placebo test, still insignificant results. Can someone help me elaborate the reasons. Is the sample size not large? What could have been wrong? The variable of interest is the change of a sustainability score of ocmpanies.Treated is a dummy that takes 1 for the period and being in the treatment country. I use Size (total assets of companies) as control variable. this is my regression: reghdfe esg c.Treated#c.post Size , absorb(country year industry) cluster(country industry) Moreover, these are my results: I would really appreciate an answer, thank you!
