Yes, it is possible. There is no statistical argument regarding which transformation of a variable should be treated as the original variable. For example, given a multivariate time series, you can take any single series and integrate it or difference it before showing the whole system to me. Then you can ask me your original question. Not knowing what the original variables were, I would likely have to difference some variables but not other until they all are on the same level of integration. If you transformed the variables in a different way before showing them to me, my transformations before fitting a VAR model would have to be different. Also, consider that the variables you have obtained from somewhere might have been integrated or differenced by another person who assembled the data. We cannot always backtrack the origins of each variable. What matters is the level of integration of the variables that enter the model after appropriate transformations, not before.
