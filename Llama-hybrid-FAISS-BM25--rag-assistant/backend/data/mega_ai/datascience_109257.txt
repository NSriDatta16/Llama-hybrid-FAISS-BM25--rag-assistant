Random forest accuracy

I saw this video and I understood that to build a random forest are used different decision tree, with a different structure. My code about that is: library(randomForest) library(datasets) library(caret) data $Species Species) table(data$Species) set.seed(222) ind $ Species) p2 Species) When I run print(rf) I saw: OOB estimate of error rate: 4.95% So my expected accuracy is 1-4.95% ? Expected accuracy is significant differently from train accuracy (1) and test accuracy (0,93), what does it means?
