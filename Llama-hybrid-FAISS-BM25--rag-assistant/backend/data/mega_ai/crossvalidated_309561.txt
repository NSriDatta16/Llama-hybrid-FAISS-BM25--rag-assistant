Basically, you want your data to be normalized or standardized so that it would have zero mean and unit-variance. Although another way to explain it would be that the features need to be normalized simply because you do not want some features overpower the other features. Let's say for example that you have a column for movie prices. The prices are around 20-30 dollars each and then you have another column for number of people who went to the cinema that day and the value is around 1000-2000 people. You can clearly see that the column that contains the number of people is clearly larger than the price of the movie hence making it somewhat incomparable. The data is normalized to address this issue and make sure that one feature doesn't overpower the other features so that when it is used in Machine Learning algorithms, it would be comparable and easier to create models from it.
