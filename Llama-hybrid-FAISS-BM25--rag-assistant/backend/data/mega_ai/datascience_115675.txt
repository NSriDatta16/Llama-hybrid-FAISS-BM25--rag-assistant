One option is incremental machine learning (sometimes called online machine learning). In incremental machine learning, existing model weights are updated with new data as the new data is available for training. If the size of the models is a concern, there is work on sparse models. One example is the Pathway architecture where a single, very large model only activates a small subset of pathways through the network as needed for a specific decision. The model itself learns which parts of the network are needed for which predictions. Pathway architectures can scale to 100s of billions of parameters.
