no you cannot you stil lhave to faff about with detaching and attaching to a new data context. Invariably you end up doing this by using the unique key for the object to slect it out of the database and then copy the properties into the new object and save the changes back. Sad but true. I used to be a lin2sql junkie, i do prefer EF4 though after a bit of exposure to it. I like the various forms of inheritance - they can be leveraged to do some interesting things.
