Is it a good idea to take a sample from the data, run PCA on it to find a good number of components then use this number on the whole dataset? PCA does eigendecomposition of covariance matrix - it doesn't actually need to run on the whole dataset, if your covariance estimate from sample is good. Is it ok to take the subspace built using this sample dataset and transform the original data using it? Yes, provided that the covariance estimate is OK.
