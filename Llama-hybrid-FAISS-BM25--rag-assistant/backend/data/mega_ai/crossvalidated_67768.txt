I know this directly contradicts the premise of the question, but why not just grind through the math and compute the expected value, given that it's exactly what you want anyway. For the example in your question, the expected values aren't the same, which ought to indicate that your approach is flawed. To wit: >> 7*(1/3) + 3*0.35 ans = 3.3833 but >> (7*(33/68) + 3*(35/68)) * 0.68 ans = 3.3600 Just in case you're getting mixed up on the definition of expected value, it's $$\mathbb{E}(X) = x_1P(X=x_1) + x_2P(X=x_2) + \cdots + x_nP(X=x_n)$$ where $x_i$ are the values that $X$ can take. I usually think of it as a weighted average of the possible values for $X$, where the probabilities are the weights. Wikipedia (and any intro textbook) have lots more details. For your first example, a 40 doesn't really enter into the computations. Let's call that random variable Y. Then $$\mathbb{E}(Y) = P(x) \cdot 30 + (1-P(x))\cdot(-10)$$ You'd typically plug in a value for P(x), and compare the resulting value to zero. If that is greater than zero, then the game is a "good deal" for you. For your second example, it's not possible to compute an expected value because your probabilities aren't actually known. For example, we could set $P(y)$, $P(z)$, $P(k)$, and $P(p)$ all to $0.25$. This satisfies your constraint that $P(y) + P(z) = 1 - P(p) - P(k)$, and it makes the resulting expected value very negative: $$\mathbb{E}(Z)=0.25 \cdot 25 + 0.25 \cdot 12 + 0.25 \cdot (-32) + 0.25\cdot(-19)=(-3.5)$$ On the other hand, we could also set $P(y)=1$ and the rest to $0$. In this case, the expected value is 25, which is a vastly better deal for you. Instead of looking for a heuristic, you might want to find out what else you know about the relationships between $y,z,p,$ and $k$
