I agree that what you have seen can be confusing and ought to be accompanied by documentation. But confusing things can happen in any language. In your own code, you should apply whatever conventions make things easiest for you to maintain the code. With respect to this particular issue, there are a number of possible things that can help. Using something like Epydoc , you can specify all the instance variables a class will have. Be scrupulous about documenting your code, and be equally scrupulous about ensuring that your code and your documentation remain in sync. Adopt coding conventions that encourage the kind of code you find easiest to maintain. There's nothing better than setting a good example. Keep your classes and functions small and well-defined. If they get too big, break them up. It's easier to figure out what's going on that way. If you really want to insist that instance variables be declared before referenced, there are some metaclass tricks you can use. e.g., You can create a common base class that, using metaclass logic, enforces the convention that only variables that are declared when the subclass is declared can later be set.
