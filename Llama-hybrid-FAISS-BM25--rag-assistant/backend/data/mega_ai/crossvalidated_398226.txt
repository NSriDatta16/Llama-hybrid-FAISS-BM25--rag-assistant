You would need to do some explorative data analysis to answer this. Look at the leverages (your linear regression tool should be able to produce diagnostic plots). If there are a few very old individuals, their squared age would dominate their expected response. Suppose, for example, age^2 has a negative coefficient. A very old individual therefore has a very low expected response, and since very old individuals are not treated, this would lower the estimates treatment effect and might well cause it to be negative. You might also want to carry out an analysis on the subset of individuals who were eligible for treatment (i.e. only young individuals).
