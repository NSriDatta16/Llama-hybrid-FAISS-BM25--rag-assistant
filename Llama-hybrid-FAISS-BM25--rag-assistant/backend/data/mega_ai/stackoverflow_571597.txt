Well, from an overall "similarity" feel, JSF is closer to ASP.NET component model than raw JSP is. So, if you come in to JSP "blind" you'll be in for a rude shock in terms of what kind of "raw functionality" you will get from the platform. Now, if you're comfortable with the raw HTTP request cycle, then any (decent) JSP/Servlet book will likely suit. I like the Head First books, I think they're pretty good. However, you can go here: Free JSP Book That's a reasonably modern book. (You may have to register to get the book.) The key things to look for, IMHO, regard a JSP book is solid coverage of JSTL and, ideally, decent coverage of JSP 2.0 Tag Files. A lot of books are still stuck in the 1999 world of JSP, and it's a LOT better than that. But, JSP is not equivalent to ASP.NET, JSF is more like that. I have no opinion on JSF, I don't use it.
