From Shmueli (2010, Statistical Science), on the difference between explanatory and predictive modelling: A popular predictive metric is the in-sample Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). Akaike derived the AIC from a predictive viewpoint, where the model is not intended to accurately infer the “true distribution”, but rather to predict future data as accurately as possible (see, e.g., Berk, 2008; Konishi and Kitagawa, 2007). Some researchers distinguish between AIC and the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) on this ground. Sober (2002) concluded that AIC measures predictive accuracy while BIC measures goodness of fit: In a sense, the AIC and the BIC provide estimates of different things; yet, they almost always are thought to be in competition. If the question of which estimator is better is to make sense, we must decide whether the average likelihood of a family [=BIC] or its predictive accuracy [=AIC] is what we want to estimate Shmueli, Galit. 2010. “To Explain or to Predict?” Statistical Science 25 (3): 289–310. https://doi.org/10.1214/10-STS330 .
