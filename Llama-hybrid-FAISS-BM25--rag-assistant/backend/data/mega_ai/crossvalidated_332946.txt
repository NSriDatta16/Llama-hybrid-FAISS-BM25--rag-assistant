I came across this paper "Image-to-Image Translation with Conditional Adversarial Networks" , but the way how the noise is added is not described in the paper. Past conditional GANs have acknowledged this and provided Gaussian noise z as an input to the generator, in addition to x (e.g., [54]). In initial experiments, we did not find this strategy effective – the generator simply learned to ignore the noise – which is consistent with Mathieu et al. [39].
