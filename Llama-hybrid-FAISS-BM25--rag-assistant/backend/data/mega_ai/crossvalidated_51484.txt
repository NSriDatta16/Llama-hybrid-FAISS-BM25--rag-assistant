I read this question differently than in @entropy's answer. I see this as a "double seasonality" request: i.e. the poster needs to filter out seasonal noise (e.g. a warm/cold cycle, modeled by week) and a weekly seasonal pattern (stores sell more on Saturday than on Tuesday). There is a good discussion of this problem by Gould and Vahid-Araghi as chapter 14 in Rob J. Hyndman, A.B Koehler, J.K. Ord and R.D. Snyder's book 'Forecasting with Exponential Smoothing'. (2008). But the poster may be looking for a simpler approach. Continuing my example above, convert the data to weeks, and estimate weekly seasonal factors (e.g. by time series decomposition). Use these weekly seasonal factors to deseasonalize the daily data. Then use this daily data to estimate daily seasonality, and remove that by deseasonalizing.
