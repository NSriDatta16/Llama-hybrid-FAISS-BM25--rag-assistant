Does CNN take care of zoom in images?

Suppose a convolution neural network is trained on small images of an object, say flower, as in following 3 training images: Will this CNN correctly classify if the same object is present in zoomed form in a test image? As in following example: What if the situation is reverse, i.e. training on large sized objects and testing with small sized object? What is the best way to take care of different size of object that may be present for correct classification of images? (The images are from: https://www.shutterstock.com/video/search/flowers )
