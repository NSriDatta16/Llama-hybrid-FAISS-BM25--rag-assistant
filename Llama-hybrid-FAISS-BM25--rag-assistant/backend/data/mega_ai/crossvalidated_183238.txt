The method is not stated verbosely in the details section of ?prop.test but suitable references are given. Wilson's score method is used, see: Wilson EB (1927). "Probable Inference, the Law of Succession, and Statistical Inference." Journal of the American Statistical Association , 22 , 209-212. This is found by Newcombe (1998) - also referenced on ?prop.test - to have much better coverage than the traditional Wald-type interval. See: Newcombe RG (1998). "Two-Sided Confidence Intervals for the Single Proportion: Comparison of Seven Methods." Statistics in Medicine , 17 , 857-872. There it is called method 3 and 4 (without and with continuity correction, respectively). Thus, you can replicate the confidence interval prop.test(319, 1100, conf.level = 0.99, correct = FALSE)$conf.int ## [1] 0.2561013 0.3264169 ## attr(,"conf.level") ## [1] 0.99 with p Of course, the "exact" binomial (Clopper & Pearson), discussed as method 5 in Newcombe (1998), is also available in binom.test : binom.test(319, 1100, conf.level = 0.99)$conf.int ## [1] 0.2552831 0.3265614 ## attr(,"conf.level") ## [1] 0.99
