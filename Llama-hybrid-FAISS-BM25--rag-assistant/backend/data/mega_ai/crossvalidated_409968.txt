Pool redundancy analysis results from multiple imputations of missing data

I have a dataset that includes missing values, and I would like to carry out redundancy analysis using multiple imputation to fill in the missing values . So far, I have successfully created multiple imputations of the dataset using the mice package in R. I can then carry out redundancy analysis on each of those datasets separately, but how can I pool their results to create a single output ? Ideally I would like to produce ordination scores in order to create a triplot, as well as pseudo-F values and p values for the marginal effects of my predictor variables. The pool function within the package doesn’t have a method for .cca objects, and what I have read about “Rubin’s Rules” seems to apply to linear models and similar, I have not been able to make the link with the kind of output I see from the RDA. Below is some example code that shows what I have managed so far and where I am stuck. It’s based on the example on the vegan::cca help page, with the addition of multiple imputation. It’s therefore heavily simplified compared to the full process I would follow with my data. For example, the mice() step gives a bunch of warnings, but please ignore them, they are not the focus of the question. # Load up packages and example dataset library(vegan) library(mice) data(dune) data(dune.env) # Sprinkle some NA values into the data dune.miss Clearly I could repeat the RDA step for each of the 5 imputations, but then how would I pool the above results to give a single output?
