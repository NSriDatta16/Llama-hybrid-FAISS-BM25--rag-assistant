This document has some information about performance tuning in NotesSQL. If you aren't already, select your data from Notes Views instead of Notes Forms. NotesSQL will then leverage the indexes within the views for faster queries. You may need to create the view in the Notes database, but the performance benefit will make it worthwhile.
