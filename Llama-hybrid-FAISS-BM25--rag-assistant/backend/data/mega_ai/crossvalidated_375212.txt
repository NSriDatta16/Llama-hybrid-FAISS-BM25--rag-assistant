Finding a cut-off point

I'm trying to find a statistically significant cut-off point for number of attempts after which the risk of a poor outcome significantly increases. I'm using SPSS. First I generated a ROC curve in SPSS which yielded an AUC of 0.649, and using the coordinates for that, 1.5 attempts (Sens=0.821, spec=0.494), rounded to 2, is the cut-off point. So then, I generated a binary logistic regression model using multiple potential predictors of poor outcome (based on clinical knowledge), including the binary variables 2 or more attempts (y/n), 3 or more attempts (y/n), four or more attempts (y/n), and number of attempts (continuous). Using this method of analysis, four or more attempts as a categorical variable is the only significant predictor of poor outcome, but only if I include number of attempts as a continuous variable in the model. If I remove number of attempts, four or more attempts is no longer significant. So, here are my questions: 1) How do I interpret this? Is the cut-off 2 or 4? Since the AUC is on the low side, is the ROC curve the best way to analyze the data? 2) Is it valid to have a logistic regression model with the same variable included in both continuous and binary form? Thanks for your time.
