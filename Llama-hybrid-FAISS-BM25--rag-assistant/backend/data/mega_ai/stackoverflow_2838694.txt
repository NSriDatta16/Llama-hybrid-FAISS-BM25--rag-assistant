R5RS states that the semantics of letrec are exactly the same as those of internal definitions. See the section devoted to the latter for details; I quote the key fragment below: A containing internal definitions can always be converted into a completely equivalent letrec expression. Thus defining letrec in terms of internal defines just shifts the problem around. Also, I find it simpler to define a letrec macro and have lambda desugar internal defines into letrec than to stuff all that complex code into the lambda handler and build letrec on top of that. That's without touching on the question of which is the prettier form of introducing mutually recursive bindings in a non-top-level scope... ;-)
