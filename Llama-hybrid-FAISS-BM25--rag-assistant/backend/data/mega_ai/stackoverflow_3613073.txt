A better way to assign list into a var

Was coding something in Python. Have a piece of code, wanted to know if it can be done more elegantly... # Statistics format is - done|remaining|200's|404's|size statf = open(STATS_FILE, 'r').read() starf = statf.strip().split('|') done = int(starf[0]) rema = int(starf[1]) succ = int(starf[2]) fails = int(starf[3]) size = int(starf[4]) ... This goes on. I wanted to know if after splitting the line into a list, is there any better way to assign each list into a var. I have close to 30 lines assigning index values to vars. Just trying to learn more about Python that's it...
