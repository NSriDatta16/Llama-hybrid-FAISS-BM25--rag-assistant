Multiclass logistic regression with mlogit in R

I have a multi-class dataset like the following (a,b,c,d are features and e is the class (it can be 0,1 and 2)). a b c d e 1 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 2 4 2 0 3 1 2 4 2 0 4 2 2 2 2 0 5 2 1 2 2 2 I am trying to use mlogit package in order to see which column is more important but I am having a difficulty to understand how to use it. What I am doing is: dataset$e mldata[1:5,] a b c d e chid alt 1.0 1 1 2 2 FALSE 1 0 1.1 1 1 2 2 TRUE 1 1 1.2 1 1 2 2 FALSE 1 2 2.0 1 2 4 2 TRUE 2 0 2.1 1 2 4 2 FALSE 2 1 Now, in order to see the coefficients, I am constructing the model like that: mlogit.model Call: mlogit(formula = e ~ 1 | a + b + c + d, data = mldata, reflevel = "1", method = "nr", print.level = 0) Coefficients: alt0 alt2 alt0:a alt2:a alt0:b alt2:b alt0:c -211.0953 -89.7558 27.9911 33.1440 37.7503 7.3585 8.5072 alt2:c alt0:d alt2:d 3.0950 37.1340 5.5584 But now I don't understand what are alt0, alt2? What are the real coefficients of a,b,c and d?
