Hibernate @embeddable annotation equivalent for XML mapping file?

I have a class that I am creating a Hibernate mapping which contains a legacy object that I can't modify, so it doesn't have the necessary id field to play nicely with Hibernate. I would like to annotate the legacy object as an @Embedded field of my new class and write an hbm.xml file for the legacy object and note that it is embeddable. Is there a way to do this? The only documentation for embedding objects I've seen refers to annotating objects instead of using XML. I realize that I could extend the legacy object and annotate it appropriately, but these case might occur frequently so I'd like to avoid that if possible.
