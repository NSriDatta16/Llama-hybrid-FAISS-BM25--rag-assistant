Cointegration analysis requires that all time series are integrated to begin with. In your case, only one is integrated, so cointegration is not relevant. Since you mentioned ARDL (a model involving own lags and lags of other variables), maybe you want a vector autoregression (VAR) where every variable is a dependent variable? The integrated variable would have to be differenced first. How can I choose the number of lags? You can use information criteria such as AIC or BIC. Software for VAR models often contain functions for model selection based on them (e.g. VARselect function in vars package in R).
