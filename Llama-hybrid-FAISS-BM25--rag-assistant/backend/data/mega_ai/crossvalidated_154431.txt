It is good that you have 10 years of data, but you should consider what many ignore and check your data for changes in variance. You can use Tsay's test to do this and then use WLS to estimate, if necessary. See more here Outliers, Level Shifts, and Variance Changes in Time Series www.unc.edu/~jbhill/tsay.pdf You should also check your model to see if the model is changing using the Chow test for structural breaks as patterns change over time within the data due to policy, competition or unknown factors.
