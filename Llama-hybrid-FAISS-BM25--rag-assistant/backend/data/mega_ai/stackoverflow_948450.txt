I have only tried logging in a user from drupal into magento frontend. But this is how I would go about sharing a session between customer and admin. Take a look at the following classes /app/code/core/model/customer/model/session.php //this retrieves the logged in customer Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->getUSer() /app/code/core/model/admin/model/session.php //this retrieves the logged in admin user Mage::getSingleton('admin/session')->getUser() When creating a new customer you should create an admin account for that user using the save() method in /app/code/core/model/admin/model/user.php Mage::getSingleton('admin/user')->save() after that when you want to login the customer into the admin , just call /app/code/core/model/admin/model/session.php Mage::getSingleton('admin/user')->login() Hopefully this will set u on the right path :)
