If we're thinking of the observations as being identically distributed random variables and the goal is estimation of the distribution mean with an arithmetic average, then this depends on whether or not measurements are uncorrelated. In general \begin{align} \text{Var} \left ( \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} Y_i}{n} \right ) &= \frac{1}{n^2} \left ( \sum_{i=1}^{n} \text{Var}(X_i) + \underset{i \neq j}{\sum \sum} \text{Cov}(X_i, X_j) \right ) \\ &= \frac{1}{n^2} \left ( n \sigma^2 + 2 \binom{n}{2} \rho \sigma^2 \right ) \\ &= \frac{\sigma^2}{n} + \frac{n - 1}{n} \rho \sigma^2 \\ &\to \rho \sigma^2 \end{align} as $n \to \infty$. If the correlation is positive, then there's some uncertainty in our estimate that can't be erased.
