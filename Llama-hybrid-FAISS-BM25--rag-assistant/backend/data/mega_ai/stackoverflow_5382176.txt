hover is not working as expected

Possible Duplicate: how to get a hover effect with jQuery?? Its not working for me.. I was trying to modify a bit in my code. Instead of displaying images as list, I tried to place them in tags. Its working fine dragonfly.zymichost.com/hovereffect2.html . But when I place them in my actual page for some reason its not working as expected. dragonfly.zymichost.com/projects1.html
