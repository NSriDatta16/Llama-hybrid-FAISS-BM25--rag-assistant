Why do I have residuals values that are greater than 1 or lower than 0, given that what I am trying to predict is a binary column with zeros and ones? I suspect that your predictions are log-odds. Usually, you think of a logistic regression model as outputting a probability $p$ , which ranges between zero and one. In this case, your residuals would range between $-1 = 0 - 1$ and $1 = 1 - 0$ . Sometimes it makes sense to instead reason with the log-odds $log(\frac{p}{1-p})$ , and my suspicion is that your code has a bug that is producing this value when you ask for predictions from your model. This is a common problem in R, as it is (or, at least, was, it's been some time since I've used R) the default behaviour. how is it that I have two distinct zones in the continuous plots? You've got at least one binary predictor that has a very strong effect (looks like it's named excited ). my guess is that the banding behaviour in your residual plots is caused by this feature. If you color your residual plots by the value of excited , you can try to confirm this. In general terms, how is your approach when fitting a binary classifier? Do you follow something like this or do you do it in an entire different way? These are all reasonable things to do, but I'd fix the log-odds bug and get your predictions on the probability scale, since this is what is directly comparable to your $y$ label.
