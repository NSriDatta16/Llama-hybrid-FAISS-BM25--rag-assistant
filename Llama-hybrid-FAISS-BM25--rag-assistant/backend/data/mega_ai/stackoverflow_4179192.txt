Can the Xaml Editor intellisense my plain old class properties?

Say I just have a plain old class with a public string property. What do I have to do to make intellisense work in the Xaml Editor? public class MyType { public string MyProp { get; set; } } EDIT: Thanks for the answers. Xaml intellisense does work by default even without having to comment up all of your types and members, however the Xaml intellisense in Visual Studio 2010 is somewhat fragile. I eventually found the cause of my problem. Don't do this in a class in the namespace that you're expecting intellisense on: public static class SomeHelper { static object GetSomething(object x) { return null; } static T GetSomething (object x) { return default(T); } } even though it compiles, the Xaml Editor must get confused between the two methods.
