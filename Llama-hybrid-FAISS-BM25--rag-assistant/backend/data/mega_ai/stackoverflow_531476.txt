Embedding images in a single html file in IE

What is the best way to embed images in a single html file in IE?, i don't want a round trip request to a PHP file to decode the base64 data. I read about MHTML, is that the only way? if yes, how can I resolve the style "background-image: url(images/top.png);"? Regards, Manoj
