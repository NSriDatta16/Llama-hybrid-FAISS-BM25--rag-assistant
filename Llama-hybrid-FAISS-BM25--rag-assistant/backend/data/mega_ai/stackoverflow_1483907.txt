jQuery click event behaves differently with live function in Firefox

Using the event click with live function leads to strange behavior when using Firefox*. With live in Firefox, click is triggered when right-clicking also! The same does not happen in Internet Explorer 7 neither in Google Chrome. Example: Without live , go to demo and try right clicking the paragraphs. A dialog menu should appear. With live , go to demo and try right clicking "Click me!". Now both dialog menu and "Another paragraph" appear. *tested with firefox 3.5.3
