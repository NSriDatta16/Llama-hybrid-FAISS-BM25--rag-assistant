Possibly even better than a book, I can highly recommend Andrew Ng's coursera course on machine learning. It gives an excellent overview of several machine learning algorithms. The main advantages are that it both discusses the theory and discusses many practical things to worry about when implementing machine learning algorithms. What really makes it better than a book for you in my opinion is that it has programming exercies in matlab for most of the algorithms, including if I remember correctly both regression and categorization using logistic regression. https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning
