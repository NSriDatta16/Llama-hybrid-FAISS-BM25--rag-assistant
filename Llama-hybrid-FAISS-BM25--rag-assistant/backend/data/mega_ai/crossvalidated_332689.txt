Confidence interval for x-values given a probability in a logistic regression

I'm facing the following problem: I have done a logistical regression and the point on the x-axis, where both possible outcomes are equally likely (50%) is very important for my research. Getting this point wasn’t a problem. I’m offering two methods below. Now I’d like to get a confidence interval around this x-value and I have no idea how this could be done, or if this is even possible at all. Looking at ggplot, standard errors are drawn, but with my understanding, those show the confidence interval for the values on the y-axis given a certain x-value and cannot be used for my problem. I added some red lines manually to show, what I’m looking for and aligned them with the standard error. As explained above, even if I could get these 2 values, by using the standard error of ggplot, I think those would not be the confidence interval I’m looking for. Here is my code: library(ggplot2) model
