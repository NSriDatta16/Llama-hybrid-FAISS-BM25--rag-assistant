No you don't need to compile a separate cod file for each version although my understanding is that OS 5 will run older applications in a compatibility mode which can mess things up so you may want to compile separately for that if there are any problems. According to Wikipedia the user agent seems to follow the format "BlackBerry / Profile/..." I'm really not sure what you're looking for here. As far as I know the rapc compiler doesn't have any optimization abilities so however you compile it it's going to produce the same result.
