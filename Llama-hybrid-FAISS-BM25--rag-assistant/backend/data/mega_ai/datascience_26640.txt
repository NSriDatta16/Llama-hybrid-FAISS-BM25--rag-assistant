How to check for overfitting with SVM and Iris Data?

I am using machine learning predictions for the sample iris dataset. For instance, I am using the support vector machines (SVMs) from scikit-learn in order to predict the accuracy. However, it returns an accuracy of 1.0. Here is the code I am using: X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=51) svm_model = svm.SVC(kernel='linear', C=1, gamma='auto') svm_model.fit(X_train,y_train) predictions = svm_model.predict(X_test) accuracy_score(predictions, y_test) How to find out or to measure if this over-fitting or if the model is so good? I assume that its not over-fitting but what are the best ways to validate this?
