How to use Markov Chain to calculate attribution worth of a state?

I am trying to model a user's behavior through an app and have come across the idea of Markov Chains to do the modeling. A similar problem in marketing seems to be the multi-channel attribution problem. What I don't quite understand is how to attribute the positive outcome's result to each node along the way since my paths can be bidrectional. In the image above, how do I attribute the purchase conversion to the Notification Center with markov chains? I've tried to see if there was a removal effect, but since the node itself doesn't touch the conversion path directly, it doesn't seem to change. Is the attribution of it just 0 then?
