An HTML template engine for Java like Genshi or Zope's TAL

I need to work with a Web Designer so... Can you suggest me any? Thanks in advance FYI : Zope's TAL The Template Attribute Language (TAL) is a templating language used to generate dynamic HTML and XML pages. Its main goal is to simplify the collaboration between programmers and designers. This is achieved by embedding TAL statements inside valid HTML(or XML, respectively) tags which can then be worked on using common design tools. Genshi Genshi is a Python library that provides an integrated set of components for parsing, generating, and processing HTML, XML or other textual content for output generation on the web. The main feature is a template language that is smart about markup: unlike conventional template languages that only deal with bytes and (if you're lucky) characters, Genshi knows the difference between tags, attributes, and actual text nodes, and uses that knowledge to your advantage. NOTE : The key feature here is: This is achieved by embedding TAL (or Genshi) statements inside valid HTML(or XML, respectively) tags which can then be worked on using common design tools Example: Genshi: ${bar} TAL: The headline visible to the designer
