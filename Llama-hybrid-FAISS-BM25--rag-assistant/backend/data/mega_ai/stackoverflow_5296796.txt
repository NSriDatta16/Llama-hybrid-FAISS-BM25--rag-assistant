Quick answer to your question: Use the built in .Net cache. Additional points to ponder over.. Preferably, retrieve all master data in a single database retrieval (think stored procedure and dataset): though, I do not advocate the used of stored procs in all scenarios. As you rightly said, ensure that your data access layer checks the cache before making a round trip to the database Also, as your drop down values do not change very often; do remember to keep a long expiry duration Finally, based on your page design you could also look at Fragment Caching (partial page caching: user controls) which could give you bigger benefits since now you neither access the data cache nor the database. Performance: Again, the performance depends more on the application's load as compared to your direct round trips for fetching the master data. Put simply, As Thomas suggested use the cache class!
