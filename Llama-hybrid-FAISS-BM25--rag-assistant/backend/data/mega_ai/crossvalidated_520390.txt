Should we use the same fitting method in model selection and prediction?

I am curious whether we have to use the same fitting method in model selection and prediction. For example, suppose that we are going to use the logistic regression in prediction. Then, we may select a subset of features using the logit's maximum log-likelihood and cross-validation. In this context, if we also want to use five-nearest neighbor, then do we have to change the model selection method or just use the same selected features above? So, in a sentence, my question is that "should we use the same fitting method in model selection and prediction?"
