Saving extra data with an order in Magento

I have to add a column to the orders page which means adding a column to sales_flat_order_grid . Both of those are possible however I don't know how to add a value so that it gets saved in my new column. Do I have to register a new attribute too? The value is not present in the quote so I guess I don't need to register under config/global/fieldsets/sales_convert_quote since the value isn't there to be converted. Using Magento Enterprise 1.8.
