I think most of your questions are really about the general modeling strategy to be used in data analysis: 1. I think you should always customize your modeling strategy based on what your substantive concerns are. 2 / 3. The best general approach is to include all of the variables that you care about into one larger model, rather than fitting separate models to different situations based on subsets of the data. There are two main reasons for this: If there is a difference in the response depending on whether a particular covariate has a given value or not, that can be properly tested within a larger model. Moreover, testing interactions (whether the effect of another covariate depends on the value of this one) can also be properly tested. Your model can borrow information from the cases where a covariate takes on the other value to more precisely estimate all of the effects included. For example, you will get a better estimate of the intercept when all the data (e.g., $male$ vs. $female$) are included, simply because there's more data to use for the estimate. (Note that there are some lower-frequency cases that appear to diverge from this advice. One I can think of concerns survival analyses ; the commonly used Cox model assumes proportional hazard, and when a covariate violates this assumption, a stratified approach can be used. Even in this case, however, all strata are fit together, so that the estimates 'borrow strength' across the strata. I'm hard pressed to think of a situation where you'd want to break up your data and fit several smaller models independently.) Relative to this specific case: 2. I don't think you should do a standard ANOVA here, as your response variable is binary. Your best bet is to use a logistic regression model. (For more information about GLiM's, you may find the answer I wrote here to be helpful, although it was written in a different context.)
