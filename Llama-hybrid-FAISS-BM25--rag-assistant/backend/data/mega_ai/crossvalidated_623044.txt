Assessing model performance

Suppose there are $n=100000$ locations. At each location,there are observations of dependent variable $Y$ for 30 years. That is, we have time series data and this data have $100000$ rows and $30$ columns. We developed a model, and want to assess how well our model performs. With our proposed model, we also estimated the $y$ values at each time point to see if these $y$ estimates are close to the true value. But it is difficult to compare each pair of estimated value and its corresponding true value for all these $n=100000$ locations (since there are $100000\times 30$ pairs to compare. We have $100000\times 30$ observed $y$ values, and then we estimated those $100000\times 30$ observed $y$ values by our proposed model yielding $100000\times 30$ estimated $y$ values.). How can we assess how well our model performs? Is there visual and/or numerical method to assess the model performance?
