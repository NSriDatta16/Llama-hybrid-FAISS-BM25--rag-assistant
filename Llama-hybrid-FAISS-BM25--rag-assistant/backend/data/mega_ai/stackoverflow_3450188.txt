PHP object isset and/or empty

Is there a way to check if an object has any fields? For example, I have a soap server I am querying using a soap client and if I call a get method, I am either returned an object containing fields defining the soap query I have made otherwise I am returned object(stdClass)#3 (0) { }. Is there a way to tell if the object has anything? public function get($id){ try{ $client = new soapclient($this->WSDL,self::getAuthorization()); $result = $client->__soapCall('get', array('get'=> array('sys_id'=>$id))); if(empty($result)){$result = false; } }catch(SoapFault $exception){ //echo $exception; $result = false; } return $result; }//end get() This method should return either an object or false and I am only receiving an object with no fields or an object with fields.
