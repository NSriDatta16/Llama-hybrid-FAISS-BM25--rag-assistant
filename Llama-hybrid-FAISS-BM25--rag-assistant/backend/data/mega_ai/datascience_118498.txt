In credit scoring a missing amount often means 0 (or account not even opened). This is probably the case so the intuitive merge would be with little (or creating a '0' category, which would be equivalent to a 'missing' category). Start by checking the average default rate by categories if you want to see if there is a difference between 'nan'/'0' with 'little'. The main catch is often that the target is related to the account and having no money (or no account) lead to fewer defaults, breaking the natural monotonicity - richer = lower risk).
