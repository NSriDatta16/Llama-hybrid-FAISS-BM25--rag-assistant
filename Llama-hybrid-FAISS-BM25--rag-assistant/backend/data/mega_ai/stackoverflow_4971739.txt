(iphone) what does [super touchesBegan/Moved/Ended] do?

Most overloaded methods require [super theMethod] call. (For example, [super viewDidLoad]; , [super viewWillAppear]; and [super dealloc]; ) I didn't think twice whether I need [super touchesBegan:withEvent:] call or not, but it seems to play a role somehow. When do I need it and when don't I need it? I'm trying to programmatically cancel touch events when I need to, and it seems to be related to the question I asked.
