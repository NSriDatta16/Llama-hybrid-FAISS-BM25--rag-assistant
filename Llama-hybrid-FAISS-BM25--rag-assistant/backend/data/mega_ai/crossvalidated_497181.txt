Average of a function pow

For hours I have tried to find the average of the next function : p*r^t Where p and r are constants and t is the variable. I want to know the average between t=0 and t=[value]. Can you help me? The application is the consumption of food of a population which grow exponentially (p = members of the population at t=0 and r is the factor of reproduction). So I want to know, between two hours, what quantity of food was consumed. Regards. Edit for more details : by exemple : If my population grow at 1% by hour and i've 10.000 members at 0h, at 24h my population = 12679 members (10.000 * 1.01^24). So at 0h, my population consume 100 food/h and at 24h, it consume 126.79 food/h. So i want to calculate, if my stock is 100.000 food at 0h00, the new quantity of food at 24h. The algorythme to determinate the moment where food stocks are empty (without mathematic determination) is : const populationStart = 10; // Population grow at 1% each hour const grow = 1.01; const baseFood = 100_000; // Each member of population eat 1 food / h const consumeFood = 1; let currentPopulation = populationStart; let currentFood = baseFood; function nextPopulation() { return Math.log(Math.round(currentPopulation + 1) / currentPopulation) / Math.log(grow); } let totalTime = 0; while (currentFood > 0) { // Calculate moment where next baby born const next = nextPopulation(); // Consume food quantity of current stable population quantity currentFood -= currentPopulation * consumeFood * next; // Grow population currentPopulation *= Math.pow(grow, next); // Add time totalTime += next; // Show result console.log('New pop', currentPopulation, 'food stocks :', currentFood, 'time:', totalTime); } With this program, my output is : New pop 11 food stocks : 99904.21405960187 time: 9.578594039813165 New pop 12 food stocks : 99808.02377598119 time: 18.32316527805758 New pop 13 food stocks : 99711.49306697701 time: 26.36739102840552 New pop 14 food stocks : 99614.6718002056 time: 33.81518078005248 New pop 15 food stocks : 99517.59963094103 time: 40.748907156094006 New pop 16 food stocks : 99420.30861304936 time: 47.23497501553837 [...] New pop 1006.0000000000001 food stocks : 133.70547554179498 time: 463.4169783608241 New pop 1007.0000000000001 food stocks : 33.25622154409804 time: 463.5168285139033 New pop 1007.9999999999999 food stocks : -67.19308199061292 time: 463.61657956011453 So between 463.51h and 463.61h, i've between 1006 and 1007 members and food stocks are empty. If want a mathematical formule to find "463.xxh" without a programmatic loop , and a formule to calculate "after 47.23h : i've consumed 579.69 food"
