I think you are right and @JohnRos is wrong. Here's the argument. A random forest (RF) can be represented by a single tree if and only if the decision boundaries of the RF (within which a constant value is predicted) can be written as finite unions of hyperrectangles parallel to the coordinate axes. (Note that this does not mean that such a tree can be obtained from one of the standard algorithms to generate trees from data! You can construct the tree from systematically partitioning the space in order to reproduce the decision rule of the RF.) But this is in fact the case. If the RF was computed from $k$ individual trees, every observation that falls into the same intersection of the $k$ tree's leaves will end up predicted by the same constant, and these intersections must themselves be hyperrectangles parallel to the coordinate axes as this is what the original trees deliver. This doesn't imply that the resulting tree is useful or allows better interpretation, as it may be extremely big. It basically needs to emulate all involved random trees, so trying to interpret it may just be as difficult as looking at the whole random tree ensemble that led to the RF, and nothing is won. And, as said before, neither does it mean that one could have any tree-building algorithm that could generate it directly from the data other than of course "do the RF first and then construct the tree from it".
