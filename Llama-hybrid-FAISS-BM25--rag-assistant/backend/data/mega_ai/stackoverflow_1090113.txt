There are several different password formats you can choose to use with DNN. You can change the password formats by making changes to the web.config file in the AspNetSqlMembershipProvider key of the membership section. Here are the options available for the password formats: passwordFormat="[Clear|Hashed|Encrypted]" Storage format for the password: Hashed (SHA1), Clear or Encrypted (Triple-DES) The passwords are stored in the AspnetMembership table. If you are using the Encrypted format, then you should be able to pull the password back out.
