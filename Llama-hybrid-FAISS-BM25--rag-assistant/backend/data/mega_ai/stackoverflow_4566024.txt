Performance Considerations Use Multiple Folders Having a single folder with 200,000 image files in it is not a good idea. You should see if you can break them into multiple folders such as A,B,C,D. Use A Temporary Working Folder Create a temporary working folder where anything and everything you want to do with the image is performed. Move files from the working folder to their storage location (i.e. A,B,C,D) No Reading Filenames Do not attempt to read the filenames from disc. Doing so will result in terrible performance. Instead you should store the filename and path to your images instead. You can work with this in memory instead and you will have great performance.
