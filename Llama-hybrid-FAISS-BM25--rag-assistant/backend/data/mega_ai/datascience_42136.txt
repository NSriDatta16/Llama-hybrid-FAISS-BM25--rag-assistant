A strong machine learning model like a CNN, will perform better on melspectrogram than MFCC. The decorrelation is primarily of interest for classical methods like Hidden Markov Models and Gaussian Mixture Models. Additionally the melspectrogram preserves locality, so it is more image-like than if the DCT is applied. This allows using pre-trained image classification models, which tends to give very strong performance with minimal amount of work.
