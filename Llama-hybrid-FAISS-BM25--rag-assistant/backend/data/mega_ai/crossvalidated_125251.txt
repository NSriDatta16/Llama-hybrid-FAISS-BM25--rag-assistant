Do we always get exact density if we sample enough and if we have appropriate proposal distribution? Even if you only sample until you get a single acceptance you're still sampling from the correct distribution, as long as it's all done correctly. 1 How many samples are usually rejected in rejection sampling? The average proportion rejected is $\frac{c-1}{c}$ (which is obvious from a description of the algorithm), but the conditional probability depends on the relative height of the majorizing function and the desired density. How to determine the constant c for the proposal distribution such that c*Q(x) > P(x)? $c$ can be any value as long as $c> \min P(x)/Q(x)$. You want to make $c$ small. Do people use rejection sampling alone while sampling from high dimensional distributions? Or is it used say in combination with Gibbs sampling? It certainly can be used with Gibbs - for example it can be used to when generating the full conditionals in some of the Gibbs steps.
