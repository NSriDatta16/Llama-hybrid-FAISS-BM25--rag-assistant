The text in that message is simply a warning that on some systems the exact values may not be available and thus the best thing the Net-SNMP software could do is to combine the other results. To figure out exactly what is being done, the right thing to do is always to look at the source code (in agent/mibgroup/ucd-snmp/vmstat_linux.c for linux, but will be a different parallel file for other architectures). This shows: case CPURAWSYSTEM: long_ret = (vmstat(cpurawsystem)+vmstat(cpurawinter)+vmstat(cpurawsoft)) & MAX_COUNTER; return ((u_char *) (&long_ret));
