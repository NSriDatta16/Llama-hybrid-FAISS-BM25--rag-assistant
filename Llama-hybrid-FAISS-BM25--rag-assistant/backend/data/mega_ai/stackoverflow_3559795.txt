I haven't looked at the documentation, and I haven't used SVMs from OpenCV (but I have used LIBSVM). My guess is that it means: return decision function value. If you set it to true, you get the distance to the margin (and you get the class by looking at the sign of that value) and if it is false it returns +1 or -1 depending on the class.
