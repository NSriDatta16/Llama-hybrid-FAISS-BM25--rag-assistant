You could take a look at vector autoregression (VAR; note that "VaR" can also stand for "value at risk" in similar contexts, which is not what you are looking for). VAR is precisely used for modeling time series that influence each other, typically in a macroeconomic context. The remaining problem is that it really presumes normally distributed innovations, which may not describe your news coverage well (though it should be a better approximation for the stock prices).
