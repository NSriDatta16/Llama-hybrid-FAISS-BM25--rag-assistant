Seems like this is a Safari issue, but maybe not a bug (and may happen in other browsers): jQuery uses the browser's .innerHTML property to parse the retrieved document and insert it into the current document. During this process, browsers often filter elements from the document such as , , or elements. As a result, the elements retrieved by .load() may not be exactly the same as if the document were retrieved directly by the browser. http://api.jquery.com/load/ I'm guessing that applies to anytime .load() is used, not just when getting fragments. But I think it would be best, since you are pulling content into a element that it not include a tag?
