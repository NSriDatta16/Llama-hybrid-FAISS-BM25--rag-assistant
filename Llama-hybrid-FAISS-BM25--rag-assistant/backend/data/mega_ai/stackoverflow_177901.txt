What does WISC (stack) mean?

LAMP is a well-known acronym for the software/technology bundle/stack representing Linux , Apache , MySQL , PHP . There are a few passing references on the Web that use the acronym WISC to speak of the other (supposedly Microsoft-centric) software/technology bundle/stack in contrast to LAMP. There is, however, no Wikipedia entry on WISC at this time nor any relevant results from googling . Does the following seem like the right de-composition of the WISC acronym? W = Windows I = Internet Information Services (IIS) S = SQL Server C = C# If yes, is there a Web reference that coins the WISC acronym? If no, is there another acronym used to represent the Microsoft-centric stack when comparing with LAMP? P.S. First sighting of WISC at “ ASP.NET Caching vs. memcached: Seeking Efficient Data Partitioning, Lookup, and Retrieval ”.
