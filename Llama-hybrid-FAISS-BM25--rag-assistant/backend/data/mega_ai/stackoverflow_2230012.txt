The only way to know for sure would be to know more about your usage scenario. For instance, will later usage of the files need them in clusters of 100 files at a time? Perhaps if it does it would make sense to combine them. In any case, I would try to make a simple solution to begin with, and only change it if you later on find that you have a performance problem. Here's what I would do: Make a class that deals with the storage and retrieval (so that you can later on change this class, and not every point in your application that uses it) Store the files on disk as-is, don't combine them Spread them out over sub-directories, keeping 1000 or less files in each directory (directory access adds overhead if you have many files in a single directory)
