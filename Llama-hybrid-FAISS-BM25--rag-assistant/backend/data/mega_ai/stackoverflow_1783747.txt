Seems from your description that you are on the right path, with one little exception. You implemented a busy wait on the retrieval of messages from the Queue. A better way is to block your threads in the synchronised popMessage() method, doing a wait() on the queue resource when no more messages can be pop-ed. When adding (a) message(s) to the queue, the waiting threads are woken up via a notifyAll() , one or more threads will get a message and the rest re-enter the wait() state. This way the distribution of CPU resources will be smoother.
