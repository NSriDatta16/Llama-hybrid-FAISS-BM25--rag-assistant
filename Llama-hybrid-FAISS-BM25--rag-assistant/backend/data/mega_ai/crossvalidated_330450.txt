Here is a little specific illustration for Xi'an's general result. Consider the classical beta-binomial model, for which the posterior $\theta|y$ is beta distributed with, say, parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$. Then, by properties of the beta distribution , the MAP (mode of the beta distribution) is $$ \hat\theta^\text{MAP}=\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+\beta-2} $$ If we consider the odds $\phi=\theta/(1-\theta)$, we find (see next link, item related distributions) that their posterior follows a beta prime distribution , which has mode $$ \hat\phi^\text{MAP}=\frac{\alpha-1}{\beta+1} $$ Now, $$ f(\hat\theta^\text{MAP})=\frac{\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+\beta-2}}{1-\frac{\alpha-1}{\alpha+\beta-2}}=\frac{\alpha-1}{\beta-1}\neq\frac{\alpha-1}{\beta+1}=\hat\phi^\text{MAP} $$ EDIT: This lack of invariance does not seem to be restricted to the MAP. Consider the posterior mean, another prominent Bayesian estimator. In the present example, the posterior mean for $\theta$ is $$\hat\theta^\text{mean}=\frac{\alpha}{\alpha+\beta}$$ with $$ f(\hat\theta^\text{mean})=\frac{\alpha}{\beta} $$ which is not equal to the mean of the beta prime distribution, $$ \frac{\alpha}{\beta-1} $$
