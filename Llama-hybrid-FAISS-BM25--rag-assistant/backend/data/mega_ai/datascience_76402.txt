Does a CNN think things inside the filter are collocated aka dependent on each other?

I am running a 1D CNN on tabular data. The rows are data that I have are not sequential, that is to say they are not part of a time series or ordered string, which is why I am not using an LSTM. So when the filter looks at both row n and row n+1 , does it learn from them as if they are spatially collocated or dependent upon each other? Is there a way to prevent this from happening? Alternatively, is there a better way to look at 2 dimensional data (rows of features) as independent rows?
