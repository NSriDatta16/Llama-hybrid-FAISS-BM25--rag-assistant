One consideration is, do you want to require that developers who work with your project must install and use Eclipse? It's not a value judgement about Eclipse, rather an assumption as to your audience and how familiar they are with your chosen tool. If a C++ programmer is familiar with Java/Eclipse it may not be a problem. If they aren't familiar with Eclipse, they are going to see Eclipse as an obstacle to getting their work done. You need to pay attention to your instructions for putting together a build environment from scratch AND keep it updated. You know developers, There will be some C++ die-hards who will curse your decision and rant about how you should have just done it with Make instead of making (heh) them install a whole new platform just to do a build.
