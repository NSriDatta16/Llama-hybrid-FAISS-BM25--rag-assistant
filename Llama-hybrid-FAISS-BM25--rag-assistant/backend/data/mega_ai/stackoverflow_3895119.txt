I am currently using the Hibernate JPA 2.0 artifact, but I'd like to use something more standard There is still no javax.persistence:persistence-api:jar:2.0 artifact from Sun/Oracle. Either use the full javax:javaee-api:jar:6.0 artifact if you want something from Sun/Oracle... or just stick with the interfaces provided by Hibernate, EclipseLink, OpenJPA, etc.
