Your equations do not allow one to make any kind of inference (Bayesian or not): they just state that (in your notation) $Pr(A_{l+1})=Pr(A_l)=Pr(A_1)$. Proof: $$Pr(A_{l+1}) = Pr(A_l)\left(Pr(B_l|A) +Pr(\neg B_l|A)\right)\tag{5}$$ Now, conditional probabilities are probabilities, which means that they follow all the usual probability rules. In particular, since $B_l$ and $\neg B_l$ are mutually exclusive events, we have $$Pr(B_l|A) +Pr(\neg B_l|A)=Pr(B_l \cup \neg B_l|A)=Pr(\Omega|A)=1$$ Thus $$Pr(A_{l+1}) = Pr(A_l) \cdot 1 = Pr(A_l) = Pr(A_1) $$ Q.E.D.
