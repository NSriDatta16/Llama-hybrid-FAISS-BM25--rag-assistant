What you need: 1) A private and a public key. They have this symbol in your keychain: 2) A certificate made from the signing request of those keys 3) A provisioning profile linked to that certificate Let's say you change computers and want to set up Xcode with provisioning profiles again. How do you do it? Open Xcode, press ctrl + O to open the Organizer, and delete all provisioning profiles you might have installed already. Open keychain access, and create a signing request which you save to file (when you create the request, a private and public key is created in your keychain). Create/Update a certificate in the provisioning portal by sending apple this signing request Download and install the newly created certificate. Revoke your provisioning profiles and update them with the new certificate. Download and install the newly updated provisioning profiles.
