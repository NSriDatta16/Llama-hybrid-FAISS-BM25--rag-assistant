It sure is bad news to hear that so many things are suddenly dead or dying... Anyway, if your requirement is "any browser on any OS" then you're talking about HTML, plain and simple. Drop some browsers from that requirement and you can include JavaScript. Local CPU as opposed to what? Using server resources? Not with HTML/JavaScript. Local data storage will be odd, HTML5 isn't supported by everything yet but it might be something to look at for that. And what's with the DoS attack vector? Why is that such a relevant concern? You may have mutually exclusive requirements here, and potentially not a full grasp of web development as a platform or architecture. More to the point, this is a really vague question with almost no information and, from the perspective of others, nonsensical requirements. Please elaborate.
