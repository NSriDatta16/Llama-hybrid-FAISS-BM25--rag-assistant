The decision value (distance to $\mathbf{w}$) for a test instance $\mathbf{z}$ is: $$f(\mathbf{z}) = \sum_{i\in SV} \alpha_i y_i \kappa(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{z}) - \rho$$ In LIBSVM models, svm_coef contains $\alpha \cdot y$, the RBF kernel function is defined as $\kappa(\mathbf{x}_i, \mathbf{x}_j) = \exp(-\gamma \|\mathbf{x}_i-\mathbf{x}_j\|^2)$. The support vectors are stored in SV . So what you need to do is compute the decision values yourself based on the content of the model object. Retraining is not necessary, everything you need is available. You'll need to take care in the structure of the support vectors and coefficients, which is poorly documented. I don't remember the details myself anymore so I can't provide the full code, but it's not that difficult.
