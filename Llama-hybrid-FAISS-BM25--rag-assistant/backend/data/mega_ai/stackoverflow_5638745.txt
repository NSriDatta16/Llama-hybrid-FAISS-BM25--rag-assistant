The problem is that you're embedding the JSON response from the server inside more html. A JSON response for an AJAX call should comprise of ONLY the JSON text, and nothing else. Since you're embedding it in HTML, then retrieving it with a DOM call, most likely the browser is totally getting confused by your html within json within html and mangling the DOM. Try this, instead: #SerializeJSON( sResponse )# and var objData = eval(jBody); though, as other answeres have pointed out, you should not use eval for this. There's far safer ways of getting JSON data parsed back into javascript objects than eval.
