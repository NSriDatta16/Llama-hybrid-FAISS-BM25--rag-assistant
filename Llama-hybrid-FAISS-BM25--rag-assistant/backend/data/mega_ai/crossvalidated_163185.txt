It looks like the observed value is exceeding the $n$ parameter of the binomial distribution. I suspect you'll continue running into this problem so long as your parameter space includes values for which $p(D) = 0$. For example, a binomial distribution with $n=3$ assigns zero probability to $k \gt 3$, so if your MCMC chain sampled a value from the Poisson distribution that corresponded to a higher observed value, the data would have zero probability. You may want to change your model such that the data are possible under any combination of parameters. In particular, you may want to model your observed values using a distribution that has infinite support. (Naturally, this will change how parameters are interpreted.) Depending on your data, you may be able to treat $n$ as observed. For example, say you were modeling the number of users who walk into a store and express interest in a given phone. In that case, you could observe both $n_t$, the count of persons walking into the store, and $k_t$, the number expressing interest. I can't speak to whether this is realistic in the application you're facing, but it would likely avoid the ZeroProbability error.
