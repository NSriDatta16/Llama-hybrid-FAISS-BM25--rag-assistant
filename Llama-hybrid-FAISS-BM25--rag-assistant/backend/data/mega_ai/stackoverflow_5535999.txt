I'm not really sure what you're asking here. Are you saying this is a bug? I don't think so, it's clearly defined behaviour: the queryset is lazy, but is evaluated when you iterate or slice it. Each time you do slice it, you get a new object. This is the logical consequence of the fact that slicing by itself doesn't cause the non-sliced queryset to be evaluated - if the result isn't already cached, slicing will perform a single database call with a LIMIT 1 to only get one result. Otherwise, you're left with extremely undesirable side-effects. Now, if you think this could be better explained in the docs, you're welcome - and encouraged - to submit a bug with a patch that explains it better.
