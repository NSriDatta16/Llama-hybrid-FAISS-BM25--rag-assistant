If you're doing in-browser development, you probably want to use Silverlight. It is similar to WPF, but browser independent, and gaining a lot of traction in terms of usage, as well as a lot of attention from Microsoft. (For example, the new RIA services is pretty nice, for business apps.) Both WPF and Silverlight provide many of the same benefits when compared to older technologies for UI development, though, such as Windows Forms. Databinding in WPF and Silverlight is very powerful, and very flexible. This can both speed up development and provide a level of safety that was difficult to create before. UI development, though different, is much more flexible. The separation of presentation from behavior in WPF and Silverlight makes it very easy to create very customized UI code, very quickly. The new commanding interface, in conjunction with DataTemplates, allows for much easier development in a manner that's very flexible, testable, and maintainble (by using the MVVM pattern). All of these lead to a much nicer long term development, once you get over the learning curve, in my opinion.
