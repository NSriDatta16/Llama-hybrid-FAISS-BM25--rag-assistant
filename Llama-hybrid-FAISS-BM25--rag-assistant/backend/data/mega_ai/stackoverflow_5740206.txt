I use a bit different technique then @Spider M9. I want that all projects in solution tree/all subdirectories from current directory use extended build throw Custom*MicrosoftCommonTargets. I don't like to be forced to change every new project to import custom targets/props. I place special file, let's say msbuild.include , in the root directory and my custom targets loader for every project tries to find it in . , ..\ , ..\..\ , and so on. msbuild.include contains flags that triggers execution of custom actions. If loader can't find this file it disables loading all custom targets and stoppes. This gives me ability to use my build extensions with projects from work repositories and to not use with opensource projects. If you are interested in I can publish loader. It's a pretty simple and elegant solution. For example I can sign any assembly in all projects in all subfolders with my key.
