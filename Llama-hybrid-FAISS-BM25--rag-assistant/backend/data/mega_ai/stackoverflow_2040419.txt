Rule of thumb: use the native platform Unicode form for processing (UTF-16 or UTF-32), and UTF-8 for data interchange (communication, storage). If all the native APIs use UTF-16 (for instance in Windows), having your strings as UTF-8 means you will have to convert all input to UTF-16, call the Win API, then convert the answer to UTF-8. Quite a pain. But if the main problem is the UI, the strings are the simple problem. The more difficult one is the UI framework. And for that I would recommend wxWidgets ( http://www.wxWidgets.org ). Supports many platforms, mature (17 years and still very active), native widgets, Unicode, liberal license.
