The violation of the normality in simple linear regression model

I ran simple linear regression models, however my model could not meet all the assumptions (e.g., the normality of the residuals, the homogeneity of the variance). I know that both are quite important to be meet if I want to run the simple linear regression model. I tried different kinds of transformations (e.g., square , log10 , BoxCox , so on), but none of them were successful. So, by searching/reading some literatures, I decided to focus on resolving the heteroscedasticity in the linear model with Robust Standard Errors . My question is that: After resolving the heteroscedasticity, is that ok for me to use the estimate , se , and CI from my model without paying any attentions on the normality. Thank you in advance!
