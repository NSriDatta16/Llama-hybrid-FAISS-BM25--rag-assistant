"Reinforcement Learning" means the result of the learning algorithm is a policy; a function that takes a set of inputs and returns a decision. "Supervised Learning", in contrast, learns a function that returns a prediction. They are different types of task. Multi-Layer Perceptron and Support Vector Machine are architectures i.e. forms for the learnt function in either case. There is no reason not to try different architectures on different tasks.
