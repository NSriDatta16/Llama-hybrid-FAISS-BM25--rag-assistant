This is a hierarchical model defined by the conditional distribution of the $X_i$ 's given $P$ and the marginal distribution of $P$ , represented by its density $p$ , as $\Pi=\Pi(p)$ . In a finite setting when the $X_i$ 's take values in a finite set $\mathfrak X$ , for instance $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ , $p$ is the probability mass function (pmf) represented by $(\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_k)$ where $$\sum_{j=1}^k \rho_j=1$$ and $X_i\sim p$ means that $$P(X_i=j)=\rho_j$$ Then, $p\sim \Pi$ signifies that the vector $(\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_k)$ is distributed as $\Pi$ , which is a distribution on the $k$ -dimensional simplex, for instance a Dirichlet distribution . The marginal distribution of the $n$ -sample is then $$\int \prod_{i=1}^n \rho_{x_i} \,\text d\Pi(\rho_1,\ldots,\rho_k)$$ and the $X_i$ 's are no longer independent (but exchangeable ). In a continuous setting when the $X_i$ 's take values in a continuous space like $\mathbb R^k$ and $p$ is, e.g., a density wrt the Lebesgue measure on that space, with no further constraint, the distribution on $p$ is then a probability distribution $\Pi$ over the set $\cal P$ of probability measures, i.e., a a family of stochastic processes whose realizations are probability distributions. An example of such distributions are the Dirichlet processes often found in Bayesian non-parametrics . Still within a continuous setting, if instead the family $\cal P$ of probability densities is chosen to be parameterised, for instance (when $\mathfrak X=\mathbb R$ ) the set of all Normal densities, $$\mathcal P=\{\text{N}(\mu,\sigma);\ \mu\in\mathbb R\,,\ \sigma\in\mathbb R^+\}$$ $\Pi$ is (the image of) a probability distribution over $\mathbb R\times\mathbb R^+$ . The marginal distribution of the $n$ -sample is then $$\int \frac{1}{(2\pi\sigma^2)^{n/2}}\exp\big\{-\sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\mu)^2/2\big\}\,\text{d}\Pi(\mu,\sigma)$$ and the $X_i$ 's are no longer independent (but exchangeable ).
