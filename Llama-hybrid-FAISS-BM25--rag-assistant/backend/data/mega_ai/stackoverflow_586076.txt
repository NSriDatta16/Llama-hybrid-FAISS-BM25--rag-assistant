Thanks for your answers and I find this isn't so complicated as I thought earlier. After a few attempts, I finally made it. I just use NavigationController to switch between UIViews. Now I understand that navigation controller can swith not only from UITableView to UIView, but also from UIView to UIView. Using a UIView class, I can organize all the controls easily in IB.
