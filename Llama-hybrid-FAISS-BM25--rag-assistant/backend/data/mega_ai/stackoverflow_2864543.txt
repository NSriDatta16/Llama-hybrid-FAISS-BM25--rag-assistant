After thinking about Graham's answer I came up with the following solution: I drag a new UIView (-> lets call it sub UIView) in Interface Builder in my main UIView I give this sub UIView the correct size (because I cannot resize the main UIView, which is always 320x460) I drag all my other elements in this sub UIView (so that all elements are attached to my sub UIView) I give my sub UIView a tag number (Interface Builder -> View Attributes), e.g. "300" In the code I do now the following within my -initWithFrame: NSArray *nibObjects = [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"CommentBox" owner:self options:nil]; UIView *subView = [[nibObjects objectAtIndex:0] viewWithTag:300]; [self addSubview:subView]; Hope that helps. Update: I just had another idea of doing it. Instead of the tag numbers you can also create a IBOutlet UIView *viewHolder in the CommentBox class and set the outlet in IB. Then in the initWithFrame: I do the following: [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadNibNamed:@"CommentBox" owner:self options:nil]; [self addSubview:self.viewHolder];
