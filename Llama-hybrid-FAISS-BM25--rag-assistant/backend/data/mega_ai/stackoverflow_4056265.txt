I seem to find solutions to these problems. It's not very elegant, but it works. The mcc compiler has the option " -a filename ". This option enables you to add the specified files for CTF archive. You want to add all the files that defines the enumeration using .NET Assemblies: Example for my case: mcc -B csharedlib:MyLib MyFunction -a OpenMode ...or in general: mcc -B csharedlib:MyLib MyFunction -a projectdir/*.m I have automated this with a build-script. This is so far the only solution that works.
