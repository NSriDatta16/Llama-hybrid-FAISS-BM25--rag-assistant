scikit-learn: SVR prediction output is constant

I am trying to make a regression with SVR and I found a problem in the process, the regression with random data is ok, but I tried it with my data, and with all of these three kernels the prediction's output is constant (see the plot). Here is a piece of my data, maybe the problem is here, but I cant'see why. data.csv 2006,46,97,97,0.04124 2006,47,97,97,0.06957 2006,48,115,97,0.06569 2006,49,137,115,0.05357 2006,50,112,137,0.04132 2006,51,121,112,0.06154 2006,52,130,121,0.02586 And here is the code I'm using. import pandas as pd from sklearn.svm import SVR import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np #Importing data data = pd.read_csv('data.csv') data = data.as_matrix() #Random data generator #datar = np.random.random_sample((7,21)) #inputdatar = datar[:,0:4] inputdata = data[:,0:4] output1 = data[:,4] svr_rbf = SVR(kernel='rbf',gamma=1) svr_rbf.fit(inputdata,output1) pre = svr_rbf.predict(inputdata) axis = range(0,data.shape[0]) plt.scatter(axis, output1, color='black', label='Data') plt.plot(axis, pre, color='red', label='Regression') plt.show() I think maybe it's hyperparameter tuning problem, but I'm not sure if the data would cause a problem as well. Any lights?
