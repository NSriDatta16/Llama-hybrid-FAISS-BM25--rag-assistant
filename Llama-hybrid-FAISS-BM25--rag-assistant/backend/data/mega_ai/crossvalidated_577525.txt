Artificially dichotomizing a continuous variable is generally agreed to lead to less power. However, if the only difference between the analyses is the continuous vs. binary variables (e.g., all the effect sizes are the same and the variances are the same) then there is hardly any difference. The example in McClelland & Judd, 1993 is weird because they make such sweeping statements, but in their simulated example the binary variables have an SD of 1, but the continuous variables have and SD of 0.5 (pg. 379, 3rd paragraph). So of course the continuous interaction is worse. They seem to have made this choice so that the range of the continuous and and binary variables is the same, without considering the implications of different standard deviations.
