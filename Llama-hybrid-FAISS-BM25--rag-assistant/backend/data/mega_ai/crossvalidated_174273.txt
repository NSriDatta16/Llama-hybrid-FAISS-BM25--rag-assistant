I don't quite get what you're doing (or why), but by training a model on the data and then using the weighted sum to train another model on the same data you're going to overfit - if you are tuning any parameters, you'll need to hold out some of your data and then assess performance against that holdout set. If all you're looking to do is get a single feature that represents the 30 you have, a good way to do so is PCA, and there are many different packages that allow you to do so. Since you're features are likely highly correlated, you should be able to capture a lot of the predictive power with just a few principal components.
