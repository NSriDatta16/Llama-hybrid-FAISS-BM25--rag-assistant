How to get the object with its translation using getRoute in Symfony?

I have several models with translations. When I load $this->tour = $this->getRoute()->getObject(); por example, it gets me the Tour Object. However, it doesn't join to the tour_translation table; so when after i try to get it's title; symfony makes another sql query. How I can override something, so in the Tour model when I ask for the object, it returns me the object with its translation in the current culture. I've been looking at the sfObjectRoute class to see if I can override any method, but I'm not sure right now I know I can do the following, but I prefer the first option as it's more transparent and elegant: $this->tour = Tour::getTour($request->getParameter('id'), $lang); thanks!
