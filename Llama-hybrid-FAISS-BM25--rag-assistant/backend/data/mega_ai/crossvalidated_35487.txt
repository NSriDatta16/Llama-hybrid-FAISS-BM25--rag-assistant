Distributions on the simplex with correlated components

I'm looking for some kind of distribution over the simplex in which components are correlated in an ordinal way. That is, if $p = (p_1, ..., p_J)$ is drawn from our distribution on the simplex, I would like $p_i$ to be positively correlated with its neighbours $p_{i + 1}$ and $p_{i - 1}$, say. A vanilla Dirichlet clearly cannot satisfy this requirement. One option I suppose is a mixture of Dirichlet distributions; for example, when $J = 4$ one could take $\mathcal D(1, 1, 0, 0) + \mathcal D(0, 1, 1, 0) + \mathcal D(0, 0, 1, 1)$ or something similar to induce correlation, but I'm wondering if there is something a little more natural. Another option I suppose is to take any distribution on $\{1, 2, ..., J\}$, say $f(j | \eta)$, put a distribution on $\eta$ take $p_j = f(j | \eta)$. So I could take, for example, $\eta \sim \mbox{Beta}(\alpha, \beta)$ and let $f(j | \eta) = {J \choose j} \eta^j (1 - \eta)^{J - j}$. At any rate, I'd like whatever I end up with to be as tractable as possible. The mixture of Dirichlet's is appealing because I could get some nice conditional conjugacy going for me, but it's not clear how to set things up. This question talks about the logistic normal distribution, but I don't know much about it; is it tractable for Bayesian inference? Of course, the components of a Dirichlet are already negatively correlated, and asking for "positive correlation" probably isn't totally coherent since if $p_i$ is large then it is, by nature, taking up most of the mass and hence forcing the probability of its neighbours to be small. Perhaps what I mean is that $p_i$ is positively correlated with $p_{i + 1} / \sum_{j \ne i} p_j$. Hopefully the question as stated is enough for people to know what I want and be able to help me.
