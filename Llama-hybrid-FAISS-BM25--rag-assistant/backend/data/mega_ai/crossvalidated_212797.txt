On the one hand, you can certainly use ts objects. Specify the season length through the frequency parameter: auto.arima(ts(data[,1],frequency=48)) However, electricity consumption usually has multiple seasonalities. You have the intra-day seasonality, but you will usually also have weekly seasonality, since weekends have different power consumption than weekdays - people are at home instead of at work, industrial production is reduced etc. Plus, there may be yearly seasonality, with air conditioners and heaters consuming a lot of electricity in summer/winter. Use msts objects to encode time series with multiple seasonalities: msts(data[,1],seasonal.periods=c(48,7*48)) You can then fit models with multiple seasonalities using tbats : tbats(msts(data[,1],seasonal.periods=c(48,7*48))) Both are again in the forecast package. You may want to look at earlier questions on "multiple seasonalities" .
