You don't remove the clear-text password when you hash the password. What you do is accept an input from the user, hash the input, and compare the hash of the input to the hash stored in the database. You should never store or send the plain-text password that the user has. That said, you can use the sha library as scrager said (pre-Python 2.5) and the hashlib library as David Raznick said in newer versions of Python.
