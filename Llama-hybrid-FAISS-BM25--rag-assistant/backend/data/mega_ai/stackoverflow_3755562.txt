Good Strategy for sharing project dependencies/resources across multiple projects/boxes/developers?

I work in a small developing team with 3 developers and none of us are really 'uber elite programmers' but we get by pretty well for our company. One thing that has been constantly recurring is we keep using the same resources in multiple projects. One example being the fckeditor control, however it stinks to constantly add this folder to every project (I've got the control set-up in my toolbox, but it won't be able to find the code unless you have the folder in there). This also applies with constantly recurring master pages and controls. Now we have made some steps for improving this, including making a 'back end' project where we put our shared functions, and made a CDN for images and scripts. But I still run into issues. For instance all developers must make sure they have the latest version of the back end project checked out, and built. Also when you add a reference to that .dll, the paths have to be the same between developers, otherwise it breaks the reference. Now I just found out you can add a project reference, which will make the back end project build anytime I build the front-end project, but again you still have to make sure you have the latest version checked out. But I wonder what else I could do? Things I find annoying are making sure the relative locations of the back end project to the front end project has to be the same, and making sure they have the latest version of the back end checked out. Are there better ways to do this? Also the back-end project is a class library, but how can I share resources like a user control? I tried putting a user control in a normal project, and then adding that project as a reference, but it doesn't give you access to the control in the file list like I am used to for dragging into a page. Edit: Using VisualSVN 2.0 and Visual Studio 2010
