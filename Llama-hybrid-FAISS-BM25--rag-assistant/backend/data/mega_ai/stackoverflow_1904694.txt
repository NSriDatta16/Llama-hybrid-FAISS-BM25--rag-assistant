Moving Files To Amazon S3 While Keeping URLs

I'm in a bit of a pickle here. I currently have a website hosted in a shared hosting environment by a third party hosting provider. As such, I do not have root access to the IIS server that this website is on. I currently have a directory on the site, such as: mysite.com/myfiles The "myfiles" directory currently has a lot of files in it. So many files that it is putting me over the disk space allotment at my host. There are a couple things to now consider: The host does not have a more generous plan for us to upgrade to. They are only willing to charge us (very high) overage fees. We need to remain with this host until the end of our contract with them, which is almost a year away. I would like to take the contents of this directory and put it on Amazon S3, which would relieve the disk space strain on the hosting account. The only issue is that the URL's to the files need to remain the same! So for instance, if an external website links to mysite.com/myfiles/image.jpg, I want the image on that site to continue working without a hitch. Is there any possible way to achieve this?
