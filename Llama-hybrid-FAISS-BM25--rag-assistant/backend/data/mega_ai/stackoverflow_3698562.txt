Deploying my Japplet in Netbeans

I'm banging my head against the wall trying to figure this out. I'm using NetBeans 6.9.1 and I have a project of type "Java Application." This project contains no Main method, but instead a Japplet named AlarmClock.java. When I right-click and run AlarmClock.java, it runs correctly with no problems. What I can't figure out is how to get this applet to run on a website (or even locally on my computer for that matter). I've tried building it and opening up ProjectDirectory /dist/launch.html which starts up launch.JNLP which opens up a webpage with a space for my applet, but this space just contains an error message. I'm not sure if it's something wrong with my project settings, and I don't know what a "codebase" is or whether "Web Start" should be on. Do I need a main method that opens up my applet, and how would I do that? Some advice would be hugely appreciated.
