That particular error message has a lot of possible reasons for it to be generated. You might want to review this thread on msdn forums for possible solutions. What it boils down to is that you are using SQL Server Express and the user the web service is executing under has run into a problem. I would guess that problem might be that it is unable to copy the system databases to the local user storage folders. The reason for failure seems to be that you have 2 different applications running under the same user but most likely deployed to two different IIS locations. The first one successfully copies the databases over, the second one fails because the files already exist at that location. If that's true then you have a couple options. One would be to merge the web service and web application projects that way they are running under the same App instance. Another would be to dump SQL Server Express and move to a more centralized version of SQL server... A third would be to set up each app to run under different users: ASPNET for the first one and something completely different for the other. However, I don't think this will accomplish what you want. FYI - SQL Express is purposely not set up to handle this type of configuration. Let me know if I've made a couple incorrect assumptions. We all know how those go. ;)
