If I understand you correctly, you have a vector of numbers $[0, 1, 2,\ldots,M - 1, M]$ with probabilities of seeing each of those value, all of whom sum to 1. You want to find a mixture of $N$ gamma distributions to represent the discrete probability mass function. That being said, what may be the simplest thing to do is to minimize the distance (e.g. squared error) between the empirical discrete PMF and the mixed continuous PMF at that point. You can "estimate" the mixed continuous PMF at $n$ as the average of the mixed continuous CDF at $n - 0.5$ and $n + 0.5$ with the data point at 0 being estimated as value at $0.5$. Here is an R function example for a mixture of two gammas which assumes that the parameters are passed to it as a list of 5 values ($p, \alpha_1, \theta_1, \alpha_2, \theta_2$) and the Data is a dataframe or matrix of size $M$X$2$ with the PMF. It converges rather slowly, but as you're estimating mixtures anyway, it may get you close to what you want. Dist Pass that into an optimzer like nloptr and let it rip.
