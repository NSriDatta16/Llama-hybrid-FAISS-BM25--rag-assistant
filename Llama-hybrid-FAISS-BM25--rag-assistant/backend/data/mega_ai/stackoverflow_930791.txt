AS3 Project - Mouse Move Listener Reacting Outside of Application

I'm getting an unusual behavior that I can't seem to get to the bottom of. When I run this, if I move in the swf area it traces normally on mouse move. To be expected. But it's tracing for the move event when I click anywhere on screen. If I click and drag, it traces as if I were moving in the swf area of the browser. Here's the code. I've simplified to it's barebones. Just put this in in an empty AS3 project in Flex called "Engine" - sans quotes obviously. package { import flash.display.Sprite; import flash.events.MouseEvent; [SWF(width='640', height='360', backgroundColor='#888888', frameRate='31')] public class Engine extends Sprite { public function Engine() { // Add the mouse handlers stage.addEventListener(MouseEvent.MOUSE_MOVE, mouseMoveHandler); } public function mouseMoveHandler(evt:MouseEvent):void { trace("move"); } } } As a workaround I've add the MOUSE_MOVE one MOUSE_OVER and remove it on MOUSE_OUT. But the behavior still seems quite unusual and I'd be interest in understanding why it's happening. Can anyone tell me how I can keep the events constrained to the actual stage of the application?
