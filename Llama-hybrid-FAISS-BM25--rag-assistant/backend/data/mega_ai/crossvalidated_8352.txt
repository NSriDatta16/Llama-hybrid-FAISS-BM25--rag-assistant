What is the proper ratio of mean squares for a two-level nested ANOVA?

I would like to analyse the following type of experiment using a two-level fully nested ANOVA. We have mice of two genotypes (Group factor) and for each of the genotypes we take a certain number of mice (sub-groups) and measure several identical samples per each mouse. Thus it looks like a classic two-level nested design with Genotype and Mice as fixed factors. I am interested in the main group effect of the genotype on the measurement outcome. I used Statistica where F-value is calculated by the ratio of $\text{MS}_\text{group}/\text{MS}_\text{residual}$. However, I found several references on the web suggesting that it is better to calculate F-value from the ratio of $\text{MS}_\text{group}/\text{MS}_\text{sub-group}$. For example, on John McDonald's web page : In a two-level nested anova, there are two F statistics, one for subgroups (Fsubgroup) and one for groups (Fgroup). The subgroup F-statistic is found by dividing the among-subgroup mean square, MSsubgroup (the average variance of subgroup means within each group) by the within-subgroup mean square, MSwithin (the average variation among individual measurements within each subgroup). The group F-statistic is found by dividing the among-group mean square, MSgroup (the variation among group means) by MSsubgroup. The P-value is then calculated for the F-statistic at each level... On the same web page, he comments that in Rweb: Fgroup is calculated as MSgroup/MSwithin, which is not a good idea if Fsubgroup is significant. In my analysis, if there was a significant Group (Genotype) effect calculated as $\text{MS}_\text{group}/\text{MS}_\text{residual}$, I didn't observe a significant effect of sub-groups (Mice). Does it mean that I can use $\text{MS}_\text{group}/\text{MS}_\text{residual}$ ratio for estimating the F-value?
