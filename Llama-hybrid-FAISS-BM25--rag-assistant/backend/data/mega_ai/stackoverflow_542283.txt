Well you don't need SQL Server Agent running now, the error suggest you are getting a timeout from the scenario. There are various reasons why you may be blocked. Perhaps the firewall is configured to allow only a certain number of connections at a port at one time. Or the database itself is limiting the number of connections. Your internet is slow and you are hitting the 120 seconds timeout. The list goes on. :)
