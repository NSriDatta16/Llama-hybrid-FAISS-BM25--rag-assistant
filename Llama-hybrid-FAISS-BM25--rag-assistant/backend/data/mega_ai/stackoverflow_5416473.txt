Question about parsing text manipulation approach

I need to parse a long file in Java and output the results to another file. Since I need to average across several items, and I need to parse the file to find them, I need to store in memory the current averaged item before to output it to the results file on disk. Is this approach ok, or am I going to have low performances with a million items file ? Update : the point here is that each output item can be updated at any time while computation, since I might average an item in the beginning and in the end. So I cannot release it, and write on disk, I guess. thanks
