How to create group variable for a regression problem

I have a small dataset with 800 observations. In this dataset there are some variables (i.e. age , annual income ) composed of several different entries. Due to that, I would like to create groups for a regression problem. After that, I will perform a multilinear regression and also a random forest regression The question is simply: How can I create the groups? I do not want to create the groups in any arbitrary way but I do not know which should be the correct approach
