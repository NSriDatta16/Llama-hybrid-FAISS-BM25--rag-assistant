Bayesian random effects

$\newcommand{\N}{\operatorname{N}}$$\newcommand{\IG}{\operatorname{IG}}$My understanding of bayesian random effects (I understand that this concept is a frequentist one, but I use it for simplicity) is that one could write down the following model: $$Y_{ij} = X_{ij}\beta + Z_{ij}\alpha_{i} + \varepsilon_{ij} \,,$$ with: $$\begin{array}{rcl} \varepsilon_{ij} & \sim & \N(0, \sigma^2) \,, \\ \sigma^2 & \sim & \IG(\frac{\nu}{2},\frac{\nu}{2})\,, \\ \beta & \sim & \N(\beta_0, \Sigma_0)\,, \end{array} \quad\quad \begin{array}{rcl} \alpha_i & \sim & \N(0, \tau)\,, \\ \tau & \sim & \IG(\alpha_0, \beta_0) \,, \end{array}$$ where $X_{ij}\beta$ is the "fixed effect" and $Z_{ij}\alpha_{i}$ is the "random effect". But $\sigma^2$ is the "within-group variance". And I believe $\tau$ is the "between-group variance". That setup doesn't make intuitive sense to me though. Is it incorrect? What do we call $\Sigma_0$? Can someone explain how the between/within group variability corresponds to the fixed and random effects?
