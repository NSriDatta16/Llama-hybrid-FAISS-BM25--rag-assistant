Java code coverage in Hudson

I'm migrating a couple of projects from an ant build to a maven one. The build server is , and will remain, Hudson. I've been having trouble recording code coverage in hudson with cobertura due to the tests run and recorded twice problem . The project is multi-module and it would be nice, although not required, to have an aggregated output of the code coverage data. All in all, the solution I'm looking for must: run automated tests for all modules and record the results once ; display the individual module code coverage in Hudson ; be easily configured once for the whole project , not in every module. The solution can be based on Cobertura, or Emma, or any other java code coverage tool. Update : Running the tests with Emma still duplicates the results and there's no merge capability, so it's not really usable with multi-module builds.
