Using FUNCTIONs might leverage maintainability... and hopefully (in the near future) it might boost performance too. SELECT ... stock_shortfall(required_stock, current_stock), stock_shortfall_cost(required_stock, current_stock, unit_cost) ... Those two functions should be marked as DETERMINISTIC . In MySql 5.0 that characteristic was not used by the optimizer. I don’t know if later versions already use it (so the “near future” reference). Of course, simple single-used calculations rarely deserve the CREATE FUNCTION... typing overhead.
