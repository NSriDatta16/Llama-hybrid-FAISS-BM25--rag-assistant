In our family of RDF storage engines we attack this problem by doing content negotiation. That is, we check the Accept line in the HTTP request headers, and adjust our behaviour accordingly. If the Accept line mentions any RDF flavours, or the SPARQL results MIME type explicitly, then we send back the appropriate Content-type and associated response. This serves dedicated SPARQL clients, hand-rolled code and various RDF "browser" tools very well in our experience. But for a typical web browser the Accept line just lists HTML and a few image formats, and our HTTP daemon sets the Content-type to text/plain (or for a blank SPARQL query, text/html, with the response body being a web page with a form for writing manual queries from a web browser for testing) Finally if the Accept header is missing altogether we know it's a very naive piece of software, most likely someone's Perl script or something, and we have a special case for that to make people's lives easier when developing against the storage engine.
