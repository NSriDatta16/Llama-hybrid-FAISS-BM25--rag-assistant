Limits of Javascript on the implementation of AI algorithms

I have a basic understanding of javascript, and know hardly any other programming language. Am I bound to face some issues in the field of neural networks and machine learning because of this? Should I learn something else for the sake of avoiding some inherent weaknesses of the language? I am most worried about the capacity of javascript to handle data, rather than its possibilities regarding the textual implementation of the algorithms per se... Thank you
