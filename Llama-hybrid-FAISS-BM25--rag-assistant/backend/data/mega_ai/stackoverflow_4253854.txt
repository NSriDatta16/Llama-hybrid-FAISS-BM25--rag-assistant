The simple_format method is good for formatting line breaks. It wraps text blocks in tags, and converts newline characters into line breaks ( ) (double newlines breaks the following text into a second paragraph). It doesn't however escape other html characters, and instead just allows them. For what you're after a combination of simple_format along with sanitize should do nicely. Try using this: %w(br p) ) %>
