Analyzing time series

I am trying to help out a friend of mine on her assignment. As far as I understand she needs to find and analyze the trend of a time series data. Her notes are a mess so it is hard to find any material on what should I look for. To find a trend I need to use a regression on the graph obtained and find the function expression. However, I don't understand if I should mention the function expression in the analysis. Or should I keep it at the increasing/decreasing type of description? What else do I include in the description of the trend? Any links to notes or maybe material related to that would be appreciated.
