how do you organize your model code in asp.net-mvc?

it seems like in my model folder, all of my classes fits into one of 3 buckets: Pure POCO data objects / business Objects Repository implementation code to query databases and external services Helper code. Is this normal and is there a best practices on how to organize this. should i have subfolders for 1, 2 + 3? any recommendations?
