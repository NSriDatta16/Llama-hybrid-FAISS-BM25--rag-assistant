How to get rid of xmlns="" (no-namespace) attribute in XSLT output

Here is my (simplified for this case scenario) XML: Mr. Title This is one paragraph. Another paragraph. And here is my XSLT: The output produces this: Mr. Title This is one paragraph. Another paragraph. which is great, except for the xmlns="" in the segment element, that seems to be defining no namespace for itself and all of its children. How can I make it not add this? Sidenote: I have also tried transforming the first node with instead, but it produces the same effect. Thanks helpful people!
