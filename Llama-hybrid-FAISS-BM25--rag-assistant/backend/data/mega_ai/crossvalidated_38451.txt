I do not see much appeal in this example, esp. as a potential criticism of Bayesians and likelihood-wallahs.... The constant $c$ is known, being equal to $$ 1\big/ \int_\mathcal{X} g(x) \text{d}x $$ If $c$ is the only "unknown" in the picture, given a sample $x_1,\ldots,x_n$, then there is no statistical issue about the problem and I do not agree that there exist estimators of $c$. Nor priors on $c$ (other than the Dirac mass on the above value). This is not in the least a statistical problem but rather a numerical issue. That the sample $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ can be used through a (frequentist) density estimate to provide a numerical approximation of $c$ is a mere curiosity. Not a criticism of alternative statistical approaches: I could also use a Bayesian density estimate...
