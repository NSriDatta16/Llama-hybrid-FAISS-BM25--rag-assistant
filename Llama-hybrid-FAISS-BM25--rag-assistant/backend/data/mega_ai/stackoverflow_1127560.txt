There is no definitive choice you should make, but it's worth noting that changing to client-side AJAX controls is a pretty big paradigm shift that will require you to rethink how you do nearly everything with the grid. Going half-way (by using a server-side control such as GridView in an UpdatePanel ) will likely improve the user experience, since the page will still be visible and responsive while it's updating. But the UpdatePanel -style is still clunky compared to the new client-only grids, because this technique sends all the page's form data when it posts back (including all that ViewState in the GridView , if ViewState is turned on). One brief note of caution: GridView is not compatible with UpdatePanel when GridView.EnableSortingAndPagingCallbacks is set to true. I haven't used any of they hybrid implementations (such as Coolite's Ext wrappers for .NET), but they are out there. There was at least one good SO discussion about this topic and the different grids available here .
