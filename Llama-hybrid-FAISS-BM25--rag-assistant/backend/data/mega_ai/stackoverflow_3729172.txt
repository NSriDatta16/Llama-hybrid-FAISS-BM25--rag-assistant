HTML: How common is it that different browsers render 1em at a different actual px size?

As you know, you can specify dimensions with CSS in px or em. As far as I understand it, em means "line height of the current element's fonts". My approach currently is to always use px (also for margin which seems to be a controversial practice). Question: Can I rely on the ratio of px and em to be the same across browsers ? If not, then my manually specified margins between paragraphs will likely look odd because they so not match 1em anymore. I believe that it is better to use em for margins but I have quite a base of existing code that always uses px margins.
