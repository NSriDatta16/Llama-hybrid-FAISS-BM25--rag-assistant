How to set SQL Server 2005 Job CmdExec Timeout

I have a job setup in SQL Server 2005 which has an Operating System (CmdExec) step. The step calls a program which can take a long time to run. I see that if the program takes longer than 1 minute 40 seconds to respond the step fails with an error message "The operation has timed out". The program actually continues to run and generates the desired results. How can I set the timeout period for the step in this job. Alternatively if there is a way to set the timeout for the entire job that would be just as useful since this is the only step in the job. If all else fails I would be willing to change the timeout for the entire server although obviously this would be a last resort. I have tried looking into the properties for the step, job, and SQL Server Agent but have not managed to find anywhere to set this option.
