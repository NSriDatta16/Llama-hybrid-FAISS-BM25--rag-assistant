Any good book on logistic regression will have this, although perhaps not in exactly those words. Try Agresti's Categorical Data Analysis for a very authoritative source. It also follows from the definition of logistic regression (or other regressions). There are few methods explicitly for ordinal independent variables. The usual options are treating it as categorical (which loses the order) or as continuous (which makes the assumption stated in what you quoted). If you treat it as continuous then the program doing the analysis doesn't know it's ordinal. E.g. suppose your IV is "How much do you like President Obama?" and your answer choices are a Likert scale from 1. "Very much" to 5. "Not at all". If you treat this as continuous then (from the program's point of view) a "5" answer is 5 times a "1" answer. This may or may not be unreasonable.
