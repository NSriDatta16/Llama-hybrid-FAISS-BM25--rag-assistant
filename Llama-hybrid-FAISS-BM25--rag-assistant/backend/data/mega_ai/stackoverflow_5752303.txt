One thing you can do to tighten the existing code as-is: There is a space beneath the and above the dropdown . Where you have it set to "top" : "42px" , it's creating a gap that doesn't have the hover event attached, so it makes the dropdown "shake" as it tries to hide/appear simultaneously. Instead of setting the top property, just change it to padding-top in each instance. It makes it a lot smoother and more "hoverable". http://jsfiddle.net/Madmartigan/6cAaN/8/
