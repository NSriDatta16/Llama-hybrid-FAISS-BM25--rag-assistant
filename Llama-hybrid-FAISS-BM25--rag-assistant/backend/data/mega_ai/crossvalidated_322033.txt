How to minimize distortion in time series visualization of commodity prices?

I'm building a product that has amongst other features a visualization of commodity prices for a set of futures contracts. The problem I'm having is we're using a pretty naive technique to visualize this time series, we simply take max and min values of the time period considered and add a 20% on top and bottom to train the Y scale. The result of doing this is changes of 0.01 can look identical to changes of 1 at first when changing time periods. Is there a better way to do this without making the charts unreadable?
