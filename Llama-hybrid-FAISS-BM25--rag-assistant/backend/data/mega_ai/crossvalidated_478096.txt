Take this following case for example: You want to know men's average height in the U.S. How could you proceed with this problem? In an ideal situation, if you had unlimited time and energy, you can certainly collect the statistics from different resources and compiled them together to figure out the " undisputed truth " behind the scene, which, from statistician's point of view, often referred the population mean, or the expectation of a random variable $X$ , denoted as $E(X)$ , where $X$ represents men's height in the case. Yet we are mortals with flesh so vulnerable to time, disease, and accidents, we only have limited time to do our job and find out the truth. The best thing we can do is to take a sample of our interest $x_1,x_2,\ldots$ , then infer the truth from the imperfect mimic of undisputed truth $E(X)$ . Besides that, the imperfect term has several interpretations: 1 The samples collected are prone to measurement errors, which may lead to a biased estimate of $E(X)$ . 2 The samples surveyed might be not representative of entire population, which may drastically diverge from $E(X)$ . A very good analogy is to think of you sitting in front of a table, trying to figure out the contents in the Jigsaw puzzle. Suppose the number of pieces is infinite, of course you can't assemble each individual to fulfill your task, what the best can you do? If you picked up a bunch of pieces from central parts, you are very likely to get a rough estimate of the contents in a few attempts. What if you unfortunately picked the pieces from the corner sides? They are still the same shape, the same weight as the central pieces, but they are unrepresentative of the object in the picture. Beyond that, the central pieces collected is subject to your choice, which can sometimes lead to a biased estimate of " true " contents underlying in the picture. In summary, statistical inference is the field of study that allows us to infer the undisputed truth from its representative part in a scientific, rigorous way.
