How to Generate Combinations of Elements of a List in .NET 4.0

I have a question that is similar, but not identical, to the one answered here. I would like a function generate all of the k -combinations of elements from a List of n elements. Note that I am looking for combinations, not permutations, and that we need a solution for varying k (i.e., hard-coding the loops is a no-no). I am looking for a solution that is a) elegant, and b) can be coded in VB10/.Net 4.0. This means a) solutions requiring LINQ are ok, b) those using the C# "yield" command are not. The order of the combinations is not important (i.e., lexicographical, Gray-code, what-have-you) and elegance is favored over performance, if the two are in conflict. (The OCaml and C# solutions here would be perfect, if they could be coded in VB10.)
