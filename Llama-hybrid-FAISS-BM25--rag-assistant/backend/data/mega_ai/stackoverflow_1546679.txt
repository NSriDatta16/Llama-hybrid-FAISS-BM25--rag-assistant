Using a parser generator for your host language is the fastest way, combined with parsing theory from a book such as the Dragon Book or the Modern Compiler Construction in {C,ML} series. If you use C, yacc and the GNU version bison are the standard generators. Antlr is widely used in many languages, supporting Java, C#, and C++ as far as I know. There are also many others in almost any language. My personal favorite at present is Menhir , an excellent parser generator for OCaml. ML-style languages (Ocaml, Standard ML, etc.) dialects in general are very good for building compilers and interpreters.
