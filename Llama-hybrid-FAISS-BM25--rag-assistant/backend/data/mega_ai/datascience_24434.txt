I am going to diverge a little bit and argue that calculation confidence interval is in practice is usually not a valuable thing to do. The reason is there is always a whole bunch of assumptions you need to make. Even for the simplest linear regression, you need to have Linear relationship. Multivariate normality. No or little multicollinearity. No auto-correlation. Homoscedasticity. A much more pragmatic approach is to do a Monte Carlo simulation. If you already know or willing to make of assumption around the distribution of your input variables, take a whole bunch of sample and feed it to you LSTM, now you can empirically calculate your "confidence interval".
