problem with subsubsection title

Suddenly in my document all definitions of \subsubsection*{Title Text} stopped working properly. The subsubsection number is displayed in the generated PDF and the title of the subsubsection is "*" (only the asterisk). The actual title text is displayed at the beginning of the first paragraph. Excact code: \subsubsection*{Failure Semantics} I'm not sure what happened. I only remember fixing some broken references... Cleaning the output folder didn't help. Any ideas? Thanks in advance. bja
