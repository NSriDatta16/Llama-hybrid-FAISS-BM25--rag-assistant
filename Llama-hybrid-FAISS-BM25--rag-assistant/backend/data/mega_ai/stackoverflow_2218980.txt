template over rides are stored in the templates folder. so if you are using teh template called "beez" (comes stock standard) the template overides are in : templates/beez/html/ they are then stored under the module or component name. eg the article layout for com_content is stored in: templates/beez/html/com_content/article/default.php the template is usualy called default.php, but each component and module can have a few extra templates that they use as well as deafult.php Now you are asking to change the "user" view for com_user when editing I think that location is: templates/beez/html/com_user/user/form.php if you ever want to find the origanal template which is to be overridden in this case: template that would be in: /components/com_user/views/user/tmpl/form.php so in general templates/templatename/component_name/view_name/template_filename.php
