Packaging an application that uses the ImageMagick C API

I've created a little Windows app that uses the ImageMagick C API but have run into a bit of a brick wall. The app works fine and I'm ready to share it with a few others in our organisation but I can't find documentation on distributing such an app without installing ImageMagick on the target machine. Does anyone here have information, or a link to information, that details how to package this up for distribution? What DLLs are required and which one(s) need to registered with Windows? The target users will be on a mix of XP and Win7.
