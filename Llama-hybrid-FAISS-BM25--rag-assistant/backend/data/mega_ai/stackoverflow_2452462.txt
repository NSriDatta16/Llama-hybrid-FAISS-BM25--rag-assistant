Infragistics Webgrid (Datagrid) dynamic adjusting columns

I want to explain this as best as I can. I have a Webgrid with a certain amount of columns. What I want is for the columns to adjust to the size of the largest string within each column, where the total of all width of columns does not exceed the width of the webgrid. At the same time however if the width of all columns is less than the width of the webgrid I want each column to adjust proportionately so that the total of columns widths equal the width of the webgrid. Example: grid width = 100 On Initial Data Load: col1 max width = 25 col2 max width = 35 col3 max width = 20 col total = 80 still 20(meas) left in the grid. After all loading without manually setting column widths: col total needs to = 100 Can anyone help me with this logic?
