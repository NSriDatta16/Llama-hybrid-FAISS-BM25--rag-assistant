SVN/TortoiseSVN painfully slow

I'm experiencing painfully slow operations with one of our SVN repositories/projects. For example, it's taking 5-10 minutes to revert the changes in one small file (10 KB). Or about 40-60 minutes to check out the project of 100 MB. There are about 30 other projects on the same server, some vastly bigger than this one, and none of them preform like this. One thing to note is that this project is a Magento project. It's not very large in terms of disk space, but I have 23k Files and 11k folders, and I have read SVN preforms badly when there are lots of little files; is this true? And is there anything I can do to speed things up?
