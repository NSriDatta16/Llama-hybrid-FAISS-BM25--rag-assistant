Posterior Function of Bayesian Instrumental Variable Model

How does the posterior of a Bayesian Instrumental variable model look like? I am aware that the Posterior $ \propto $ Likelihood * Priors. But I am not sure how the Posterior function looks like for an Instrumental variable model. For eg, for a linear regression model ($Y = X \beta + \epsilon$), we have: Posterior $\propto$ [Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_linear_regression] How would the Posterior change in the presence of an instrumental variable? Say for example one independent variable $x_i$ is endogenous. and is given by the following equation: $x_i$ = $Z_i \gamma + \nu$ where $\epsilon$ and $\nu$ are error terms, $X$ is a set of independent variables, $Z$ is an instrumental variable and $\beta$ and $\gamma$ are unobserved coefficients to be estimated. It would be very helpful if you could point me to an appropriate resource. Thanks in advance. Follow up question: Following Professor Hanck's comment I looked up Greenberg Edn 1. On Pg 174, I see that the Likelihood function (assuming $x_is$ and $Y$ is MVN ) is written as: Now what would happen if Y is not normal (for example: Poisson or logit). Would the likelihood function look this: (Eq 1) Or this: (Eq 2) Thank you once again for your help.
