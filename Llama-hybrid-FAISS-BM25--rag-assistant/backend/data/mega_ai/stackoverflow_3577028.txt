Without any code, it's hard to help out. Some ideas: Profile the Java app on both systems, and see where the difference is. You might be surprised. Because the T1 CPU lacks out-of-order execution, you might see performance lacking in strange areas. As Erick Robertson says, try bumping up the number of threads to the number of virtual cores reported via prstat , NOT the number of regular cores. The T1000 uses UltraSparc T1 processors, which make heavy use of thread-level parallelism . Also, note that you're using the latest-gen Intel processors and old Sun ones . I highly recommend reading Developing and Tuning Applications on UltraSPARC T1 Chip Multithreading Systems and Maximizing Application Performance on Chip Multithreading (CMT) Architectures , both by Sun.
