Can EF4.1 Code First express simultaneous 1-1 and 1-many to same table?

The high level problem: I'd like speed lookup on table I have a 1-many relationship to. I've got a large log-like table with a foreign key to an employee table. I'd like to have a relation from the employee table to the most recent log entry (for that employee) as well as the regular Collection of many log entries. I could use only the one to many and just query on last timestamp and employee Id on the logfile, but I'd prefer a direct pointer. Is it possible to do something like this with Annotations? public class TagEntry { public int TagEntryId { get; set; } public int TagId { get; set; } public DateTime LogTime { get; set; } public string log { get; set; } public virtual Tag tag { get; set; } } public class Tag { public int TagId { get; set; } public TagEntry CurrentTagEntry { get; set; } public int TagEntryId { get; set; } public string someTagData { get; set; } public virtual ICollection TagEntries { get; set; } } One solution would just be to store a integer currentTagEntryId, but ideally I'd like to reference the Log with tag.CurrentTagEntry.log type notation.
