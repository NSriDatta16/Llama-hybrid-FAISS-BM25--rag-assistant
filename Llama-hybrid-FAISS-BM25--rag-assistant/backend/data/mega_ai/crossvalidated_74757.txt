The maximum by which X1 can increase is 0.30-0.001. Following your explanation, if I want to compare the max. value with the lowest value, does this mean that the average log(y) increases by 1.5/100 * 0.3-0.001, i.e. around 45%? No, because the simple way of multiplying the coefficient by 100 and then interpreting as a factorial change only works when both the coefficient and the change in the independent variable are relatively small. Consider the equation: $\ln(y) = \alpha + 1.5X_1 + 0.8 X_2$ With one percent point increase: $\ln(y') = \alpha + 1.5(X_1+0.01) + 0.8 X_2$ Subtracting for the difference: $\ln(y') - \ln(y) = 1.5 \times 0.01$ $\ln(y'/y) = 0.015$ The factorial change is then: $y'/y = 1.015113$, which is about 1.5%. So, that approximation shortcut works. When the change is large, like your 0.299, the approximation can deviate: $\ln(y'/y) = 1.5 \times 0.299$ The factorial change is then: $y'/y = 1.565961$, about 56.6% larger instead of the approximated 45%.
