Assuming you're trying to modify the order of your shortcuts on the Start Menu, I'm not sure this is possible to do programatically (which is a shame - I've fired up the uninstallers for many apps in Vista/7 by typing their names and just hitting without looking!). Microsoft's Raymond Chen posted this on his blog some time ago: The classic Start menu and the "All Programs" portion of the Windows XP Start menu permit you to customize the order of the shortcuts that appear there. You can use drag/drop to rearrange them, or force them to be sorted by name. But why is there no programmatic interface to these actions? Because the power would be used for evil far more than it would be used for good. More info here: http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/19/636823.aspx
