Division of two values that are represented as MEAN+/-STDEV

Look at the article here ( https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1618464/ ) (I am not sure if you have access to the full article, if not, let me know so that I can find a way to share it). Basically, they measured the blood flow through liver (liter/min) as well as total cardiac output (liter/min) for a population of 178 subjects. So, the mean+/-SD for the liver blood flow for the entire population is reported to be 1.65+/-0.069 liter/min. For the cardiac output, the mean+/-SD for the same population is 8.5+/-0.2 liter/min. Now I need to know the liver comprises what percent of the cardiac output in this population. I need this result to be presented in the form of mean+/-SD. Thanks Full Citation: Paulsen, A.
