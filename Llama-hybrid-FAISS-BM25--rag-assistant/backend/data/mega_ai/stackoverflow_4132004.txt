Never. You should organize yourself so that classes have the same serialVersionUID for their entire lifetime. You should (a) resist serialization-incompatible changes to the class; (b) write your own readObject()/writeObject()/readResolve()/writeReplace() objects so as to preserve the initial serialization format, and define an explicit serialVersionUID right at the beginning of the class's lifetime. The instant you change this value you have an enormous headache on your hands. Plan to avoid it.
