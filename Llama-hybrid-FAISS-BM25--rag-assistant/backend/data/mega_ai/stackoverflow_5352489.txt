How to detect whether page is scrolled or not in ScrollView?

I have an ScrollView for display PDF Pages. When I scroll the this shows me the second Page with paging enabled in ScrollView. I set the bounce property false for Scrolling. I want to display page number that which page is being Displayed. For that I am had used following code.. - (void)scrollViewDidEndDragging:(UIScrollView *)scrollView willDecelerate:(BOOL)decelerate { if (scrollView == scrlView) { if (lastContentOffsetX > scrollView.contentOffset.x) { if (currentPage > 1) { currentPage--; self.title = [NSString stringWithFormat:@"%d/%d", currentPage, totalPages]; } } else if (lastContentOffsetX I don't have any problem if every time I drag and the page changes. Some time I drag a very little time and the page doesn't change and remain the same. My page number get Increased/decreased. Can Any body tell me if I can get any event when ScrollView Stops Scrolling I can get the current offset and complete my task.
