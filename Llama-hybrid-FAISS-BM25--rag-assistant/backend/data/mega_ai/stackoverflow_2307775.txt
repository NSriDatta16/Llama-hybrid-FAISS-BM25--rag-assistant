Color has the properties R, G, and B . You can take your input value, divide it by 100 to get the bottom color (clipping it at 3). Add one to that to get the top color. Then grab R, G, and B from the bottom and top colors, create a weighted average of each based on value % 100, and make a new Color with those values.
