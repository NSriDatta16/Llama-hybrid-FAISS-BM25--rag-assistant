Presuming each sublist consists of individual strings of the form a=b : >>> [el[i].split('=') for el in li for i in range(len(el))] [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']] (Indeed, what you're splitting is the inner string a=b . So the split() string method works fine.) EDIT : A much more elegant way of doing this double list comprehension is: >>> [a.split('=') for el in li for a in el] [['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd']] There have been a number of good suggestions made, so the OP should be able to learn a good amount of Python for it. Important to remember is that what is being split is li[i][j], ie an item of the list that is an item of the list li.
