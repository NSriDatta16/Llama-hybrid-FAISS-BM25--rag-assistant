Here is a plot of your time series: We note that the beginning of the series obviously behaves very differently from later parts. In addition, there are three large spikes during the last year, i.e., during your test period. No time series forecasting algorithm will forecast spikes like the last three ones by itself. I would recommend that you investigate what caused these three spikes and include this information in your forecasts. This is far more important than finding a "better" ARIMA model.
