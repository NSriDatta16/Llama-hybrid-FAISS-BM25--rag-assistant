I would go for the ArrayList version too, so I don't need to worry about growing it. Do you need to have a column like access to values? What is your scenario behind your question? Edit You could also use a common long[][] matrix. I don't know how you pass the columns to Matlab, but I guess you don't gain much speed with a column based storage, more likely you loose speed in the java computation.
