Multi-Seasonal Time Series function in Python

I am wondering if Python has any implementations of Multi-Seasonal Time Series like msts method in forecast library under R. So far, I have found only following packages for Time Series in Python: FBprophet TSFresh (feature engineering for TS) PyFlux Statsmodels TStoolbox timeseries ( https://github.com/sealevelresearch/timeseries ) Pandas (partially) However, none of them contains approach that I am looking for. Please advice.
