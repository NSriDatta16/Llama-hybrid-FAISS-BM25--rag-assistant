Issue using LIKE in a SQL query with special characters in it

SELECT id, absolute_tag, tag FROM c7_storage_tags WHERE users_id = 1 AND LOWER(absolute_tag) LIKE LOWER('@#Pictures#zee\'s fav%') This is not giving me the correct result, even thou i do have a row in my database with the correct string. The better solution for me would be to figure out a way so that "@#Pictures#zee\'s fav" string of mine, could be treated as just a string. And I can perform like on it. How can I fix it. Thanks in advance. Zeeshan
