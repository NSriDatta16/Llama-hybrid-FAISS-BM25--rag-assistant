Can t-SNE be applied to visualize time series datasets

I have multiple time-series datasets containing 9 IMU sensor features. Suppose I use the sliding window method to split all these data into samples with the sequence length of 100, i.e. the dimension of my dataset would be (number of samples,100,9). Now I want to visualize those splitted samples to find out the patterns inside. Can I treat it as tabular data and transform the original dimension firstly to (number of samples, 900), then apply t-sne method directly on that to find out the patterns? Or is there any other method to better find out the patterns for time-series data
