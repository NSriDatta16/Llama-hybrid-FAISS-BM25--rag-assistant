Statistical Analysis on Sparse data?

I had few data analysis and modelling roles and was always "unfortunate" to work with, let's call it bad data. Think of default probabilities 1 of 10 000, or sales time series that has 3 sold products per day which occasionally jumps to 10 or drops to 0 with certain seasonal component of course. What do you think, can one even to proper analysis on these kinds of sparse data? If yes, what techniques would you recommend?
