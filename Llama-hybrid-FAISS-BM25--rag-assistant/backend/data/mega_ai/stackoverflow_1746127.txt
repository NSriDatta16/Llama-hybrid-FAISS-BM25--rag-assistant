Variables may not named the same as language keywords in C#. int is a keyword; Int32 is a type. Note that the type and the property name are not actually the same; their fully-qualified names are different. One is System.Int32 , and the other is YourClass.Int32 . If you really want to name your property "int" (don't do this), you can use the verbatim operator: public int @int { get; set; } From MSDN : The prefix "@" enables the use of keywords as identifiers, which is useful when interfacing with other programming languages. The character @ is not actually part of the identifier, so the identifier might be seen in other languages as a normal identifier, without the prefix. An identifier with an @ prefix is called a verbatim identifier. Use of the @ prefix for identifiers that are not keywords is permitted, but strongly discouraged as a matter of style.
