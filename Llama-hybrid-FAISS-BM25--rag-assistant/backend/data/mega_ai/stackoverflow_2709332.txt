Plot multiple files

I'd like to make an animation that illustrates the positions of some agents I'm simulating under Linux. Basically, I have some files named file00001.dat, file00002.dat and so on. I have to generate "something" that get files in order, and output an animated gif, a dynamic graph or whatever, that simulates the moving reading data from file. I have control on the files, meaning that I can put identifiers or everything I want. How would you achieve that? What programs would you use?
