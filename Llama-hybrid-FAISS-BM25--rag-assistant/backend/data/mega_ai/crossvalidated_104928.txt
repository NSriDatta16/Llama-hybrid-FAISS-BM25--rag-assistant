Modelling a variable that is both categorical and continious

I am attempting to design a study in which the impact of a variable on patient decision making is evaluated having adjusted for some other clinical variables. To give more detail, a clinical continuous variable (call it X) that is known to be associated with disease recurrence is used along some other clinical variables. Suppose, I have 100 patients and over the course of the study, the patients are randomized in such a way that half of them receive the variable X along other variables and choose to undergo treatment or not. While, the other half do not receive the info on variable X and based on other variables revealed to them choose to undergo treatment or not. Now, I'm interested to evaluate the impact of X on the decision (treatment vs no treatment), but as a continuous variable and the problem is half the patients did not receive the variable X. So, what is the appropriate approach here? Can I use a logistic regression model where I adjust for 1)other clinical variables, 2)whether someone received X or not (binary), and then also 3) X as continuous variable (for those who did not receive X, this value would be 0). I would appreciate your thoughts on this. thanks
