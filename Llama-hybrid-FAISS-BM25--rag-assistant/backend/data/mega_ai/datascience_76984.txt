How to use unigram and bigram as an feature on SVM or logistic regression

How to use unigram and bigram as an feature to build an Natural Language Inference model on SVM or logistic regression?on my dataset i have premise, hypotesis and label column. I'm planning to use the unigram and bigram of the premis or hipotesis or both as one of the features on my training. for example : premise |hipotesis |hypothesis bigram =============================================================================================== I am planning to use the unigram and bigram |I am planning to use the unigram |[(i, am), (am, planning), (planning, to), (to, use), (use, the), (the, unigram)] the hypothesis bigram is a list of bigram(word), so i cant use it as input to my svm or logistic. can i convert the hypothesis bigram into vector?
