Why is -[NSPasteboard writeObjects:] returning NO for an array of NSURL objects?

I have an NSArrayController that I'm using to provide data to an IKImageBrowserView. I want to support drag and drop from the IKImageBrowserView to other applications. Here's the relevant method from my code: - (NSUInteger) imageBrowser:(IKImageBrowserView *) aBrowser writeItemsAtIndexes:(NSIndexSet *) itemIndexes toPasteboard:(NSPasteboard *)pasteboard{ NSArray *items = [[resultsArrayController arrangedObjects] objectsAtIndexes:itemIndexes]; if(![pasteboard writeObjects:items]){ return 0; } return [items count]; } My app is new so I'm targeting 10.6+ and according to the documentation , "On Mac OS X v10.6 and later, use writeObjects: to write URLs directly to the pasteboard instead." I've verified that the objects that I am attempting to write are indeed NSURL objects, so I'm not sure where the process is breaking down or how to further troubleshoot the problem. Thanks in advance for any help.
