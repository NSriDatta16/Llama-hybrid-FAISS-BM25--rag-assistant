You can increment an integer global variable in the T constructor, and decrement it in the T destructor: doing this will tell you whether T instances are being destroyed by the container. The acceptance test can allocate a few T instances into a Container instance, destroy the Container, and test whether that destroyed the T instances (i.e. whether the T destructors were invoked). Without overriding the delete operator I don't see an easy way to tell whether the container is not only destroying T instances but also releasing the memory which the T instances occupy: but if it is destroying T instances (which you can test as mentioned in the first paragraph above) then you might like to hope that it's probably also releasing the memory occupied by each instance.
