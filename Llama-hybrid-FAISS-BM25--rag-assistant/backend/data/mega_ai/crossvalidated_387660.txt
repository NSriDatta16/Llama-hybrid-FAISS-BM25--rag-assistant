how to combine standard deviations and mean for each group?

I have a table with 10000 rows, each row having 10 columns and their numbers vary from 0 to 80.Now, if I want to compare the mean of these rows.Maybe because of the largeness of one of the numbers in the row and the compensation of the smaller numbers of the same row, I can not make a fair comparison (because the value of each column is also important to me). I know that I can use standard deviation. But I want to use a method that combines standard deviation and mean for each row to have just one number so I can sort the rows based on those rows. I want to find the best rows. The best rows for me are the rows with the smallest Sd and at the same time the largest average.
