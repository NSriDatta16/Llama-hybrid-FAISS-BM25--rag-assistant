Chipmunk: How to remove shape and body?

First, sorry for my English, im not an American. My question is how can I remove the shape and body from the space, this isn't related with collision detection. Im triying to do this with a touch event, specifically I'm trying to clear a ball Touching it (I have a lot of balls in the space), but I have no idea how to do it, I have been looking on Internet and cannot find any help regarding how to do it, all relates to the collisions and that's not what I need. I read many times the documentation, but not contain any useful information how to do this. Only have how delete with colission. I know how delete with colission: static void postStepRemove (cpSpace *space, cpShape *shape, void *data) { //Remove the shape and body cpSpaceRemoveBody(space, shape->body); cpBodyFree(shape->body); cpSpaceRemoveShape(space, shape); cpShapeFree(shape); } static int collission(cpArbiter *arb, cpSpace *space, void *data){ cpShape *a, *b; cpArbiterGetShapes(arb, &a, &b); cpSpaceAddPostStepCallback(space, (cpPostStepFunc)postStepRemove, a, nil); cpSpaceAddPostStepCallback(space, (cpPostStepFunc)postStepRemove, b, nil); return 0; } return 1; } I use this with collision, but I need some example without collision.
