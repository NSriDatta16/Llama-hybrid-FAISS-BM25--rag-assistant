I would suggest two approaches based on the description of your problem. Analytic solution of standard errors: If your likelihood function allows it (which may be the case based on the autoregressive structure of your series), you can estimate the standard errors as the diagonal of the outer product of the gradients of your likelihood function evaluated at the maximum Likelihood estimator. In your case, since you have ten parameters, the gradient $\nabla_{\theta} L(\hat{\theta},y_t)$ should be a 10 x 1 vector. Thus, the variance-covariance will be a 10 x 10 matrix, which can be estimated as $$\Omega(\hat\theta,y_t) = \nabla_{\theta} L(\hat{\theta},y_t)\nabla_{\theta} L(\hat{\theta},y_t)^T $$ The standard error of the estimates would be the diagonal elements of this matrix. Since autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity can be a feature of your data, you may want to use a Heteroskedasticity and Autocorrelation (HAC) robust var-covar estimate. See These lecture notes and bibligraphy for more details The other solution would be to use Stationary Bootstrap to sample for a time series. This block-based method allows you to better preserve your data's time-series dependency and structure. I hope this helps!
