Flex 4 - Using .pfm/.pfb fonts

I just switched to Flash Builder 4 & Flex 4 SDK, and it seems it's no longer possible to use a .pfm/.pfb font, either by embedding it or using it as a system font. I keep getting error messages, and Google can't find anybody having the same issue. I tried several methods: - copy/pasting the [Embed] statement which was working using Flex 3 SDK - installing the font and then try to simply call it by its name in a CSS declaration without embedding it ; seems to work for every .ttf and .otf system fonts, but not for .pfm/.pfm ones - using a Flash-generated swf which embeds the font So far none of these seems to work. Has anybody got an idea on how to achieve this? I actually don't care using a system font without embedding it as long as it works. I'll be really grateful if somebody could help me on this, I'm totally stuck and cannot use another font instead.
