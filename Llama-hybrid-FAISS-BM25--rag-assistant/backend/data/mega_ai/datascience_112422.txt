Freight Matching ML Algorithms

Has anyone worked on Carrier Freight Matching machine learning algorithms for logistics industry (digital freight matching)? If yes i need help to understand what type of algorithms worked best for you? What business and model metrics did you use? Here I would like to recommend relevant matching loads (shipper) to a carrier (trucking, shipping company)?
