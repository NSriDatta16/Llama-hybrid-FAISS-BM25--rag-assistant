PCA vs tSNE after k-means clustering: some separation on the PCA plot but no separation on the tSNE plot

I am using K-Means in order to cluster a population based on 5 variables into 2 groups. I am then using both tSNE and PCA to visualise the outcome to somehow better understand the separation. What is confusing me is that PCA shows a reasonably nice separation of the data whilst tSNE does not show the same pattern. What is the best way to describe these differences? Which one is likely a better representation of the data?
