WGET, Cookies and 302 Redirect

I want to use WGET to download some pics from a memberarea of some site. This site is password protected. I have logged in successfullly and save the cookies. However, I still cant download the pics, becasue of the 302 Redirect. Could any one do me favor and take a look at this? Thanks a lot. wget --load-cookies=examplecookies http://members.example.com/membersarea/0004.jpg --2010-12-18 18:58:50-- http://members.example.com/membersarea/0004.jpg Resolving members.example.com... 12.34.56.78 Connecting to members.example.com|12.34.56.78|:80... connected.
