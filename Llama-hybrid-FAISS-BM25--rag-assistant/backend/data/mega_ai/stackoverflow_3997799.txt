Large Javascript arrays aren't as slow as you might think (relative to Canvas operations). I've done a lot of performance testing with noVNC (HTML5 VNC client I made) and found that often doing manipulations on Javascript arrays is faster than Canvas operations. It's really going to depend on what type of modifications you are doing (transforms and complex lines will probably be faster as Canvas ops). So I would suggest actually performance testing both options before you decide. In fact, I've done testing of using imageData arrays as a storage format instead of normal Javascript arrays, and imageData (even though they should be binary arrays) end up about 50% slower (in Chrome anyways) :-(
