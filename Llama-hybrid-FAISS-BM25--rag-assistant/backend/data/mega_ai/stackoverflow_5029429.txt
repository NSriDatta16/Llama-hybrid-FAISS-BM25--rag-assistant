Before taking care of the programming part, you have to care about transforming the WGS84 coordinate system (used by GPS) into plane grid system coordinates. That's trigonometry, and depending on the size of the system you will be using, the precision you need, and your location (the earth is not a perfect sphere), you will have to choose a projection , or use an approximation. In France, we generally use the Lambert projection. Then, using this new local plane grid, you can just scale it to pixels and fill your image. edit : I found this question on stackoverflow very similar, and the accepted answer is well explained
