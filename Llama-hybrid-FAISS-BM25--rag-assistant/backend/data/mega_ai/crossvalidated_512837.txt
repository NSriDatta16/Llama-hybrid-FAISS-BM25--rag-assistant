When performing matrix multiplications in neural networks, is it acceptable to do X * W rather than W * X?

I'm having a hard time seeing a clear convention being used and I've seen it both ways. X * W would assume the features (X) are in row format, and the weights are in column format. Is there anything wrong with that? This is mostly for pedagogy.
