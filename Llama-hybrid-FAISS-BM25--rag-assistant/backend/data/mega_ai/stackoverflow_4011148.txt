G'Day Martin, I'll point out up front that the issue is that you'll have is an index being generated per machine. Which means that every machine on the network will at some point have to index every document. All that load over your network isn't a good thing and it won't scale well if you have to add more computers. imho, the best thing to do would be install one of the free varients of SharePoint and leverage its search abilities. This will take care of any search UI that would need to be written and OOTB it's already very good at indexing files spread over drives across a network. Hope that helps. Cam
