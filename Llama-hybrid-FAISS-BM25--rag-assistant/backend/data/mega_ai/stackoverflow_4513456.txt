No, that is not possible in iText. It's not a particularly good idea anywhere else either. As Redman said, PDF is a print-based format. It's not HTML. There are some tricks you can do to get around this to some extent: Create your page with the maximum legal height. 200" * 72dpi = 14400 points. Add a "generic tag" to your paragraphs. create a tag event handler that tracks where the bottom of your last paragraph was drawn. Save the PDF. Open it again with a PDFStamper Set the bottom of the page to match the location of that last paragraph. Remember that the bottom left starts off at 0,0, and the top right will be Save the final PDF This trick will only work if your total output is less that 200" high. If you go over that, you'll still get a second page, and your "where the bottom is" code had better be prepared for it. PS: I don't see what's wrong with having a number of 12mm x 3.25" pages... won't that perfectly fit the labels they want printed?
