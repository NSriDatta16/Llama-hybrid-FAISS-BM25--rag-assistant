Open source file hosting/sharing in php

Do you recommend an open-source project in PHP as a file hosting/sharing solution? The project should support the following: 1- Register a new user. 2- Enable the user to download/upload files (doc, images, programs, etc.). 3- Define limits on the traffic upload/download (per user). 4- Define limits on the storage capacity (per user). 5- Enable the user to share his/her files. The preferred platform is Linux.
