There are very often occasions where you want to have a probability of a probability. Say for instance you worked in food safety and used a survival analysis model to estimate the probability that botulinum spores would germinate (and thus produce the deadly toxin) as a function of the food preparation steps (i.e. cooking) and incubation time/temperature (c.f. paper ). Food producers may then want to use that model to set safe "use-by" dates so that consumer's risk of botulism is appropriately small. However, the model is fit to a finite training sample, so rather than picking a use-by date for which the probability of germination is less than, say 0.001, you might want to choose an earlier date for which (given the modelling assumptions) you could be 95% sure the probability of germination is less than 0.001. This seems a fairly natural thing to do in a Bayesian setting.
