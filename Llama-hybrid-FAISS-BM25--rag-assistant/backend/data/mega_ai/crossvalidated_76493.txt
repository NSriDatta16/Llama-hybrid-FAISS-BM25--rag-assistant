It looks like you want to do something like principal component analysis and find out two components from these 50 items. A very good technique for Likert data will be conducting Non-linear Principal Component Analysis or Categorical PCA instead of usual PCA. Papers have shown that it works better than usual PCA for ordinal data. Key papers are from Jacqueline J. Meulman, see e.g. Nonlinear principal components analysis: Introduction and application (Psychol Methods. 2007 12(3):336-58) or PCA with nonlinear optimal scaling transformations for ordinal and nominal data (SAGE Handbook of Quantitative Methodology for the Social Sciences, 2004).
