Software development process and lawyer

On any if you ask a question about licenses, patents or copyright everybody will refer you to the lawyer (see SO’s “ask-a-lawyer” tag). I’m trying to setup a software development process where there will be place for a lawyer. But I cannot find any well known process that includes a lawyer, what activities a he or she performs. Can you referrer me to some publicly available resource that will explain lawyer activities and part in a software development process (RUP, MSF, XP, etc.)? It’s really hard to convince a customer to pay money for something for activities that will cost more than project development :-) How currently organizations handle legal expenses for customer projects in most cases: via overhead or via time and materials?
