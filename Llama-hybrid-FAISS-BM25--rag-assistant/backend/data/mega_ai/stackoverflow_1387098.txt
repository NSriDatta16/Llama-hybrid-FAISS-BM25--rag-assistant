Embed advertisements in a windows application

I'm developing a free application and would like to make some money by embedding advertisements in it. Initially I had planned to embed ads in a webbrowser control (AdSense, Google Ads) but found that this isn't allowed. Does anybody have experience with this? The program is coded in C# and will run on PCs not windows mobile
