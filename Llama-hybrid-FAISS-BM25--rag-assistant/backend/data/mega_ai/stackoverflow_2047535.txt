Include something extra in the URL, like the timestamp of the graph image That way, the URL changes whenever the image does. This won't stop the user-agent from caching what it sees, so it still might show an old image even after the server updates. So, if you want to stop the user-agent from actually caching the image, then write a script which returns the image with some headers to prevent caching.... $file="graph.png"; $size=filesize($file); header("Cache-Control: no-cache, must-revalidate"); // HTTP/1.1 header("Expires: Sat, 26 Jul 1997 05:00:00 GMT"); // Date in the past header("Content-Length: $size"); header("Content-Type: image/png"); readfile($file);
