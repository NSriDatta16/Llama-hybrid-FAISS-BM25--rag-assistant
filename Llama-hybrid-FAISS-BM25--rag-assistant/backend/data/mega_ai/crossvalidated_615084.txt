Thinking in terms of percentage-point differences can lead to confusion in logistic regression. The coefficients are in units of log-odds differences associated with the predictor values. Those aren't linearly related to percentage values. The negative intercept in your model is related to the low overall probability of the used outcome in your data. If your data adequately represent the underlying population of interest, that's what you should focus on. If there were simply an under-representation of cases with used outcomes and the regression coefficients still represented the correct differences in log-odds associated with changing predictor values, then you could estimate corresponding percentage-point differences. With your current intercept of -3.259 , the percentage estimates with all continuous predictors at 0 for the two levels of the binary exp predictor are about 3.7% and 1.1%; if the data had been better "balanced" so that intercept was 0 and the other coefficients were the same, those percentages would be about 50% and 22%, respectively. plogis(-3.259) # [1] 0.03700483 plogis(-3.259-1.255) # [1] 0.01083585 plogis(0) # [1] 0.5 plogis(0-1.255) # [1] 0.2218358 That said, it seems unlikely that a "better balanced" data set would only change the intercept of the model without affecting the other coefficient estimates.
