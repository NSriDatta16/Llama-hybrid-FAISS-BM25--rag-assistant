Standard deviation of the population

I have some trouble getting the standard deviation of a stratified sample. I have a sample of 1600 individuals that are divided into three groups (strata), with their sample mean $y$, which is the groups average income, $s_k$ is the standard deviation, and $n_k$ is the number of indivdiuals in the strata/group. What is the standard deviation of the population?
