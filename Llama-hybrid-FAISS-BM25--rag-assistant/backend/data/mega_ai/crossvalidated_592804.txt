This is a problem where you want to examine the lifetime of a system composed of two components operating in series. It is part of the broader subject of reliability analysis (also called survival analysis when looking at survival of organisms). I recommend you read some introductory resources to get a general understanding of this subject area, including an understanding of the analysis of series and parallel systems. In this particular case we have a system time-to-failure $T_\text{sys} = \min(A,B)$ and we want to find the expected system time-to-failure $\mathbb{E}(T_\text{sys})$ . To do this, we first need to derive the distribution of the system time-to-failure and then we use this to find the expected time-to-failure for the system. Since the times-to-failure for the two components are independent exponential random variables we have: $$\begin{align} F_\text{sys}(t) &= \mathbb{P}(T_\text{sys} \leqslant t) \\[6pt] &= \mathbb{P}(\min(A,B) \leqslant t) \\[6pt] &= 1 - \mathbb{P}(\min(A,B) > t) \\[6pt] &= 1 - \mathbb{P}(A > t, B > t) \\[6pt] &= 1 - (1-F_A(t)) (1-F_B(t)) \\[6pt] &= 1 - \exp(-\lambda_A t) \exp(-\lambda_B t) \\[6pt] &= 1 - \exp(-(\lambda_A + \lambda_B) t), \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ so we can see that $T_\text{sys} \sim \text{Exp}(\lambda_A + \lambda_B)$ . Now, taking its expected value we get: $$\begin{align} \mathbb{E}(T_\text{sys}) &= \int \limits_0^{\infty} (1-F_\text{sys}(t)) dt \\[6pt] &= \int \limits_0^{\infty} \exp(-(\lambda_A + \lambda_B) t) dt \\[6pt] &= \Bigg[ - \frac{1}{\lambda_A + \lambda_B} \cdot \exp(-(\lambda_A + \lambda_B) t) \Bigg]_{t=0}^{t \rightarrow \infty} \\[6pt] &= \Bigg[ ( 0 ) - \bigg( - \frac{1}{\lambda_A + \lambda_B} \bigg) \Bigg] \\[6pt] &= \frac{1}{\lambda_A + \lambda_B}. \\[6pt] \end{align}$$ Substitution of your particular parameters gives you the result given by your textbook. As you can see from the above working, when you have components in series and these components operate independently with exponential time-to-failure, the system time-to-failure is exponentially distributed with hazard rate equal to the sum of the hazard rates of the components. This is a well-known result for series systems in reliability analysis.
