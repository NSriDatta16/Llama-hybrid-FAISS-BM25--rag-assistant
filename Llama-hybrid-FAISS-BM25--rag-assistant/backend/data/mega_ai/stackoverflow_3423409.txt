My experiences. Function calls are slow, eliminate with macros or inlined methods. Look at the disassembler listing to see. If using GCC, mark optimized sections with #pragma GCC optimize("O3") or compile them separately. Play with different combinations of applying the inline attribute (basically find a balance between size and speed).
