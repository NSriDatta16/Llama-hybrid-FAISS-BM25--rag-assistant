I would suggest that you look into options that your revision control system provides to embed revision information into source files. I've had enough problems with auto-increment in the past that I promised myself never again. These days I prefer something a little more concrete than a build number though and embed unique identifiers into every product of the build system. I describe my own system in Embedding mercurial revision information in Visual Studio c# projects automatically . While my solution probably isn't right for you, there were other interesting options suggested in response to my question, so some of the solutions I rejected may, nevertheless, be useful to you, even if you have to adapt them to whatever VCS you use.
