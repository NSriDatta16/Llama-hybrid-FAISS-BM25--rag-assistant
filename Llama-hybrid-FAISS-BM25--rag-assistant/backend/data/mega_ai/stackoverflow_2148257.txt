The most obvious use cases are: An output filter (eg ob_gzhandler or any number of filters you could devise on your own); I have done this with APIs that only support output (rather than return values) where I wanted to do subsequent parsing with a library like phpQuery . Maintenance (rather than rewriting) of code written with all the problems you discuss; this includes things like sending headers after output began (credit Don Dickinson) or suppression of certain output that has already been generated. Staggered output (credit here to Tom and Langdon); note that your tests may have failed because it conflicts with PHP/Apache's default internal buffer, but it is possible to do, it simply requires a certain amount to be flushed before PHP will send anythingâ€”PHP will still keep the connection open though.
