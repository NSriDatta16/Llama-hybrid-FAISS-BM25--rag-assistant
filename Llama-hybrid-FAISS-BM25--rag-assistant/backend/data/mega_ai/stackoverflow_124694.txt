I really like using AnkhSvn in conjunction with Tortoise. It works from Visual Studio. When I set up my own repository, I used VisualSVN, which took 2 secs to run, and didn't involve any apache or LAMP stuff. Just worked out of the box. As far as using it, try the free book online to get a feel for what source control is all about. Then go to a website, like http://blog.taragana.com/index.php/archive/5-minutes-guide-to-subversion/ for a quick tutorial of how to use it.
