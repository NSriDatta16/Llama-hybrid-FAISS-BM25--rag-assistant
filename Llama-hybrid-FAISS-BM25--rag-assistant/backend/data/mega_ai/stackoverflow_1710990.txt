GAE data-store is completely different animal from a RDBMS. It is easy in a relational DB to write something like: SELECT STDEV(player_score) FROM Table WHERE player_id = 1234 AND game_date BETWEEN '2007-01-01' AND '2009-11-10' AND city <> 'London' GAE query has lots of restrictions -- see here -- so it is not easy to translate this. For aggregate functions (sum, stdev, etc..) you have to pull all data into application layer and calculate, or maintain aggregate entities which update on each data insert/update. Update You may consider using GAE for UI and business logic, but having separate relational DB somewhere else in cloud like: Microsoft SQL, DB2 on Amazon, MySQL elsewhere -- and than using GAE data-store for pre-calculated aggregations and statistics. So stats are still calculated in RDBMS, but you store results (partial, pre-calculated stats) in GAE storage; similar to dimensional storage in analytic cubes.
