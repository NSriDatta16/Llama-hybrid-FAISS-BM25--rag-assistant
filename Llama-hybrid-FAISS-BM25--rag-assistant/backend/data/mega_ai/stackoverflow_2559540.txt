I feel your pain - quite a lot of the administrative functionality is insufficiently granular concerning access control options, and while there are many modules that address one or more specific shortcomings, I have not yet found the general module for this. That said, and given your multi-site setup, you might want to take a closer look at the Domain Access module and its multiple 'offspring'. While mainly aimed at running a set of affiliate sites on different domains that share some content while keeping other content domain specific, it also contains many tweaks to assist in organizing and administrating such a setup. So it could offer some of the features you're looking for. But be warned - the module is quite a beast in complexity and I'd only recommend using it if it fits your setup in general, not to gain just one or two ACL features.
