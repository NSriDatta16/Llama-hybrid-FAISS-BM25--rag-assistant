Tabber.js script not running in DotNetNuke

I have designed an HTML page that uses the tabber.js script to create tabs on my page. It works fine in a basic html page when ran in VS. However in DotNetNuke, I put the div tags which represent the tabbed pages into the content using the text editor, and it doesn't work. I can't put this on a site for you to test because it is on local host. To get the tabber.js to be included in my page, I entered this code in my skin's ascx page: protected override void OnPreRender(EventArgs e) { string scriptTag = " "; LiteralControl headerscript = new LiteralControl(); headerscript.Text = scriptTag; Page.Header.Controls.Add(headerscript); Page.Controls.Add(headerscript); base.OnPreRender(e); } When I view the source in firefox, the script tag does show in the page and when I click on the script link, it does show the tabber.js script so it can be found. I've tried to put an alert() call into tabber.js to see if it will fire and it does not. Any ideas? Edit: Below is the html code that I'm putting in my text editor within dotnetnuke. After rebooting my machine, the code is now firing but not changing the div tags to resemble tabbed viewing. I've also put these div tags directly inside of my skin (ascx) control but that doesn't make any difference. By the way, the tabber.js is open source and the code can be found here: http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/tabber/tabber.js Guests Welcome! Our great joy is knowing and serving Christ.
