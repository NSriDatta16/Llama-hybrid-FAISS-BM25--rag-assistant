I've been having the same issue myself (and was using the same tutorial). If you use jquery, my solution might work for you. In the rowCreated function I have this: int index = e.Row.RowIndex; Literal output = (Literal)e.Row.FindControl("RadioButtonMarkip"); output.Text=string.Format(" "; Then on the JS side: jQuery.fn.post_Default=function(){ $.post("YourPage.aspx", {Default: arguments[0]}); }; Now all you need is the page load to check Request.Form["Default"] for the index value of your checked radio button. This may not be the most elegant way of doing it, but so far its working. I am also toying with the idea of just using jquery's $.ajax function to do it. I think that might be a bit cleaner, but for now this works.
