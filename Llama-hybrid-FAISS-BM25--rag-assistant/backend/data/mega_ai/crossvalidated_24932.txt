Combining experimental error in a mean

I understand the rules for combining experimental errors in sums, differences and ratios ( as explained here ), but what happens to an experimental error when you average it? Say, ruler measurements of the length of beetles that are all values like 12.3 cm $\pm$ 2mm. I can find plenty of explanation on the web about how to add and multiply values like that together, but what happens to the error when you take an average of (say) 10 measurements?
