Rails: Change form action from submit_tag

I have a form which is always submitting the form to the "update" function in the controller, and I have created this form using "remote_form_for" tag. In this form I have objects from different tables, and from this form I want to submit entire form data to another function(not to the "update" function) via AJAX request. I have tried many methods including using submit tag with action organization_employee_path(@organization, @employee), :method => :put do |employee_form| %> // form objects and other functionalities .... .... // views inside the forms "employee_header", :locals => {:employee => @employee} %> ... ... "page_level_validation" , :action=>"validate"%> But the Ajax request always calling the same "update" function. It would be very helpful, if anyone helps to resolve this issue.
