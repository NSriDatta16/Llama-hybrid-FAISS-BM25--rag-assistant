I'm nominating for moderator because I want to do more to help the present moderators than I can otherwise. I think I'd make a reasonable choice for moderator: Familiarity with tools: I've been using moderator tools for almost two years; gold tag badges give me some additional privileges above even trusted user level. I'm active but cautious with them. I try to use privileges responsibly. Presence, coverage, experience: I've been here every day for the last two years. I'm in a different time zone to the most active moderators. Besides being on CV since the public beta, I have had some outside moderation experience (held two moderator-like positions outside SE). Good relationships with the moderators and the other active high reputation users who help keep the site running smoothly. Issues are handled in a positive and productive way. (See many comment threads, meta posts, and chat discussions about site issues.) Cross Validated has worked very well since its early days, yet site traffic has doubled just since the last moderator election. I want to do what I can to help keep the site as clean and responsive as its first 4-and-a-half years while it continues to grow.
