You have a nice start to your list. The items I would add include: Data integrity - SQL engines provide built-in mechanisms (relationships, constraints, triggers, etc.) that make it very simple to reduce the amount of "bad" data in your system. You would need to hand code all data constraint separately if you use flat files. Add-Hoc data retrieval - SQL engines, through the use of SELECT statements, provide a means of filtering and summarizing your data with very little code. If you are using flat files, considerably more code is needed to get the same results. These items can be replicated if you want to take the time to build a data engine, but what would be the point? SQL engines already provide these benefits.
