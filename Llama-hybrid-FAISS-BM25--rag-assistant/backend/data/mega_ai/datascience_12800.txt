You can use the dataframe's .values method to access raw data once you have manipulated the columns as you need them. E.g. train = pd.read_csv("train.csv") target = train['target'] train = train.drop(['ID','target'],axis=1) test = pd.read_csv("test.csv") test = test.drop(['ID'],axis=1) xgtrain = xgb.DMatrix(train.values, target.values) xgtest = xgb.DMatrix(test.values) Obviously you may need to change which columns you drop or use as the training target. The above was for a Kaggle competition, so there was no target data for xgtest (it is held back by the organisers).
