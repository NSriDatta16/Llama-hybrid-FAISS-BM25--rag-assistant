This appears to be a trivial application of the Law of Iterated Expectations, because $X$ is mean-independent of the choice of the sample that contains realizations of it (i.e. the true mean of $X$ does not change as we change the sample). So $$E[E(X|i)] = E[E(X)] = E(X)$$ The expression is not wrong, but it does not appear to me to be a useful example for the application of the tower property, since the result comes about due to independence, rather than from "averaging".
