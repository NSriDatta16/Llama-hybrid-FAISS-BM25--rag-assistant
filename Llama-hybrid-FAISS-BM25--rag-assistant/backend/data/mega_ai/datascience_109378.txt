Natural language processing

I am new to NLP. I converted my JSON file to CSV with the Jupyter notebook. I am unsure how to proceed in pre-processing my data using techniques such as tokenization and lemmatization etc. I normalised the data before converting it to a CSV format, so now i have a data frame. Please how do I apply the tokenisation process on the whole dataset and using the split() function is giving me an error?
