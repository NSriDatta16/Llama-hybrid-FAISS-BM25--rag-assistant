Oh yeah, lists.... /(?:^value_name\s+|,\s*)([^,]+)/g will theoreticly grab them, but you will have to use RegExp.exec() in a loop to get the capture, rather than the whole match. I wish pre-matches worked in JS :(. Otherwise, go with Logan's idea: /^value_name\s+([^,]+(?:,\s*[^,]+)*)$/ followed by .split(/,\s*/);
