How can I test whether one empirical CDF is to the left or right of another?

I am currently working with a box plot (shown below) that consists of two boxes per value of one of the independent variables (call it $x$ ). The other independent variable is indicated by the two boxes (call it $y$ ). The blue box represents the dependent variable (call it $z$ ) under the condition $y = 1$ , while the red box represents $z$ under the condition $y = 2$ . The bottom and top whiskers represent the 10th and 90th percentiles respectively, while the bottom and top edges of a box represent the 25th and 75th percentiles respectively. The median is marked in black. My hypothesis is that, when $y = 1$ (blue box), the empirical CDF of $z$ is to the right of the empirical CDF of $z$ when $y = 2$ (red box) "in general" (on average or otherwise) for every value of $x$ . This relationship (although not particularly strong) can be seen in the plot below. However, I am not sure how to phrase this precisely in terms of a statistical test. One possibility that I thought of was to use a two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test for each value of $x$ , but I am not sure how helpful this would be. Another possibility, is that, because the data was generated in pairs, i.e., one specific value of $z$ when $y = 1$ can be matched to another specific value of $z$ when $y = 2$ , then I should subtract the value of $z$ when $y = 2$ from the corresponding value of $z$ when $y = 1$ , and then check that the values are always (or mostly) positive. Any suggestions would be appreciated.
