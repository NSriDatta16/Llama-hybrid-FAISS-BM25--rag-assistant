How to detect UserAgent within an NPAPI plug-in before it is registered by the browser?

I need to figure out a way to install plug-ins specifically for Safari on Mac. If I copy the .plugin files into the Internet Plug-ins folder, it will be detected by Firefox and Google Chrome as well when they are run. To prevent this I was using the NP_UserAgent API call to determine the user agent, and exit if it wasn't Safari. However the plug-ins are still registered by Google Chrome and Firefox. Is there anyway to do the same thing without having either browser register the plug-in?
