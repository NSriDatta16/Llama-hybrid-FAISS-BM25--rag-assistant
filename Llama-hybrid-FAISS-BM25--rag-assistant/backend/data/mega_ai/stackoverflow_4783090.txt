WebRequests/Responses Slowing down after many calls

i have this method: private void sendSms(object url) { var Url = url.ToString(); webRequest = WebRequest.Create(Url); // webRequest.BeginGetResponse(this.RespCallback, webRequest); webResponse = webRequest.GetResponse(); // End the Asynchronous response. var stream = new StreamReader(webResponse.GetResponseStream()); var response = stream.ReadToEnd().ToString(); if (response.Contains(Config.ValidResponse)) { var queryString = HttpUtility.ParseQueryString(webRequest.RequestUri.Query); OnMessageAccepted(this, new MessageAcceptedEventArgs(queryString["SN"], "n/a")); } else { OnMessageAccepted(this, new MessageAcceptedEventArgs("", "n/a")); } } which i call inside a loop like this While (true) { Send(url); sleep(400); } Problem is after couples of hundreds of calls like 500 or 600 the performance of the calls gets slower and slower if i restart application it start so fast and good but then start slowing down ! i was wondering if there is any buffer or cache i should clear every now and then to make it stay fast ? ps: i developed the server so im sure the server doesnt slow it down plus i tried that with different kind of server implementation that i developed and developed by others. thanks in advance.
