What is a good Read, Eval, Print, Loop implementation for C#?

Some programming language implementations provide a Read, Evaluate, Print Loop interactive shell to allow the programmer to evaluate expressions and program fragments, and to program in an incremental, interactive manner. What implementations of a C# REPL have you used, and liked? It would be nice to have one that could integrate with Visual Studio as well. I have found, but not tried, the Mono C# REPL and Don Box's C# REPL
