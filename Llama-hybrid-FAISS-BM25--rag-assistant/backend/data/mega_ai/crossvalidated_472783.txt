Log-transforming a value less than 1 results in a negative number. Here is a quick demonstration in R: # Generating a sequence of values between 0 and 1 (inclusive), incrementing by 0.1 x It is entirely possible for the sign of a Pearson's correlation to flip as a consequence of logging observations between 0 and 1. In such contexts, it's possible for $\rho(X,Y)$ to flip sign if we $\log X$ or $\log Y$ , or both. See below for a quick-and-dirty simulation. In each iteration, I assessed the correlation between 10 pairs of values. The correlation was preserved in 7 out of the 10 trials. Note, upon each draw of 10 observations, a subset fall between 0 and 1, which reverse in sign after the log transformation; this has the potential to influence the relationship between variables. set.seed(13) sims 0 & logged 0) preserved Another example is when a transformation dampens an outlier that was exerting major leverage. Review the top answer here for a very simple and clear demonstration of this. If you're working with per capita rates (e.g., limited number of incidents per unit population) or proportions , then a log transformation can influence or even reverse the sign of a coefficient.
