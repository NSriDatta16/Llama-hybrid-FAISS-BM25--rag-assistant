Any documentation for Win32 ShellEx StorageHandler?

I'm currently poking around with a new archive format and was interested in implementing a shell extension like the native Zip support that Windows XP has. This appears to be done by registering a shell extension that implements a StorageHandler . Problem is that according to MSDN, this handler doesn't exist. I've tried Googling various resources, but haven't been able to find anything. Is there any documentation for this anywhere, or is this just another case of Microsoft refusing to share the fun toys with the rest of us?
