This description is closer to OK, but still you need to describe a lot of things in more detail. Since you want to classify, it seems like what you want is LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) more than PCA. You want to "dimensionality reduction", possibly because you need to be able to describe the rule you obtain, but more importantly don't forget that you want something that helps you classify boys from girls. The most important key step is that you will have to think of a sensible representation for your data that helps achieve this goal. Depending on this: what do the 500 RTs mean? Are they repetitions of the same experiment? or are they executions of different experiments? Why does it "stand on its own" and "order has no meaning"? the representation would be significantly different. Also when you say PCA does not work well, what exactly do you mean by that? It could be many things: does it give unacceptable accuracy on new data? or does it work reasonably well, just not as well as you had hoped? What you say in your question (A), is not true you may be seeing the effects of a poor representation for your data.
