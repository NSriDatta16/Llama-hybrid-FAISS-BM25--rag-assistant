Anyone have a large folder tree sample?

I'm doing some testing that requires a large folder tree. 1000s of folders, 100000s of files, atleast a gigabyte but not over 5 thats a little big. (around 2 is fine). Anyone have one that they use as a test file? I can provide storage and transfer mechanism to share if you need it.
