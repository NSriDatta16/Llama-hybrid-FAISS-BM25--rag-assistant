Compare how fast two time-series grow

I collected data from Pubmed containing articles published about two different topics. The first is a yearly series of articles about omega 3 supplements. The second is a yearly series of articles published about probiotics supplements. I want to understand how fast the research has grown over time (in plain English, capture the scientific interest over time) and specifically whether the scientific interest grew somehow "faster" for a topic rather than the other. Please find here the data in a public gdoc: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yw2F8a6f0_v_-QmCYpWZfm12ev_qirdRNWcfwR71Qjk/edit?usp=sharing I don't expect a full solution but at least some indication to where to start looking for my answer. I assume it is something I can check with the time series slope, but I need some more inputs for going deeper in my research because I am kind of lost. Thank you!
