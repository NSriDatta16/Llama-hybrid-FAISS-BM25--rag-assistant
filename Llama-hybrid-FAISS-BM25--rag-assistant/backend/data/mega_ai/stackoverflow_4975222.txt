Jquery - disable select when dragging

I'm trying to do my own drag and drop function using jquery library. But everytime I mousedown on an image, then mousemove, my browser "highlights" or "selects" the image, which disrupts my mousemove operation. How do I disable the select/highlight? I tried $('img').onselectstart = function() {return false;} , but that didn't work.
