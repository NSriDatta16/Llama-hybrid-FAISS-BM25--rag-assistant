It sounds like you have a lot of data, but no model yet. What do you learn from the $1$ run scored from a ball? There are a lot of possibilities. You might learn just what happened on that ball. You might learn something about the batter. You might learn something about the bowler. You might learn something about the overall skill levels of the teams. These are all possibilities according to particular choices of models. Since you have a lot of data, you may be able to test these possibilities against the data. Filter the past games to ones in which there was $1$ run scored on the first ball. How does this affect the average scores of the games? Some models will be inconsistent with the data. My guess is that teams are not so consistent that a good first ball determines much about the match, and that you primarily can learn a little about the batter, and a little about the bowler. So, make some models for how teams might differ, and test them against the data.
