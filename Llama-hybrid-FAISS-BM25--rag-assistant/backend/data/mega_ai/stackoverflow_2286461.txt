Common reasons include: The previous merge between the two items was resolved AcceptMerge (instead of AcceptTheirs). An AcceptMerge is treated as a new reverse candidate -- even if the contents were automerged successfully -- unless the source and target are byte-for-byte identical. The source item has been renamed or undeleted. The target file was edited & subsequently rolled back. While these cases seem innocuous, TFS errs on the conservative side by bringing them to your attention. If you only care about cases where the items' path or contents are truly in conflict with one another, use the AutoMerge button. To prevent these types of conflicts from cascading indefinitely, choose the AcceptTheirs resolution (aka "copy item from source" in the 2008 client UI).
