Question about prior in bayesian image processing

I am learning Bayesian image processing. Bayesian approach will take prior knowledge about image into account. From one material, it says knowledge is expressed via probability functions. I understand noise can be expresses as probability distribution. How can one image is expressed via probability? From another material, it mentions Markov random field (MRF). Is it used for modeling $f$? What is the relation between Markov random field and Gaussian mixture model?
