In data streaming and mining of time series databases, a common approach is to transform the series to a symbolic representation, then use a similarity metric, such as Euclidean distance, to cluster the series. The most popular representations are SAX (Keogh & Lin) or the newer iSAX (Shieh & Keogh): Symbolic Aggregate approXimation iSAX: Indexing and Mining Terabyte Sized Time Series The pages above also contain references to distance metrics and clustering. Keogh and crew are into reproducible research and pretty receptive to releasing their code. So you could email them and ask. I believe they tend to work in MATLAB/C++ though. There was a recent effort to produce a Java and R implementation: jmotif I don't know how far along it is -- it's geared towards motif finding, but, depending on how far they've gotten, it should have the necessary bits you need to put something together for your needs (iSAX and distance metrics: since this part is common to clustering and motif finding).
