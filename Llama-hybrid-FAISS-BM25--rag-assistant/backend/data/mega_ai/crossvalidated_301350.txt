Imputing missing values on a testing set

I'm a newbie to machine learning so forgive me if the answer to this question is obvious. I have been working on a binary prediction problem using logistic regression. Using a selection of categorical and continuous I have been able to predict accuracy on a testing set with an AUC of about $0.7$. I have been comparing multiple data pre-processing approaches where I carry out combinations of various filtering steps which are: no data filtering removing mean based outliers without replacement removing mean based outliers with mean replacement & additionally replacing NA's with the mean. removing median absolute deviation outliers without replacement removing median absolute deviation outliers with mean replacement & additionally replacing NA's with the mean. repeating the above 5 procedures on a data set that has all of the NA's removed. I find that my model is the most predictive on a testing set whenever I remove all median absolute deviation outliers and replace them with the mean and additionally replace pre-exisiting NA's with the mean. Is it OK to impute mean based missing values with the mean whenever implementing the model? Thanks!
