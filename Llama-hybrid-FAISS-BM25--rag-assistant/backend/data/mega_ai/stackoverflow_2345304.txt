How to locate a sequence of values (specifically, bytes) within a larger collection in .NET

I need to parse the bytes from a file so that I only take the data after a certain sequence of bytes has been identified. For example, if the sequence is simply 0xFF (one byte), then I can use LINQ on the collection: byte[] allBytes = new byte[] {0x00, 0xFF, 0x01}; var importantBytes = allBytes.SkipWhile(byte b => b != 0xFF); // importantBytes = {0xFF, 0x01} But is there an elegant way to detect a multi-byte sequence - e.g. 0xFF, 0xFF - especially one that backtracks in case it starts to get a false positive match?
