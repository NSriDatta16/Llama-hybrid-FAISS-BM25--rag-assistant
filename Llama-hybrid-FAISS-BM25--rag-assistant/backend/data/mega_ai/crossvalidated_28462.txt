Assume your matrices are called $A$ and $B$, then it is usual to notate their elements with $a_{ij}$ respectively $b_{ij}$. So you could denote the sum of the squared errors as $$ \text{SSE} = \sum_{i,j} (a_{ij}-b_{ij})^2. $$ You would get your MSE in the usual way, by taking the average. Does this answer your question? It sorts of seems to sample. You could also first define a new matrix $C$, via $$c_{ij} = a_{ij}-b_{ij}$$ and work with that. As per the comment above, for the whole matrix you can also just write $$ C=A-B $$ which works out elementwise as given above.
