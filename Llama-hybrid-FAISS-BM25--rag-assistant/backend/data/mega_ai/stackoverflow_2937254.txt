No, there is not a way to do this. It's a client-side scripted language...you cannot in any way hide the a script that's running...not from the people you are probably wanting to hide it from (people who would go after your script are smarter than the average user most likely). There are a number of tools available to inspect javascript, Chrome's tools , Firebug , any traffic sniffer, javascript unpackers (though debate-ably packing/minifying makes the code less "out of the box" usable). You can deter people with the packing/minification, but you cannot prevent them from seeing/figuring out the code.
