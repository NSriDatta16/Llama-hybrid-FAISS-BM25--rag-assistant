If you want a fast way to do this, the best thing that comes to my mind is to write your own function (I assume you only search for ' ' characters) . int yourOwnFunction(char *str, char c) { while(*str != '\0' && *str != c) { str++; } return *str == '\0'; } So you just have to test if(yourOwnFunction(p,' ')) { ... } else { ... } Correct me if I misunderstood something :) Btw I didn't test it, but this should be in the worst case as fast as the other proposed method. If you just want a one-liner strager's (elegant) solution is the way to go!
