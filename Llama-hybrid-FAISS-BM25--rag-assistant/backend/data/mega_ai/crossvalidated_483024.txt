MLE for $\sigma^2$ in $\mathcal{N}(\mathbf{Bz}, \mathbf{WW}^{\top} + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I})$

I'm trying to compute the MLE of $\sigma^2$ in the model, $$ \mathbf{x} \mid \mathbf{z} \sim \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{Bz}, \mathbf{WW}^{\top} + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I}). $$ Here, $\mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{R}^P$ , $\mathbf{z} \in \mathbb{R}^K$ , $\mathbf{B} \in \mathbb{R}^{P \times K}$ , and $\mathbf{W}^{P \times K}$ . In other words, I want to take the derivative of the log likelihood, set it equal to zero, and solve for $\sigma^2$ If the covariance matrix were just $\sigma^2 \mathbf{I}$ , then the MLE would just be what you'd get for probabilistic PCA. However, this log likelihood has the following term: $$ (\mathbf{WW}^{\top} + \sigma^2 \mathbf{I})^{-1}. $$ I don't know how to either compute the derivative of this term w.r.t. to $\sigma^2$ or even how to isolate $\sigma^2$ , since the Woodbury matrix formula will keep $\sigma^2$ inside the inverse.
