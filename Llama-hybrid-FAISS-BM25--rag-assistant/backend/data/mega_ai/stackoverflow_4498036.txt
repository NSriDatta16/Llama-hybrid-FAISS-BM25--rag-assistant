Magento rewrite headaches

Just need a bit of advice. i have just finish building a site, i have turned on the Web Server Rewrites in the backend to get rid of the index.php But when i go to the frontend it keeps giving me 404 errors I cant seem to figure it out ... Is there anything else i need to do? Cheers
