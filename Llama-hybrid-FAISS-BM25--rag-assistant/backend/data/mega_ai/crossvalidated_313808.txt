Unbiased estimator of distribution function in two-stage randomization design

Apologies for a long post. I believe the answer of my questions involve basic statistics though I am reading it in the context of two-stage randomization design. The questions appear in the unbiasedness section. The other two sections ( model framwork and estimator ) only describe the relevant things in two-stage randomization design. Definition: In a two-stage randomization design, patients are initially randomized to an initial treatment and then depending upon their response and consent, are further randomized to a maintenance treatment. Model Framework in two-stage randomization design: Let treatment $A$, at levels $A_1$ and $A_2$, and treatment $B$, at levels $B_1$ and $B_2$, be the initial and maintenance treatments, respectively. In the two-stage trial, patients are randomized initially to one of the $A$ treatment levels. If a patient achieves remission and consent to further participation, he is then randomized to a level of $B$. An objective of the study is to estimate the treatment policy $A_jB_k$ $j,k=1,2$, which we define as "treat with $A_j$ followed by $B_k$ if remission and consent". Assume that each subject $i$ has an associated set of random variables $(R_{1i},R_{2i},T_{11i},T_{12i},T_{21i},T_{22i}),$ where $R_{1i}$ is the remission/consent status that $i$ would achieve were $i$ assigned to one of the policies $A_1B_k,$ $k=1,2,$ and similarly for $R_{2i}$. Implicit is the assumption that potential remission/consent status is a function only of the $A$ treatment level for a given policy and not on the subsequent $B$ treatment that the policy would dictate. The $T_{jki},$ $j,k=1,2$, represent the potential survival times $i$ would achieve if assigned to policy $A_jB_k$. Suppose $X_i$ is the $A$ treatment assignment indicator, $X_i=j-1$ if $i$ is randomized to $A_j$, so that $$X_i= \begin{cases} 0, & \text{if $i$ randomized to $A_1$} \\ 1, & \text{if $i$ randomized to $A_2$} \end{cases}.$$ The observed remission/consent status $R_i=R_{1i}(1-X_i)+R_{2i}X_{i}.$ $$R_i= \begin{cases} 0, & \text{if no remission or consent} \\ 1, & \text{if no remission and consent} \end{cases}.$$ Let $Z_i$ be the $B$ assignment indicator and defined only if $R_i=1$, $$Z_i= \begin{cases} 0, & \text{if $i$th patient get remission/consent and randomized to $B_1$} \\ 1, & \text{if $i$th patient get remission/consent and randomized to $B_2$} \end{cases}.$$ Let $C_i$ be the time to censoring. $C_i$ is conditionally independent of $(R_i,R_iZ_i,T_{j1i},T_{j2i})$ given $X_i=j-1, j=1,2$. $\Delta_i=I(T_i\le C_i)$ and $V_i=\min (T_i,C_i)$. Let the $B$ randomization probability is $\pi_{Z_j}$. Consider $A_1B_1$. Ideally, if all subjects were assigned to $A_1B_1$ and there were no censoring, then $V_i = T_i = T_{lli}$, and the natural estimator for $F_{1l}(t)$ is $n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}I(V_i\le t)$. With censoring and randomization to $B$ contingent on remission/consent status, only a subset of the n patients have an observed (uncensored) survival time and have actual treatment consistent with the policy $A_1B_1$. Let $Q_{1i}=1-R_i+(1-\pi_Z)^{-1}R_i(1-Z_i)$. In the cases where $i$'s treatment is consistent with $A_1B_1$, $Q_{1i}$ acts as a weight. Nonremitters consistent with $A_1B_1$ represent themselves and hence receive a weight of one, while if i achieves remission and consents, then $i$ represents $(1-\pi_Z)^{-1}$ remitting/consenting subjects who could have potentially been assigned to $B_1$. With $Q_{2i}=1-R_i+\pi_Z^{-1}R_i Z_i$, an analogous argument may be made for policy $A_1B_2$. Estimator: These considerations motivate the estimator $$\hat F_{1k}(t)=n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\Delta_i Q_{ki}}{\hat K(V_i)}I(V_i\le t),\ldots (1)$$ for $k=1,2,$ where $\hat K(t)=\prod_{u\le t}\frac{Y(u)-dN^c(u)}{Y(u)}$ is the Kaplan-Meier estimate of the censoring survivor curve, with $N^c(u)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}I(V_i\le u, \Delta_i=0)$ and $Y(u)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}I(V_i\ge u)$. Unbiasedness: To show $\hat F_{1k}(t)$ is unbiased estimator of $F_{1k}(t)$, the authors 1 then proceed as follows: $\mathbb E[\frac{\Delta_i Q_{1i}}{K(V_i)}I(V_i\le t)]$ $\color{blue}{\text{[over which random variable this expectation is? Is it $\mathbb E_V(.)$ or}}$ $\color{blue}{\text{$\mathbb E_R(.)$ or $\mathbb E_Z(.)$ or anything else?]}}$ $=\mathbb E[\frac{I(T_{11i} $=\mathbb E[\frac{I(T_{11i}\le t) Q_{1i}}{K(T_{11i})} \mathbb E\{ I(T_{11i} $\color{blue}{\text{[over which random variables the 1st and 2nd expectations are?]}}$ $=\mathbb E[\frac{I(T_{11i}\le t) Q_{1i}}{K(T_{11i})} K(T_{11i})]$ $\color{blue}{\text{[How $\mathbb E\{ I(T_{11i} $=\mathbb E[I(T_{11i}\le t) Q_{1i}]\color{blue}{\text{[over which random variable this single expectation is?]}}$ $=\mathbb E[\mathbb E\{I(T_{11i}\le t) Q_{1i}|R_i,T_{11i}\}]$ $\color{blue}{\text{[over which random variables the 1st and 2nd expectations are?]}}$ $=\mathbb E\{I(T_{11i}\le t)\mathbb E(Q_{1i}|R_i,T_{11i})\}$ $=F_{11(t)},$ which follows by noting that $\mathbb E(Q_{1i}|R_i,T_{11i})\}=1-R_i+(1-\pi_Z)^{-1}\mathbb E\{R_i(1-Z_i)|R_i,T_{11i}\}=1$ from considering the cases $R_i=0$ and $R_i=1$ in turn. Another question: does $\mathbb E[\frac{\Delta_i Q_{1i}}{K(V_i)}I(V_i\le t)]=F_{1k}(t)$ imply $\mathbb E[\hat F_{1k}(t)]=\mathbb E[n^{-1}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\Delta_i Q_{ki}}{\hat K(V_i)}I(V_i\le t)]=F_{1k}(t)$? $\color{purple}{\text{Thanks a lot for your attention.}}$ 1 Lunceford, J.
