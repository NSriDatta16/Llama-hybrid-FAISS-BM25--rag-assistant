Fitted values of ARMA model

I'm trying to understand how fitted values are calculated for ARMA(p,q) models. I've already found a question on here concerning fitted values of ARMA processes but haven't been able to make sense of it. If I have a ARMA(1,1) model, i. e. $$X_t = \alpha_1X_{t-1}+\epsilon_t - \beta_1 \epsilon_{t-1}$$ and am given a (stationary) time series I can estimate the parameters. How would I calculate the fitted values using those estimates. For an AR(1) model the fitted values are given by $$\hat{X_t} = \hat{\alpha_1}X_{t-1} . $$ Since the innovations in an ARMA model are unobservable how would I use the estimate of the MA parameter? Would I just ignore the MA part and calculate the fitted values of the AR part?
