Bork Blatt mentioned Ethereal, which has been renamed to Wireshark for various reasons, so go to the new site directly. I've never tried editing packets in Wireshark, but you do get the option to save out the packets so you can work with the files offline to change the packets. Do get started with this, check out the libpcap file format documentation.
