There is a book from O'Reilly called " Feature Engineering for Machine Learning " by Zheng et al. I read the book and it covers different types of data (e.g categorical, text...) and describes different aspects of feature engineering that go with it. This includes things like normalization of data, feature selection, tf-idf in text.
