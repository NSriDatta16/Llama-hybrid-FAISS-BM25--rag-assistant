I'm using Jeff Wilcox's framework (it's the same one that you referenced up above as Scott Gu's), with some success. It's not precisely elegant, but it ends up doing what I need it to do. It's what the Silverlight team uses internally, so it should presumably cover most of what needs to be covered. And since it's just executing in the browser, there's nothing in it that should keep it from working correctly with Express. Do make sure you get the right version, i.e., you want the DLLs that come with the Silverlight Toolkit up on Codeplex. At one point, I'd ended up with an older version, and many of my problems went away once I got the most recent bits. If you're having trouble getting it to work correctly, perhaps you could post your problem as a separate question. I know that Jeff Wilcox hangs out here on occasion, and has answered some of my questions about it before.
