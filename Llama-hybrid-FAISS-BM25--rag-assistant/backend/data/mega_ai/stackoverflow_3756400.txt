I am a research professor who has published many articles in the Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems Conference (AAMAS): the main vehicle for multiagent research. MAS is a term used by researchers (coined around 1995, for the first International Conference on Multiagent Systems (ICMAS) , which brought together the Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) and the Autonomous Agents research communities under one tent: the MAS tent) that refers to algorithms and methods for organizing teams of autonomous agents. Researchers in MAS have developed algorithms for Robot soccer (see Robocup ), coordinating autonomous robot rovers (as in Mars rovers), distributed allocation of resources (who does which task), and many other domains. I don't see that there is any "hype" as you describe. You can read all the papers in past conferences and each one clearly states what the author tried to accomplish, how he tried it, and what the results were. I do not know of anyone making silly claims about the power of these techniques: they are all just algorithms (isn't everything). No magic here. The question do you think that we can already achieve everything MAS has to offer but with simple more elegant solutions? is incorrect in that, if you can solve a MAS problem with a simple and more elegant solution, your solution is now a MAS solution! MAS is a problem domain, along with the solutions we found so far. If you find a better solution then, awesome, publish it and join the MAS community. As an aside, I see this confusion often. Journeymen programmers don't realize that research communities are (usually) defined by the problem they work on, not a solution approach.
