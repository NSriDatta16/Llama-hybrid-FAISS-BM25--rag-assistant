PHP core function printing debug statements

I'm integrating a framework ( Kohana 2.3.4), into a web-app ( IPB 2.3.4/2.3.6) via a third party bridge library ( IPBWI 2.07), and I began seeing the string NOT FOUND at the top of the web-page output. How can I turn that message off? I narrowed it down to a call to class_exists(...) in IPB. The call is working correctly, except for the printing of the "NOT FOUND" message. When executed by itself (not invoked by Kohana via the IPBWI) the message is not printed. What is strange is that I've identified calls to the same method in Kohana which are invoked earlier, but do not print the message. echo 'Calling class_exists '; if ( ! class_exists( 'db_main' ) ) echo 'class_exists returns false '; ... results in: Calling class_exists() NOT FOUND class_exists() returns false Note that it is not only printing 'NOT FOUND' but following it with an html tag as though intended for runtime debugging. I'm not very familiar with PHP, but is there some global debug setting that is being enabled? What sorts of flags should I check?
