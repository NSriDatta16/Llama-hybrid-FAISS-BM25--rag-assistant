Estimate return levels for non-annual data

Apologies if this has been asked before - I have looked but could not find anything. I intend on estimating return levels for average annual temperature data using a number of different distributions. This is made relatively simple when the quantile function is available: p = 1/return_period quantile(p, parameters, distribution) However, I am also interested in return levels for temperature data averaged over 5 years. To prevent data being included more than once I extracted 5 year blocks e.g. (1900-1904, 1905-1909, 1910-1914...). However, I wondered how this changed the return level estimation? I assumed the correct method would be: p = 1/return_period/block quantile(p, parameters, distribution) However, I'm not finding much difference in parameter estimation (MLE) between the full dataset and extracted blocks, leading me to think the above method may not correct. How do you estimate return levels for 5 year block data?
