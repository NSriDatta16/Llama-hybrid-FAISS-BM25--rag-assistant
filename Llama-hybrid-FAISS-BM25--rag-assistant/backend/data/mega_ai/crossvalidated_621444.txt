Can I make a proportional-to-size without replacement sample (PPS WOR) self weighted?

Let's say I have 100 schools and each has a different number of students. I want to estimate which % of students are in schools with electricity. Simulation and theory indicate it is more efficient to give a higher probability to schools with a larger number of students. If I do a proportion-to-size with replacement sample, I am able to get a self weighted sample, where my estimator is a plain average of the sample (no weighted needed). Below is my logic (if you already know this is correct, you can skip to the questions): Let's say we have: A sample selected proportional to the student size of the school (with replacement) A sample size 2 Based on this, let's say we got the following sample: 1, 0 (with 1 being the school has electricity); a good estimate of the proportion of students with electricity I think would be: $s_i =$ number of students school i $s_t =$ total number of students $\bar{y} =$ estimate of proportion of students that have electricity $$ \bar{y} =\frac{\frac{s_1 \frac{1}{\frac{s_1}{s_t}} + s_2 \frac{0}{\frac{s_2}{s_t}}}{2}}{s_t} $$ which is the same as $$ \bar{y} =\frac{\frac{s_t\cdot1 + s_t\cdot0}{2}}{s_t} = \frac{1 + 0}{2} = 0.5 $$ Which is the sample average. Question 1: Does this look right? Basically, the selection probability compensates for the school size, and the average now represents the proportion of students rather than the proportion of schools. Question 2: Is there a way that I can design my sample so the calculation is a plain average of the sample with sampling without replacement ? I have read a few papers, and I haven't found an answer to this question. Thanks in advance!
