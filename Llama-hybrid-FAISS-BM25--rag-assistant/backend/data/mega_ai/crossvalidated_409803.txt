PCA scores (or PCA results) are used in the literature to calculate Mahalanobis distance between sample and a distribution of samples. For an example, see this article . Under the "Analysis methods" section, the authors state: Data sets of fluorescence spectra (681) are reduced into a lower dimension (11) by evaluating the principal components (PCs) of the correlation matrix (681 Ã— 681). PC scores are estimated by projecting the original data along the PCs. Classification among the data sets has been done using Mahalanobis distance model by computing Mahalanobis distances for the PC scores. I have seen other examples of PCA/Mahalanobis distance based discriminant analysis in the literature and in the help menu of the GRAMS IQ chemometrics software. This combination makes sense since Mahalanobis distance does not work well when the number of variables is greater than the number of available samples, and PCA reduces the number of variables. One-class classification machine learning algorithms (i.e. Isolation Forest, One-ClassSVM, etc.) are possible alternatives to the PCA/Mahalanobis distance based discriminant analysis. In our lab, Isolation Forest combined with data pre-processing has produced good results in the classification of Near Infrared spectra. On a slightly related note, outlier or novelty detection with PCA/Mahalanobis distance, for high dimentional data, often requires calculation of the Mahalanobis distance cutoff . This article suggests that the cutoff can be calculated as the square root of the chi-squared distribution's critical value , assuming that the data is normally distributed. This critical value requires the number of degrees of freedom and the probability value associated with the data. The article appears to suggest that the number of principal components retained equals the number of degrees of freedom needed to calculate the critical value because the authors used the number of features in the data set for their calculation.
