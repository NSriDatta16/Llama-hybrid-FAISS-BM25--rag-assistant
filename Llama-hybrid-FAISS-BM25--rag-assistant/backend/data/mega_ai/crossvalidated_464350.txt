I am a little unclear what your question is, and in particular what you want to know from the interaction of time-varying x with t . But let me elaborate on your current model, which is: lmer(y ~ t * x + (1 + t | id), data=df) This models y as a linear function of t ime, x , and the interaction of x and t . It further allows for the linear association between t ime and y to vary across persons (random slope - (1+t|id) . So each person gets their own linear rate of change in y . The interaction between t ime and x assesses whether the time-varying association between x and y is different depending on the value of t . Or equivalently, whether the linear rate of change in y varies as a function of time-varying x . Interactions between time and a time-varying variable can be difficult to interpret. Accordingly, it may be more meaningful to think about whether the rate of change in y depends on an individual's average value on x . This would entail calculating the mean value of x for each individual, e.g. using dplyr : df % group_by(id) %>% mutate(pmn_x=mean(x)) %>% ungroup() lmer(y ~ t * x + pmn_x + pmn_x:t + (1 + t | id), data=df) This model is also advantageous because by including pmn_x , you separate out the time-varying portion of x from the time-invariant portion of x ( pmn_x ). And because both interact with t , the interaction is also separated into a pure within-person interaction effect ( t*x ) and a pure between-person interaction effect ( pmn_x:t ). Again, whether this is useful depends on what your question is.
