If you want to take into account database changes, you will have no other choice than querying the database or ... you must somewhere cache the changes in memory if you use just one web server. The latter is only an option if you don't have too many data or enough memory available. The most elegant way to query something like the following, but this is something very difficult to achieve in Django 1.0 without using SQL: SELECT COUNT(*) + 1 FROM images WHERE images.field (where field is the field of field you use for ordering your images) To use raw SQL in Django, you can read this page for more information. Then you know the position of your image, and you can easily calculate the page the item is in.
