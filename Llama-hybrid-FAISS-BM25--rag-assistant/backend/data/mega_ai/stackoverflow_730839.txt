As it is, it would be a bad idea. You will scarify security with easy usage. As said before SSL will only protect the transfer of information between the server and client browser and will only prevent the middle man attack. Emails are very risky and insecure. The best would be a User name and password authentication to access the information. I like the cookie idea more or less. You should encrypt the cookie information as well. You should also generate the token with salt and key phrase plus the $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] to limit the probability of an attack. Store as much nonsensitive information about the client in the cookie for verification usage. The key phrase could be stored in the cookie for easy usage but keep in mind that also cookie can be stolen =(. Better let the client type the key phrase that he provided, which is also stored in the database along with his data. Or, the key can be used in case the person uses a different machine which differs in the $_SERVER['HTTP_USER_AGENT'] parameters or simply misses the cookie. So the cookie can be transfered or set. Also make sure that sensitive data is encrypted in the database. You never know ;)
