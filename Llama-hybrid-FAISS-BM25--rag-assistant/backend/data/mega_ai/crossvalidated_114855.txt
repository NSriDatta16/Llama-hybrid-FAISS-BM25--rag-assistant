Model selection: where to start?

For a general modeling problem, there are literally at least a dozen choices of statistical and algorithmic models to choose from. Off the top of my head, choices could be: regression (and its variants), neural networks (and its variants), SVM (and its variants), random forests (and its variants), etc. So what I'm asking about isn't much about what is referred to 'model selection'. I'm looking for a guide that can help me (intelligently) choose candidate models. Or is this process more of an art? I'm not looking for models specialized for certain data types. I'm looking for models that generically model tabular data. I tried consulting with Google but it wasn't of much help. Surely, there must be a guide on how to begin the model selection process.
