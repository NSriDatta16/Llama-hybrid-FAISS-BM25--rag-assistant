There can be some valid rationales for what you call "bivariate" analysis. For example, analysis of survival as a function of each individual predictor variable (a set of "bivariate" analyses in your terminology) gives clinicians assurance that the patient cohort being studied is reasonably representative. Clinicians might not be able to keep track in their heads the complex associations seen in multiple-predictor models, but for example in cancer studies they do know several single-predictor associations that should be expected in a representative patient cohort. There should be shorter survival for those with higher disease stage, smokers having some types of cancer should have shorter survival than non-smokers, certain disease characteristics (e.g, involvement of human papillomavirus) should be related to survival, etc. None of these single-predictor associations necessarily has causal or mechanistic significance, and may well be related to associations with other predictors, but they are descriptive characteristics expected of a type of patient cohort. That said, your argument and that in @PaulHewson's answer are completely on point for analysis. Particularly in logistic regression and survival analysis, with their inherent omitted-variable biases, multiple-predictor models are needed. Use of an arbitrary p -value cutoff to choose those predictors can be misleading. See the link to model selection threads provided by @whuber for extensive discussion. Note that many prefer to reserve the term "multivariate" for situations with multiple outcome variables. I took your use of the term to represent a situation with multiple predictor variables.
