As Rob said if it is a sequence collected at time intervals it is by one definition a time series. It is another question as whether or not there is an temporal structure within the sequence. One could consider a sequence of numbers that are independently distributed as being generated from a mean model (0,0,0)(0,0,0) with perhaps some pulses or unusual values. In this light a sequence of numbers that is measured with a fixed frequency e.g. 1 every minute/hour/day/month could be referred to as a cross-sectional series if there is no evidented structure between successive values such as an ARIMA structure or a deterministic based structure such as level shifts, seasonal-pulses and/or local time trends even though it was collected at specific intervals of time. All of this having been said , if a series can be classified as having no temporal dependency then one might refer to it as being equivalent to a non-time series and treat it accordingly. I suggest that the OP program or acquire such functionality software that delivers parsimonious automatic ARIMA and the detection of seasonal pulses, level shifts, local time trends and various combinations of these two structures. If he finds that there is no proof of any of these structures being evident then he might classify it as a "non-time series" or as Michael opined "white noise" or informationless using time structures.
