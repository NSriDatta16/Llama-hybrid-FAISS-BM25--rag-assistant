What statistical analysis should we use for this aviation study?

I am helping a friend with an aviation research study. We have two categorical variables for our IV (Group 1 consists of low-cost airlines, Group 2 consist of legacy carriers), our dependent variable is continuous (Average Arrival Delay in minutes). For example, in a span of 5 years, airline X in group 1 might have an average arrival delay of 5 minutes for all flights, and airline Y in group 2 might have an average delay of 3 minutes for all flights. Essentially, we are trying to see if there is a difference in average delays (in minutes) between group 1 or 2. The only data we have access to for the DV is the average arrival delay in minutes for each airline. Is this enough data? Since we have a categorical IV and continuous DV should we do an ANOVA? Our DV is normally distributed.
