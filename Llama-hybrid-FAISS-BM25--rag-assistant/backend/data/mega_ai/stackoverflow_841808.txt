WPF: Display a bool value as "Yes" / "No"

I have a bool value that I need to display as "Yes" or "No" in a TextBlock. I am trying to do this with a StringFormat, but my StringFormat is ignored and the TextBlock displays "True" or "False". Is there something wrong with my syntax, or is this type of StringFormat not supported? I know I can use a ValueConverter to accomplish this, but the StringFormat solution seems more elegant (if it worked).
