I would try with the lime framework. It works with many models (including random forest). It can be used for local interpretation (that is, explaining a single prediction) or for global interpretation (that is, explaining a whole model). Quoting from the asbtract In this work, we propose LIME, a novel explanation technique that explains the predictions of any classifier in an interpretable and faithful manner, by learning an interpretable model locally around the prediction. We also propose a method to explain models by presenting representative individual predictions and their explanations in a non-redundant way, framing the task as a submodular optimization problem. It has packages both for R and python , and many examples if you google it.
