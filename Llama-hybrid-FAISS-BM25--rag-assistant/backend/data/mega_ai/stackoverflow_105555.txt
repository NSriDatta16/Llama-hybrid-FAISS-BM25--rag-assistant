@BRH: Great insight. I would echo all of the "Pros" and "Cons" 2, 4, & 5 and your final overview. I kind of get the sense that they didn't intend to displace any of the market for upstream frameworks ... but if they could do so and keep it as tight and comprehensible as it is, I hope they do! I like the way they think! P.S. I don't know if it is new, but there is a tag that injects fragments into the page prior to server-side script execution that might be a help in some code-reuse scenarios. There may be more for me to discover along those lines.
