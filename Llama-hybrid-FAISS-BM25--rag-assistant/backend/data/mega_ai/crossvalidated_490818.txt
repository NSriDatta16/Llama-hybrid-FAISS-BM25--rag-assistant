how to explain in a statistical way, if revenue increase in several store but overall no change

Let's say, Target has implemented a new store management methodology and applied to 100 stores went well as revenue increase. but once extend to all 1000 stores not seeing the lift of revenue. How to analyze/explain this in a statistical way? I was thinking about this is kinda a quasi-experiment based on the different time intervals. first, the revenue increase might not be significant. second, the interrupted time series usually have concerns that the two different time interval will introduce temporal variant. so the treatment and control are not independent. What is a good comprehensive way to explain this?
