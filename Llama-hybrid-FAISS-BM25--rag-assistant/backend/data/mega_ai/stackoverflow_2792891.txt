private class calling a method from its outer class

Ok, so I have a class for a "Advanced Data Structure" (in this case a kinda tree) SO I implimented a Iterator as a private class with in it. So the iterator needs to implement a remove function to remove the last retuirned element. now my ADT already impliments a remove function, and in this case there is very little (thinking about it, i think nothing) to be gain by implimenting a different remove function for the iterator. so how do I go about calling the remove from my ADT sketch of my struture: public class ADT { ... private class ADT_Iterator impliments java.util.Itorator{ ... public void remove(){ //where I want to call the ADT's remove function from } ... public void remove( Object paramFoo ) { ... } ... } So just calling remove(FooInstance) won't work (will it?) and this.remove(FooInstance) is the same thing. what do i call? (and changign the name of the ADT's remove function is not an option, as that AD T has to meet an Interace wich I am note at liberty to change) I could make both of them call a removeHelper functon, I guess...
