StringTokenizer was always there. It is the fastest of all, but the enumeration-like idiom might not look as elegant as the others. split came to existence on JDK 1.4. Slower than tokenizer but easier to use, since it is callable from the String class. Scanner came to be on JDK 1.5. It is the most flexible and fills a long standing gap on the Java API to support an equivalent of the famous Cs scanf function family.
