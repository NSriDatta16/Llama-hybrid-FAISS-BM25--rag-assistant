Your question is very vague; are you looking for examples of unit/automated/test tools written in these languages? Here are some automation resources that I think would help you clarify your question a bit. Selenium is a toolkit that will allow you to write DOM-rich automated tests and run them within a variety of browsers. There are wrappers for selensese (the language that interacts with the running DOM during tests) in a variety of languages. My organization uses Selenium-RC along with PHPUnit to write Selenium test cases for our web application. Watir is a ruby-based framework that allows testing similar in nature to selenium. The tests are written in ruby, but the test coverage that they add is over Javascript, rendered PHP; the tests are automated. Each of these systems provides what I would consider to be integration tests. Selenium has been implemented in PHP by PHPUnit, so you have everything available to you in these test cases that you would have in a unit test. The difference is purely semantic. You're testing functionality of the site, rather than the ability of a small unit of the code to respond to something specific.
