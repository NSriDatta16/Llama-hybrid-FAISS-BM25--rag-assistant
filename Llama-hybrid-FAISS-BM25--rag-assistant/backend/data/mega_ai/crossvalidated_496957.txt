SVM Model: What's a healthy number of support vectors?

For a SVM model what is a healthy number of support vectors? or more precisely what's a good ratio of number of support vectors to the total number of training samples, 10%, 20%, 30%, 50% ... 80%? Is there a general consensus on this? By healthy I mean that the SVM model is a good fit and has good generalization power. For example, I fit a SVM model with 50 predictors, two response classes and the support ratio is about 25%. I have solid out of sample performance i.e. F1, accuracy etc all scoring higher OS than IS but does this support ratio makes sense or is it too high?
