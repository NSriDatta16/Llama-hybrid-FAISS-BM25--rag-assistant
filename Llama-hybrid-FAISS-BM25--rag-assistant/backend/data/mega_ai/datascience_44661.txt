If I were you I would start by learning how to make simple neural networks for image recognition. I started by the book of Aurelien Gueron which contains a good introduction to tensorflow, a python library for neural networks. There is also a very large literature on the web, have a look at this which has links to interesting examples of python image recognition, natural language processing, and more problems.
