This should work: ^[Rr][Rr]\d+ *[Ss]\d+ *[Cc]\d+$ or as per other comment ^[Rr][Rr][0-9]+ *[Ss][0-9]+ *[Cc][0-9]+$ What it all means: ^ - start of string [Rr] - next char must be a R or r [Rr] - next char must be a R or r \d+ or [0-9]+ - next part must be 1 or more digits (space)* - allow for 0 or more spaces [Ss] - next char must be a S or s \d+ or [0-9]+ - next part must be 1 or more digits (space)* - allow for 0 or more spaces [Cc] - next char must be a C or c \d+ or [0-9]+ - next part must be 1 or more digits $ - end of string There might be a more elegant solution but this is pretty easy to read.
