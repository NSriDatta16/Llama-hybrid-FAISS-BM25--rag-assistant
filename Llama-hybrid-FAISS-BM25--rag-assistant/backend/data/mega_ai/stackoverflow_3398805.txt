There is no way to get a list of all instances of some class, so you have to keep track of new instances yourself: List organisms = new List (); Organism bob = new Amoeba(); organisms.Add(bob); Later you can iterate your list of instances and make them all raise the event, one after another: foreach (Organism organism in organisms) { organism.Awake(); }
