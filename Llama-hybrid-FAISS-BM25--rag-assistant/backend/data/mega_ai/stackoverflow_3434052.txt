Some suggestions: Use references instead of pointers, they are usually very similar to pointers in use, but a little bit safer and easier. Just write bool & variable1Ref and then you can use it as a variable. Use initiliazer list in the constructor mixing data and its presentation in one class OptForm is a bad idea. It can be fine for small applications, but things easily get messed up when the application grows. Use a data storage class (Model) and a class to show it (View).
