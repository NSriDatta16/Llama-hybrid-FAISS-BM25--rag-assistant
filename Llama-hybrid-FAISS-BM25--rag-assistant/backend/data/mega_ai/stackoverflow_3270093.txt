Are the includes themselves doing something fancy, like db queries? And are they all at the top of the page, or are they included as-needed? Those stats don't look bad, so, if admin access is infrequent, you may be ok. But you should examine this from a design angle: can things can be organized in a way that would prevent you from having to maintain so many includes? Separate from any performance issues, there is a risk here of creating hard-to-track dependency bugs. (It could be as MainMa said, related to a framework, in which case you may have no control over the above. I only mention it in case you do.) A couple things in case you didn't know already: If it's just text or static HTML, you can get the contents with file_get_contents(), readfile(), etc. This is somewhat faster because the loaded file doesn't need parsing. But obviously if it contains PHP code this won't help. You can use include_once() to prevent the same file from being included twice (if, for instance, it's included by two files that are themselves included by the top level file).
