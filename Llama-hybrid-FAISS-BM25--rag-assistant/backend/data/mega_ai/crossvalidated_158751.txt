Is it possible to derive Leverage figures without a Hat Matrix?

I ran into an impasse while attempting to write code for Cook's Distance: when a regression model reaches only a moderate size, I can't derive a Hat Matrix through my normal matrix math routines without receiving intractable locking errors (it's an inherent limitation of the platform). The good news is that I can calculate pretty much every other type of regression stat effortlessly on far larger models, like RSS, Norms of Residuals, MSE, RMSD, MAPE, Explained Sum of Squares, Fraction of Variation Unexplained, R2, Lack of Fit Sum of Squares, Pure Error, Total Sum of Squares, inverse covariance matrices, you name it. Observed, predicted and residual values are trivial. Is there any alternate route to calculate the Leverage values backwards from these or any other regression stats? Hat Matrices are probably the most mathematically succinct method of reaching these answers, but in this case they're not an option so I need an equivalent method. I did some searches on CrossValidated over the last few months for the terms "Hat Matrix" and "Leverage," but have yet to find any posts that would address my issue; the only remotely relevant candidate I spotted was an equation posted by Glen_B in Which of these points in this plot has the highest leverage and why? , but I'm not certain that it applies. As always, my overall goal is to teach myself these concepts and acquire the skills to code them myself, so replies that incorporate some problem-solving on my part are even better than ready-made answers.
