Updated Answer:# This listing of compiler errors says: You must explicitly call the constructor of the base class with a super() statement if it has 1 or more required arguments. Given your error ( 1203: No default constructor found in base class com.objects:desertStorm. ), it looks like you are extending desertStorm somewhere and need to call the super() function with the appropriate parameter. This simple example given below will fail with this compiler error: 1203: No default constructor found in base class Class1. Indicating that the issue is in the class that extends Class1 . So find whereever you're extending desertStorm and call the correct super-constructor. Example: package { import flash.display.MovieClip; public class Class1 extends MovieClip { public function Class1(property:String) { super(); } } } package { import flash.display.MovieClip; public class Class2 extends Class1 { public function Class2() { // You need to call the super constructor here. // super("Work!"); } } } Original Answer: If I remove ship from the parameter and keep public function desertStorm(target:Object):void. this is the error i get.... '1203: No default constructor found in base class com.objects:desertStorm.' Im not sure what that means but it sounds like I dont have a constructor when I do Whilst you do have a constructor, you don't have a default constructor. If you have created any instances of desertStorm by dragging them from the library to the stage then you must define a default constructor, such as: public function desertStorm():void { super(); // Do simple initialisation behaviour here. } This is because Flash doesn't know how to instantiate your class if it has a custom constructor - how can it? Instead, move the other behaviour into an initialisation function that knows all about your target object: public function init(target:Object) { this.target = target; health = 2; turret1 = new Torret(); eApi.addGameChild(turret1); } Then you can just instantiate it like this: var ds = new desertStorm(); ds.init(ship); // Do whatever else you need to do with your desertStorm object, e.g.: addChild(ds);
