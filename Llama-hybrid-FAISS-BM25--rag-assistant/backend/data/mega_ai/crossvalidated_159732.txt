Okay to use oneway ANOVA to compare these 3 group proportions from aggregated dataset?

My situation: I am assessing outcomes of a university course redesign. One of the goals of the redesign project was to increase successful course completion, as measured by a decrease in the course DFW rate. (The DFW rate refers to the proportion of students who earn a D, fail, or withdraw.) The redesign was done in phases, and I want to compare the average DFW rates for Phase 1 (the original course), Phase 2 (first redesign), and Phase 3 (second redesign) and estimate the effect size and confidence intervals. My dilemma: I am unsure what test(s) and effect size measures are okay to use with aggregated data, a dependent variable that is a proportion, and, if needed, enable me to account for the fact that each group (Phase) consists of a different number of course sections with a different number of students in each section. What would be the least complicated (but still an appropriate) way to go? My dataset: My dataset is aggregated by course section. There are 33 records, one for each of the on-campus sections taught by a single professor between the Fall of 2005 and Fall of 2013. Aggregate stats are based on all the students in these sections who were taking the course for a letter grade (i.e., not pass/fail or audit credit) and were taking it for the first time.

I'm thinking weights probably ought to be applied to the data since each section's DFW_RATE is derived from a different number of students' grades. From my reading (primarily the Stata help docs/base reference in this case), it seems "analytic weights" based on the variable STUDENTS would be most appropriate. (As far as I can tell, SPSS only gives you the option to use "frequency weights") I'm not certain if/how the standard deviations ( DFW_SD ) associated with the section DFW rates should be used. A one-way ANOVA with analytic weights seems like it would be the simplest (even if a bit simplistic) way to test for overall statistical significance using the current dataset. I could then follow-up with Bonferroni-corrected post-hoc comparisons of the means (or should it be proportions?) of PHASE 1 vs 2, PHASE 2 vs 3, and PHASE 3 vs 1. I may be overlooking something obvious or doing something incorrectly, but I'm not seeing any major violations of the ANOVA assumptions: - Despite being bounded between 0 and 1 and having values generally below .2, DFW_RATE is approximately normally distributed at each level of PHASE (per Shapiro-Wilk test) - Per Levene's test, no evidence of heterogenous variances - The group sizes are unequal, which is a consideration but not a crucial assumption - Regarding the independence of observations assumption, no student is in more than one section (course repeats were removed prior to data aggregation) and all students had the same instructor. The section number ( SECTION ) is associated neither with PHASE nor with DFW_RATE , and there is no apparent statistical dependence between time ( TERM ) and DFW_RATE among sections taught using the same course design (same PHASE ). However, ANOVA treats PHASE as nominal and not ordinal (to what extent is this problematic?). In terms of which effect size measures to use with ANOVA, would either eta-squared or omega-squared work? For the omnibus test and post-hoc comparisons, do weights need to be applied somehow when calculating effect size and CIs? My software: I have been working in Stata v.13.1 but have SPSS 22.0 as well and have R installed too (though am less familiar with it). My gratitude: Thanks in advance for your help!
