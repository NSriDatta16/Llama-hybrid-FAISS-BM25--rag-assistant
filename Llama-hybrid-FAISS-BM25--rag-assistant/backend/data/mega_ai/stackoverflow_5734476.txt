Flash Builder Output is Blank

I am a Flash Builder 4 noobie here, and I began working on a simple application, to try out FB 4. However, I am having a problem. When a compile and run the application, the output is entirely blank. The HTML wrapper page does contain the flash application, but the content is blank, even though I have a simple label component on the stage. Also I noticed that when I right-click on the flash object, the default context menu appears, displaying the "Zoom In", "Zoom Out", "Show All", etc... options which are removed from the application by default. If you are interested, here is my code, as easy as it gets. :) I am running Flash Player 10.2. Can anyone help work out this issue? Thank you for your time, spryno724
