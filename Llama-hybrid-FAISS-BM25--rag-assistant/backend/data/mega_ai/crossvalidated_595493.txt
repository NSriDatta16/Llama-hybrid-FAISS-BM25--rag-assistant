Appropriate Test for Binary Dependent Variable and Continuous Independent Variable

I have a dataset of observations of hawks foraging. I am trying to examine the relationship between height of perch used (continuous independent variable, integers of 0 through 10) and outcome of a foraging attempt (binary: success or fail). I'd like to answer the question, are hawks more successful at shorter or taller perches. Would it be appropriate to use a linear regression or is there something more apropos?
