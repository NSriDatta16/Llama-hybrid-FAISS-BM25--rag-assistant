Is there a way to have class variables with setter/getter like virtual variables?

I am embedding Ruby into my C project and want to load several files that define a class inherited from my own parent class. Each inherited class needs to set some variables on initialization and I don't want to have two different variables for Ruby and C. Is there a way to define a class variable that has an own custom setter/getter or is this a stupid way to handle it? Maybe it would be better with a custom datatype?
