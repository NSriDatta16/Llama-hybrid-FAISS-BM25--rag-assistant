as suggested, db/seeds can be used for some use cases, you can also checkout this solution: http://jedschneider.posterous.com/using-semi-static-data-as-an-activerecord-mod that may address other use cases. In regards to cucumber, the true cucumber philosophy would be to create a resource through the web interface, eg to create a user: go to user sign in, register, sign in as that user. They discourage direct model access (page 292 ish), but it is too convenient to not do, in my opinion, as long as the web interface workflow is also tested. For this, I prefer using factories over fixtures as they are less fragile in on-going development. I would recommend factory_girl or factory_girl_rails for Rails 3. Thus you can have a step definition: /Given a valid user exists?/ do @user = Factory(:user) end which populates the user table with a user an creates an instance variable that you can use to follow through the scenario with. If you want to use fixtures with cucumber, setup a before hook that will load your fixtures for you.
