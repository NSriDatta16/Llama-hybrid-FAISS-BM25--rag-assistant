I provided my own account of the similarities and differences between PCA and FA in the following thread: Is there any good reason to use PCA instead of EFA? Also, can PCA be a substitute for factor analysis? Note that my account is somewhat different from the one by @ttnphns (as presented in his answer above). My main claim is that PCA and FA are not as different as is often thought. They can indeed strongly differ when the number of variables is very low, but tend to yield quite similar results once the number of variables is over around a dozen. See my [long!] answer in the linked thread for mathematical details and Monte Carlo simulations. For a much more concise version of my argument see here: Under which conditions do PCA and FA yield similar results? Here I would like to explicitly answer your main question: Is there anything wrong with performing PCA and FA on the same data set? My answer to this is: No. When running PCA or FA, you are not testing any hypothesis. Both of them are exploratory techniques that are used to get a better understanding of the data. So why not explore the data with two different tools? In fact, let's do it! Example: wine data set As an illustration, I used a fairly well-known wine dataset with $n=178$ wines from three different grapes described by $p=13$ variables. See my answer here: What are the differences between Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis? for mode details, but briefly -- I ran both PCA and FA analysis and made 2D biplots for both of them. One can easily see that the difference is minimal:
