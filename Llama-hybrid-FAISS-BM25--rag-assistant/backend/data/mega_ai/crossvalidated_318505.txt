Usually there are two ways to model time-series in Deep Learning: Recurrent Neural Networks like LSTM (there are many resources if you google). You should be able to implement those in PyMC3, especially if they are supported by Lasagne. Placing a stochastic process like random-walk or ARMA on the parameters of your neural network. See my blog post for more info: http://twiecki.github.io/blog/2017/03/14/random-walk-deep-net/
