AUC vs error rate for classification

I'm trying to build a recommendation system, and have a bunch of (item,item_features,liked) triplets, where liked is binary. Most items are not liked. So I'm running a logistic regression with glmnet of the form liked ~ item_features This yields an AUC of around 0.75 (it doesn't vary much with the regularization parameter). However, the error rate (also doesn't vary much) is only a tiny,tiny bit better than what you would get if you just always predicted "don't like." What is the best way (or any way, really!) to think about the value or lack thereof this recommender?
