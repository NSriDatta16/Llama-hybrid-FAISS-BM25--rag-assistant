Does the model(best fitting line/curve) changes when the training data is changed in the cross validation?

From my understanding - a machine learning algorithm goes through the inputs (independent variables) and predicts the output (dependent variable). I believe, what line/curve would best define the training data will depend on the training data. When it decides the best line or curve, the new inputs are plotted and based on plotting, the target variables are found. My question is, during the cross-validation, the training data changes, due to the difference in splits, shouldn't that change the best fitting line, and shouldn't that make K different models(=number of splits)? If yes (it makes K different model), then what use would that be? If no, then where am I going wrong?
