What I've done for this is created a function that you give the slave / master elements to, which creates a bind() function for the master (I'm only allowing a drag from the master in this case, you can work around this I'm sure), which makes the slave follow it around using standard jQuery css. function overlap(slave,master) { $('a#groupTheseBlocks').click(function(){ master.bind('drag', groupBlocks); slave.draggable('disable'); // remember where the slave is in relation to the master sLeftRef = (slave.offset().left - master.offset().left); sTopRef = (slave.offset().top - master.offset().top); }); function groupBlocks() { var left = master.offset().left; var top = master.offset().top; slave.draggable('disable'); slave.css('left', (left + sLeftRef) + 'px'); slave.css('top', (top + sTopRef) + 'px'); } } I guess I'll post more to this once I have a working example. As it stands this is working for me. What is missing is a way to call overlap(slave, master) with the elements you want to group together. I'm doing this in a really specific way. You can clever a way to do it, I'm sure.
