Linear regression for multi-class classification

Linear regression can be used for binary classification where it competes with logistic regression. While the fitted values from linear regression are not restricted to lie between 0 and 1, unlike those from logistic regression that are interpreted as class probabilities, linear regression can still successfully assign class labels based on some threshold on fitted values (e.g. a threshold of 0.5). Logistic regression can be used for multi-class classification by applying it repeatedly as one-against-the rest classification. Can linear regression be used for multi-class classification in the same way (one against all, repeat for each class)? Or is there some inherent feature that would to make it fail?
