Trying to get MKPolygon overlay working

Trying to figure out this MKPolygon working. I've created a whole heap MKMapPoints and placed them into an array. Then I make a Polygon out of them with: [MKPolygon polygonWithPoints:pointArr count:sqlite3_column_int(countStatement, 0)]; and add that to an Array for retrieval later. Later I loop through the array and add each object (MKPolygon) to the map with: [mapView addOverlay:[overlays objectAtIndex:i]]; And this according to logs works fine. I then implement mapView: viewForOverlay: like so - (MKOverlayView *)mapView:(MKMapView *)mapView viewForOverlay:(id )overlay { MKOverlayView *theOverlayView = nil; for (MKPolygon *theOverlay in overlays) { if (theOverlay == overlay) { MKPolygonView *thePolygonView = [[[MKPolygonView alloc] initWithPolygon:theOverlay] autorelease]; theOverlayView = thePolygonView; } } return theOverlayView; } As far as I can see this should technically work. But it doesn't, the App just crashes when it gets to the region of the map that I think its on (points may be wrong because of lat long mixup or conversion mistake but thats another thing) Am I missing some property I need to set or could the incorrect points be causing the crash? Or am I missing it entirely? Cheers for any help.
