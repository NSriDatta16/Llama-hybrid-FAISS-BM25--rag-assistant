Yes, this is possible. One way to test for touches is by using the CCTouchDispatcher. Overview Determine which class will monitor for touches of your letter sprites. Make the class a delegate of CCTargetedTouchDelegate. Add code to the class to register with the CCTouchDispatcher. Add code to the class to unregister with the CCTouchDispatcher. Add the touch callback methods to your class. In the touch callback methods, you must add code for determining which sprite was touched. Register and unregister from Dispatcher [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] addTargetedDelegate:self priority:0 swallowsTouches:YES]; [[CCTouchDispatcher sharedDispatcher] removeDelegate:self]; CallBack Methods To Implement - (BOOL)ccTouchBegan:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)ccTouchMoved:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event - (void)ccTouchEnded:(UITouch *)touch withEvent:(UIEvent *)event Example Code For Testing If Touch In Sprite - (BOOL) isTouch:(UITouch *)touch InSprite:(CCSprite *)sprite { CGPoint touchLocation = [touch locationInView: [touch view]]; touchLocation = [[CCDirector sharedDirector] convertToGL: touchLocation]; CGPoint localLocation = [sprite convertToNodeSpace:touchLocation]; CGRect spriteRect = [sprite textureRect]; spriteRect.origin = CGPointZero; if(CGRectContainsPoint(spriteRect, localLocation)) { return YES; } return NO; }
