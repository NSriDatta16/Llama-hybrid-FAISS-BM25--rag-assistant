What if DirectoryInfo.GetFiles().Length exceeds Int32.MaxValue?

By another question about the maximum number of files in a folder, I noticed that DirectoryInfo.GetFiles().Length is returning a System.In32, but the Maximum value of a Int32 is 2.147.483.647 (Int32.MaxValue) while on NTFS (an many other filesystems) the maximum number of files can go far beyond that. on NTFS it is 4.294.967.295 single files in one folder (probably an Uint32) Which leads me to the interesting question: Is it possible to get the number of files in a folder on NTFS with the .NET framework, when the number of files exceeds the Int32.MaxValue, in an elegant and performing manner? note: this is not a matter of why. and I know, those are a lot of files ;)
