A tutorial and a project: the VB6 documentation has a good tutorial Creating an ActiveX EXE Component . A more detailed version of the project is available in the samples that come with VB6. I can't find it available for download - have a look in your VB6 install directory or on the CD. Dan Appleman's excellent book Developing COM/ActiveX components with Visual Basic 6 has good in-depth coverage of ActiveX exes. You can usually pick it up second hand very cheaply.
