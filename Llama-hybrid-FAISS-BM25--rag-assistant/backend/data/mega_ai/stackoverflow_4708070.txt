Rather than server-side frameworks, you should be taking a look at JavaScript frameworks. Dojo Storage will transparently select between providers such as Google Gears, Adobe AIR or plain old HTML 5 local storage. Dojo 1.5 - dojox.storage: http://dojotoolkit.org/api/1.5/dojox/storage There's also jQuery local storage: http://plugins.jquery.com/project/saveit ... or jStorage, which can act as a storage plugin for jQuery, Prototype or MooTools: http://www.jstorage.info/ With any of these, you should be able to use a quick little AJAX call to pull (JSON perhaps) data from your server and use one of these tools to help minimise your storage code.
