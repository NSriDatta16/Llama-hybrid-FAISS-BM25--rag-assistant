The container class works well enough. Often, you end up wanting to include a few extra items at the top level too, and then the container class is useful. If you don't like the extra class, you can use an anonymous type to avoid the container class: public static object GetAgentsAndChannels() { List agents = GetListOfAgents(); List channels = GetListOfChannels(); return new { Agents: agents, Channels, channels }; } On the client-side, they'll be present as regular arrays. You can access them like this: $.ajax({ url: 'YourPage.aspx/GetAgentsAndChannels', type: 'POST', dataType: 'json', contentType: 'application/json', success: function(response) { var agentsAndChannels = response.d; var numberOfAgents = agentsAndChannels.Agents.length; var numberOfChannels = agentsAndChannels.Channels.length; var firstAgent = agentsAndChannels.Agents[0]; var firstChannelName = agentsAndChannels.Channels[0].Name; // Etc. } });
