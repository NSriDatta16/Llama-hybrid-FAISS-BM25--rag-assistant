How Do Vector drawing applications do this?

In Illustrator, you can drag a rectangle and it will select all objects in it. It does beyond a bounding box test since it ensures its touching an actual part of the polygon. How does it efficiently do this then? (A C or C++ implementation would be preferable) Thanks
