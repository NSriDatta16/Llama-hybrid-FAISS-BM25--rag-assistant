The knnImpute method uses the most similar (nearest) neighbors to impute the missing values using the average value of its neighbors for that column. So, the columns used to determine the neighbors should be clean (not having NA/INF/NaN) and for the columns with the missing values you are trying to impute, they should have values to be used for taking average. I hope it helps.
