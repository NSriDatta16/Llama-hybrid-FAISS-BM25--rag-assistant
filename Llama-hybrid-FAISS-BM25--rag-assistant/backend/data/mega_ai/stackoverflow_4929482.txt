How can I specify a column alias in HQL so I can use AliasToBeanResultTransformer with Count

Using NHibernate, I would like to run the following query: return Session.CreateQuery ( @"select FooType, count(*) as Total from Foo group by FooType") .SetResultTransformer(new AliasToBeanResultTransformer(typeof(FooSummary))) .List (); The classess are: class FooSummary { string FooType, int Total }; class Foo { string FooType }; However, it seems that HQL doesn't support column aliases. Is this correct? If so, does that mean I can't use AliasToBeanResultTransformer?
