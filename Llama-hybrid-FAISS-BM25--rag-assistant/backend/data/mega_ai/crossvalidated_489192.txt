Dimensionality reduction of a large covariance matrix

I have a large covariance matrix $\Sigma$ and I am reducing its dimensionality by using a truncated eigendecomposition. $\Sigma \approx VDV^T$ . I remember somewhere that you could also decompose it as $VDV^T + \Delta$ , where $\Delta$ is a diagonal matrix with positive entries and dimensionality similar to $\Sigma$ . Does anybody know this technique? Can I just assume that diag( $\Sigma - VDV^T$ ) always has positive entries?
