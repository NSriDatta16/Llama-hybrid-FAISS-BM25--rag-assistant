How can I model non-normal latent factors in a factor analysis or SEM?

We are running a confirmatory factor analysis (covariance-based SEM form) with three latent variables for around 900 companies. The input is around 20 variables: 5-6 are perfectly normally distributed and the rest is less so with extreme cases of binary and very skewed distributions. Around a third have an IQR of 0. Even when we restrict the latent variances to 1, we run into severe issues of model fit because the factors are dominated by the normal variables. What are better ways to propagate the non-normal structure into the latent variables? Two solutions we considered are: simple averaging and PLS path modeling.
