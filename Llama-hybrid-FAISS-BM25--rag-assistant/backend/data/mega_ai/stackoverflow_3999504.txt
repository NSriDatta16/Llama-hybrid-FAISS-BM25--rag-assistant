File sharing not working on iPad

I am trying to get file sharing to work on my app in iPad. I've added UIFileSharingEnabled to the plist, I've queried the documents dir and written a file there (and verified it is there by looking at it through Organizer). iTunes just refuses to display the file sharing info in the device's apps tab. Does anyone know of any obscure step I might be missing, or some edge case that might be causing my problem? I've tried all the rebooting, clean building avenues.
