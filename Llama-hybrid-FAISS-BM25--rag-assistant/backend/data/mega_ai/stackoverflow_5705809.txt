Firefox doesn't have a global "event" object at all. Instead, a reference to an essentially similar object is passed in to event handlers by the runtime system. I can't tell what sort of code is that fragment you posted. As an example, if you're binding event handlers with the basic DOM 0 attributes, you can do this: hi and then: function yourhandler(event) { event = event || window.event; var X = event.screenX; // ... } If, as you mention in a comment, you were to use jQuery to bind handlers, then it's even easier because it's the same in all browsers: $(function() { $('#myAnchor').click(function(event) { var X = event.pageX; }); });
