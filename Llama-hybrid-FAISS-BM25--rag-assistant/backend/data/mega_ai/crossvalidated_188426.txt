I had exactly the same question using statsmodels. I've found the explanation (for SPSS but it's the same answer for R or Statsmodels) here . These are the estimated multinomial logistic regression coefficients for the models. An important feature of the multinomial logit model is that it estimates k-1 models, where k is the number of levels of the outcome variable. In this instance, SPSS is treating the vanilla as the referent group and therefore estimated a model for chocolate relative to vanilla and a model for strawberry relative to vanilla. Therefore, since the parameter estimates are relative to the referent group, the standard interpretation of the multinomial logit is that for a unit change in the predictor variable, the logit of outcome m relative to the referent group is expected to change by its respective parameter estimate (which is in log-odds units) given the variables in the model are held constant.
