Code has punctuation which SQL statements lack. There are dots and parentheses and semicolons to help you keep things separate. Code also has lines. Despite the fact that you can write a SQL statement on multiple physical lines, it is a single statement, a single "line of code." IF I were to write English text without any of the normal punctuation IT might be easier if I uppercased the start of new clauses THAT way it'd be easier to tell where one ended and the next began OTHERWISE a block of text this long would probably be very difficult to read NOT that I'd suggest it's easy to read now BUT at least you can follow it I think
