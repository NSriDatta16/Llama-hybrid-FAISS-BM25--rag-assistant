Magento custom module not using the correct include path

I am creating a custom Magento payment module. I have created the file: /var/www/app/etc/modules/CustomerParadigm_NoPay.xml which contains: true local For what everreason Magento is throwing this error: Warning: include(Mage/Model/Nopay.php): failed to open stream: No such file or directory in /var/www/lib/Varien/Autoload.php on line 93 which is obviously not the right path, since I told Magento to look in the local folder. If anyone has any suggestions let me know. I have also added this to my .htaccess file php_value include_path ".:/var/www/app/code/local"
