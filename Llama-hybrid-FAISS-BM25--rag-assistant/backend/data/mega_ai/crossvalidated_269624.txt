PCA-like analysis to minimize variance

PCA operates by the following principles/constraints Principal components are orthogonal basis vectors spanning the original feature/variable set Principal components maximize variance between observations Questions: 1. Is there an analysis or manipulation of PCA to achieve the following? Principal components are orthogonal basis vectors spanning the original feature/variable set Principal components minimize variance between observations 2. Additionally what would be an intuitive interpretation of the principal component loadings/coefficients? My interpretation is that for the highest principal components, they would represent original features that explain homogeneity in the observation set.
