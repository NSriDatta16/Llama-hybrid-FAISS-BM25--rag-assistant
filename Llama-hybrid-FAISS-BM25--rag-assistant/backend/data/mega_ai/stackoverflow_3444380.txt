I enable soft-wrapping when I'm editing most text files: :set wrap If you decide to do the same, then you'll want to know about gj and gk in normal mode, to move by screen lines instead of physical lines. I use them so often I remapped the up and down arrow keys to them instead of k and j . Whether you're editing hard- or soft-wrapped files, you'll get a lot of mileage out of gqap (or its cousin gwap ) to re-wrap a single paragraph with hard newlines, and vipJ to join all the lines of a hard-wrapped paragraph back into a single line. You might also want to consider including a in formatoptions , to enable automatic paragraph formatting: :set formatoptions+=a When you're doing all this wrapping and unwrapping, it's nice to keep Vim from mangling numbered lists: :set formatoptions+=n In fact, I'd suggest reviewing all the formatoptions and adjusting them to your particular preferences: :help fo-table More info: :help gj :help gk :help gqap :help auto-format :help formatoptions
