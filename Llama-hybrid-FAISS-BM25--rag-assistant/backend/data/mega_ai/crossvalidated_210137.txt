I would like to suggest a solution utilising the changepoint package. The simplistic example below attempts to identify peaks, defined here as change points by looking at one channel from the available data. Example Data sourcing # Libs library(seewave) library(tuneR) # Download tmpWav Data preparation # Libs require(changepoint) # Create time series data for one channel as an example leftTS Chart generated via the plot.ts call: Change-point analysis The changepoint package provides a number of option for identifying changes/peaks in the data. The code below provides only a simple example of finding 3 peaks using BinSeg method: # BinSeg method (example) leftTSpelt Obtained chart: It is also possible to get values: cpts(leftTSpelt) [1] 89582 165572 181053 Side notes The provided example is mostly concerned with illustrating how the change point analysis can be applied to the provided data; caution should be exercised with respect to parameters passed to the cp.var function. A detailed explanation of the package and the available functionalities is given in the following paper: Killick, Rebecca and Eckley, Idris (2014) changepoint:an R package for changepoint analysis. Journal of Statistical Software, 58 (3). pp. 1-19. ecp ecp , is another worth mentioning R package. The ecp facilitates undertaking non-parametric multivariate change point analysis, which may be useful if the one would like to identify change points occurring across multiple channels.
