That volume is not a problem for Access so long as it's on a stable LAN or very high speed WAN. Wireless connections are also a bad idea. I have several clients which are adding about 200K to 300K transactions per year into the systems. So that's about 1000 per work day. That's using both an Access front end and back end. That said one of them will be upsizing shortly to SQL Server. I fired the other client when they hired a PHB (Dilbert's pointy haired boss.)
