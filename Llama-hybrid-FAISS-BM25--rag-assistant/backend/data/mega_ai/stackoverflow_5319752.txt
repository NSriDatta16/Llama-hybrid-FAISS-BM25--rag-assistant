In practice, scene objects in videogames are rarely organized into a graph that is "walked" as a tree when the scene is rendered. A graphics system typically expects one big array of stuff to render, and this big array is walked linearly. Games that require geometric parenting relationships, such as those with people holding guns or tanks with turrets, define and enforce those relationships on an as-needed basis outside of the graphics system. These relationships tend to be only one-deep, and so there is almost never a need for an arbitrarily deep tree structure.
