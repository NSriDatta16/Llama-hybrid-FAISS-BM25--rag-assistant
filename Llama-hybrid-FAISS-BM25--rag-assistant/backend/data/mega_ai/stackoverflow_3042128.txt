You want to use Witty . Wt (pronounced 'witty') is a C++ library for developing interactive web applications. The API is widget-centric and similar to desktop GUI APIs. To the developer, it offers complete abstraction of any web-specific implementation details, including event handling, graphics support, graceful degradation (or progressive enhancement), and pretty URLs. Unlike many page-based frameworks, Wt was designed for creating stateful applications that are at the same time highly interactive (leveraging techinques such as AJAX to their fullest) and accessible (supporting plain HTML browsers), using automatic graceful degradation or progressive enhancement. The library comes with an application server that acts as a stand-alone web server or integrates through FastCGI with other web servers.
