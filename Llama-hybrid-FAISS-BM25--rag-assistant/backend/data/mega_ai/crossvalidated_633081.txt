In time series analysis, I don't think "sample" is used often. I like "observation", or "value", if the interval nature is obvious enough - "observation" is probably better if it is a sum of timestamped observations; if the value comes from an averaging, then "value" sounds better. Related terms are "aggregation" or "aggregation dimension" (sometimes you want to aggregate across multiple dimensions, not only time), or "bucketizing". If you want to distinguish the original timestamped observations from the aggregates, then something like "bucketized value" or "bucketized observation" would work. Though you probably don't want to use that particular term throughout a document or a presentation...
