Three years late, but it might help other people. I guess you refer to F-score used in the paper of Chen and Lin (2006) : "Combining SVMs with Various Feature Selection Strategies" . They use an example to explain what you ask : I quote their words : "Both features of this data have low F-scores as the denominator (the sum of variances of the positive and negative sets) is much larger than the numerator." In other words, F-score reveals the discriminative power of each feature independently from others. One score is computed for the first feature, and another score is computed for the second feature. But it does not indicate anything on the combination of both features (mutual information). This is the main weakness of F-score.
