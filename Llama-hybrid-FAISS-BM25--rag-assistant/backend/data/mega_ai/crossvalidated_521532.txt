If you compute $\kappa$ for each of the three subsets you can then summarise it either by taking the median or by a weighted mean with weights the inverse of the sampling variances. That gives you the average agreement of a secondary rater with the chosen primary rater. If the primary rater is seen as a gold standard, perhaps because they are highly trained and the others are beginners, then computing sensitivity and specificity for each subset would seem a better option.
