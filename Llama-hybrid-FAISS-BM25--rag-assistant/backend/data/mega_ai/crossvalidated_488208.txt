Prediction problems : Assume a situation you can model with some kind of regression(-like) model. An error distribution with long tails will tend to produce many outliers, that is, observations far from the bulk of the data. That makes predictive modelling harder, and could indicate need for robust methods. For some examples Building a predictive model, regression with a long right tail , Fat Tailed risks: do they get fatter when we linearize non-linear systems? and this arXiv paper Building robust prediction models for defective sensor data using Artificial Neural Networks . For classification it is different. The response is categorical, so cannot have long tails. Then long tails must apply to the predictors, and the problems will be different. For the moment I defer that to others.
