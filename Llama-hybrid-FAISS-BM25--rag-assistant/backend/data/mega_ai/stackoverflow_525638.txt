The answers already give some great books on how to specifically design interfaces. I'd like to help with some suggestions to help you improve your nose for design. Some of these might be cheaply available 2nd-hand, or something you can borrow locally (I'm always willing to lend books to people in Perth, Western Australia): Bill Buxton's Sketching user Experiences - buy it, read the stories and start practicing sketching Nathaniel Borenstein's (out of print) Programming as if People Mattered - a superb little book of anecdotes Jeff Johnson's GUI Bloopers which will help you with lots of pragmatic examples of design gone wrong, in both desktop and web application design.
