estimating effect with marginaleffect package

I want to estimate ATE. first of all I used MatchIt package for full matching for propensity score and then I used logistic regression with all of variable in propensity score model after that I used marginal effect package for estimating causal effect with G-computation. I noticed one of variable in outcome model have big standard deviation. my question is: I have to remove this variable and after that use marginal effect package or with out removing this variable the effect is true?
