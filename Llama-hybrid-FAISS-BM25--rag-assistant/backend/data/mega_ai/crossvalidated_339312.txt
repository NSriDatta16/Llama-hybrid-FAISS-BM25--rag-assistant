No, linear mixed models are not the same as logistic regression. Linear mixed models have a continuous dependent variable, logistic regression models have dichotomous dependent variables (or, ordinal ones for ordinal logistic and categorical ones for multinomial logistic). Linear mixed models are one way of dealing with violation of the assumption of independent errors.
