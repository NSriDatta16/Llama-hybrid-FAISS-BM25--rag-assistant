Pretty much all cards since DX7-level technology (GeForce 2 / Radeon 7000) can do it. Most notable exceptions are Intel cards (Intel 945 aka GMA 950 and earlier can't do it; I think Intel 965 aka GMA X3100 can't do it either). Older cards (GeForce 2 / 4MX, Radeon 7000-9250) were using supersampling (render everything into internally larger buffer, downsample at the end). All later cards have multisampling, where this expensive process is only performed at polygon edges (simply speaking, shaders are run for each pixel, while depth/coverage is stored for each sample).
