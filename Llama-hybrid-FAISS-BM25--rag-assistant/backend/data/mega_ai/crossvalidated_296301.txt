Question about how auto.arima works

I have a time series that grows by 10% every month; I have done auto.arima on the month-over-month growth rate and absolute monthly numbers; for example Absolute numbers = 100, 110, 121, 133.1, ... Month-on-month-growth = 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, ... When I auto.arima on the growth rate as expected it gives me a forecast of the next month to be another 0.1, but when I do it on absolute numbers I get a implied growth of 0.0909. Can someone please explain why there is a difference? library(forecast) rates = ts(rep(0.1,48), frequency = 12, start = c(1959, 1)) auto.arima(rates) f = auto.arima(rates) print(forecast(f, 1)) foo = 1:48 ; base = 1; for ( i in 1:48 ) { foo[i] = base; base = base * 1.1; } levels = ts(foo,frequency = 12, start = c(1959,1)) fl = auto.arima(levels) print(forecast(fl,1))
