Probably yes. If you use logistic regression with L2, change C from 1 (default in scikit-learn) to the power of 10. E.g. C from 1 to 10, 100, 1000... C is the inverse of regularization strength. By increasing C you decrease bias and increase variance. In other words, you are probably going to overfit.
