Magento has numerous systems and facilitate for updating products and stock levels from external sources on a scheduled basis. Magento also has a robust event system such that listeners can be setup to send out information instantly after an order's been placed. If you know what you're doing, this is an average task, and the kind of thing Magento was made for. Additionally, Magento has an extension marketplace, and it wouldn't surprise me to find out there are commercial extensions to automate handling exactly your situation. The question you want to be asking is, has this marketing/SEO/design done this before.
