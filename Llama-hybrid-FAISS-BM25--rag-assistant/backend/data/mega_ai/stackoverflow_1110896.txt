Ruby: split one hash into two based on desired keys

I'm hoping this question has a very simple answer. I can think of ways to do with with boring, annoying looping, but I'm hoping there's a more elegant solution. If I have the following two variables: hash = {:a => 1, :b => 2, :c => 3, :d => 4} keyset = [:a, :c] How can I get the following two hashes in the simplest way possible? hash1 = {:a => 1, :c => 3} hash2 = {:b => 3, :d => 4} If the example doesn't make my goal clear, in essence, what I want is a hybrid between #delete and #delete_if - #delete returns the deleted value, whereas #delete_if allows me to delete in bulk. I would prefer a way to delete in bulk, and have the deleted values returned - or something equivalent. Thanks!
