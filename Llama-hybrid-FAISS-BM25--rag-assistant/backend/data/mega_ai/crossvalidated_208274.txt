Organic vs Paid Attribution Model (Granger)

I'm wondering if there is literature or studies done on how to model organic attribution from paid user acquisition. So the context is, on our mobile app, we have paid installs that we purchase and organic installs, but we believe organic installs mostly come from either featuring or referrals from current users. Thus, for every paid user we buy, we actually can attribute some organic installs to that paid user. My problem then is what this coefficient is. My first instinct is to use granger causality model where the lagged organic installs and paid installs are the inputs to the model (along with exogenous featured dates). So basically there are two time series: organic installs $y_t$ and paid installs $x_t$, and I regress organic installs on lagged organic installs and paid installs and exogenous featuring $z_t$ on the dates we were featured. \begin{equation} y_t=\beta_0+\beta_1 y_{t-1}+ ... + \beta_q y_{t-q} + \gamma_1 x_{t-1} + ... + \gamma_q x_{t-q} +\delta_0 z_t+\varepsilon_t \end{equation} So basically is this a valid way to model this problem and if so, is an information criterion like AIC or BIC the best way to determine the order? Anyways, would love to hear everyone's thoughts or suggestions if there's a well-defined model for this!
