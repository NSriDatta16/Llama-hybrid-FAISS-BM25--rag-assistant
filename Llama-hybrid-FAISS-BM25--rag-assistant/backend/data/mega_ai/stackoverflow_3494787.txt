Enabling JVM options with Java Web Start / JNLP

I'm creating a Web Start application which would benefit from some of the newer JVM options (especially escape analysis, G1 garbage collector etc.) At the same time, I would like the application to work gracefully on older JVMs that do not support these options. Is there a good way of achieving this?
