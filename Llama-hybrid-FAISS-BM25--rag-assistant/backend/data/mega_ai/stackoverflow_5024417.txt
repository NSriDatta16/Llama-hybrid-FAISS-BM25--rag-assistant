Cookies don't seem the place do to this anymore. Cookies are limited and are sent with each HTTP request, including all of your images and static files unless they are on a different domain. I recommend using localStorage instead. Since this is intended for smartphones like the iPhone and Android you are ok to use localStorage. Webkit browsers have supported it for a long time. If you use localStorage you can use any kind of key value storage mechanism you like. I recommend the redis way of field:id:property for keys. var order_id = 10203; var key = 'order:' + order_id + ':drink'; localStorage[key] = 'Pepsi'; By using the order_id in your key field you can easily manage unique orders.
