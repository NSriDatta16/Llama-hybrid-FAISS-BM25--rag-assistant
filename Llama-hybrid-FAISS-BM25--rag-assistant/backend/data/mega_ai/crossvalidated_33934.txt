I can think of two ways. The simplest is to assume that the price of those comparable homes follows a normal distribution. Then, to estimate the price, you just take the average of the 5 prices you have. You can also report a 95% confidence interval: average Â± standard_deviation(5 prices)/sqrt(5). The other one is more complicated. Since you don't have much data, it's good practice to regularize (or control the complexity/capacity) of your model. Examples include Lasso regression, L2-regularized regression, support vector (SVM) regression. I would first try the SVM regression using libsvm .
