What should a hobbyist do to develop good programming skills after basics?

So I'll say right here that I'm no professional coder. I'm a hobbyist. And pretty much like other people I feel like I'm doing it wrong. Like this question A feeling that I'm not a good programmer if have began to feel like that. Now I know basically that they say you shouldn't worry and that your good even if you continuously doubt yourself. But, they are talking to him. I'm not like him (in the sense I'm more of a newbie)... I've been coding as a hobbyist for 3 years (3 hobbyist years mind you!) unlike his 10-11 years that he states. Also, the only thing I've probably read in-depth is Teach Yourself C++ in 21 Days . And before I continue, just so your not confused about the various questions I've posted on (mostly) iPhone and OpenGL, I have poked and prodded at those two things for a few months each and finally sort of got a hang of both of them. But, from what I've noticed, is that I suck at making good code. For me its not even a debate of whether I'm doing it wrong or not: I can tell (from the various spaghetti code I create and other various discrepancies I, and others, can see and have noted in my code). What is a good way to get rid of these awful habits of mine and do it in a more correct, or if there is no "correct way" then I mean "typical", way?
