Creating a DTO hierarchy that parallels your domain model, just for the sake of layering purity, seems like an anti-pattern to me. I'd argue against it every time. EJB 1.0 encouraged using DTOs this way, because passing entity EJBs that were chatty was inefficient. People would load the data into DTOs to avoid network traffic. I think it's unnecessary now.
