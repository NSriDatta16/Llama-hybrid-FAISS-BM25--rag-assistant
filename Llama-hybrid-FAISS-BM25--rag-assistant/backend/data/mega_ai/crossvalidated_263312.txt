The hidden layers are necessary for capturing interactions between features in the data. Without any hidden layers, the neural network is logistic regression (with sigmoid activation) or a perceptron (with linear activation). The process of multiplying weights and inputs and then using an activation function on the output (and then further multiplying that output with different weights and using another activation function, etc.) which allow the ANN to model the non-linearities in the data. (While the circle data is non-linear, the features $X^2_1$ and $X^2_2$ allow the logistic regression to classify the data correctly.)
