how to illustrate adding feature will increase the variance of first component in PCA geometrically

How to geometrically illustrate Adding feature will increase the variance of first component in PCA namely, $\lambda_{max}\Big((X,u)^T(X,u)\Big) \geq \lambda_{max}\Big(X^TX\Big).$ Intuitively, the variance of new feature will be allocated into each component (by correlation), then the variance of old first component will increase, which must be smaller then the new first component. But is there any clearly geometric explanation? I know the similar result of linear regression can be geometrically explained that the residual of projection on a line must be larger than on a plane (adding feature).
