R: regression coefficients and lubridate

I'm getting some odd coefficients when I apply lm to dates that have been processed and rounded using the lubridate package. MWE: library(ggplot2) library(lubridate) library(dplyr) lakers$month % round_date(unit = 'month') items_by_month % group_by(month) %>% summarize(count = n()) %>% mutate(count = count / 1000) ggplot(data = items_by_month, aes(x = month, y = count)) + geom_line() + stat_smooth(method = 'lm', data = items_by_month) model The plot indicates that ggplot , at least, understands what's going on with the regression model. But in summary(model) the coefficient on month is on the order of 10^-7, which is about 5 orders of magnitude too small: the plot shows an increase of about 2.5 between the first and last dates, but the last line shows an increase of about 2.5 * 10^-5. Note that I've divided the count column by 10^3, in order to get values that are easier to read (and closer to my actual use case). But that shouldn't effect either the plot or lm . Also, I know there are more sophisticated techniques than linear regression for analyzing time series data; but I'm just looking at gross trends over time, not factor out seasonal patterns, etc.
