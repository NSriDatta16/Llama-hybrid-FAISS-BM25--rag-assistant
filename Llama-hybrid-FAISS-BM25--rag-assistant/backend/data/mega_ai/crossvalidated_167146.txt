You may believe you're a Bayesian, but you're probably wrong... http://www.rmm-journal.de/downloads/Article_Senn.pdf Bayesians derive the probability distribution of outcomes of interest given prior belief / prior information. To a Bayesian this distribution (and its summaries) are what most people will be interested in. Contrast with typical "frequentist" results that tell you what the chance of seeing results as or more extreme than those observed given that the null hypothesis is true (p-value) or interval estimates for the parameter of interest, 95% of which would contain the true value if you could do repeated sampling (confidence interval). Bayesian prior distributions are contentious because they are YOUR prior. There is no "correct" prior. Most pragmatic Bayesians look for external evidence that can be used for priors and then discount or modify this based on what is expected to be "reasonable" for the particular case. For example, sceptical priors may have a "lump" of probability on a null case - "How good would the data need to be to make me change my mind / change current practice?" Most will also look at robustness of inferences to different priors. There are a group of Bayesians who look into "reference" priors that allow them to construct inferences that are not "influenced" by prior belief and so they get probabilistic statements and interval estimates that have "frequentist" properties. There are also a group of "Hardcore Bayesians" who might advocate not choosing a model (all models are wrong), and who might argue that exploratory analysis is bound to influence your priors and so shouldn't be done. There are few that radical though... In most fields of statistics you'll find Bayesian analyses and practitioners. Just as you'll find some folks who prefer non-parametrics...
