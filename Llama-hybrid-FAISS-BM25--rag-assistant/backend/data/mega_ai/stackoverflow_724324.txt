I agree with all of you with jQuery, but I would like to tell you script.aculo.us as an alternative. 1) Learning curve is really short 2) It's a bit heavy because you need prototype.js (993kb) plus dragdrop.js(31kb) and scriptaculous.js (2kb) 3) Fully supports IE6+, Firefox (Iâ€™d say 1.5+, 2+ certainly), and Safari (2+ for sure, perhaps 1.3+) Link: Script.aculo.us at GitHub Script.aculo.us Homepage
