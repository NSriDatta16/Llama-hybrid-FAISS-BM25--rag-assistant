UISlider with variable scrubbing speeds (like iPod app)

Apple's iPod (Music) app has a slider (UISlider, I presume) with variable scrubbing speeds: the further away from the slider you drag vertically, the smaller the proportion of your horizontal dragging speed that is reflected in the value change of the slider. Has anyone figured out how to duplicate this behavior?
