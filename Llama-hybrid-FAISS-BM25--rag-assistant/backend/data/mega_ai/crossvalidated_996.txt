You can find a pedagogical summary of the various methods available in (1) For some --recent-- numerical comparisons of the various methods listed there, you can check (2) and (3) . there are many older (and less exhaustive) numerical comparisons, typically found in books. You will find one on pages 142-143 of (4), for example. Note that all the methods discussed here have an open source R implementation, mainly through the rrcov package. (1) P. Rousseeuw and M.
