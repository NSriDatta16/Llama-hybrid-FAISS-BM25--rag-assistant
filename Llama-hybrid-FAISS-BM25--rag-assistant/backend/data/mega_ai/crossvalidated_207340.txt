An estimator for the amount of change in a time series

I have data like this: Bond Cash Stock Day1 65 66 50 Day2 10 69 75 Day3 35 75 69 Day4 34 96 95 Day5 25 63 40 Day6 5 6 92 Day7 16 77 27 Day8 11 58 35 Day9 84 0 30 Day10 14 12 55 Day11 86 84 80 Day12 11 90 35 I am looking for an estimator for the amount of change in the portfolio (the values are money) from day to day. I don't think that looking at the variance of the portfolio in the right way - because "11 60 5" and "5 11 60" has the same variance. Any suggestion?
