As far as estimating similarity between the time series series there is a variety of methods you may want to investigate. Some of those are: cross correlation: this will be affected by the amplitude and will not be able to estimate lagged correlations, prone to noise. coherence: normalised frequency based correlation (cross-spectrum), not prone to amplitude or noise. wavelet coherence: similar to above but based on wavelet transformations instead of STFFT. dynamic time warping: measuring similarity between two temporal sequences, which may vary in speed.
