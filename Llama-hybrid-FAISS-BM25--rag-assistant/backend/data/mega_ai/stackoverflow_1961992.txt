You need to do it the naive way and fail before you realize the problems those frameworks and patterns solve. Happened to me with many things. SVN branches looked like a disorganized way to do things, until one day I wished I had branched before my last 5 commits. C++ templates seemed useless and confusing, until I got enlightened; now I use them pretty often. And every single J2EE feature will look like useless bloat to anyone, until you actually build an app big enough and have problems; then they may be exactly what you need. (thus it's a flaw to "require" you use them)
