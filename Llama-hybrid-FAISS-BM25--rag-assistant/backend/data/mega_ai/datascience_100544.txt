I think that the issue is related to a lack of enough data for a neural network problem (LSTM). You mentioned you added four years, but this still might not be enough. How many data elements do you have for experiment? What is the dispersion between those elements? My recommendation is to try to approach it with other machine learning algorithms; maybe regression could be a better approach if you have less than 100,000 elements in your dataset.
