In what sense is the interpretation of coefficients in a GLMM subject-specific?

There is something I'm not quite understanding conceptually about the output from generalized linear mixed models. I have read that the target of inference in GLMMs is subject-specific. For example, the accepted answer to this question states that in a logistic GLMM the odds-ratios are conditioned on both the fixed and random effects. So, in a GLMM of pupils within classrooms, with random intercepts for classroom (i.e., the "subject" in this case), the odds-ratios will differ for each classroom as there will be many random intercepts. So far, this makes sense to me. What I am confused about is that the typical output from the fixed effects part of such a model reports just one odds-ratio. For example, in the R example I provide below, the odds-ratio for the fixed effect of sex is .662. I have three questions: How do I interpret this single fixed effect odds-ratio? (Is it an odds-ratio ignoring the random effects? Is it an odds-ratio of the average random effect - in which case, isn't it a population average? Is it calculated assuming the random effect variance is zero?) Is it possible to calculate a population average odds-ratio using the output from a GLMM? I know this can be done using a GEE, but what about a GLMM? How would I go about calculating the odds-ratio for a particular random effect (a particular classroom, lets say class 7 in the example below)? Presumably this involves combining the fixed and random effect estimates somehow. EDIT 1: It seems after doing more reading (for example, this post ), that since the fixed effect for sex in this example does not have its own random effect (e.g., a random slope), there will be no subject-level interpretation of this parameter. Does this mean that only the intercept term in the model below is subject-specific, while the sex term is a population average? # dummy data: set.seed(1) dat
