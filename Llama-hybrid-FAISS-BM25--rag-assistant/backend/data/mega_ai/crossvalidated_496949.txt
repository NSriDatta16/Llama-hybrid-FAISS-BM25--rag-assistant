This idea may lead nowhere but hopefully will lead you to a useful idea. Think about stringing the data out into a tall and thin dataset with one row per month per client. For each row create 5 indicator variables with $Y_{i} = 1$ if product $i$ was used by the client in that week. Use a binary logistic regression model fitted separately for each product to estimate the probability that product $i$ will be used as a function of week. Week would be modeled as a flexible nonlinear function, e.g., a regression spline. Now the hard part: how to estimate the probability that product $i$ will be used before product $j$ . This may require modeling some notion of the correlation between the uses of multiple products. I don't know if some kind of conditional probability model would help (e.g., $\Pr(\text{use } i | \text{use } j)$ ). You can compute indicator variables another way if it helps, e.g., for each week have an indicator of whether product $i$ was used and it was the first product used at or before that week.
