Which Algorithm did OpenAI used to create a hide and seek playing Agent?

I just saw this video on youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kopoLzvh5jY&t=9s Which Algorithm did OpenAI used to create a hide and seek playing Agent? Was it Genetic Algorithm or Policy Gradients or something else? If it was Policy Gradient method, then which Policy Gradient method did they used?
