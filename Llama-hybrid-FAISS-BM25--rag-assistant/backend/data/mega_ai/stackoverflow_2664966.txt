custom wordpress page

I'd like to implement a custom post retrieval page in wordpress. Basically, I'm using AJAX to call this page that will be passed a post ID and retrieve certain data from that post. Note: please don't mistake this as a template question. I do not want a template for one single page -- I am looking to make this page query multiple different posts based on postID and return certain data from that post. So I tried creating a page '77' ); $friends = new WP_Query($args); ?> have_posts()) : the_post(); ?> Sorry, no posts are available. But this does not work since it is not loading in the wp functions to handle the query. Thanks in advance for any help!
