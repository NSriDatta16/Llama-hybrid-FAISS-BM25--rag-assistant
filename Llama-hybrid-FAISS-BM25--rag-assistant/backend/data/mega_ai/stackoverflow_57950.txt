In a controlled environment, using SmtpClient would be the answer. But on a user's machine you would need an SMTP server to send through. You could prompt the user for their SMTP credentials, but I think that would be impractical for your case. As a user, I would not want to provide my SMTP credentials to a random app (think SPAM). You also don't want to hard-code your own SMTP credentials into the app, it would be trivial for a malicious user to sniff those credentials and use your server to send SPAM. Ideally you would be able to use the user's mail agent to send the email. I was thinking you might be able to formulate and execute a mailto: URL, but I'm not sure if you'd be able to specify the body or any attachments for the message.
