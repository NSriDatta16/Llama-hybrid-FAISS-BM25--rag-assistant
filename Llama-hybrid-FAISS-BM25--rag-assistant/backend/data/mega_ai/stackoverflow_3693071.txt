I organize my code is by type of the elements, meaning that all the methods are at one place (at the end of the file, that is), all the constructor in one (before methods), etc. The same goes for variables, constants, enums etc. Usually I place private variables first and others after them, but that's not a strict rule. Also by nature code related to each other often ends up at the same place, but that's just because it is easiest. I don't bother keeping my code in alphabetical order as I do that easily in the Eclipse outline view. However, if the editor does not support this, then I might use alphabetical order. Well, at least for bigger files.
