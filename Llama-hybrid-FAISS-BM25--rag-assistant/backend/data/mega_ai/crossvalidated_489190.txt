Question about the Proof of PCA in "Learning from Data" by Shwartz and Ben-David, P. 280-281

Does anyone know how to justify the red and blue line in the attached proof of PCA? Red line: $B \in \mathbb{R}^{ d \times n}$ , arrange $B = [B_{j,1} | B_{j,2} | \cdots | B_{j,n}]$ , then $B^\top B = \sum_{j = 1}^d \sum_{i = 1}^n B_{j,i}^2$ . Since the columns are orthonormal, therefore $\sum_{i = 1}^n B_{j,i}^2 = 1$ , hence $B^\top B = \sum_{j = 1}^d 1 = d$ not equal to $n$ as claimed. Blue line : I do not see where the equality comes from. Why is it that for every orthogonal matrix $U \in \mathbb{R}^{ d\times n}$ you have an inequality on the trace, but as soon as you have that all columns of $U$ are the leading eigenvector of $A = X^\top X$ , you obtain an equality? See below for the relevant parts of the proof
