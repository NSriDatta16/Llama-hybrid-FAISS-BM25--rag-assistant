How to determine if two sequences are significantly different?

I have two sequences of equal length, like [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4] and [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, 4] . I want to determine the odds that they were generated by the same random variable, or different ones. What is a good statistical test to do this? The data are not pairwise; nor are they time series. Each element in the sequence is independent of the others. (I'm sorry if I'm omitting necessary details; I'm new to stats.)
