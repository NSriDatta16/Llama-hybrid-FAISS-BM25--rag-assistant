I'm not too well up on WinForms and have never used Infragistics Ultragrid. My guess would be that Child list for field DiscoverData([Build] = '4 is thrown deep down in the framework in some of the data-binding code. It seems to be looking for child members of a class called ([Build] = '4 as it stops at the dot or period (.) in your string literal. I try to avoid working with DataSet s and DataView s because of some of the crazy hoops they jump through. Might be worth firing up Reflector and having a poke around System.Windows.Forms.BindingContext
