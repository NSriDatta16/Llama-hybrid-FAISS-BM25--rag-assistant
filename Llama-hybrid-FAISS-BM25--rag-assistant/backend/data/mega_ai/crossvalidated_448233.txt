Are p-value and Bayesian probabilities equivalent when applied to conversion rates?

For evaluating AB-tests, one can use the frequentist approach or a Bayesian one. Using these websites I compared both with some example data: Bayesian A/B-test Calculator AB Testguide Result: +---------+---------------+---------+---------------+---------+--------------------------------------+ | Users A | Conversions A | Users B | Conversions B | p-value | Bayesian chance of A outperforming B | +---------+---------------+---------+---------------+---------+--------------------------------------+ | 1000 | 100 | 1000 | 120 | 0.0764 | 7.7% | | 1000 | 100 | 1000 | 130 | 0.0176 | 1.8% | | 10000 | 1000 | 10000 | 1100 | 0.0105 | 1.1% | | 10000 | 1000 | 10000 | 1030 | 0.2412 | 24.1% | | 17000 | 1700 | 10000 | 1030 | 0.2157 | 21.5% | | 4000 | 2683 | 3000 | 2000 | 0.6402 | 64.1% | +---------+---------------+---------+---------------+---------+--------------------------------------+ I'm aware of the different meanings of the probabilities given by the p-value and by the Bayesian chance of A outperforming B , thus it surprises me, that both seem to give the same values. So are those two really equivalent? And if so, why do all the simulation efforts involved in the Bayesian calculation?
