I would note that there is a significant literature on predicting low frequency time series using a higher frequency time series. MIDAS regression and state space representations are more often seen in the literature. These techniques can be more complicated than the approach you intend to use (which is perfectly fine, taking into account Wayne's points), but may be helpful if you have other daily or weekly indicators you wish to consider.
