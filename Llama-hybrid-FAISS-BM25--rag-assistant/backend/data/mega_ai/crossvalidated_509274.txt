Two simple things people commonly do is: Use one of the many available lists of stopwords and filler them out first. Most NLP software does this out-of-the-box. Decide on the number of words that will fit your memory (considering also the memory that will be available when the model is deployed, so e.g. if this is going to be mobile app, this needs to be adequately small) and take the $N$ most common words. But you donâ€™t have to filter out anything, you can use hashing trick to loosely map the words to lower dimensionality.
