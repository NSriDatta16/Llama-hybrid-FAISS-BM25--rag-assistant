Movable UIViews, like Tangram

In my iPad application, there is one main view. It contains various views which have different sizes and different images (tetragons, but not rectangles). (source: idzr.org ) The grey lines represent the frames, the red lines represent the outline of the image. It is a bit like Tangram, but more complicated since the tetragons are not rectangles. The views can be moved and rotated, but the red tetragons should not touch one another, and not overlay one another. If the corners of the tetragons are known, what is the best way to implement this?
