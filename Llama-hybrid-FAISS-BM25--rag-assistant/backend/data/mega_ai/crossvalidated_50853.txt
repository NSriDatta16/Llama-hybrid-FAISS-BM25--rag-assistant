ROC50 score - how is it calculated?

I have never found a good explanation of what the ROC50 score is and how it is calculated. To take an example definition found on the net: The ROC50 score is the area under the ROC curve, up to the first 50 false positives So if I understand correctly, you look at how many correct positive classifications you have, until you get the first fifty wrong ones. But this makes the ROC50 score dependent on which positive classifications you look at first- if they are true or false. What ordering does one use? Does one look at the objects most confidently classified as positive first? I.e. for an SVM-classified list of objects you begin with the object with the highest score from the decision function and work your way downwards until you get to fifty false positives? If so, is it correct to say that the ROC50 score gives you information about how well the most confidently classified objects are classified?
