How to organize external tools in Visual Studio 2010?

This is how one can set them up: http://www.c-sharpcorner.com/uploadfile/rmcochran/commandpromptinstudiotoolsmenu01152008103357am/commandpromptinstudiotoolsmenu.aspx My problem is that I have got too many of them set up, and I now need a separate sub-menu or two to keep them organized. I could not figure out how to do that. Feel free to ask if something is not clear.
