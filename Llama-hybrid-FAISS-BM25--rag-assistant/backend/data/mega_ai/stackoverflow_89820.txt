How to reference a custom field in SQL

I am using mssql and am having trouble using a subquery. The real query is quite complicated, but it has the same structure as this: select customerName, customerId, ( select count(*) from Purchases where Purchases.customerId=customerData.customerId ) as numberTransactions from customerData And what I want to do is order the table by the number of transactions, but when I use order by numberTransactions It tells me there is no such field. Is it possible to do this? Should I be using some sort of special keyword, such as this , or self ?
