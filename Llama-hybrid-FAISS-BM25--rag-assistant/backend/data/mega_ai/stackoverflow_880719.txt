Determine user agent timezone offset without using javascript?

Is there a way to determine the timezone for a user agent without javasript? normally, i would execute this snippet of javascript: var offset = new Date(); document.write(' '); However, for a lot of mobiles and clients, JS is either not existant or turned off. Is there something clever I can do or am I reduced to "tell me where you are and what timzeone you are in?"
