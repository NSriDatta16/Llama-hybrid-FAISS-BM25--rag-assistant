I almost feel embarrased asking this but I really can't find my app on my phone. Look for it in Settings > Applications to see if it is installed. If it is, any activities you declared in the LAUNCHER category (action MAIN ) will appear in the home screen launcher. I read that the app should be installed in /data/data/ folder but my /data folder appears to be empty when viewed in Astro. You do not have permissions to view that directory on an un-rooted phone. My app is most definitely installed on the phone, should I transfer it to the SD for it to become visible? Your app will not be any more "visible". I just need to have a peek at the SQLite database managed by my App. Add a backup/restore feature to your app that copies your SQLite file to/from external storage. Be sure all your SQLiteDatabase objects are closed first, though.
