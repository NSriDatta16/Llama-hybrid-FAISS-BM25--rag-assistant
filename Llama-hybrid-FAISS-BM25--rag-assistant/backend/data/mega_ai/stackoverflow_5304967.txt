deploy .NET on Apache

We are switching our web development from Java to .NET We currently have an Apache/Tomcat server to host our war files. I understand that .NET needs to run on IIS or on Apache with mod_mono. My boss is concerned with the IIS setup since we currently use IIS for ONE process off our iSeries and quite regularly that server needs to be restarted. Our Apache server is quite solid and rarely requires restarting. However, a developer on staff doesn't think that the mod_mono (or any other Apache plug-in) would be stable. Does anyone have any references they can share on the stability of the 2 platforms? Is there another solution that I'm unaware of? What set up does your organization use for hosting .NET applications
