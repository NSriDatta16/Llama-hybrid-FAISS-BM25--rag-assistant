This is mentioned in the documentation at http://php.net/manual/en/function.mail.php : "If messages are not received, try using a LF (\n) only. Some poor quality Unix mail transfer agents replace LF by CRLF automatically (which leads to doubling CR if CRLF is used). This should be a last resort, as it does not comply with Â» RFC 2822." So, as you said: it's not right, but it's reality.
