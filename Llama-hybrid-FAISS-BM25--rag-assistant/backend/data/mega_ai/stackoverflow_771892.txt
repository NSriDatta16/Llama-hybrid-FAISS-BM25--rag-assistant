Average asymptotic order of QuickSort is O(nlogn) and it's usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants (tighter loops). In fact, there is a theoretical linear time median selection algorithm that you can use to always find the best pivot, thus resulting a worst case O(nlogn) . However, the normal QuickSort is usually faster than this theoretical one. To make it more sensible, consider the probability that QuickSort will finish in O(n 2 ) . It's just 1/n! which means it'll almost never encounter that bad case.
