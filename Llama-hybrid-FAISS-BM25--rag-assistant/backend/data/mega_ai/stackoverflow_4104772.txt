rails Gemfile.lock - gem windows version versus linux

Looking at my Gemfile.lock , I found a gem specified with a windows version. That is because I develop under a windows environment (I know. What can I say ?). Unfortunately, I use heroku, which is linux environment. This cause the app to crash. I found a workaround : deleting the Gemfile.lock and then committing and pushing. But this solution is not great right ? I mean, it's like fixing a wind shield with duct tape. I was wondering if you guys have found a solution more elegant for this environment problem, that will not force me to manipulate files. In advance, thanks.
