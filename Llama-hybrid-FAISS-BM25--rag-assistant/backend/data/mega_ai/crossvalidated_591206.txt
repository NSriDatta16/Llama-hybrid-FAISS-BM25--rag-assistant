Election Predict Using Machine Learning

I want to predict the election results in a country. Firstly I want to check and specify probabilty. For doing this, I intend to use the election results of the past years and the estimation results of the survey companies. For example, in the election held in 2012, the survey firm x made a prediction of 30 percent for party a, part b, etc... In the election that took place that year, party a came in first with a share of 32 percent. Here, using the difference between the 30 percent forecast and the 32 percent rate for verification, how can I predict the election results in 2023 with using the survey forecasts of the companies.
