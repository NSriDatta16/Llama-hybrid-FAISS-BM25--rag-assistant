Copula to ensure one team wins and the other loses (Bernoulli margins)

Team $1$ has a historical win percentage of $p_1$ . Team $2$ has a historical win percentage of $p_2$ . The upcoming game features team $1$ against team $2$ and cannot end in a tie (one team wins, and the other loses). While this isn't strictly true, assume the time series of wins for each team to be $iid$ (so no player injuries, improvements, etc). I want to know the joint distribution of the game outcome. It seems like I can use margins of Bernoulli $(p_1)$ and Bernoulli $(p_2)$ . For the copula, I figured I could use a Gaussian copula with a "correlation" parameter of $-1$ so that the Bernoulli margins always have opposite outcomes. However, when I simulated this, I did not observe such behavior. library(copula) set.seed(2023) # Gaussian copula with -1 as the "correlation" parameter # cop Nine of the ten simulated games gave (1, 1) outcomes that I interpret as ties (yet, curiously, there are not any (0, 0) outcomes, even in a million simulated games). Therefore, using a Gaussian copula with the "correlation" parameter set to $-1$ does not force anyone to lose (Bernoulli outcome of $0$ ). If this Gaussian copula doesn't do the trick, what would?
