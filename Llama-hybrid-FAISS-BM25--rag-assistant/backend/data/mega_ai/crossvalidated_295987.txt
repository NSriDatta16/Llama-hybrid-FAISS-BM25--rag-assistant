Metrics to identify the presence of more than one circle in a set of (x,y) coordinates

I have a set of $(x,y)$ coordinates that represent any number of circles in a plane. What I am trying to do is determine whether there is 1 or more circles present in the data set. This would normally be pretty easy except that the data that is being generated is coming from a rather imperfect particle detector. As a result, a circle is on average represented by at most $5$ to $10$ points. The circles can be arranged in any way on the plane from completely overlapping each other to completely separated. An example is shown below of three common arrangements with the ideal image shown followed by what is actually observed in the detector. Any ideas on clever ways to efficiently distinguish between these scenarios? Emphasis on efficiency because it needs to be done approximately $300,000$ times a second. Example 1 - 3 Circles Random Overlap: Example 2 - 3 Circles Linear Overlap: Example 3 - 2 Circles Almost Complete Overlap
