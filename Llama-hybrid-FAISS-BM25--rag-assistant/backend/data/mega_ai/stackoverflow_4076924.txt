As you mentioned you can always pass the user list as extra param, thats not so bad. If you don't want to do this just put it in State. You can have a special State just for this part of the calculation that also contains the user list. Then there always is the possibility of putting it in ETS or in another server process. What exactly to do is hard to recommend since it depends a lot on your exact application and preferences. Just choose from the mentioned possibilities as if the process dictionary doesn't exist. Maybe your code needs restructuring if none of the variants look elegant, there always is some better way without the process dictionary. Its really bad it is still there, because its alluring to many beginning Erlang users.
