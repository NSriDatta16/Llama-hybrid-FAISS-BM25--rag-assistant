I noticed this error (System Error. Code: 8. Not enough storage...) recently when using some Twain code, it was happening on my computer and not my coworker's, and the only real difference between our machines is that I use the laptop screen as a second monitor, so my total desktop dimensions are larger. I found documentation of the problem pointed to above by Steve Black, but I found a way (that fixed the error on my machine, at least) that does not require editing the registry: The old code was using DC := GetDC(Owner.VirtualWindow); // ... ReleaseDC(Owner.VirtualWindow, DC); and I found that replacing it with this got rid of my errors DC := CreateCompatibleDC(Owner.VirtualWindow); // ... DeleteDC(DC); I don't know if this has relevance to your problem, but it may be helpful for others in the future.
