User agent etails - lookup based?

When detecting user details like Browser name, OS name, versions, City (from IP address), screen resolution, Flash enabled, etc. are these text entries in the database or do we use lookups to FK them in the user log table? This table is the session details table for users who are signed in to my site. Currently my team has these are varchars but I want it as FK IDs from a lookup list of values for each so I can perform detailed analytic, however I am not sure what works in the 'real world'?
