MVVM- Trigger Storyboard in the View Model in Silverlight

I have a couple of Storyboards in my view that I would like to trigger from the ViewModel if possible. Is there a simple way or elegant way of doing this. Here is what I am trying to do. Person Clicks on a Button-->RelayCommand (In the ViewModel), the Relay Command should then play the storyboard. Also one more thing, I would like to also trigger the storyboard animation by itself in the ViewModel without any interaction.
