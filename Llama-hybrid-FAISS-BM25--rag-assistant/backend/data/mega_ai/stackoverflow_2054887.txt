WM_SysCommand Preventing window move in delphi

I use the following code to capture when the minimise button of my program is pressed so that I can hide the form from the taskbar, and as such minimise to the system tray. procedure TForm1.WMSysCommand; begin if (Msg.CmdType = SC_MINIMIZE) then begin form1.Hide; show1.Checked :=false; hide1.Checked :=true; end; if (Msg.CmdType = SC_CLOSE) then form1.Close; end; I have had to put the capture in for the close button too as this code was preventing the program closing via the close button. What I need help with is how to fix dragging the program window by the caption bar which has stopped working with this code.
