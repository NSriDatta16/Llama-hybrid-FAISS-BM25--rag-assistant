As you tagged this question with zend-framework I think you want to implement this with ZF. Look at the constructor of the Zend_OpenId_Provider public function __construct($loginUrl = null, $trustUrl = null, Zend_OpenId_Provider_User $user = null, Zend_OpenId_Provider_Storage $storage = null, $sessionTtl = 3600) The important one is the $storage parameter. In the example on http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.openid.provider.html they do not pass any parameters. That means by default the Zend_OpenId_Provider_Storage_File provider is used. Again this one would store per default in files in your TEMP directory ( /tmp on Linux). Basically the example should be fully functional. You could register some more users by calling $server->register($someid, $somepassword); But as it stores accounts per default in the temporary directory, you should replace that line by something like this (if it is okay to store accounts in files): $dir = "/var/lib/myopenidusers"; mkdir($dir); $server = new Zend_OpenId_Provider(null, null, null, new Zend_OpenId_Provider_Storage($dir) ); Now, if you prefer to store your users in a database you have to implement your own Provider_Storage. Have a look at the abstract class abstract class Zend_OpenId_Provider_Storage . This are the methods you have to implement.
