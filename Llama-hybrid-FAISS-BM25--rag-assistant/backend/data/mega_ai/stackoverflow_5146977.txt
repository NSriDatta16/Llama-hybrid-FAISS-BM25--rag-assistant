Yeah should be fine, just build your main controller using the shopping cart class, so it's basically just a shopping app. After it's built match the design, and maybe the htaccess / routes to have the same url structure. It all depends on the scale / bespoke nature of ecommerce you are planning. A possibly quicker option would be Magento http://www.magentocommerce.com/ which I can't speak highly enough of. It's definitely my first port of call for ecommerce when I'm doing development jobs. Good luck.
