Down-convert Visual C# 2008 Professional to Express?

I have been working on a project in Visual Studio 2008 Professional, and I recently tried to open it up on a computer with Visual Studio 2008 Express and four of the six projects were unavailable as Visual Studio puts it. I don't understand why, I am not using openMP or plugins. Just my code, some XNA , and a couple of libraries like EasyStorage . Am I stuck? I thought there would be an automatic conversion. I also couldn't ever get others to help me on my projects if it requires them to buy Visual Studio 2008 or Visual Studio 2010 Professional...
