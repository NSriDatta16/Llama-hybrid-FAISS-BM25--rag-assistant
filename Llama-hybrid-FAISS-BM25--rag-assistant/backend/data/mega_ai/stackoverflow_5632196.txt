Beware! Dav Glass of the YUI team advised that the reference I'm after is not available in Y2.8.1 DragDrop - though it is in YUI3. Though its not feasible in my case to switch to YUI3, a suitable (if hacky) solution was to add all droppables to a single group (instead of many groups) so that they all trigger onDragDrop . From there, its possible to qualify in/valid drop targets based on things like the drop targets' id , classNames , or in my case some custom object props. Problem... solved.
