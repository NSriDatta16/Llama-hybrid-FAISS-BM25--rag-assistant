Creating a PHP page that runs a release script on Unix

I've just completed writing some release scripts on my client's new server that creates an SVN tag and checks it out, creating all the specific symlinks and releases it onto either their production or staging websites. My client quite likes getting his hands dirty, and is increasingly comfortable getting under the hood and making PHP/HTML changes when I'm focusing on something else. He's actually quite good, and I'm encouraging him to continue because it's good for both of us and he doesn't annoy me by making simple or annoying errors. I'm going to set him up with a SVN client so he can commit his changes, but the only thing outstanding from the process is allowing him to release those changes to staging and production. Of course, I can give him access to the server via. SSH and walk him through the process, but that seems like it has the potential to go seriously wrong at some point. I'm thinking of setting up a PHP password-protected page that will let him run those scripts by clicking a button. So, I've two questions: a) Is the approach I'm taking with a PHP page to expose the release scripts reasonable, and b) What is the best way to implement this type of page in PHP? The script is a straight-forward shell script Cheers
