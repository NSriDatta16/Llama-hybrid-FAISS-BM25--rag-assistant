Hm... I would say it is because the scrolling is caught by the dragged element, as it is on top of the VGroup. So - I guess the solution would be to listen to scrolling event in the dragged element and send that to the VGroup / something that will handle the drag'n'scrolling of the VGroup. Also - I am not sure, but when you are dragging, the VGroup might no more be specified as the dragged element's parent - so, just add a realParent reference or whatever so you can always access it.
