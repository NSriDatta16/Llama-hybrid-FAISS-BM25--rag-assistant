The documentation for GCHandle.Alloc indicates: An instance with nonprimitive (non-blittable) members cannot be pinned. Object references are not primitive (aka blittable) members. The implementation of types like List etc. use object references (such as array references) internally. Thus they have nonprimitive members and cannot be pinned. Arrays are different: if the element type of the array is blittable (i.e. a value type with no non-blittable fields), then the array can be pinned. But that doesn't mean a reference to the array can be pinned; a reference to the array is not the array. Collection classes like List contain a reference to an internal storage array. They are not arrays themselves.
