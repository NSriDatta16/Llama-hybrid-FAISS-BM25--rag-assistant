Signs for marginal effects and regression coefficients are inconsistent for beta regression

I have conducted a zero-one inflated beta (ZOIB) regression using a logit link function for explaining tenure incidence in colleges and universities. Tenure incidence is a proportion in the interval [0,1]. I have 12 explanatory variables in my model. This is the part of the STATA report for the regression corresponding to the interval (0,1): I requested the marginal effects at the means, which are reported here in the dy/dx column: I expected the signs on the marginal effects to be the same as the signs on the corresponding regression coefficients, but the signs for TUITION, PUBLSERV2, LABRMKT, PROFDEGS, and MEDICAL1 are not the same. I based my expectation that the signs would be the same on this equation, which is the definition of a marginal effect in a logistic regression: where bk is the regression coefficient for the k-th independent variable Xk and P is the probability. Because both P and (1 - P) must be positive, the regression coefficient determines the sign of the partial derivative. This is the code that was used to run the ZOIB regression and call for the marginals: My question is: Why don't five of my marginals have the same signs as their respective regression coefficients?
