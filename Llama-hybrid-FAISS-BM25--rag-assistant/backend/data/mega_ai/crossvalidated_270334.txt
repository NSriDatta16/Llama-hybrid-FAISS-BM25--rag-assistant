Applicability of Principal Component Analysis

I need some guidance on applying PCA analysis to my data. As a novice in statistics I'm not sure if PCA is suitable and profitable in my case. I have daily gridded SST data for a 35 years (1982-2015) in a single file with columns "date","SST at point 1",....,"SST at point n" These are temporal series for 4248 points through 35 years (daily values). Should I apply PCA to this data? What results should I look for? Well, I'm not sure I would get any profit from PCA cause all my variables (columns) are SST values, I think I don't have components to extract with PCA. Maybe PCA is not suitable for that data, maybe my approach to PCA is not good. I also have the daily SST data in gridded files (lon,lat,SST) but I don't think I can apply PCA on them. Any guidance will be welcome. Thanks in advance
