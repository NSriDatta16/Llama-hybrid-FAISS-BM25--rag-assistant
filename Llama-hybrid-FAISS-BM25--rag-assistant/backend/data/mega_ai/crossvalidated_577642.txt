Transition matrix as a feature to feed machine learning algorithm

Currently, I am trying to replicate a paper to extend the research on the paper they create a transition matrix similar to this one: my question is : how can I feed this information into my KNN or SVM algorithms? As far as I understand they only receive columns with continuous or discrete data, I was suggested to flat the matrix. Nonetheless it seems the authors of the paper opt for a different approach. Here are some passages from the paper: We normalize the chord transition matrices by the total number of chord transitions so that each element represents the probability of the chord transition. We discretize the musical features and emotions while 2-chord, 3-chord matrix, and chord histogram are used as binary data regarding non-zero value as one. Thanks a lot
