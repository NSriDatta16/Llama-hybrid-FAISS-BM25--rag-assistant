SqlCe odd results why? -- Same SQL, different results in different apps. Issue with

When I run this SQl in my mobile app I get zero rows. select * from inventory WHERE [ITEMNUM] LIKE 'PUMP%' AND [LOCATION] = 'GARAGE' When I run the same SQL in Query Analyzer 3.5 using the same database I get my expected one row. Why the difference? Here is the code I'm using in the mobile app: SqlCeCommand cmd = new SqlCeCommand(Query); cmd.Connection = new SqlCeConnection("Data Source="+filePath+";Persist Security Info=False;"); DataTable tmpTable = new DataTable(); cmd.Connection.Open(); SqlCeDataReader tmpRdr = cmd.ExecuteReader(); if (tmpRdr.Read()) tmpTable.Load(tmpRdr); tmpRdr.Close(); cmd.Connection.Close(); return tmpTable; UPDATE: For the sake of trying I used the code found in one of the answers found here and it works as expected. So my code looks like this: SqlCeConnection conn = new SqlCeConnection("Data Source=" + filePath + ";Persist Security Info=False;"); DataTable tmpTable = new DataTable(); SqlCeDataAdapter AD = new SqlCeDataAdapter(Query, conn); AD.Fill(tmpTable); The issue appears to be with the SqlCeDataReader. Hope this helps someone else out!
