Al gave you a good answer . I'd also add vim.wikia that has a few tips related to your question. On a side note. I wouldn't say that ma10jd'a20kp is more elegant. I see the following problems: it's quite difficult to maintain (what if the number of lines shall become a parameter?), people like to override keys they never learned to use (this could be fixed with a banged :normal! ), some normal-mode commands have strange behaviour on side-case (like when the cursor is on the first column), it messes the mark a , and the unnamed register -- other scripts, or even the user may expect their values to not be altered by your script.
