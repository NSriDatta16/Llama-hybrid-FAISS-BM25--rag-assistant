find out if something has changed in a website using an RSS feed

I need to find out if something has changed in a website using an RSS Feed. My solution was to constantly download the entire rss file, get the entries.length and compare it with the last known entries.length. I find it to be a very inelegant solution. Can anyone suggest a different approach? Details: • My application is an html file which uses javascript. It should be small enough to function as a desktop gadget or a browser extension. • Currently, it downloads the rss file every thirty seconds just to get the length. • It can download from any website with an Rss feed. Comments and suggestions are appreciated, thanks in advance~ ^^
