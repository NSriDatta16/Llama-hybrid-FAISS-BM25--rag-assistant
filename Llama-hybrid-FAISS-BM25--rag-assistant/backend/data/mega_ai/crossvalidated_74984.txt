Suggestion for doing research in data mining and machine learning

I am a fresh graduate student. I want to do research in machine learning and data mining. There is no professor in our department doing this! I want to try to do this by myself, at least for a while. But I don't where should I start. What books or review papers should I read at the beginning?
