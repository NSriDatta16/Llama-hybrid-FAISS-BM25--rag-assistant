Adding anchor line to a Bing Maps custom pushpin and allowing the user to drag

I am currently working on a Silverlight application using the Bing Map control, i am using a custom pushpin made up of an Image and a text block within a grid element, which works fine, this also allows me to have hover and right click events for each pushpin so all good so far, however there is a need for me to enable the user to drag the pushpin in any direction and have an a line connecting it to its actual position, sort of like an anchoring point. I am struggling to see how to do this, I have seen lots of information on making the pushpins have the capability to be moved by the mouse but the line and anchor part is causing me a bit of a problem. Currently i keep my pushpins in various Observable Collections so that when they are updated the UI updates. If anyone has an Idea on a clean way of adding this functionality please let me know it will be much appreciated. Many Thanks
