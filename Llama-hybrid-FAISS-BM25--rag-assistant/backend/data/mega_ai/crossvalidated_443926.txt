The method introduced in this paper by Flaxman el al. does a form of approximated gradient descent for this type of problem. Specifically, they consider the setting in which you're optimizing over a convex set, and you receive feedback at one point per iteration. Their method constructs an unbiased estimate of the gradient at each iteration, and they show that this scheme performs well. There may be more recent developments in this space, but I like the elegance of this method. I assume what you mean by a "natural ordering between bandits" is that the decision set is continuous and convex (the set of button sizes in your case), rather than a discrete set of objects.
