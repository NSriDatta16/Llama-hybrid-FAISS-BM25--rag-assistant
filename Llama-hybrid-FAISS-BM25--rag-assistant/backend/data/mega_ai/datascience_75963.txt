Both of these methods are used to combine independent transformations (transformers) into a single transformer, by independent I mean transformation (transformers) that don't need to be executed in a defined order. That's because unlike in regular pipelines, one transformer is not applied to the output of another transformer. The main difference is that: each transformer in a feature union object gets the whole data as input. While in column transformer object they get only part of the data as input. Both of them concatenate the results of each transformer in the end. Both can use parallel processing.
