Magento Admin Dashboard graph displays "no data found" sometimes, how do I remove that?

The graph/chart that appears on the frontpage of the admin panel dashboard says "No Data Found" if an order or sale hasn't been placed in the time period selected. I want to display the chart no matter what, even if there are no orders. What do I have to modify to do this? The code or just a template?
