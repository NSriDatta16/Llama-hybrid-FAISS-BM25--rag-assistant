I have accepted an answer above and am only writing this as an answer because I think my research could be beneficial to other Python users. The comments and answers above helpfully directed me towards Survival Analysis. After exploring the modelling options in StatsModels , I then discovered the library Lifelines by Cameron Davidson Pilon (@Cam.Davidson.Pilon). I can thoroughly recommend Lifelines to anyone looking to do duration-based analysis in Python. It's excellent in many ways. I particularly like the way it addresses - both theoretically and practically - the concept of Censorship . Given how elegant and effective the library is, and how broad the applications of Survival Analysis are, I'm somewhat surprised Lifelines isn't better known. I can also recommend watching this introductory talk . It got me up and running with Lifelines in no time.
