This just sounds like a bad idea. If your field and the iframe's field are both fighting over focus you could cause an infinite-loop and hang their browser, or you may just make it impossible to type into either field. And what if the user wants to type into the iframe's field? If I went to a site that behaved like you describe, I'd leave and never return. If there's something that requires the users immediate, undivided attention like you're implying then it should be the only thing on the page, similar to many login pages.
