It sounds like what you need to do is to set up a script to start and stop replication on a slave database. If you can do that via a script, then you can establish a workflow in SSIS such as follows: Stop Replication to Slave MySQL Database If Replication has Stopped, then Take Snapshot of Slave MySQL Database If Snapshot has been Taken, then a= Start Replication to Slave MySQL Database b= Import Slave MySQL Database Replica into SQL Server NB: 3a and 3b can run in parallel. I think your best bet in such a scenario would be to use SSIS to enable and disable MySQL database replication to the slave as well as to take a snapshot of the slave database. Then you can drive the whole thing from the SQL Server Agent mechanism. Hope this helps
