After some more research (with the new keywords cagdas supplied me with), I came to this solution: ' ' POST: /Member/Create _ Function Create( ByVal memberToCreate As eForening.Biz.Member) As ActionResult If ModelState.Item("DateOfBirth").Value.AttemptedValue = String.Empty Then ModelState.Item("DateOfBirth").Errors.Clear() End If If Not ModelState.IsValid Then Return View() End If memberToCreate.Save() Return RedirectToAction("Index") End Function This lets me handle both empty and specified values for DateOfBirth - and let's me keep my existing Business Class the way it is (and as it should be, in my oppinion). I basicly check the supplied value of DateOfBirth, and if the supplied value is an empty string, I will reset the error-count of that field and let validation continue - before checking Modelstate.IsValid. Maybe there is a more elegant solution to this, but it is the best option I have found so far.
