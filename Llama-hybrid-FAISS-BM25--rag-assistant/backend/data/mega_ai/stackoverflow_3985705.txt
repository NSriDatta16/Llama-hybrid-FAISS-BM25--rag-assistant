Python - go to two lines above match

In a text file like this: First Name last name # secone name Address Line 1 Address Line 2 Work Phone: Home Phone: Status: First Name last name # ....same as above... I need to match string 'Work Phone:' then go two lines up and insert character '|' in the begining of line. so pseudo code would be: if "Work Phone:" in line: go up two lines: write | + line write rest of the lines. File is about 10 mb and there are about 1000 paragraphs like this. Then i need to write it to another file. So desired result would be: First Name last name # secone name |Address Line 1 Address Line 2 Work Phone: Home Phone: Status: thanks for any help.
