Queues against Tables in messaging systems

I've been experiencing the good and the bad sides of messaging systems in real production environments , and I must admit that a well organized table or schema of tables simply beats every time any other form of messaging queue, because: Data are permanently stored on a table. I've seen so many java (jms) applications that lose or vanish messages on their way for uncaught exceptions or other bugs. Queues tend to fill up. Db storage is virtually infinite, instead. Tables are easily accessible, while you have to use esotic instruments to read from a queue. What's your opinion on each approach?
