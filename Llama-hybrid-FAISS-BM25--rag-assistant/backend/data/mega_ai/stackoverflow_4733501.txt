ClickOnce deployed application registry persmission issue

I have developed an application in C# with an option to run at Windows startup implemented using registry (current user hive). When I run my application from VS or from the bin folder, this option works. When I create ClickOnce installer (to be run from internet) and put it on Codeplex, after the application is installed this option does not work. No exception is thown, it just makes registry write. I suppose there is some kind of a security issue. I tried to create a ClickOnce installer with the option to be run from a CD/local storage , after the application is installed it works. It just does not work after installing using the ClickOnce web installer (put on CodePlex). I looked at the Publish settings, there are set to default = full trust. I really do not know what to do now to make the run at startup option work.
