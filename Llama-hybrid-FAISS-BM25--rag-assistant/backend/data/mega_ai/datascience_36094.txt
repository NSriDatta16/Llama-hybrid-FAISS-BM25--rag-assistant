Backpropogation "The hardest derivation I have seen in machine learning"?

In week 3 of Andrew Ng's "Neural Networks and Deep Learning" on Coursera there is a video titled "Backpropogation Intuition" during which he gives the full vectorized backpropogation formula, and ends the lecture suggesting that students who are good at calculus try to derive these from first principles, saying "it is one of the hardest derivations I have seen in the whole machine learning". Please can someone post a link to a source that gives this derivation, ideally, using the same notation as Andrew Ng:
