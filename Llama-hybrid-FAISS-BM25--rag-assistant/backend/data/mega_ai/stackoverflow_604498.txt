what you have is a sample whose length in time is 256/44100 = 0.00580499 seconds. This means that your frequency resolution is 1 / 0.00580499 = 172 Hz. The 256 values you get out from Python correspond to the frequencies, basically, from 86 Hz to 255*172+86 Hz = 43946 Hz. The numbers you get out are complex numbers (hence the "j" at the end of every second number). EDITED: FIXED WRONG INFORMATION You need to convert the complex numbers into amplitude by calculating the sqrt(i 2 + j 2 ) where i and j are the real and imaginary parts, resp. If you want to have 32 bars, you should as far as I understand take the average of four successive amplitudes, getting 256 / 4 = 32 bars as you want.
