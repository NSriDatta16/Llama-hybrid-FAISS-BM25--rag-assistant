Relative LOC counts for code and tests are pointless. What matters more is test coverage. What matters most is finding the bugs. When I'm writing unit tests, I tend to focus my efforts on testing complicated code that is more likely to contain bugs. Simple stuff (e.g. simple getter and setter methods) is unlikely to contain bugs, and can be tested indirectly by higher-level unit tests.
