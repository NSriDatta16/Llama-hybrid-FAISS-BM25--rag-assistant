It is possible. Creating higher resolution imaging with deep learning has been done in several fields. Medical imaging is one of the most common fields. The general approach is called "learning-based upsampling". It is also called "resolution enhancement" or "super-resolution (SR) reconstruction" in the literature. The goal is to obtain a higher-resolution (HR) output from lower-resolution (LR) versions. There are many options to consider including: Sampling order (pre-upsampling SR vs. post-upsampling SR) Loss functions (pixelwise L1 or L2 loss, content loss, adversarial loss, peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR)), Architectures (Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), residual learning, recursive learning,Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN)) " A Review on Deep Learning Super Resolution Techniques " by Khoo et al is one place to begin. One possible limitation is a lack of original data. You might have apply data augmentation within the bounds of the projects to synthetically increase the amount of training data or try Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) .
