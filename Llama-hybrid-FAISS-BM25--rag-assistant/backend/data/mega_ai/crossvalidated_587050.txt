Can I use the CoxPH model for 'count' variable instead of time variable?

I'm working on the survival rate with transaction data. I can use the transaction date for CoxPH, but I wanna know whether I can try to use the number of transactions instead of the transaction date. [Edit] To be specific, I wanna use the number of transactions as a type of time scale. So, the result would be "survival rate is 70% at the 5th transaction". I actually already tried it, but when I do it with the number of transactions, CLV(the customer lifetime value) is quite different from the CLV with the time variable. -- I calculate CLV like this (with 5 years of data) When "with # transaction as time scale" : Sum of survival rate (meaning that the average number of total transactions) When "time variable": each survival rate multiplied by the average number of transactions each month, and the sum of them. I know this is complicated, but my point is that I wanna know if I can use the number of transactions as a time scale instead of a "time variable".
