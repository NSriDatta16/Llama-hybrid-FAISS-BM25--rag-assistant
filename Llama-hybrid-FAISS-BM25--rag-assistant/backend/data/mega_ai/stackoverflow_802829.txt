Our company uses load runner with 3 different sets of scripts. 1 script is to mimic a basic use case for the web site, main-page, log-in, navigation to subject area etc.... the second script is to do a random site search based on 100 possible search terms. and the 3rd test is for a use case of a response to a mass e-mail to our subscribers. each script we repeat the action 20 times. We run the 1st script at 100 concurrent users starting with 1 user increasing by 5 every 30 seconds and we let that run and we pull the statistics. We run the 2nd script at 20 concurrent users starting with 1 user increasing by 2 every 30 seconds We run the 3rd script at 500 concurrent users starting with 1 and increasing by 10 every 5 seconds. The important part is that we run the same load test and track / analyze the results with each change to the infrastructure. Load runner tracks the response time, failure rates and a few other statistics... with remote agents it can track the database and server vitals as well.
