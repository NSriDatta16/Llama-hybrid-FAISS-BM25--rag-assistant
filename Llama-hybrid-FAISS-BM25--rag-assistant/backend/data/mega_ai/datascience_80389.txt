What is an autoencoder?

I am a student and I am studying machine learning. I am focusing on deep generative models , and in particular to autoencoders and variational autoencoders (VAE) . I am trying to understand the concept, but I am having some problems. So far, I have understood that an autoencoder takes an input, for example an image, and wants to reduce this image into a latent space , which should contain the underlying features of the dataset, with an operation of encoding , then, with an operation of decoding , it reconstrunct the image which has lost some information due to the encoding part. After this, with a loss function, it reconstruct the latent space and so get the latent features. about the VAE, it uses a probabilistic approch, so we have to learn the meand anv covariance of a gaussian. So far this is what I have understood. What I have really unclear is what are we trying to learn with autoencoders and VAE? I have seen examples where an image goes feom a non smiling to a smiling face, or to a black and white image to a colored image. But I don't understand the main concept, which is: what does an autoencoder do? I add here some sources of where I studied so that who needs can see them: https://hackernoon.com/autoencoders-deep-learning-bits-1-11731e200694 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFBFl1cLYx8 https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zKuYvjFFS8
