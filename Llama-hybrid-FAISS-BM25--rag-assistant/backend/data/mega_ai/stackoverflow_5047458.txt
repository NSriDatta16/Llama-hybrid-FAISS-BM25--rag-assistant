I don't know of a compiled list, but I can list a few: SVG is not supported (currently) in Android, as it's been turned off. Support is coming in Honeycomb. In contrast, iOS has left the SVG support enabled and it seems to work nicely. While both browsers support CSS3 opacity, make sure you thoroughly test any animations as they can be quite choppy for more complex graphics (especially with multiple layers of opacity.) In my javascript, I typically listen for the "touchstart", "touchmove", or "touchend" events for the sake of speed (the "click" event typically elicits a noticeable lag) and granularity. HTML5 features such as localStorage and the new audio and video tags seem to work well. However, on the iphone you can't autoplay audio or video, as the play event (and corresponding download) must be directly triggered by the user. Transitions involving movement (changing x and y coordinates) are quite smooth. In contrast, transitions involving opacity can be quite choppy depending on the resources involved (sometimes you might have to use a sprite to get a smoother feel.) Just some quick observations.
