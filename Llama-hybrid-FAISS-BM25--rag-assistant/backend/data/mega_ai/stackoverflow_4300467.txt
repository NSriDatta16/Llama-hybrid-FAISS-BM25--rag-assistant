Chrome: Changing Select Value with jQuery is not working correctly

This code worked in IE, FF, and Safari (windows7). It is not working in Chrome however. Basically, I am trying to make some changes on page load (Magento product page). I change the selected option (of a hidden select dropdown), then when they hover over the Add to Cart button, I make sure that an option was selected. Code below: $j('select#attribute76').val( $j('a'+hash).attr('index') ).change(); alert($j('select#attribute76').val()); // shows correctly w/ all browsers ... then later on ... $j('#addtocartbutton').hover(function(){ //alert($j('select#attribute76 option:selected').val());// empty in Chrome! if ($j('select#attribute76').val()=='')// empty in Chrome! $j('.infoOptionsColors a:first').click(); }); What is happening is that Chrome is selecting the option that I am asking it to, but it reverts back somehow... perhaps there is another call that is overriding it..
