In general you should ALWAYS try/catch errors with XMLRPC/SOAP (to Magento) as you cannot guarantee the internet connection between A and B is working. I think your error may be Python's way of saying '50x blah' or '404 blah' IF you have not fully looked at the error object: http://docs.python.org/library/xmlrpclib.html#protocolerror-objects
