… suppose I want to compute the average enrollment limit for all the classes in the CS department. This is easy to do with NSArray's and NSSet's @avg operator . Of course, that will return an NSNumber, which puts you back in problem #2: Let's say I want to compare course numbers: //classFoo is a NSManagedObjects I've fetched if ([[classFoo valueForKey@"courseNumber"] intValue] I assume you mean that the problem you risk is omitting the intValue message, thereby comparing the NSNumber object's id to the int . The compiler offers a warning for such comparisons. In Xcode, add -Wextra to your “Other C Flags” build setting. For more warning options, see the full list of GCC warnings .
