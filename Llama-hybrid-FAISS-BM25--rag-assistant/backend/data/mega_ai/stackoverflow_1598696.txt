google maps, cellid to location

According to this sample: http://www.codeproject.com/KB/mobile/DeepCast.aspx It's possible to request a gps coordinate (longitude & latitude) including range when sending cellid information (MCC, MNC, towerid, etc) Can someone tell me the actual parameter to request/post to this address? http://www.google.com/glm/mmap It could be something like this http://www.google.com/glm/mmap?mcc=xxx&mnc=xxx&towerid=xxx And i would like to know what response we would get. I have observe OpenCellid website and they provide some nice API to begin with, but i want to know about that in google map too (since they have more completed database). OpenCellID API
