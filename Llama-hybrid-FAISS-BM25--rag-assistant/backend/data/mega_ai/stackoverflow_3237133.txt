I guess you could avoid recursion by rewriting this along the lines of while(organisationalUnit!=null && !organisationalUnit.IsMainUnit) organisationalUnit=organisationalUnit.Parent; return organisationalUnit; I hope that helps. EDIT: I just realized this would still fail if you have some sort of cyclic dependency.
