Maybe you could show us a plot of this time series? Name the two persons A, B. Find points which correspond to the same "laugh call" maybe based on some maximum time difference. How many laugh calls have both A and B? How many only one of them? That would be informative. Also, for the laugh calls with both A,B, is always A first? always B first? or do they alternate in some way? What is the typical time difference? Is it the same when A first as with B first? Maybe some results could come from such descriptions. Can you show us some such descriptive stats, then maybe we can have better ideas?
