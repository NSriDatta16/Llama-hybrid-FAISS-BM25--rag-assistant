custom attribute UI in Magento admin

I'm trying to change the way Magento shows options of an attribute with multiple select. I have 10K options for this attribute. How can I override the UI and use an Ajax based UI? The admin will be able to filter options and present only ~20 each time. I know how to use js and php for this but not in Magento. Thanks
