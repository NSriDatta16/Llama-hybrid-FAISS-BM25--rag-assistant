You can't just write files to local folders without prompting the user a second time (e.g. save as dialog http://www.silverlightshow.net/items/Using-the-SaveFileDialog-in-Silverlight-3.aspx ) You could write it to isolated storage instead: http://blogs.silverlight.net/blogs/msnow/archive/2009/05/21/71909.aspx . If you want specific examples (e.g. going straight from OpenFileDialog to Isolated storage) I strongly recommend you use Google. The first match on " silverlight openfiledialog to isolated storage " is this: http://forums.silverlight.net/forums/t/201362.aspx
