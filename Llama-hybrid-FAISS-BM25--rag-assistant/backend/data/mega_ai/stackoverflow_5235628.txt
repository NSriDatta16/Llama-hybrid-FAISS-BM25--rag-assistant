Magento: Get product price from another store?

I have multi-store Magento installation, and different product prices are set in different stores. I want to display on one page the actual product price from the current store, and the price from other store (I have its ID), but I'm not sure how to get that info? The prices are set for each store view for each product, no tier-pricing or special-pricing was used.
