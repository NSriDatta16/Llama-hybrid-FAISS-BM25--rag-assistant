GridSplitter with min constraints

I want a Grid layout with two rows and splitter between them. Rows should have a minimum height of 80 pixels. This code works great: But I want top row to have an Auto height until user manually change it using the splitter. So I changed the code to this: And there is a problem. Splitter still satisfies row constraints, but it begins to increase top row's height infinitely if I drag splitter too low. This results in bottom row to be completely below window's bottom border. I have done some Reflector on GridSplitter code and see that it uses different logic if rows has Auto or Star height. Any suggestions how can I "fix" it?
