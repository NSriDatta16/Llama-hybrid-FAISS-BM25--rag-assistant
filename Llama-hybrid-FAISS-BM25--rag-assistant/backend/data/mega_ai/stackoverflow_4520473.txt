Eclipse - easy access to frequently used folders?

Does anyone know of a plugin for Eclipse to use 'favorite folders' in a project ? There are maybe 2 or 3 folders inside my project (of 1000+ folders) that I regularly switch between. It's really a drag to use the scrollbar in the Project Explorer each time to get to the right folder, since some of them are 5 levels deep in the directory tree. It would be VERY nice to have a separate small panel below the Project Explorer to access these frequently used folders...
