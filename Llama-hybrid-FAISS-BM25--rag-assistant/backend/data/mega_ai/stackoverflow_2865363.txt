Zend Framework - Not Connecting to IMAP mail server - instead dumps empty php file

Hi guys I'm trying to connect to an imap mail server using zend frameworks Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap function. Its working with some accounts but with most accounts it just dies out. I'm connecting using: $mail = new Zend_Mail_Storage_Imap(array('host' =>$current_dept->incoming_server, 'ssl' =>$current_dept->ssl, 'port'=>$current_dept->incoming_port, 'folder'=>$mbox_name, 'user' =>$current_dept->email, 'password' =>$current_dept->email_psd)); WIth some email accounts teh code doesn't go past this statement - and instead I'm prompted to 'download' the php file being run. Whats happening here - the mail server details are correct.
