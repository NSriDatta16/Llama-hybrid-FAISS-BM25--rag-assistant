Consider the model: $$ y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \text{treatment} + \beta_2 \text{block} + \beta_3 \text{year} $$ Where $y$ is some outcome of interest, treatment is a treatment factor, block is a blocking factor and year is the year (a factor) where the experiment is repeated over several years. We would like to recover $E(Y|\text{treatment})$ , but it cannot done from this model. Instead we find $E(Y|\text{treatment}, \text{block}, \text{year})$ . However we could average the fitted value from $E(Y|\text{treatment}, \text{block}, \text{year})$ , over block and year, and then think of it as $E(Y|\text{treatment})$ . If the model is estimated by least squares (OLS in the linear case), this is the LS-mean (of treatment, in this case). For a reference on implementation (in R) see this pdf it also covers LS-means from the common models.
