Assume that your sample contains only two realizations. I guess an intuitive measure of dispersion would be the average absolute deviation (AAD) $$AAD = \frac 12 (|x_1-\bar x| + |x_2-\bar x|) = ...= \frac {|x_1-x_2|}{2}$$ So we would want other measures of dispersion at the same level of units of measurement to be "close" to the above. The sample variance is defined as $$\sigma^2=\frac{1}{2}[(x_1-\bar x)^2 + (x_2-\bar x)^2] = \frac 12 \left[\left(\frac {x_1-x_2}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac {x_2-x_1}{2}\right)^2\right]$$ $$=\frac 12 \left[\frac {(x_1-x_2)^2}{4} + \frac {(x_1-x_2)^2}{4}\right]=\frac 12 \frac {(x_1-x_2)^2}{2}$$ $$=\frac 12\cdot \frac {|x_1-x_2|^2}{2}$$ To return to the original units of measurement, if we did as the student wondered/suggested,we would obtain the measure, call it $q$ $$ q \equiv \frac 12\cdot \sqrt {\frac {|x_1-x_2|^2}{2}} = \frac 12 \frac {|x_1-x_2|}{\sqrt 2} = \frac 1{\sqrt 2} AAD i.e. we would have "downplayed" the "intuitive" measure of dispersion, while if we have considered the standard deviation as defined, $$SD \equiv \sqrt {\sigma^2} = \frac {|x_1-x_2|}{2} =AAD$$ Since we want to "stay as close as possible" to the intuitive measure, we should use $SD$. ADDENDUM Let's consider now a sample of size $n$ We have $$n\cdot AAD = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-\bar x|$$ and $$n \cdot \text{Var}(X) = \sum_{i=1}^n (x_i-\bar x)^2 = \sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-\bar x|^2$$ we can write the right-hand side of the variance expression as $$\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-\bar x|^2 = \left(\sum_{i=1}^n |x_i-\bar x|\right)^2 - \sum_{j\neq i} |x_i-\bar x||x_j-\bar x|$$ $$ = \left (n\cdot AAD\right)^2 - \sum_{j\neq i} |x_i-\bar x||x_j-\bar x|$$ Then the dispersion measure $q_n$ will be $$q_n \equiv \frac 1n \left[n^2\cdot AAD^2 - \sum_{j\neq i} |x_i-\bar x||x_j-\bar x|\right]^{1/2}$$ $$= \left[AAD^2 - \frac 1{n^2} \sum_{j\neq i} |x_i-\bar x||x_j-\bar x|\right]^{1/2}$$ Now think informally: note that $\sum_{j\neq i} |x_i-\bar x||x_j-\bar x|$ contains $n^2-n$ terms, and so divided by $n^2$ will left us with "one term in the second power". But also "one term in the 2nd power" is what we have in $AAD^2$: this is a primitive way to "sense" why $q_n$ will tend to zero as $n$ grows large. On the other hand the Standard Deviation as defined would be $$SD \equiv \frac 1{\sqrt n} \left[n^2\cdot AAD^2 - \sum_{j\neq i} |x_i-\bar x||x_j-\bar x|\right]^{1/2}$$ $$= \left[n\cdot AAD^2 - \frac 1{n} \sum_{j\neq i} |x_i-\bar x||x_j-\bar x|\right]^{1/2}$$ Continuing are informal thinking, the first term gives us $n$ "terms in the 2nd power", while the second term gives us $n-1$ "terms in the second power" . So we will be left eventually with one such term, as $n$ grows large, and then we will take its square root. This does not mean that the Standard Deviation as defined will equal the Average Absolute Deviation in general (it doesn't), but it does show that it is suitably defined so as to be "on a par" with it for any $n$, as well as for the case when $n\rightarrow \infty$.
