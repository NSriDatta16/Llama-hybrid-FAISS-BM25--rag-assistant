Question regarding selection variables for a multiple logistic regression analysis, through univariate analysis

I use univariate analysis to select variables for a multiple logistic regression. However, one of the categorical independent variables has a non significant dummy (one of the three). Should I include this variable in my multiple logistic regression? And how many variables can I include in my multivariable model? My dependent variable is being informed, with 129 respondents being informed and 105 being uninformed.
