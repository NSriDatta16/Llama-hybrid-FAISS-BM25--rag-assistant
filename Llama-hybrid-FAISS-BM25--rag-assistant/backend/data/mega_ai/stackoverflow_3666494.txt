PHP isn't saving session when it's an ajax call

Hi all , i'm testing out a service for internal ads on our website... I need to save internal session (PHP) to know what ads have been displayed and some other protection stuff... The problem is that if i access to the API throught webbrowser GET or POST it does session (and saves the cookie of php session), but if i use jQuery.ajax() method it doesn't save it ... My link for tests is http://search.microdual.com (this is because i wanted a customized google search on my laptop :p) I suggest you to use firebug to take a look at the javascript code . (PHP code isn't needed because it is working on clicks...) To simplify the debugging, i print out on response json array from server the session id on the var {id_sessao:"..."} ... Thanks in advance, Jos√© Moreira EDIT: Headers from server: Date Wed, 08 Sep 2010 11:24:48 GMT Server Apache/2.2.8 (Ubuntu) P3P CP="NOI NID ADMa OUR IND UNI COM NAV" Cache-Control private, must-revalidate Access-Control-Allow-Orig... * Access-Control-Allow-Cred... true Access-Control-Allow-Meth...
