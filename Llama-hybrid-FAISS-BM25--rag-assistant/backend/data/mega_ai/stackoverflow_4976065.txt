Recommendations on how to organize my various web projects (rails, asp.net, binaries and git repos)

This question is more about organizing the directories/files on my computer. However, this IS a problem every programmer runs into so I thought it appropriate to ask here. Over the least few years I've worked on many projects on many platforms (classic asp, asp.net webforms, asp.net mvc, rails, etc). Most of them are websites but some are not. These projects not only have source code but also some photoshop files, word documents, spreadsheets, etc. I also like to clone interesting git repos I find on github.com and download source code from sourceforge.net. My question is, how do I organize these files in a way that makes sense? Right now I have something like this: /sourcecode /non_web_projects ... /websites /classic_asp /project1/website # the source code /project1/misc # everything else /project2/website /project2/misc ... /asp_net /project1/website /project1/misc ... /asp_net_mvc /project1/website /project1/misc ... /rails /project1/website /project1/misc ... /git_repos ... /source_forge ... But I feel this is a big mess. How do you guys organize your projects, source code, and related assets?
