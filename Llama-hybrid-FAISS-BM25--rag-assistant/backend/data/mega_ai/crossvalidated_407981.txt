Event studies: Panel OLS vs cross sectional OLS vs FE

I'm currently working on my bachelor's thesis, where I'm investigating the effect of surprise interest rate decisions on stock prices using an event study approach similar to Bernanke and Kuttner (2005) (Link: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1540-6261.2005.00760.x ). My sample consists of approximately 60 rate decisions between 2011-2019, and 47 stocks in 9 different sectors. I use a narrow event window of 1 day which should exclude most potential omitted variable bias. The variables are as follow: Dependent variable in both cases is abnormal returns; independent variables are expected and unexpected interest rate changes, a QE dummy and a dummy for directionality (positive or negative surprise). Dependent variable is log transformed. I'm using closing price for the day prior to the rate decision and closing price the same day as interest rate decision. The calculation is then Price at T minus price at T-1. The result is further divided into a normal and an abnormal component (which can be done in different ways). Picture shows how I have structured my data in excel. Example: For the panel, sectors are placed in rows to match each date. In other words, the picture continues with financials and once 60 observations are reached, it continues as telecom and so on. IRexp (expected rate change) and IRUnexp (unexpected) are used as independent variables in the panel, just not included in this picture, In the "cross section OLS" picture, abnormal return is indicated under each sector column. I should note that in both cases, the stocks' individual returns are used as an input (rather than an average of them) I have run 3 different analyses using the same model; one using cross sectional OLS, one panel OLS and one fixed effects OLS. I get the same coefficient for all methodologies, although slightly different standard errors (and thus also T statistics). I'm confused as to why this is, especially since the data input is organized differently (in the Excel files that I export to Eviews) in the different regressions. This is what I have done: A. Create an excel file with separate stock returns on dates of interest rate returns. Then I take stocks from the same sector and run a panel OLS. B. Create an excel file with separate stock returns on dates of interest rate returns. Then I take stocks from the same sector and run a panel FE OLS. C. Create an excel file with separate stock returns on dates of interest rate returns. Then I pool these together and run a regular OLS regression. In addition, I'm not sure whether or not to treat my data as panel or not (even though I understand that having multiple entities with the same cross section sample over time is longitudinal) as I'm not particularly interested in any time trends. Is my data input incorrectly specified? Does the similar results imply that there does not seem to be any time invariant unobservable heterogeneity in my data? Many thanks in advance
