You could access your data through database views and do your filtering there. Personally I do not like SQL commmands in DataSet definitions. EDIT: There is not a built-in possibility to do this AFAIK. You could make an VS add-in and invoke it on a context menu from Solution Explorer (right click on .xsd) or open DS and invoke add-in from main menu. The add in would then parse xsd and identify select and update text and make corrections. Probably this would be useful only right after generating the DS (drag drop from sql server). For add.in look at: Creating a Visual Studio.NET add-in to write SQL statements Writing a Visual Studio 2005 & 2008 Add-In Tutorial : Creating Visual Studio Add-Ins I personally would go the DB way. Make views that do the filtering for you and add delete triggers on those views that would perform an update instead of delete. This way you are removing the burden to do that on application and make this the responsibility of the person that makes a physical DB model. This would be done once per table. On the contrary you probably have multiple points in code that deal with single table (multiple datasets that use the same db table).
