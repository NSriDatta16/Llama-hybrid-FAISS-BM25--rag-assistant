The traditional stumbling blocks for people coming to C++ from C# or Java are memory management and polymorphic behavior: While objects always live on the heap and are garbage collected in C#/Java, you can have objects in static storage, stack or the heap ('free store' in standard speak) in C++. You have to cleanup the stuff you allocate from the heap (new/delete). An invaluable technique for dealing with that is RAII . Inheritance/polymorphism work only through pointer or reference in C++. There are many others, but these will probably get you first.
