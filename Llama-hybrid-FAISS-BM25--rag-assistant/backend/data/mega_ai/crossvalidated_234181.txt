How to intuitively understand the reconstruction of the original data after dimension reduction

So I have been trying to understand PCA for the past day, and the part that I don't understand is when the original data is reconstructed after dimension reduction. Below is the code that I was follow from here . I what the code is doing for the most part, but the one line that I don't understand is this line: Xt_reconstructed # Generate data m=50 # columns or features n=100 # rows or observations frac.gaps So if my understanding is correct Xt_projected is the Xt projected onto 3 dimension space, where each axis of the space is defined by the eigenvectors. Now to reconstruct the data to the original m = 50 dimensions, why are we multiplying Xt_projected by the transpose of the eigenvectors used to map the Xt to the 3 dimension space, am I missing something here? I'm guessing that when Xt_projected is multiplied by the transpose of the the eigenvectors that projected Xt to Xt_projected it is effectively "reconstructing" the original data. But this is just a guess and even if it is correct I still don't intuitively understand what is happening when the projected data is multiplied by the transpose of the eigenvectors that projected them there. Sorry if this is unclear, please tell me so that I can edit it accordingly.
