Is there a test for tendency when ANOVA is not significant?

I have a set of data that I think shows a slight decrease in the value, but there is no statistical difference among the groups. Is there a test to check if there is indeed a trend in the data in the absence of clear difference between groups? The data I have is the following: r0 = c(0.128, 0.131, 0.118) r1 = c(0.128, 0.132, 0.118) r2 = c(0.126, 0.130, 0.117) r3 = c(0.125, 0.128, 0.115) df = data.frame(x = c(rep(1,3), rep(2,3), rep(3,3), rep(4,3)), y = c(r0, r1, r2, r3)) The plot of the data is this: I think there is a trend for the average values decrease 0.003 units from the first to the last point: 0.1257 0.1260 0.1243 0.1227 But the ANOVA test is of course not significant: > oneway.test(y ~ x, data = df, var.equal = TRUE) One-way analysis of means data: y and x F = 0.1458, num df = 3, denom df = 8, p-value = 0.9295 Is there a test that could tell me if the trend is real or just wishful thinking? Thank you
