On each spin of a roulette wheel with 37 slots, you have $1$ chance in $37.$ If you bet on $5$ numbers on a spin, you have probability $5/37$ of winning. Assuming that spins of the wheel are independent, the number of wins in $100$ spins has a binomial distribution with $n=100$ and Success probability $p=5/37.$ On average, you can expect about $E(X) = 100(5/37) = 500/37 = 13.48631 \approx 13.5$ wins in $n=100$ spins. You can google binomial distribution on the Internet, or look in an elementary probability book, to see if you can find a discussion at your level. Here is a graph of the distribution of $X,$ showing the probability of getting each number of Successes from $0$ through $100.$ x = 0:100; pdf = dbinom(x, 100, 5/37) plot(x, pdf, type="h", lwd=2, main="Distribution of BINOM(100,5/37)") abline(v=0, col="green2"); abline(h=0, col="green2") abline(v = 9.5, col="orange", lwd=2, lty="dotted") The probability of getting 9 Successes or fewer is $P(X \le 9) = 0.1167$ and so the probability of getting at least 10 successes is $1 - 0.1157 = 0.8833.$ As you can see, it is very unlikely to get more than about 25 Successes in 100 spins. pbinom(9, 100, 5/37) [1] 0.1166582 1 - pbinom(9, 100, 5/37) [1] 0.8833418 Here is a mathematical formula for finding each probability $P(X = k),$ for each $k = 0, 1, 2, \dots, n=100.$ $$P(X = k) = {100 \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{n-k}.$$ As computed in R statistical software, here is a table of the first fiew probabilities rounded to four places. These are the heights of the black bars in the figure above.
