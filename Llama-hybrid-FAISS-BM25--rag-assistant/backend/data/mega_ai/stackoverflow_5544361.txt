Outlook 2010 Macro throws VBA error 'For loop not initialized'

I got this bit of code from someone's blog years ago. It basically iterates through all the Outlook mail rules, and executes them (handy to organize your inbox!). I've recently upgrade to Outlook 2010 from 2007. Now I get a very strange error stating Run-time error '92': For loop not initialized However, while debugging this, it will always run through 8 times (out of 20-25), then it throw this error. Here is the offending code: Sub RunAllInboxRules() Dim st As Outlook.Store Dim myRules As Outlook.Rules Dim rl As Outlook.Rule Dim count As Integer Dim ruleList As String 'get default store (where rules live) & get rules Set st = Application.Session.DefaultStore Set myRules = st.GetRules 'iterate all the rules For Each rl In myRules If rl.RuleType = olRuleReceive Then 'determine if itâ€™s an Inbox rule, if so, run it rl.Execute ShowProgress:=True count = count + 1 ruleList = ruleList & vbCrLf & rl.Name End If Next 'tell the user what you did ruleList = "These rules were executed against the Inbox: " & vbCrLf & ruleList MsgBox ruleList, vbInformation, "Macro: RunAllInboxRules" Set rl = Nothing Set st = Nothing Set myRules = Nothing End Sub Edit: Per Jay Riggs's comment, clearing the entire for block still results in the error.
