In general, preprocessing your dataset into the suggested form is the first thing you should do. Also, conducting a logistic regression is the method of choice for your research question. However, since you want to know which independent variables (e.g. base payment or years of employment) have a significant influence on your dependent variable (i.e. staying in or leaving the company), I suggest to use a stepAIC algorithm in order to find the best fitting model. Following this way you could answer questions such as "Are particular managers connected to significantly high leave rates?" or "Does an interaction between base pay and the time since the last increment have an influence on leaving the company?". In particular you could do something like this: set.seed(1337) # load or install MASS (contains stepAIC) library(MASS) # dependent variable (0 = has not left the company, 1 = has left the company) has.left |t|) # (Intercept) 3.488e-01 3.304e-01 1.055 0.294 # years.of.employment 1.469e-01 1.598e-01 0.919 0.360 # base.pay 2.191e-04 1.571e-04 1.395 0.166 # years.of.employment:base.pay -1.120e-04 7.496e-05 -1.494 0.138 # # Residual standard error: 0.4834 on 96 degrees of freedom # Multiple R-squared: 0.03746, Adjusted R-squared: 0.00738 # F-statistic: 1.245 on 3 and 96 DF, p-value: 0.2977 Briefly explained, including the variables years.of.employment , base.pay as well as their interaction would represent the best fitting model here. Not to mention that this is just to show the basic principle since all data is randomly generated. Please note that you can also manipulate the direction of the stepAIC algorithm (i.e. forward, backward, forward/backward) which leads to different results and depends on both your data and your research question (by default the direction is backward). Overall, it should further be mentioned that exploratory data analysis should be conducted with caution and you should have hypotheses before testing. However, this is a point which rather goes into a methodological direction.
