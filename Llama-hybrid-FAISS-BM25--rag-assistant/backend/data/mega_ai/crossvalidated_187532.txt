Your effective sample size is 5 so you do not have an adequate sample for doing anything , not even predicting the overall average outcome in the absence of any predictors. So the choices you make about measuring accuracy are "too late". Note that when $Y$ is binary it is not a good idea to consider classification. Better almost always is to predict the probability that $Y=1$. Classification is an arbitrary manipulation that has to be completely re-thought when you move to a sample that has a prevalence of $Y=1$ that is much different than $\frac{5}{10000}$.
