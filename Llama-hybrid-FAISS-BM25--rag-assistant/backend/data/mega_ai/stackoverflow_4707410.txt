You should be able to isolate the applet or object tag and use the parameters to start the applet in the stand-alone appletviewer. That might fail, if the applet is using the javascript gateway to interact with the browser for authentication or other purposes (as the javascript gateway is only available in the browser). Once you are able to run the applet outside the browser, you can then try to start it within your own process, either via embedding the JVM or by running your own java code, because appletviewer is just initializing an applet class, which you can do yourself. Once that is accomplished, you can do screen-scraping and controlling relatively easy. Check out java.awt.Frame.getFrames() to get access to all windows displayed on the screen. This gives you access to the component hierarchy, i.e. the input fields, buttons and other components. Good luck! You will need it.
