WPF is actually easier to use than Windows Forms, it's just completely different. The minute you understand the power of XAML and what you can do with data binding, styles and animation you'll never want to go back to dragging controls into the Windows Forms designer. Just get used to the idea you have to write XAML by hand and not use the visual designer. The XAML designer built into Visual Studio 2008 is junk, Expression Blend is better, but it is very designer oriented.
