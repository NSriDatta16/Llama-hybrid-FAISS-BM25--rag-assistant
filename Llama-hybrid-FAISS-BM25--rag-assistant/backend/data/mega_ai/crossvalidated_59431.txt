@Dail -- You don't need to know the date in advance. There are many options beyond the Chow Test. In practice, the Chow test can be undesirable because it assumes homoskedasticity, which is very often violated in real time series data. There is a famous paper on testing for structural breaks when the break dates are unknown and methods are now quite well developed. The reference is Andrews, 1993 but you probably would prefer to just have a look at these slides though, which provide an overview of the various tests, the theory, and examples of practical applications. There is an R package that you can use to implement the tests called strucchange which you can find more info about here
