search results filter effects - flex

I've created a search with a couple of comboboxes that allow users to filter their search results. The results are currently using a TileList & itemRenderer to display, and now I'd like to add an animation effect when the user filters their results. I know that you can use the itemsChangeEffect to create an animation effect when the user drags and moves result itmes. So I'd like to know if there's a way to create a similar effect triggered by the filtering on the comboboxes? Thanks.
