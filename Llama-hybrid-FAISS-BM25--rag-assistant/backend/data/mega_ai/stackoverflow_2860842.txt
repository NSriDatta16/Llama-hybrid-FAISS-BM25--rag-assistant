How to implement zoom-in/zoom-out effect on a cocos2d sprite image?

I am developing module where-in I pick the image from photo library and put into a sprite. I want to implement zoom-in/zoom-out kind of effect for a sprite image, same like camera album images zoom in/out effect. Could someone please guide me how do i implement it? I see somewhere is that, I have to detect two touch events in ccTouchBegan and then adjust the sprite's scale size to up or down based on the distance of two fingers touch event values. Could someone please tell me: How do i detect two fingers touch values in ccTouchBegan ? How to allow to touch and zoom-in/out of sprite image by user? Please give me samples. I tried already some stuff from this URL , but doesn't work for my requirement. Thank you.
