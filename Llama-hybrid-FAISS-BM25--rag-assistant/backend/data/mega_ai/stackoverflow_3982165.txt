CSS Floating trouble

Hi I have this really strange error.... I have two elements: paragraph and a link with an image inside of it. Paragraph overlaps the link this results in that the link becomes ineffective... How fix this? Thanks in advance ;) EDIT: Instead I will give you a link to mi site : http://e-skaitykla.lt/ . Try the posts images are the links and I can press them only in Opera. FIX: There was misunderstanding in positioning types. P was set to have relative positioning. When I added the same thing to A tag all fixed Thanks everybody who tried to help ;)
