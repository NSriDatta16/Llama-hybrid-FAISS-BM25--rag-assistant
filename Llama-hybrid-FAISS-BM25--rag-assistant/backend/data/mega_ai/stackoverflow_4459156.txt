The problem is in these two lines: NSString *questionString = [[questionView textStorage] string]; NSString *answerString = [[answerView textStorage] string]; The string method comes from NSAttributedString . The docs say this: For performance reasons, this method returns the current backing store of the attributed string object. If you want to maintain a snapshot of this as you manipulate the returned string, you should make a copy of the appropriate substring. So you need to replace the two lines with: NSString *questionString = [[[[questionView textStorage] string] copy] autorelease]; NSString *answerString = [[[[answerView textStorage] string] copy] autorelease]; This is because an NSTextStorage is ann NSMutableAttributedString and when that gets set to blank, the string you received gets emptied. Unrelated but you might want to set i to [cardList count] at the beginning instead of 0 . Also, methods beginning with new are expected to return an object you own according to the memory management rules . If newCardWithQuestion:andAnswer: conforms to the rules, your code is leaking. If not, you should rename the method, probably by dropping the word "new".
