Usually, forecasting is applied to time series data where future values of a series are predicted based on past observations, possibly leveraging predictors. It is contrasted with prediction in Cressie & Wikle Statistics for Spatio-Temporal Data, p. 17: Uncertainty in data, processes or parameters means that there will be uncertainty in conclusions. Statisticians call this drawing of conclusions in the presence of uncertainty, statistical inference (or just inference); in this book, inferences will be either estimation of fixed but unknown parameters, or prediction of unknown random quantities. (Notice that "forecasting," namely concluding something about the future, is a special case of "prediction".) Resources/books for project on forecasting models is our canonical thread for references and textbooks on forecasting.
