Before we collect any data, the prior distribution in a GP is Gaussian with mean 0 and covariance $F(x_i, x_{i'})$, to follow your notation. For any single point, its variance under the prior is simply $v_0 + v_1$. For more detail, you can look at Chapter 2 of Rasmussen's Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning .
