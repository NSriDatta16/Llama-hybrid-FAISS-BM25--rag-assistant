Main idea of Bagging

I just read this post and several other websites, but I still don't understand what bagging is. I understand it is an algorithm for machine learning, that it improves stability and accuracy of the algorithm and decreased the variance of my prediction, but what is the main idea behind this algorithm? Is it to put a dataset into a bag? For example, to me the main idea behind boosting is to boost records that are weighted incorrectly.
