Yes. while loading your application container will load web.xml and will extract the data for particular URL pattern to servlet . when request comes it checks from memory that for this pattern which servlet to invoke and then if servlet is already loaded it will take it from memory otherwise it will create an instance of servlet and it will invoke doGet() or doPost() depending on the request type. and there is another way to delcare URL mapping as from JAVAEE-6 by annotation something like import javax.servlet.annotation.InitParam; import javax.servlet.annotation.WebServlet; @WebServlet( name = "SimpleServlet", urlPatterns = {"/login"}, initParams = { @InitParam(name = "param1", value = "value1"), @InitParam(name = "param2", value = "value2")} ) public class SimpleServlet { } In faces-config.xml we are giving the navigation cases as follows: failure.jsp Why we need not give the view name as failure.jsf? We are just giving the *.jsp in the faces-config.xml. How it is handled internally? it is view identifier not the URL FacesServlet will load that view upon invocation of that navigation case.
