How to use a function generating an image?

I have a php code which generate an gif-image defined by a set of parameters. I wrote this code as a function and now I want to insert an image into a html page. My problem is that whenever I use an img tag I need to specify a name of the file containing an image but I do not have an image in a file. The file containing a function for generation of an image do not contain the image it contain the function generating an image. I could use a file which would contain an image but then I do not know how to pass parameters to this file. Usage of $_GET does not seem to be a good solution since one of the arguments of the function is a big array. Is there an elegant solution of the described problem?
