The first step towards getting anything done in Magento is to read the Magento Design Guide . Once you are familiar with the XML/Block system, you can make changes to the design portion very easily. Once you're comfortable with that, you're going to want to take a look at every folder in your base Magento install. Each folder has a purpose, and having an understanding of what each one's function within Magento will help you when you decide to start making modules. Alan Storm has a great tutorial for your first module here. I'd read that carefully and get the books that he suggested; they are great resources. Finally, start tracing functions through the code. I basically have grep -R available at all times to find out where methods are defined so I can better understand what their capabilities are. Because of the size of Magento, sometimes that's the best way to find answers. Good luck!
