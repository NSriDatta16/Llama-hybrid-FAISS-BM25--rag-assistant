The problem is that Core Data caches a lot for performance's sake. I should have guessed this earlier on as I've written similar generic data storage algorithms. It also explains why I didn't see it allocated as my memory. When you send the save message to your managed object context, the data written is cached. You can flag NSManagedObjects as "dirty" (faulted) by using the NSManagedObjectContext message "RefreshObject: mergeChanges:" Do this to the object directly after you send the context the save message. By using "NO" as the second argument, you are saying, "You'll need to go back to disk to get it." An poof , my memory usage issues are solved. Don't you love it when the fix is one line of code? -Pete
