Yes, this is absolutely possible. Ironically enough, I had to do this last night. In my case, I was embedding a UIView inside a UIScrollView , but I still wanted to detect taps and presses on my embedded view. To do this, I enabled user interaction on the UIView and then attached a UITapGestureRecognizer and a UILongPressGestureRecognizer to it. It works beautifully. :)
