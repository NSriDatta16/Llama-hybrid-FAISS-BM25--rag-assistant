Is the Poisson-Gamma Model Bayesian?

I was earlier learning about the Poisson-Gamma Model: $$Y|Z \sim Poisson(Z)$$ $$Z \sim Gamma(a,b) $$ This was introduced without any Frequentist flavoring, but since Z, a parameter is now treated as not fixed, but having a distribution, is this now a Bayesian model? Or is it because in Y|Z, Z is treated as known (and thus fixed) is it still a frequentist model?
