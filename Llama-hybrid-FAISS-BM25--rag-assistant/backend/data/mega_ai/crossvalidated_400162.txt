Simple but effective face detection algorithm using neural networks

I'd like to have my undergrad machine learning students have the option of doing a face detection project using neural networks (constructed by the students using Keras). The algorithm should ideally be simple but able to detect faces in a group photo of our class. From what I've seen so far, implementing YOLO or R-CNN looks too complicated, and I think a simpler approach should be possible because YOLO and R-CNN are near state of the art and they do more than just face detection. Any recommendations for a relatively simple face detection algorithm that could be used?
