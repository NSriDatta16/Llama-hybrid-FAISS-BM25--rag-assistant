I believe that there were some changes to the behavior in Silverlight 3, but not having worked directly on these features, I'm not completely sure. I did take a look at this MSDN page on the feature and the recommended approach is definitely the first example you have; they're suggesting: Get the user store Check the AvailableFreeSpace property on the store If needed, call IncreaseQuotaTo It isn't ideal, since you can't implement your own growth algorithm (grow by 10%, etc.), but you should be able to at least unblock your scenario using the AvailableFreeSpace property, like you say. I believe reading the amount of total space available (the Quota) to the user store could be in theory an issue, imagine a "rogue" control or app that simply wants to fill every last byte it can in the isolated storage space, forcing the user eventually to request more space, even when not available.
