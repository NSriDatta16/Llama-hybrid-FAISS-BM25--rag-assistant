In addition to what christo said, I would still recommend to do this the "before 3.2"-Way since you won't be able to support iPhones, which have not yet updated to 4.0, so consequently every 1. gen iPhone out there. The old way is to overwrite touchesBegan/Moved/Ended in your UIImageView subclass. This post is about TableViews but the exact same code works for every subclass of UIView, so you can use it in your ImageView.
