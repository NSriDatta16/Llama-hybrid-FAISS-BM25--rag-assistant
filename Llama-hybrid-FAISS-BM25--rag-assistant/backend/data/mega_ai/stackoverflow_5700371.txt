webapp movement

i have created a webapp using only html css javascript using iui library i have few pages and all the content is inside one html page and for page navigation and slide effect i have used iui framework when there is lot of content i can scroll vertically up and down which is fine however what i have also noticed is if i drag the page horizontally either left to right or right to left and also if i drag the page from top left diagonally the entire page is moving in those directions which is not good i would like this movement to be locked and even if i use the finger to slide across or diagonally the page should stay fixed and should only move vertically up or down do i need to write any meta tag to avoid this movement. using only html css and javascript is there a way to fix this or are there any other alternatives without creating the app natively using xcode
