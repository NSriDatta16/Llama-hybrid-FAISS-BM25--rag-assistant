Infer family type, size from reviews

I have a bunch of reviews: User_id, review 1, "We (a family of 4 adults) chose this and view and loved this place" 1, "My husband and I, with our 2 teen sons, visit this restaurant at least once..." 2,"My partner and I booked table for a short holiday, their wine menu was awesome" 2,"My wife is a fan of jazz and she's expecting, so visited this place " What techniques/packages are available to, for instance, estimate that: User Id 1 => family of 4, 2 sons (13-19) User Id 2 => family of 2, expecting : : I have been googling around, to little help, and other than creating my own labeled dataset, I was hoping there are some NLP techniques that can help bootstrap my training set, which can then be curated by humans.
