How do I set a schema level default engine? [MySQL]

I'm trying to set a default database engine for each of my MySQL schemas, but I can't seem to find out how to do that. I know it's possible to specify the engine at the table level, and in the config file with --default-storage-engine=type , but isn't there a way to set it at the schema level?
