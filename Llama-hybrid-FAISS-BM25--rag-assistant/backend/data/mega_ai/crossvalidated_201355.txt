I don't think you want clustering here. Instead, why don't you consider adaptive thresholds. Some examples: if the difference of teo values is less than 1/100 (or 1/10) of the standard deviation , consider them to be the same. Sort the data, and compute the average gap width (or better: median). Points with a difference of less than 1/100 (or 1/10) of this average gap are the same. These are very simple rules, but they adapt to your data distribution. In your first example, the average gap is 1, in the second it is about 80.
