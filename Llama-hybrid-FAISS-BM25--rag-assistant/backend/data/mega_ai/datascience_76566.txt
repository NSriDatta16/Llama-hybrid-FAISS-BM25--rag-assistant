You are describing a problem of supervised learning with multiple inputs. That is not an uncommon task and you can find many tutorials about multiple inputs for neural networks out there. Using Tensorflow, I personally recommend Keras Functional API for this task, since it gives you more control on the layers while keeping the high-level simplicity.
