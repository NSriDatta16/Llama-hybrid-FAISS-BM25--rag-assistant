Encryption - whole file or single fields?

I have to encrypt a list containing three fields for each record (a tag, a username and a password). Those will be saved in a JSON structure and then written to storage. My question is, should I encrypt the whole file or should I encrypt the single fields, convert the encrypted strings to Base64 and put those encrypted fields in the JSON file? Considering I don't expect the file to become very big (say, less then a MB), that I'll always be reading it as a whole and that the target platform is Android, what is the best approach in terms of performance and security?
