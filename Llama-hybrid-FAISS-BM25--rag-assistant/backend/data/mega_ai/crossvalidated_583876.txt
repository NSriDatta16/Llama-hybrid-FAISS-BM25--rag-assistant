Transformation of periodic data prior to PCA?

Basically I have periodic data (angles from -180 to 180) that I want perform a PCA on. However, since the data is periodic, a change in angle from say 170 to 10 will not be accurately reflected. I was wondering if anybody had a good/reliable way to transform the data without introducing new artifacts from the transformation on the data?
