While code such as those examples posted earlier does in a strict sense answer the question, it seems like really, really poor design to go down that path. Depending on your needs, and what framework you are using, you are much better off using some other technique. Arrays of controls are one option; if you're using WPF then this can be achieved quite elegantly using a list that visualizes its elements as labels (you should get that for free, but if not, it'd be trivial to change the control's ItemTemplate - sorry, I don't have any example immediately at hand).
