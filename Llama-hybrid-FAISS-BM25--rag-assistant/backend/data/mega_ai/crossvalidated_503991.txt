Typically, object detection networks can be broken down into two parts: a backbone network which takes an input image and outputs a feature map, and the "head(s)", which produces the final detections from the feature map. Backbones can often be swapped out for one another, and they're not usually the focus of research -- there's just much more interesting things to be explored in the heads. So in this context, "Faster R-CNN" refers to the design of the heads, and "ResNet 101" is the name of the backbone network.
