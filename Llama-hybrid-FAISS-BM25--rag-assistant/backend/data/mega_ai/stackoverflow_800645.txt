(it's actually allowed to have more than one row for a widget, but the daemon shouldn't ever do this automatically) Then it's not the database that's the problem. it's the fact that you've got multiple daemons that don't know the've detected the same object. Seems to me that's where you need to focus your attention. From the point of view of the database, they're both submitting perfectly legitimate rows. What happens if you change: 1: every so often: 2: find newest N widgets (from external source) 3: foreach widget 4: if( widget not yet in database ) 5: add rows for widget to 1: every so often: 2: while there are unhandled widgets 2: find first unhandled widget 4: if( widget not yet in database ) 5: add one row for widget
