This is pretty broad. My first reaction is: go read a PHP beginners book. That being said, you'll need to learn the following: Basic PHP / MySQL tutorial jQuery AJAX basics , so that you learn how to interact with a web server through AJAX jQuery draggable documentation jQuery droppable documentation Then try reading these comprehensive tutorials: Drag and drop reordering Dynamic Drag'n Drop Update: Sounds like you should send your data with JSON, which follows a structure similiar to XML. Your best bet is to start at JSON.org . There's also tutorials on the jQuery site regarding their JSON functions for GET and POST. As for updating multiple columns, you can either do multiple AJAX posts, or use PHP to split apart the passed data and hit the DB multiple times. That's my best guess, based on the info you've posted.
