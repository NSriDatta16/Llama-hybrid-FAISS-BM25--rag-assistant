How many unit are necessary in randomized experiment?

Let's say we want to conduct an experiment with binary treatment. How do I decide how many units do I need to assing the treatment to, to get internally valid results? I understand that you need to reach a certain number of units for detecting statistically significant effect. But in this case I am concern about finding the (average) causal effect of my treatment free of possible confounders. (In this case I don't care about external validity and generalization of my results to the broader population). I just want to be sure that I have enough units to control the confounders with randomization. Thank you for answers. Edit: I am basically trying to measure SATE and I am not sure what role does the statistical significance test play in this context. Can it tell me anything about the internal validity of the experiment, or is it strictily directed toward external validity and generalization to the broader population?
