You need to pass in methods that match those delegates. If I had to guess I'd say it's using a BackgroundWorker behind the scenes. So you could do something like this. void Main { ProgAnalysis(@"c:\test.txt", delegate(object sender, ProgressChangedEventArgs e) { // Do something }, delegate(object sender, RunWorkerCompletedEventArgs e) { // Do something else }); } Just guessing about the delegate signatures. Of course you could use lambdas or separate methods instead of anonymous delegates, depending on exactly what you need to do. It doesn't matter that the library was written in VB.NET.
