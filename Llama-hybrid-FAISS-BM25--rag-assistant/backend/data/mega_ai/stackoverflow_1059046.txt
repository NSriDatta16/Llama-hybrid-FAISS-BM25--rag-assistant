There is no general way to pass an array to a function or method that uses varargs. In this particular case, however, you could fake it by using something like: for (NSString *currentReplacement in array) [string stringByReplacingCharactersInRange:[string rangeOfString:@"%@"] withString:currentReplacement]; EDIT: The accepted answer claims there is a way to do this, but regardless of how fragile this answer might seem, that approach is far more fragile. It relies on implementation-defined behavior (specifically, the structure of a va_list ) that is not guaranteed to remain the same. I maintain that my answer is correct and my proposed solution is less fragile since it only relies on defined features of the language and frameworks.
