Columns 1 to 6: if the data is missing because it does not exist, does that tell you something about the variable/target/customer? If so, you want to preserve that information in your imputation. For instance, if Column X is the average number of days since the last transaction, does a missing value mean that this is a new customer? If that's the case, then one approach is to replace the missing values with a distinct value that allows you and your model pipeline to recognize that no such event has happened. So, missing values in Column 1 could be replaced with -1 say. Column 7 : there are various approaches, including replacing missing values with a statistic based on non-missing values (e.g. mean, median, mode) and more advanced approaches like modeling Column 7 using other columns and using model predictions to replace missing values (MICE).
