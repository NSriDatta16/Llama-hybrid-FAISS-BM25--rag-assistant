The easiest way is just to go to the mysql config file (my.ini in windows, my.cnf in Linux) and just add this: [mysqld] default-storage-engine=InnoDB This assumes that you have enabled InnoDB , which is another topic, but there are plenty of answers on how to do this. You can always check the default storage engine in phpMyAdmin on XAMPP: Just click on the server, then on engines, then on a particular engine (like MyISAM), and then see if it says MyISAM is the default storage engine on this MySQL server .
