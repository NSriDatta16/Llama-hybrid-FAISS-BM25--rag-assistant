Time series forecast from STL using ARIMA method for specific order

I am trying to forecast daily sales and have found that for the seasonally adjusted component a non-seasonal ARIMA (3,1,6) and a seasonal naive for seasonal component gives me the best result. How can I use stlf or stlm functions to specify my order (3,1,6) in ARIMA method? Currently, I am forecasting both components separately and merging them to obtain my forecasts.
