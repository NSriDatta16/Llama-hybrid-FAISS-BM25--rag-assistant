Unfortunately, the Inventory form is not dynamic like others, and you can't just add an attribute to this form. If you are good with Magento programming, than you can play with it's block: app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/Block/Catalog/Product/Edit/Tab/Inventory.php and with it's template: app/design/adminhtml/default/default/template/catalog/product/tab/inventory.phtml
