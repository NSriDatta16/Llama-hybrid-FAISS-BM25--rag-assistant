The literature on hierarchical clustering deals with similarity measures between groups. The most popular measures of group similarity are perhaps the single linkage , complete linkage , and average linkage . Single linkage defines the group distance according to the two nearest members. Complete linkage uses the two most distant members. Average linkage uses the distance between the group averages.
