how to get content of a small ascii file in python?

Let's say we want to implement an equivalent of the PHP's file_get_content . What is the best practice? (elegant and reliable) Here are some proposition, are they correct? using with statement: def file_get_contents(filename): with file(filename) as f: s = f.read() return s is using standard open() safe? def file_get_contents(filename): return open(filename).read() What happens to file descriptor in either solution?
