Determining number of clusters with SSE scree plot with Gower's coefficient of similarity

I am researching cluster analysis, and I am interested in variables that are both categorical and continuous, for which I have read that a Gower's similarity coefficient is a good proximity measure. I am interested in first using an average linkage algorithm, and have found that some have recommended looking for the 'elbow' in the sum of squared error (SSE) scree plot as a guideline for deciding how many clusters to retain. I was wondering if the Gower's similarity coefficient (being non-metric and non-Euclidean) would allow me to create an SSE scree plot, or if that didn't make sense statistically.
