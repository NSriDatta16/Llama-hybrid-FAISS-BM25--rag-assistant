There are at least a couple of ways to go about this. What I do is set a value for the User Header Search Path build setting for the main target, pointed to the library path. Just type 'user header' in the build settings editor search box and you'll find it. If you're consuming a library that you intend to use often, it's best to set up a source tree setting for it. This is in XCode Prefs -> Source Trees. Add an entry, put in the path to the library source, and give it a sensible Setting Name, eg. XXLIBRARY_SOURCE. Then in the user header search path (or any other build setting where you need the library path), you can use $(XXLIBRARY_SOURCE) as the path. A simpler but less flexible alternative is just to drag the library's headers into your main project.
