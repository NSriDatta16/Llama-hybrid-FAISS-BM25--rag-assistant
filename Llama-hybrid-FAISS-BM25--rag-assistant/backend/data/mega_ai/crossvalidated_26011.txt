Non-Bayesian alternatives to maximum likelihood estimators and method of moment estimators when there's only one observation

When trying to estimate the parameters of a known distribution, it might occur that the maximum likelihood estimator and the method of moment estimator don't work well when there's only one observation. What are some good non-Bayesian alternatives to maximum likelihood estimators and method of moment estimators if there's only one observation?
