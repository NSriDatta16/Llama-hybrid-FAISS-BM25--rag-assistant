I've run into similar issues going from ScriptManager to ToolkitScriptManager and while it isn't an elegant solution, the thing that has worked for me is to remove the ScriptManager, rebuild the solution (even if it throws errors) then add the ToolScriptManager in and rebuild. For some reason the project was hanging on to the old object type reference (ScriptManager) and causing problems. It wasn't until it was removed and rebuilt (thus removing all instances of the object from the project) and added in that all the proper connections were set.
