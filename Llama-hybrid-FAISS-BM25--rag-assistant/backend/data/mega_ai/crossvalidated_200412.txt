Combining two eigenfaces of the same person

What exactly would the benefit of having more than one eigenface to work with when trying to do facial recognition? Say I have an average face already prepared from my set of faces, and I know that many of the faces are different pictures of the same person. I have prepared eigenfaces of each of the images. Is there any way to combine eigenfaces of the same person in order to create a vector that could identify that person more easily?
