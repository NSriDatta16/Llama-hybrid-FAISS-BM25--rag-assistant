VB.Net apply XSL transformation to XML file

I have got some XML which is built by my application. This XML is dropped to an XML file, which I then wish to apply an XSL stylesheet to in order to convert it to a HTML page. However, every time, it just keeps coming out with the original XML rather than the transformed HTML Here is the XML: Mr Gregory House asasasas 11:41 asasasasa a KWA Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital \\more\DataCard\VisitorPhotos\V0004.jpg Here is the stylesheet : and here is the code which does the transform : Dim document As XmlDocument ''# Xml document root Dim navigator As XPathNavigator ''# navigate document Dim transformer As XslTransform ''# transform document Dim output As StringWriter document = New XmlDocument() document.Load("firelist.xml") ''# create navigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator ''# load style sheet transformer = New XslTransform() transformer.Load("firelist.xslt") ''# transform XML data output = New StringWriter() transformer.Transform(navigator, Nothing, output) ''# display transformation in text box Console.WriteLine(output.ToString) ''# write transformation result to disk Dim stream As FileStream = New FileStream("firelist.html", FileMode.Create) Dim writer As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(stream) writer.Write(output.ToString) ''# close streams writer.Close() output.Close() It is ages since I did anything with XSL and .NET so I'm sure I am probably missing something obvious! UPDATE: Here is the code as it currently stands following modifications made as a result of below suggestions... Code-Behind: Dim document As XmlDocument ' Xml document root Dim navigator As XPathNavigator ' navigate document Dim transformer As XslCompiledTransform ' transform document Dim output As StringWriter document = New XmlDocument() document.Load("firelist.xml") ' create navigator navigator = document.CreateNavigator ' load style sheet transformer = New XslCompiledTransform() transformer.Load("firelist.xslt") ' transform XML data output = New StringWriter() transformer.Transform(navigator, Nothing, output) ' display transformation in text box Console.WriteLine(output.ToString) ' write transformation result to disk Dim stream As FileStream = _ New FileStream("firelist.html", FileMode.Create) Dim writer As StreamWriter = New StreamWriter(stream) writer.Write(output.ToString) ' close streams writer.Close() output.Close() XML: Dr James Wilson bob 11:30 dunno 4 KWA Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital \\more\DataCard\VisitorPhotos\V0005.jpg XSLT: I am still only getting the original XML being output to my HTML file, rather than the HTML which should result from the XML/XSLT Transformation.
