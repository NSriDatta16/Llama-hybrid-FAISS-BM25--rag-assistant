PCA weights vs. standardized

I have a number of timeseries on which I want to apply a PCA (using matlab). These time series have very different variances. My objective is: 1) all time series have the same weight for me, no one should get overweighted 2) I don't want the nature of my data (statistical properties) to get modified through transformations I have found two solutions on the internet: A) standardizing the time series B) using the pca command in matlab, while specifying that the weights should be the inverse of the variances Both approaches look ok to me, what are the advantages or disadvantages of A) vs. B)? Is there anything I should be aware of or are both approaches perfect substitutes? Thanks!
