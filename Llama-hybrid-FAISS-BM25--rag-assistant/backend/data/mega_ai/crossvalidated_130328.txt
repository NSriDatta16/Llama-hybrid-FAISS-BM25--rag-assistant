It's probably most helpful if you show us more information about your model, but: the baseline value of the log-odds of whatever your response is (e.g. mortality) varies across hospitals. The baseline value (the per-hospital intercept term) is the log-odds of mortality (or whatever) in the baseline category (e.g. "untreated"), at a zero value of any continuous predictors. That variation is assumed to be Normally distributed, on the log-odds scale. The among-hospital standard deviation of the intercept is 0.6554; the variance (just the standard deviation squared -- not a measure of the uncertainty of the standard deviation) is $0.6554^2=0.4295$. (If you clarify your question/add more detail about your model I can try to say more.) update : your interpretation of the variation seems correct. More precisely, cc should give you the 95% interval (not really quite confidence intervals, but very similar) for the probabilities of a baseline (male/average age/etc.) individual getting treated across hospitals. For testing the significance of the random effect, you have a variety of choices (see http://bbolker.github.io/mixedmodels-misc/glmmFAQ.html for more information). (Note that the standard error of a RE variance is usually not a reliable way to test significance, since the sampling distribution is often skewed/non-Normal.) The simplest approach is to do a likelihood ratio test, e.g. pchisq(2*(logLik(fitted_model)-logLik(fitted_model_without_RE)), df=1,lower.tail=FALSE)/2 The final division by 2 corrects for the fact that the likelihood ratio test is conservative when the null value (i.e. RE variance=0) is on the boundary of the feasible space (i.e. the RE variance cannot be
