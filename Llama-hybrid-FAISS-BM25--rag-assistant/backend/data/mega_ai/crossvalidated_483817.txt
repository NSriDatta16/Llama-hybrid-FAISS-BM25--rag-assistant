Since you have a number of measurements of the same individuals, you should be fine averaging their measurements along each of the 9 dimensions. One possible issue is that you may have more variance in the 5-trial averages versus the 7-trial averages. That could cause non-constant variance (though it sounds like your data exhibit very little variance). A way to handle non-constant variance is to do a weighted regression that stabilizes the variances. You would weight the 5-trial data by some weight that is 5/7 the weight used on the 7-trial data. (So you could use a weight of 5 for 5-trial data and 7 for 7-trial data.) Finally, you should consider why some of the individuals only completed 5 trials. There might be a lower mean score or some other difference between individuals who completed all trials and those who only completed 5 trials.
