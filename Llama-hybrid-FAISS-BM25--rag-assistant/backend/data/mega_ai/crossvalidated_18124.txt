There is a (fairly limited) set of statistical tools for so-called "causal inference". These are designed for actually assessing causal relationships and are proven to do this correctly. Excellent, but not for the meek of heart (or brain, for that matter). Apart from that, in many instances, the ability to imply causality is much more a consequence of your design than of the techniques at hand: if you have control over 'all' the variables in your experiment, and you see something happening everytime you (only) change one variable, it is reasonable to call the thing that happens a 'consequence' of the thing you change (unfortunately, in real research, these extreme cases rarely actually occur). Another intuitive but sound reasoning is time-based: if you randomly (but in a controlled manner) change a variable and another changes the day after, causality is also around the corner. All of my second paragraph essentially works regardless of which methods you use to find which variables changed in which conditions, so at least in theory there is no reason why Machine Learning (ML) would be worse than Statistics based methods. Disclaimer : Highly subjective paragraph folowing However, in my experience, too often ML techniques are just let loose on a blob of data without consideration of where the data came from or how it was collected (i.e. disregarding the design). In those cases, ever so often a result bobs up, but it will be extremely hard to say something useful about causality. This will be exactly the same when some statistically sound method is run upon that same data. However, people with a strong statistics background are trained to be critical towards these matters, and if all goes well, will avoid these pitfalls. Perhaps it is simply the mindset of early (but sloppy) adopters of ML techniques (typically not the developers of new techniques but those eager to 'prove' some results with them in their field of interest) that has given ML its bad reputation on this account. (note that I am not saying statistics is better than ML, or that all people doing ML are sloppy and those doing stats aren't)
