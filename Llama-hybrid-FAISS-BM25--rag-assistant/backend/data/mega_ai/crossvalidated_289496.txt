How can I correctly interpret the results of logistic regression?

I built the logistic regression model and the results have good accuracy, but I have a question. Let's say the predicted probability value is 0.86. And the total accuracy in the classification matrix of the model was 94%. How can I correctly interprete this? Can I say that with a 94% accuracy the probability of an event is 0.86? If not, how can I correctly describe it?
