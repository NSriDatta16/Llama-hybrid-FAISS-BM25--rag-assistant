p vs. ol or ul for form styling

Typically I style forms with the unordered list tag e.g. Name However, often I see markup that uses the tag instead, like so: Name Which of these is more semantically correct? Are there any pros or cons to the different methods, other than the style being more succinct? Edit: Clearly opening a can of worms here - more options, gah! :) Does the W3C have a recommendation here? Amusingly the W3C recommendation seems to be the least elegant solution: Chocolate Cream Filled Honey Glazed A pity there isn't stronger guidance around the best convention for marking up form elements.
