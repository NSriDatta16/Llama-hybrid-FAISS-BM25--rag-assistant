Best Practices for Designing a Simple Web Service w/ Return Codes

I'm designing a WCF service that will return a response code (such as 0 for success, or another number for errors). Also, all methods of the web service will perform several common validations (such as authenticating an apiKey). I am wondering if there is a best practice approach or organizing and retrieving these response codes and messages. Thanks for any suggestions.
