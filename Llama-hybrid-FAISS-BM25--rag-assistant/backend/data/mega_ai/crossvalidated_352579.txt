In case of collinearity between two variables and you have to choose which one to keep is by calculating the correlation of those two predictors with all other predictors and then taking averages of all those correlation and then keep one which has lower correlation with other predictors. To remove multicollinearity, you can do this for all predictors by setting some threshold to keep.
