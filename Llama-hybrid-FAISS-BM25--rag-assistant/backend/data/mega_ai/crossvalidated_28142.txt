SVD of a data matrix (PCA) after smoothing

Let's say I have a $n \times m$ centered data matrix $A$ with SVD $A = U \Sigma V^{T}$. For example, $m=50$ columns (measurements) that are spectra with $n=100$ different frequencies. The matrix is centered so the rows of the matrix have their mean subtracted. This is for interpreting the left singular vectors as principal components. I'm interested in understanding how the SVD changes when I smooth each column vector. E.g. Let's smooth each 100x1 column by a simple kernel like [1/3, 2/3, 1/3]. $S=\begin{bmatrix} \frac{2}{3}&\frac{1}{3}& & & & &\\ \frac{1}{3}&\frac{2}{3}&\frac{1}{3} & & & &\\ & \frac{1}{3}&\frac{2}{3}&\frac{1}{3} & & &\\ & & \ddots& \ddots & \ddots & & \\ & & & \frac{1}{3}&\frac{2}{3}&\frac{1}{3} & \\ & & & &\frac{1}{3}&\frac{2}{3}&\frac{1}{3} \\ & & & & &\frac{1}{3}&\frac{2}{3} \end{bmatrix}$ So the new data matrix is $A'=SA$ and has some SVD $A' = U' \Sigma' V'^{T}$. My first thought was that since $SA = SU \Sigma V^{T}$, I should expect the ${U'}_i$ vectors to be smoothed just like the $A_i$ vectors. This first equation looks like the $(SU)_i$ are eigenvectors of $A' A'^T$: $$SA(SA)^T=SU\Sigma\Sigma^TU^TS^T$$ But I'm not sure about this next one if its valid to say that the $V_i$ are eigenvectors of $A'^T A'$: $$(SA)^TSA=V\Sigma^TU^TS^TSU\Sigma V^T$$ When I compare SVDs of $A$ and $A'$ numerically, the left singular vectors are not what I expect, $U' \neq SU$, but they do have a smoothed appearance. Can anyone help me relate $U \Sigma V^{T}$ and the SVD $U' \Sigma' V'^{T}$ after this simple transformation?
