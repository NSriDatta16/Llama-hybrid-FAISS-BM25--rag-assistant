SharedPreferences for serialization?

I'm rather new to Android development, and am trying to learn with a bit of a hobby project. My app has a relatively small amount of state that needs to be stored for the main Activity in order for the app to resume properly. Moreover, since my app syncs with a webapp, I already have JSON-based serialization logic included for all the state that I might want to save. Is it a good use of SharedPreferences to store relatively small (~ a few KiB) strings that serialize objects? Would it be better to just use internal storage and write out to a text file? Thanks for the advice!
