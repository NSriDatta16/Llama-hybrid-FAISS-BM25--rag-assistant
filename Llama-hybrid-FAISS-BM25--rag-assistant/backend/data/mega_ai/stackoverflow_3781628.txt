What languages have best built-in graphics support?

I'm an architecture student and a designer, rather than a programmer, so I am looking for a programming language or library with best support for interactive graphics. For example, last week I had this idea about a traffic intersection program where I would insert incoming and outgoing lanes and then connect them with nodes using mouse to show the required paths and this would be used to calculate the average throughput using best traffic light scheme. Or that time I wanted to draw a shape and then fit rooms with predefined floor space optimally into that shape. There is Javascript+Canvas, Processing, also Rebol and that's about all I have heard of. Anything more concise/ easier available on Windows platform?
