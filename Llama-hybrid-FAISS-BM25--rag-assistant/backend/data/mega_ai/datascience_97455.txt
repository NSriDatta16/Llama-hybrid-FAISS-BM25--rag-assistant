Can I use labelled data in unsupervised learning algorithms like neural network?

I am working on a transaction dataset that consists of some labeled features like gender, product categories, membership types, and so on. There are also some numeric data like the amount of transactions, number of products, and so on. I use one hot encoder for all the categorical data and minmaxscaler for all the numeric data. In this case, can I feed all the categorical data to unsupervised learning algorithms like neural network and KMeans clustering? Do I need to use PCA to convert all the categorical data to numeric data before feeding it to neutral network?
