Use HMM for time series classification in python - define initial states

I have a time series of locations. I want to use HMM for classification of path, by using the knowledge I have on the locations. I know that locations [0,100] should be state A , [100,200] are state B , and so on for 6 states. The assumption is that I should have 4 classes of time series in my data, such that each class should present different probabilities. For example, for the class "Mild", it is very likely to move from state A to B. But , for class "Severe", it should differ. I don't know the initial probabilities but I know the exact mapping of location to state and that they should defer. Each sample is 1-D time series of locations. How can I do this (model the states, find probabilities) in python and use it for classification? I couldn't find any similar tutorial or example.
