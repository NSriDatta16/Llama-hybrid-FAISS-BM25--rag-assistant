It won't fail unless you've run out of memory (which would happen with any other allocator as well) - but your code will usually run much quicker if you manage to estimate the required storage upfront. Often it's better to do an extra loop run solely to determine the storage requirements. I wouldn't say that realloc is a no-go, but it's not good practice either.
