how to group time series data into stationary & non-stationary?

i have time series data (download at:-->http://www.4shared.com/rar/ft3YCN2H/Time_series_data.html) consider potential values as time series data points(4th column) file ts_data please, give R script /functions to be used from any package,for follwing to cluster these time seris into 2 groups--stationary & non-stationary(by programming & not by visually seeing ACF/PACF graphs) how to find best model(AR/ARMA/ARIMA/SARIMA/GARCH,etc) to fit over these data for future forecasting ?,i don't want manually for each file,kindly suggest automated script how to transform non-stationary models to get best fit model(i dont know how to get best P(autoregressive order),Q(moving average),D(differencing order))
