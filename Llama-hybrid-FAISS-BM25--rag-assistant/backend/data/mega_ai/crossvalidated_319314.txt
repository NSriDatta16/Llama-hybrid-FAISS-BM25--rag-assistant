The reason why data is centered for Bayesian regression is that for some types of sampling (ex. Gibbs) having highly correlated parameters increases the autocorrelation in chains and leads to less effective and longer sampling procedure. As far as the interpretation is concerned: Before centering $\alpha$, its meaning is the height of a person with weight 0. Thus, $\alpha$ would be a just a numerical intercept (possibly negative) without any real world interpretation. Centering the data around the mean of the weight, will lead to $\alpha$ representing the height of a person with average weight. In this case, the numeric value of $\alpha$ has a real world interpretation.
