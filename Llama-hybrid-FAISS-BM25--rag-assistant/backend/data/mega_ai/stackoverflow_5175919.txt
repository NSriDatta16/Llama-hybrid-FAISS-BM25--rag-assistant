You could simply check the current time in your controller, something like: def show @last_refresh ||= DateTime.now @current ||= MyModel.get_random @current = MyModel.get_random if (DateTime.now - @last_refresh) > 5.minutes end This kind of code wouldn't scale to more servers (as it relies on class variables for data storage), so in reality you would wan't to store the two class variables in something like Redis (or Memcache even) - that is for high performance. Depends really on how accurately you need this and how much performance you need. You could as well use your normal database to store expiry times and then load the record whose time is current.
