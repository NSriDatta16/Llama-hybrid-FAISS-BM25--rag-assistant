I'd definitely recommend Coderush+Refactor or Resharper (Coderush being my personal favourite), these tools dramatically reduce the time to go from code in your head to code on the page. For quick development the UI component sets from the likes of Telerik/DevExpress/Infragistics can be good, but in my experience can cause pain further out in the project when you want to refine things more precisely. Regarding frameworks etc I think you'd need to be a bit more specific about the project itself to get any meaningful suggestions.
