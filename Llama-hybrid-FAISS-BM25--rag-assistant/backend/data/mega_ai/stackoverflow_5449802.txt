Mobile browser simulator for finger gestures?

I am looking for a light-weight mobile browser simulator that runs under Windows XP and allows me to test JavaScript touch and gesture events, such as zoom or drag and drop: http://dev.sencha.com/deploy/touch/examples/dragdrop/ So far I have evaluated: MobiOne Studio's Test Center (iPhone) Keynote's MITE PhoneGap Simulator It looks like MobiOne is the only one of these that supports finger gestures, and actually quite well. However, before shelling out the $99.95 for MobiOne, I'd like to know: Are there any alternatives? Note that I'm not interested in installing the Android SDK since it runs extremely slow on my machine. The Palm Pre SDK runs much faster, but it's still rather heavy-weight.
