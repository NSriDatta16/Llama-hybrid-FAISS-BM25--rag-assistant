Generally, I've found that if I have to use the argument of "Trust Me. I know what I am talking about" I need to go back and rethink what I am trying to explain and implement. Sometimes I get a feeling about something being good or bad, but that is an indicator that I need to review it as I don't have a concrete reason about why I should or shouldn't do something. The other thing you should pay attention to is dismissing "Junior" people because of their title. You may have more expierence, but that doesn't mean they aren't smart and could be correct in what they are saying. In reality, years of expierence can mean little to nothing as it is just the number of years that someone has been doing the same type of job. It's a good indicator as to where someone is in their career, but it isn't an automatic decree they are actually capable of making the right desicions all the time.
