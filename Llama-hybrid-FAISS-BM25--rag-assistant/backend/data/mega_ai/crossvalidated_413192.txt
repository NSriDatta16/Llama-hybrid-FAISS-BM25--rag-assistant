Estimating potential moves in a time series relative to an other

Say we have two time series which over time have a strong correlation, say above 0.8, say for example the price of oil and share price of an oil exploration and extraction company. Now say that we have a universe of oil companies exhibiting a strong correlation with oil, but we are interested in obtaining results for one of them say company A. What we want is to have this: If the price of oil goes up by 5USD or down by 5USD how can I expect shares of company A to move? Our past data, may or may not have 5 dollar moves in oil prices. What are some methods to look into for such a case based on your experience? Thank you!
