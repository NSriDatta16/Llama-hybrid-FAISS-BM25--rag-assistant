Interpreting Cross-Correlation Function betwen residuals of ARIMA-SARIMA models

I've seen several posts this week around this topic, but I cannot find a right answer, probably because time series is something very artisan! I'm doing a task about finding causality between surface temperature and sea level in a specific zone. The thing is to explain the relation of the process through a CCF and Transfer Function. I have modelled my series with much care as I could. In R, I took 1 difference and logarithms for $x_t$ and only logarithms for $y_t$ (this one is really seasonal - sea level!) The best models arisen from auto.arima had been : for $x_t$ ARIMA(2,0,1) with zero mean Coefficients: ar1 ar2 ma1 0.4138 0.2498 -0.9517 s.e. 0.0526 0.0511 0.0231 sigma^2 estimated as 0.006168: log likelihood=513.04 AIC=-1018.09 AICc=-1018 BIC=-1001.6 and $y_t$ ARIMA(1,0,1)(0,1,2)[12] with drift Coefficients: ar1 ma1 sma1 sma2 drift 0.5607 0.4494 -0.8262 0.1173 -5e-04 s.e. 0.0493 0.0545 0.0508 0.0490 1e-04 sigma^2 estimated as 0.0009074: log likelihood=922.19 AIC=-1832.38 AICc=-1832.19 BIC=-1807.81 Then, I got this graph from ccf(x$residuals, y$residuals) , which I am triyng to interpret: Questions: a) In this example, at $k$ = 4, $x_{t + k}$ is significantly correlated with $y_t$ ? My hypotesis is that there is backfeed but I'm not sure of that. b) How I can calculate and express the transfer function with the information above? (e.g with MTS::tfm1 ) Thank you in advance. All useful, interesting and helpful comments will be rewarded!
