Yahoo address book retrieval

I am trying to retrieve address book contacts through yahoo. After googling a bit, I came up to number of Yahoo developer pages and the api I was looking for. However, at the moment I am not in position to give detail about my Web Application URL and BBAuth Success URL while registering for Yahoo app-id in order to yahoo app working. Since my application decision are still not yet decided. I am trying to make a POC (Proof of concept) for retrieving yahoo/hotmail contacts. Is there any way that I can get address book details without app-id .. OR .. can I register for app-id without the Web Application URL and BBAuth Success URL .. OR .. what alternate I could use for a local POC development ? Any suggestions?
