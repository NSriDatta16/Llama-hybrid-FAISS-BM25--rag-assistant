Cannot send email in ASP.NET through Godaddy servers

I have an ASP.NET application hosted on Godaddy that I want to send email from. When it runs, I get: Mailbox name not allowed. The server response was: sorry, relaying denied from your location. The important parts of the code and Web.config are below: msg = new MailMessage("accounts@greektools.net", email); msg.Subject = "GreekTools Registration"; msg.Body = "You have been invited by your organization to register for the GreekTools recruitment application. " + url + " " + "Sincerely, " + "The GreekTools Team"; msg.IsBodyHtml = true; client = new SmtpClient(); client.Host = "relay-hosting.secureserver.net"; client.Send(msg);
