NHibernate + Fluent NHibernate + Oracle Index

I have a table with more than 10 000 000 rows. In TOAD this query works very well on it: select /*+ INDEX(x IDX_CASHFLOW_COMPLEX)*/ * from MYPR.CASHFLOW x where fk_debet in (21856, 21854, 21855) IDX_CASHFLOW_COMPLEX is index on 5 columns created by following script: CREATE INDEX MYPR.IDX_CASHFLOW_COMPLEX ON MYPR.CASHFLOW (FK_DEBIT, FK_CREDIT, FK_DOCUMENT, PAYMENTDATE, FK_PAYMENTCODE) LOGGING TABLESPACE INDX PCTFREE 10 INITRANS 2 MAXTRANS 255 STORAGE ( INITIAL 64K MINEXTENTS 1 MAXEXTENTS UNLIMITED PCTINCREASE 0 BUFFER_POOL DEFAULT ) NOPARALLEL; Similar query but without Oracle hint syntax works significantly slower! Would you please suggest is it possible to tell NHibernate to add Oracle hint in the query? Thanks!
