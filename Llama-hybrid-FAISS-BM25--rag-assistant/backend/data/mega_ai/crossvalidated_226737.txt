Yes, there are other ways to create weights. Have you considered things like: What percentage of all emails that Person A received were from Person B? What percentage of all emails that Person A received did they reply to? What percentage of the emails that Person B sent were to Person A? And what percentage of all emails that Person B sent were replied to? You correctly sense that one email from Person B to A that is then replied to by A shouldn't count as a high weighting (i.e. as a 100% response rate). So come up with weights that reflect your insight. What other pieces of information about Person A and Person B do you know? Is Person A three levels up the hierarchy from Person B, or are they their supervisor or a coworker? Are there standardized titles in the organization, and do some jobs tend to send more emails -- that require responses -- than others? You say Person B is new, while Person A is well-established. Could you factor in longevity? (Maybe emails sent last month, average number of emails received per month over the last three months, lifetime number of emails sent/received, or something like that?) Do you know -- or can you determine -- the nature of the email? For example, can you do a little text mining to determine if the email was about Vacation, or scheduling a meeting? Might attachment names/types, or message length tell you something? How about what time of the day the emails were sent, or how quickly they were replied to? The actual analysis you do in the end is another matter. What algorithm do you use? But the key part of most work is to make sure you have correct data, make sure you have as much data as possible, and then engineer features you will use in your algorithm. In the real world, you rarely feed found data directly into an algorithm.
