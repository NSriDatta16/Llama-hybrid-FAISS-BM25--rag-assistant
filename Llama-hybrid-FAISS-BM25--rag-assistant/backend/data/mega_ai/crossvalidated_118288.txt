First, are you sure you want correlations among time series? These are fraught with problems, chiefly that there are many false correlations. E.g. the population of China is highly correlated with the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Second, if you do want correlations, then instead of deleting outliers you can run a correlation measure that copes better with them, such as rank correlation, provided that the outliers are not spurious data.
