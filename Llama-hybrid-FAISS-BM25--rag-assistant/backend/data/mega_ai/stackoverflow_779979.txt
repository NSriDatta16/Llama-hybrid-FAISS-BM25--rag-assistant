C# popularity industry-wide or is SO atypical?

I feel I'm a well rounded programmer, I'm comfortable in C# and java (several large projects with both) but I tend to use C++ for most applications when I have a choice. (and sometimes R,Python, or Perl as appropriate..) But I am astounded to see the popularity of C# here on SO. There are 18500 C# topics, more than C, C++, and java combined. I've never felt C# as having such an impact in the companies I've worked with but the SO popularity of C# is undeniable. My question: Why is C# so popular on Stack Overflow? My question is not so much a SO question as a desire to understand C#'s current acceptance/growth compared to C++ and java. Possible explanations for the popularity: C# is truly that popular and accepted in industry, it's everywhere! SO is not typical, it seems to have attracted a disproportionate number of C# users C# has more questions/confusions that tend to need community help to solve Microsoft (maybe on its forums?) encourages people to use SO for questions The first explanation is likely the reason, but I just haven't felt that popularity in the real world! What's your reason you discuss C# topics here?
