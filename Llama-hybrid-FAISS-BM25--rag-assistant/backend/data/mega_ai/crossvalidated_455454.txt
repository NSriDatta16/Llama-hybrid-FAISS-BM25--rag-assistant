Data preprocessing for dynamic linear regression

In DLM, what kind of preprocessing should be done before fitting the model? $$Y_t = \beta_t'X_t+\epsilon_t$$ $$\beta_t = \beta_{t-1}+\eta_t$$ Should I transform both $Y$ and $X$ into stationary time series? e.g. log, difference of log, etc. Should I centered and standardize $X$ like in Lasso/Ridge regression? If yes, should I do it variable-wise or time-wise? I think the any transformation will have an impact on the signal/noise ratio, does it matter? Because I think a high signal/noise ratio makes the estimation easier in state space model. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!
