EDIT: I don't think it's accurate enough since when walking normally the average acceleration would be near 0. The most you could do measuring acceleration is detect when someone starts walking or stops (But as you said, it's difficult to filter it from the device moved by someone standing at one place) So... what I wrote earlier, probably wouldn't work anyway: You can "predict" whether the user is moving by discarding when the user is not moving (obvious), And first two options coming to my mind are: Check whether the phone is "hidden", using proximity and light sensor (optional). This method is less accurate but easier. Controlling the continuity of the movement, if the phone is moving for more than... 10 seconds and the movement is not despicable, then you consider he is walking. I know is not perfet either, but it's difficult wihout using any kind of positioning, by the way... why don't you just use LocationManager ?
