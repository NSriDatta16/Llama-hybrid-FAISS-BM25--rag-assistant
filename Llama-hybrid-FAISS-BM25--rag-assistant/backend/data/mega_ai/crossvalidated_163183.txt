Is it possible to use genetic algorithms as a learning algorithm for artificial neural networks?

I've been using back-propagation to optimize neural networks without problems. But I've read in some books that genetic algorithms can be used to optimize an ANN. I want to know if its possible to use them as a learning algorithm.
