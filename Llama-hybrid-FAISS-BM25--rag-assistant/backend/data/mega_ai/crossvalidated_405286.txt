Normalizing the data prior to CNN will create more spherical error surfaces which will yield faster convergence of the gradient-based optimization procedure. If this step is skipped, some axes (determined by the eigenvectors of the loss function) will have steeper/flatter structures and consequently, the travel of our optimizer on the surface will get troubled. You can standardize the images. However, generally, we map the images into 0-1 interval (by dividing to 255 for gray images) so that the values are bounded.
