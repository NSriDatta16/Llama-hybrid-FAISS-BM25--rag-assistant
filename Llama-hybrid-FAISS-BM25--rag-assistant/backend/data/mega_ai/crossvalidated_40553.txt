Tobit model with corner solution and selection problem

How would you estimate a model with a log transformed dependent variable with a corner at zero and a continuous distribution for strictly positive values AND an additional selection problem due to missings? Background : Dependent variable y (expenditures) where y>=0 with "true" 0 values (y is always observed. The value zero is not arbitrary; it is observed data). Thus I have a corner at zero and a continuous distribution for strictly positive values. The distribution is such that I prefer to make a log transformation of the dependent variable y (ln y) Given such situation I would normally start with a tobit model. Based on that I would estimate several two part models ( according to Wooldridge) 1.Cragg Truncated Normal Hurdle Model 2. Lognormal Hurdle Model 3.Exponential Type II Tobit Model Finally, in order to compare these two part models I would use the value of the log-likelihood function.. But what happens if I have additionally a true missing data problem. That is, the value zero is observed data but additionally I have missings in y (selection problem) After taking logs I could not distinguish between the true zeros ( corner solution) and the missings due to the selection problem. Do you know any reference on this issue?
