Depending on your use case, Groovy AST transformations are a third option. AST transformation are modifications of the bytecode at compile time. They are available since Groovy 1.6 and have been improved a lot in Groovy 1.7. Esp. ASTBuilder is a very elegant way. Be aware that using AST within Grails might require some modifications to the build. The classes performing the AST must be compiled before the classes that are subject to AST. This could be easily done by hooking into the "CompileStart" event in scripts/_Events.groovy and precompile the Transformation first.
