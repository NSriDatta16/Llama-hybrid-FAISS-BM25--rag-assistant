Building v8 without JIT

I would like to run some tests on v8 with and without JIT to compare performances. I know JIT will improve my average speed performance, but it would be nice for me to have some actual more detailed tests results as I want to work with mobile platforms. I haven't found how to enable or disable JIT like it exists on Squirrelfish (cf. ENABLE_JIT in JavaScriptCore/wtf/Platform.h). Does somebody knows how to do that with v8? Thanks. Alexandre
