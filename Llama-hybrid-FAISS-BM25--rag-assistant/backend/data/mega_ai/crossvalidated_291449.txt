Reducing standard deviation by removing "noisy" items

I hope I'm using the right terms to describe my problem. Let's say I have the following list of numbers: 1,1.6,2,2.6,3,3.7,1000000 The last number (1000000) will greatly affect the calculated average and I'd like to somehow "ignore" it when performing the calculation (as its value is very different from the rest of the values) but I don't know what is the right way to approach this issue. Thanks !
