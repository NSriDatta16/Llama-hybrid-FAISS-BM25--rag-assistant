Clover web apps during runtime

Hello I am a Java web app developer I have a problem, I would like to make clover collect data during runtime for my web applications. I did manage to do so for a single application by adding a parameter to my tomcat (-Dclover.initstring.basedir="[PATH TO CLOVER DB]" ). It worked fine. But the problem is that we have more than one application and I would like to check their data coverage during runtime, all at once. So I have tried to do the same by referring to a merged DB file. It doesn’t work - the merged db file just doesn’t get updated at runtime. Do you have any idea why or any ideas on how should I do it? Thank you
