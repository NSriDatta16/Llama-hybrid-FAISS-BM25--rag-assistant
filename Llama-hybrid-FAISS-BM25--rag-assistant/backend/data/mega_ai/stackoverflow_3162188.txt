When using Event Sourcing and CQRS the most elegant (at least in my opinion) way of inter-AR communication is messaging. You can look at Ncqrs project (it will be easier if you are a .NET guy), particularly 'Messaging' branch. The idea is, ARs implement IMessageHandler interface for every message type they handle and AR base class exposes method Send for sending there messages. By means of this API clients can invoke model behavior and model itself can communicate (between ARs).
