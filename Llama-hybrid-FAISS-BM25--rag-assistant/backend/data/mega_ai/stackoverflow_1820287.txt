That is because your regex in the second group matches reluctantly (a.k.a. ungreedy matching). More info on this see: http://www.regular-expressions.info/repeat.html escpecially paragraph Laziness Instead of Greediness . That's why it doesn't work as you expected it to. Now, as to fixing your problem: use a proper parser for this or some existing tool to get attributes from html ( jQuery can do this quite nicely, I heard). Don't try to do this with regex: you may get it working for this case, but next week you'll be here again because something else broke. Best of luck!
