We will have 20% subjects left (e.g., if we have 1000 people, by day 200, we should have 200 left)? or For a given person, it has 20% chance to survive at day 200? In its most pure form, the Kaplan-Meier curve in your example doesn't make any of the above statements. The first statement makes a forward looking projection will have . Basic survival curve only describes the past, your sample. Yes, 20% of your sample survived by day 200. Will 20% survive in next 200 days? Not necessarily. In order to make that statement you have to add more assumptions, build a model etc. The model doesn't even have to be statistical in a sense like logistic regression. For instance, it could PDE in epidemiology etc. Your second statement is probably based on some kind of homogeneity assumption: all people are the same.
