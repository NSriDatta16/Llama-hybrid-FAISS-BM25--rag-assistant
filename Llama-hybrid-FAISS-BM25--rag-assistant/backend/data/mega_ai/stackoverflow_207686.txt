A bit of a educated guess here but anyway :- First check that you have XmlRoot attribute like this in your web part [XmlRoot(Namespace = "Your.Namespace")] public class YourWebPart: WebPart { ... and XmlElement attribute on your custom properties [DefaultValue(0)] [WebPartStorage(Storage.Shared)] [Browsable(false)] [XmlElement(ElementName = "YourProperty")] public Int64 YourProperty { ... } This error is happening when .NET is attempting to desterilize the data from the .DWP file and set the custom properties in your web part. I suspect that the error may have nothing to do with namespace conflicts as SharePoint sometimes tends to fall back to an error messages that can be a red herring. I would firstly examine your .dwp file. Do you have any custom properties set there, if so remove them and retest. Comment out the custom properties in your web part code one by one and retest at each step. I think you will find one of these is causing the problem - exactly why is the next question!
