What is your error message on the snapshot view creation? Something like: cleartool: Warning: Unable to register new snapshot view: not a ClearCase object snapshot view may not be recognized by some commands. Created snapshot view directory "yourServer". Server view_server (pid=2842) on "/home/store/testview.vws" died on startup; marking it as "down". ? Any " Unable to register new snapshot view " message will mean that you are ot able to edit your config spec (so ct edcs will fail) Try to specificy all the argument for your storage path: ct mkview -snapshot -tag testview \ -vws /home/store/testview.vws \ -host yourServerName \ -hpath /home/store/testview.vws \ -gpath /home/store/testview.vws \ /home/view/testview (is your view server on the same server than your view?)
