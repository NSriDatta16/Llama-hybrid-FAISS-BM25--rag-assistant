Suffix Array Implementation in Java

I'm looking to write an efficient n-order Markov chain method to generate random text strings given a set of example text. I currently have a Java implementation that uses several layers of Maps, but it's clunky. A suffix array would be perfect for my needs, but I'm not clear if that can be efficiently implemented in Java. In C I might do something like: char exampleText[MAX]; char *suffixArray[MAX]; ... while(n This gets gnarly in Java since I'd have to take substrings of exampleText , or turn suffixArray into an array of indices, or something else. Any suggestions for a good approach to this in Java?
