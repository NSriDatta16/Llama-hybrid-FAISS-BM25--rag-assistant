Why .data() function of jQuery is better to prevent memory leaks?

Regarding to jQuery utility function jQuery.data() the online documentation says: "The jQuery.data() method allows us to attach data of any type to DOM elements in a way that is safe from circular references and therefore from memory leaks. " Why to use: document.body.foo = 52; can result a memory leak -or in what conditions- so that I should use jQuery.data(document.body, 'foo', 52); Should I ALWAYS prefer .data() instead of using expandos in any case? (I would appreciate if you can provide an example to compare the differences) Thanks, burak ozdogan
