Guess the touched UIImageView

I have multiple UIImageViews with userinteraction enabled. I am implementing touchesBegan, is there a way to guess which imageview was touched rather than making a rect based on all imageviews and check for the touch point existence in them? I also have assigned different tags to each imageview.
