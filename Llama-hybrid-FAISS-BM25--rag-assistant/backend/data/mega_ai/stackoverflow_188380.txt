To get the average of the minimum values for each incnum, you could write this SQL select avg(min_time) as avg_time from (select incnum, min(col2) as min_time from inc group by incnum) using the correct average function for your brand of SQL. If you're doing this in Access, you'll want to paste this into the SQL view; when you use a subquery, you can't do that directly in design view.
