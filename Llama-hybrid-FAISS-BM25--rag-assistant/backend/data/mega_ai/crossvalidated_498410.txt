A good answer I found on Quora : Overfitting is not defined over a particular size of dataset. If we have large datasets such as the imagenet, then overfitting could very well be applicable for a large portion of it or a small portion of it. It is simply a phenomenon where a CNN might not learn to extract rich features (more generalizable model), but rather tends to extract features that are only good for classifying certain number of examples in the training set. Excuse my reference to only CNNs, but this argument can be extended to general machine learning. So, when we have non-overlapping pooling regions, we can see that the spatial information is quickly lost and the network "sees" only the dominant pixel values (winning unit for max pooling for example). This would still provide hierarchical representations, but they would almost always be dominated by the "stronger regions" of an image which then propagate through the network. Effectively, this creates a "bias" in learning which in turn causes an easier potential to overfit. Let me illustrate this in a different manner. Suppose I take photographs and cover most of it except a bright spot and show them to you, the bright spots all look similar and you learn to identify it. But they could have been from different sources such as a lamp post, headlight of a car, the sun and so on. Unless information from the surrounding is also captured, finer distinguishing cannot be achieved. The overfitting occurs because you almost always see a bright spot and learn to say its a "car" and you turn out to be right since most cars have headlights and you have a lot of photographs of cars having their headlights on, but thats not the only feature you would use to recognise a car and thus would do bad during validation and testing. With overlapping regions, there is less loss of surrounding spatial information. This is why fractional pooling seems even more effective. Note that non-overlapping pooling does not always cause a problem in practice and overlapping pooling regions or fractional pooling only marginally improves results. I had to explain it more dramatically to put forth my point.
