solve() fails when the likelihood profile for one or more parameters is flat around the maximum likelihood. It means that the standard error for this or these parameters is infinite. ginv() can be seen as a trick (the Moore-Penrose generalized inverse of a matrix) assuming that standard error is 0 for this or these parameters. It is clearly wrong. If this (or these) parameters are not of interest for you, this can be a good solution. But do not interpret these se ! The solution could be to use Bayesian MCMC rather.
