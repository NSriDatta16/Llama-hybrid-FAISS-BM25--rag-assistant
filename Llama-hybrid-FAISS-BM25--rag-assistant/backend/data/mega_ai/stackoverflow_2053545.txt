Castle Windsor - Staging vs Production connectionString parameter for a Component

I've been struggling with this problem, and while something elegant would be preferred any old hack will do at this point :) I have a repository that is registered something like: Data Source=COMPUTERNAME\SQL2008;Initial Catalog=MyDB;Persist Security Info=True;User ID=username;Password=password #{myConnStr} I am trying to set up my config file so that I don't have to modify the myConnStr property portion for the various deployment options. It's fine (even ideal) if I can only establish the connectionString once when the configuration is first loaded, but I can't figure out how to set this value when setting up my container. If I wasn't using castle windsor I'd just have multiple connection strings defined like "connectionStringStaging", "connectionStringProduction" and choose the appropriate one via code based on my environment (computer name or URL). How can I do something like that with a castle windsor property? Modifying the 'parameter' for the component instead of the 'property' would be acceptable as well.
