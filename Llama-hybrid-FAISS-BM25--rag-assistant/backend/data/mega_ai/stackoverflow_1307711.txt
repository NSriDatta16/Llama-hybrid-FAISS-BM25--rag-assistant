Does it have something to do with the levels, zero and three, of x86? No. What did the 9-killing do to things such as kernel and fs? Nothing - though the database files of postgresql might have been left in an inconsistent state. Has the failure with reinstalling anything to do with side effects No (?). Sending signal 9 to a process simply forces it to exit immediately. For a database server that can be a bit fatal if it was in the middle of altering the data files/storage - leaving them in an inconsistent state. It sounds like you either haven't removed everything from your old postgresql installation, or you haven't configured the server properly after reinstalling it.
