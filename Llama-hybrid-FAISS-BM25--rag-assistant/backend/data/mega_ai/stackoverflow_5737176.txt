Quoting wikipedia http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIME : "Many mail user agents also send messages with the file name in the name parameter of the content-type header instead of the filename parameter of the content-disposition header. This practice is discouraged." So it seems content-disposition is preferred. However as I am using JavaMail, current JavaMail API seems to have only a String getDisposition() method: http://javamail.kenai.com/nonav/javadocs/javax/mail/Part.html#getDisposition (). So you might need to work with the header directly if you are using JavaMail.
