The process you have defined in the first paragraph is not stationary. We have $\mathbb{Var}(x_1) = \mathbb{Var}(w_1) = \sigma^2$ and $\mathbb{Var}(x_2) = \frac{1}{4}\,\mathbb{Var}(x_1) + \mathbb{Var}(w_2) = \frac{5}{4}\,\sigma^2$. To get a stationary AR(1) process, you need to define the first state to follow the stationary distribution - not $x_1=w_1$ but $x_1 \sim \mathrm{N}(0, \frac{4}{3}\sigma^2)$ (Exercise: try plugging this into the "here's how I'm doing this"). If the first state has a different distribution, the subsequent states will, too. However, if $x_1$ has finite variance, the variance of $x_t$ will converge to the "stationary variance" when $t \rightarrow \infty$ - the initial state will be "forgotten". Typically, the stationary AR.process is understood to be defined either so that the first state follows the stationary distribution or so defined to be driven by noises $\ldots,w_{-2},w_{-1},w_0,w_1,w_2,\ldots$ so that there is no "first state".
