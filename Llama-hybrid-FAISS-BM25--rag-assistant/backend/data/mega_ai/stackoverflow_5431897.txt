From your fragment it looks right (but I would use this.first = new SLLNode(elem, this.first) and ommit the next two statements). What did your mergeUnsorted method print? Edit: I have no idea what is wrong, but obviously your addFirst method works, while directly adding does not work correctly. So use this: public SLL mergeUnsorted(SLL otherList) { Iterator itr = otherList.iterator() ; while (itr.hasNext()) { Object elem = itr.next() ; System.out.println(elem) ; // to make sure the elements are retrieved correctly SLLNode ins = new SLLNode(elem, null) ; // make a node out of the element this.addFirst(ins); } return this ; } Of course, this will add the elements in reverse order, but the same is happening now, too (it just does not work).
