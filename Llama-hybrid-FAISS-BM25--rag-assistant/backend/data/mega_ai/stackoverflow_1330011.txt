CDN and URL's with query-strings

We have an images folder on our web servers that we may publish via a CDN. Sometimes we append query-string like syntax to URL's to help us freshen content that has changed, even though it rarely does. Example: /images/file.png?20090821 will URL's like this work with your average content-delivery-network?
