I'll answer 1. The marginal effect is the predicted increment of the response variable associated with a unit increase in one of the covariates keeping the others constant. In linear regression, it is just the beta parameter. In logistic regression, it depends on the value of the covariate. The predicted probability is just the predicted probability for the outcome to be 1 (the label associated with the value 1)
