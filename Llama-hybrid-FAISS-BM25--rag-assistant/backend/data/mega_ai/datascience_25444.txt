Advantages of monotonic activation functions over non-monotonic functions in neural networks?

What are the advantages of using monotonic activation functions over non-monotonic functions in neural networks? Do they perform better than non-monotonic ones? Is this mathematically proven? Are there any papers/references that are related to this?
