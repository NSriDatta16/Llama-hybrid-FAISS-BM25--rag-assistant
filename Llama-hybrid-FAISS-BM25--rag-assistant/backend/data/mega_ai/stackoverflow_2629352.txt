First of all size of the RAM has nothing to do with how much free virtual memory available in the process. It just that your program will slow down if the RAM is less due to frequent page faults. Also, the virtual memory will be mostly fragmented so it makes more sense to find the things such as largest continuous free memory instead of total free memory. There are no built in C++ functions to do this you have use OS API's to get it. For example, on windows you can use the Win32 APIs to get this information.
