Why me. I have been fairly active on Meta, in particular in the tag related-issues, and have coordinated several large tag reorganization projects. This kind of work would get a lot easier if I were a mod. The unmerged tag synonyms will be merged and the tags that need to be burninated will get burninated. Finally. (Apart from that, I like organizing existing threads through duplicates, merges, canonical Qs, etc., and with mod privileges this could be more effective.) Why not me. During all these years, I have entirely neglected review queues. Monitoring review queues to quickly close & re-open stuff is one of the most important moderator tasks. However, I did not do it before and am unlikely to start now. My "candidate score" is 3 points short of maximum because I am missing some of the review badges. Among the existing nominees, @Tim and especially @gung are much more active in moderation as well as answering. After some hesitation, I decided to nominate myself because there was not enough candidates and because I was encouraged by several kind users. But I don't know if such division of labour among mods makes sense. Q&A
