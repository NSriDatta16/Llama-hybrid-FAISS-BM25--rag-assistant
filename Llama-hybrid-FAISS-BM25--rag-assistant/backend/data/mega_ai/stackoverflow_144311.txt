You're right. nvarchar stores Unicode data while varchar stores single-byte character data. Other than storage differences ( nvarchar requires twice the storage space as varchar ), which you already mentioned, the main reason for preferring nvarchar over varchar would be internationalization (i.e. storing strings in other languages).
