Synchronize SVN through FTP

My team is working with a group at another company with pretty stringent IT policies. We are not allowed any direct access to their SVN server. They are not allowed to access our SVN server. The only option we've been given is access to a shared FTP server. So, I'm looking for suggestions for keeping our repositories in synch. Note that this FTP server is the only communication mechanism other than email so svn:externals are not an option. My current thought is a nightly (or as often as needed) diff/patch going in both directions. For what it's worth we're each working of pretty independent components so the chances of conflicts is pretty low. Any better ideas? Edit: I realize that I should "fight the man" a bit on this, but it has been weeks and the FTP (presumably SFTP) is not even in place yet. Thus I'm looking for clever solutions. The nature of our industry and the system we're working on precludes 3rd party storage of the code. Yes, this is silly and bureaucratic. Way it goes :)
