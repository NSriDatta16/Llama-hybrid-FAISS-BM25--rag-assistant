It seems that the spec even states that h1 has preference over all the others: Sections may contain headings of any rank, but authors are strongly encouraged to either use only h1 elements, or to use elements of the appropriate rank for the section's nesting level. What disturbs me however is this: Authors are also encouraged to explicitly wrap sections in elements of sectioning content, instead of relying on the implicit sections generated by having multiple headings in one element of sectioning content. Now it is wonderful that we got section, article, nav and aside to use to prevent div-itis. But if we need to explicitly use a section element for each section than we end up with more section elements then we ever had divs. I feel a strong case of section-itis coming on.
