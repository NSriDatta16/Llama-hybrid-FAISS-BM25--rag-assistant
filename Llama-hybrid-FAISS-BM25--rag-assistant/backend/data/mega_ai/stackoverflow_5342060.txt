Color of the line marker in DropMode.INSERT_ROW

I have a JTable where the rows can be moved with drag&drop. I'm using DropMode.INSERT_ROW for this (so the drop location is marked with a horizontal line between the rows of the table). By default the line is gray, with black along the column the mousepointer is currently over. How can I change the color of this line? And is it possible to not "mark" the column-bit with black? I want to avoid making my own handler for this. Simply looking for something like setMarkerColor() or something like that, but I'm having a very hard time finding it.
