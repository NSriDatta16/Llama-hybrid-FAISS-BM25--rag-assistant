noSQL/SQL/RoR: Trying to build scalable ratings table for the game

I am trying to solve complex thing (as it looks to me). I have next entities: PLAYER (few of them, with names like "John", "Peter", etc.). Each has unique ID. For simplicity let's think it's their name. GAME (few of them, say named "Hide and Seek", "Jump and Run", etc.). Same - each has unique ID. For simplicity of the case let it be it's name for now. SCORE (it's numeric). So, how it works. Each PLAYER can play in multiple GAMES. He gets some SCORE in every GAME. I need to build rating table -- and not one! Table #1: most played GAMES Table #2: best PLAYERS in all games (say the total SCORE in every GAME). Table #3: best PLAYERS per GAME (by SCORE in particularly that GAME). I could be build something straight right away, but that will not work. I will have more than 10,000 players; and 15 games, which will grow for sure. Score can be as low as 0, and as high as 1,000,000 (not sure if higher is possible at this moment) for player in the game. So I really need some relative data. Any suggestions? I am planning to do it with SQL, but may be just using it for key-value storage; anything -- any ideas are welcome. Thank you!
