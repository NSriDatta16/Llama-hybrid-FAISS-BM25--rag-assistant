In my experience, it is always better to keep record of the users that try to register to a site. The problem is that more then often the users do not get the confirmation e-mail. When that happens they often forget the site and do not come back. What I do is to retry sending the confirmation e-mail after a while, say one week. Often they receive the second e-mail and you end up recovering a registered user that otherwise would be lost. As a matter of fact, I retry sending the confirmation e-mail once every week until the user confirms or it passed 30 days since the registration attempt. Even if the user does not confirm after 30 days, I do not delete the account. Often the user comes back trying to register again. Then I just send him again the account confirmation once again and encourage the user to contact the site if he does not get it again. All this is to maximize the chances of recovering a registered user that otherwise could be lost.
