drag and drop from datagrid to uicomponent in Flex

I'm trying to drag an item from a datagrid and drop it onto a UIComponet. Basically I just want the UIComponent to know that something has been dropped onto it and allow it to access the data of the dropped item. I thought just listening for the drop event would do it but it seems not. I found lots of documentation on dragging from one IList to another but nothing for this.
