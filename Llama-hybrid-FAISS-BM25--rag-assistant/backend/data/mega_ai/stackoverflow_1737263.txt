Thank you for using Aspose.Words. In the public API we currently have only the "flow-document" information e.g. paragraphs, tables, lists etc. Internally, we build a page layout model that has classes like page, block of text, line of text and so on. There are internal links of course between the document model and the layout model and it is possible to find out which page ends where and all the stuff. Making this information available via the public API is (well, still) high on our priority list. Have you logged your request in the Aspose.Words support forums? We use this info to maintain a voting system and will work on features that get more votes first.
