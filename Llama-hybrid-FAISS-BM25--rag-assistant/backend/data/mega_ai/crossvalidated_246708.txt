Fused lasso on a 2d grid is called generalized fused lasso, it can take into an account any neighborhood structure you can represent as a graph. I think it should not be a problem to use it for negative binomial, it is all just about adding the penalty term. Unlike the standard lasso, fused lasso cannot be as effectively computed. I know about this paper claiming to have an efficient algorhitm, but I don't know where it stands in the state of the art, but it might be worth to look at for you http://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/AAAI/AAAI14/paper/viewFile/8261/8862 Another option for you, if the speed is important is to ditch the fuse lasso and use just elastic net, which can be solved on GPU with SVM solvers. Not sure about the negative binomial tho. You can add the spatial dependency to your model by smoothing the data.
