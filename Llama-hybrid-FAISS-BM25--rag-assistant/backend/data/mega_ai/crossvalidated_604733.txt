Parameterization of inverse gamma prior in Bayesian methods

For a prior of $\sigma^2 \sim IG(0.01, 0.01)$ , often recommended as an uninformative prior for the variance parameter in MCMC approaches and other Bayesian methods, which parameterization does this recommendation correspond to? Is it shape/scale or shape/rate? That is, in R, would it be invgamma::dinvgamma(sigma, shape = 0.01, scale = 0.01) or invgamma::dinvgamma(sigma, shape = 0.01, rate = 0.01) ?
