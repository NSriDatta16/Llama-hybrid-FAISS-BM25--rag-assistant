That's not the only problem. Even if you could catch cut and paste reliably on all browsers, which you can't, there are still more ways of putting content in a form field. For example on some platforms dragging a file to an input will put the pathname in, with no event for you to catch. Or a user might do right-click-Undo to change the contents. Or Delete. Or select some text from the input or another input and drag-and-drop it in. And probably many more I haven't thought of. If you want to be informed of all changes to a form field more quickly than onchange , I'm afraid there is no alternative but to constantly monitor the value of the element in a polling setInterval .
