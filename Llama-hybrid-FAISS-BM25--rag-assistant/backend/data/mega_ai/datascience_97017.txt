How to represent a "switch"-like behavior in a neural network?

I have three input variables $x_1$ , $x_2$ and $d$ , where $x_1$ and $x_2$ are numerical variables and $d$ is a dummy variable that takes the value of 1 or 2. How to represent the part of a neural network in the black box so that when $d=1$ , $x_1$ and $x_2$ are sent to layer $T_1$ for transformation, and when $d=2$ , $x_1$ and $x_2$ are sent to layer $T_2$ for transformation?
