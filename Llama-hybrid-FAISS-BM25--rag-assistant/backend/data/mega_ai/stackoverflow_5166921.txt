newGroups = [NSMutableString stringWithString:[newGroups substringToIndex:[newGroups length] - 1]]; This line generates a leak, then is the cause of the crash. After this executes, you no longer have a reference on your alloc/inited mutable string, and you have an autoreleased string. So calling release on that string causes a double release somewhere. EDIT: with solution Simplest solution: do not add the last ','. for (int i = 0; i Not very elegant, but quite efficient (could avoid taking the count each time though).
