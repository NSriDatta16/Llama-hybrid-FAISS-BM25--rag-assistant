I do have some experience with this type of data, so I'd suggest a couple of things to implement BruceET's elaboration on Poisson statistics (+1). First, don't model ratios. Model counts. Model counts as close to the raw data as possible. If you're doing things like hemacytometer counts, model the actual counts, not the transformations to counts per ml. Second, have a separate data line for each observed count value, annotated with all of the associated values of interest. Obviously you include the treatment type; structure it as a multi-level categorical variable with "control" as the reference level. Also include in each data line anything else that might matter: date of experiment if there is substantial inter-day variability, an indicator of which observations are paired if that's the case, drug concentrations if some of your "treatments" are the same drug at different concentrations, etc. If your cell counts come from different volumes of cell suspensions, include the volume value too. Third, start with a Poisson regression generalized linear model. That makes sure that the error estimates are properly based on Poisson statistics (variance equals mean). Include the treatment predictor and any other variables that might be of interest. If volumes of the cell suspensions differed and you are interested in differences in cell numbers, use the log of the volume as an offset in the model (fixed to have a slope of 1). Then (with standard treatment/dummy coding) each coefficient reported for the categorical treatment variable will represent the log difference between a corresponding treatment and control, taking into account any other predictors in your model. That is precisely the log of the ratio that you wish to estimate. It won't matter if in some cases, contrary to expectation, you find more cells in treatment than in control; it will effectively average out over the replicates. (Or not, if a treatment doesn't affect cell count.) You might find that the Poisson model doesn't work well, in that estimated means and variances are too far apart. Then there are related regression approaches, allowing for a Poisson-like model with variance at some fixed multiple of the mean to be estimated from the data (quasipoisson) or modeling directly with a negative binomial distribution instead. The data set-up and modeling principles, however, would be the same.
