Embedding Video Cross Browser, Single format / Embed

I have a task ahead of me that I do not know the easiest way to address. Currently I am building out an admin section in Symfony for a client and she would like to upload video. She has the capability of conversion and will use the format I specify but I just do not know what the best on is for cross browser compatibility. I think .mov seems pretty good but I do not know. I would like simple embed code and to swap out the video src with js. Any and all help appreciated as always. Thank you in advance, J
