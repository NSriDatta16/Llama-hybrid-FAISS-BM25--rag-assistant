You are erroneously conflating two different entities: (1) bias-variance and (2) model complexity. (1) Over-fitting is bad in machine learning because it is impossible to collect a truly unbiased sample of population of any data. The over-fitted model results in parameters that are biased to the sample instead of properly estimating the parameters for the entire population. This means there will remain a difference between the estimated parameters $\hat{\phi}$ and the optimal parameters $\phi^{*}$, regardless of the number of training epochs $n$. $|\phi^{*} - \hat{\phi}| \rightarrow e_{\phi} \mbox{ as }n\rightarrow \infty$, where $e_{\phi}$ is some bounding value (2) Model complexity is in simplistic terms the number of parameters in $\phi$. If the model complexity is low, then there will remain a regression error regardless of the number of training epochs, even when $\hat{\phi}$ is approximately equal to $\phi^{*}$. Simplest example would be learning to fit a line (y=mx+c), where $\phi = \{m,c\}$ to data on a curve (quadratic polynomial). $E[|y-M(\hat{\phi})|] \rightarrow e_{M} \mbox{ as } n \rightarrow \infty$, where $e_{M}$ is some regression fit error bounding value Summary: Yes, both sample bias and model complexity contribute to the 'quality' of the learnt model, but they don't directly affect each other. If you have biased data, then regardless of having the correct number of parameters and infinite training, the final learnt model would have error. Similarly, if you had fewer than the required number of parameters, then regardless of perfectly unbiased sampling and infinite training, the final learnt model would have error.
