sample from a distribution raised to a power

If I know how to simulate the distribution $\pi(\mathbf{x})$, then is there a way to directly generate samples of $(\pi(\mathbf{x}))^\beta$ for some $\beta > 0$ ?(assume that it can be normalised to a density, i.e. $\int (\pi(\mathbf{x}))^\beta d\mathbf{x} Generating random variables from a mixture of Normal distributions , but how can I sample from $\pi^\beta$ (without using MCMC algorithms).
