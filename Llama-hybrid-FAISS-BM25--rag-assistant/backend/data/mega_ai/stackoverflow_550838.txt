Basically you create a file named Yourmodulename.pm , whose contents are: package Yourmodulename; # Here are your definitions 1; # Important, every module should return a true value Then the program that uses the module will look like: #!/usr/bin/perl use strict; # These are good pragmas use warnings; # Used modules use Carp; # A module that you'll probably find useful use Yourmodulename; # Your module You may want to organize your modules in a hierarchical (and hopefully logical) way. To do so you create a tree of directories like: Your/Module.pm Your/Other/Module.pm And then in your program: use Your::Module; use Your::Other::Module; There are more facilities to export functions and variables from your module, you can take a look at Henning Koch's "Writing serious Perl: The absolute minimum you need to know" .
