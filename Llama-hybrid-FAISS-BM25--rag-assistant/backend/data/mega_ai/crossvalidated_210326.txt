Are all generative Models based on Bayes?

Reading about deep learning I encounter various different kinds of hierarchical networks, many of which are generative. 1) Are all of the generative networks based on Bayes? 2) If not, how do they form the model that enables them to be generative? Please explain in layman's English since my math is very limited. I have read the excellent discussion at The connection between Bayesian statistics and generative modeling , but if I understand it correctly, it does not answer my question. It says there is a close relationship between Bayes and generative models but not that all generative models are based on Bayes. Nor does it say, if they are not, how they form their model. Thank you.
