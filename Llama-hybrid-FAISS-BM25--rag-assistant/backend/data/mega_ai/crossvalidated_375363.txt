I'm not 100% sure of this but I think that would you suggest is correct, finding the probability between classes would be difficult. I don't understand the softmax function you suggested since logistic regression is binary. You're exaggerating binary outputs. To my knowledge (which isn't much because multinomial logistic regression was never touched on in my studies), how Multinomial LR works is already how you are describing your multi class logistic regression works.
