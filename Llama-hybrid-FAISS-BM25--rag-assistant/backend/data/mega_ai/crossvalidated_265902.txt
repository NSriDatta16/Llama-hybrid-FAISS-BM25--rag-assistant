Hey Yaroslav, you really do not have to hurry accepting my answer on MO and are more than welcomed to ask further details :). Since you reformulate the question in 3-dim I can see exactly what you want to do. In MO post I thought you only need to calculate the largest cosine between two random variables. Now the problem seems tougher. First, we calculate the normalized Gaussian $\frac{X}{\|X\|}$ , which is not a trivial job since it actually has a name "projected normal distribution" because we can rewrite the multivariate normal density $X$ in terms of its polar coordinate $(\|X\|,\frac{X}{\|X\|})=(r,\boldsymbol{\theta})$ . And the marginal density for $\boldsymbol{\theta}$ can be obtained in $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^{+}}f(r,\boldsymbol{\theta})dr$$ An important instance is that in which $x$ has a bivariate normal distribution $N_2(\mu,\Sigma)$ , in which $\|x\|^{-1}x$ is said to have a projected normal ( or angular Gaussian or offset normal ) distribution.[Mardia&Peter]p.46 In this step we can obtain distributions $\mathcal{PN}_{k}$ for $\frac{X}{\|X\|}\perp\frac{Y}{\|Y\|}$ , and hence their joint density $(\frac{X}{\|X\|},\frac{Y}{\|Y\|})$ due to independence. As for a concrete density function of projected normal distribution, see [Mardia&Peter] Chap 10. or [2] Equation (4) or [1] . (Notice that in [2] they also assume a special form of covariance matrix $\Sigma=\left(\begin{array}{cc} \Gamma & \gamma\\ \gamma' & 1 \end{array}\right)$ ) Second, since we already obtained their joint density, their inner product can be readily derived using transformation formula $$\left(\frac{X}{\|X\|},\frac{Y}{\|Y\|}\right)\mapsto\frac{X}{\|X\|}\cdot\frac{Y}{\|Y\|}$$ . Also see [3]. As long as we computed the density, the second moment is only a problem of integration. References: [Mardia&Peter]Mardia, Kanti V., and Peter E. Jupp. Directional statistics. Vol. 494.
