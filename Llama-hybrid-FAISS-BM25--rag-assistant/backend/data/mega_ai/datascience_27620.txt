How to handle the target variable being in the features

I am trying to predict the winner of a tennis match from the players participating and their respective ranks. Labels of my data: Winner Loser Winner rank Loser rank The problem is that the columns holding the player names in my data are labeled 'Winner' and 'Loser'. What is the best course of action to render this dataset usable for machine learning? Could I just assign the 'Winner' column/vector as my target variable, and construct two new columns ('Player1', 'Player2') and populate them with random choices from 'Winner' and 'Loser'?
