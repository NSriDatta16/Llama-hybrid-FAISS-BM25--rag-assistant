I'd add some observations to what's been said... AI is a very broad term for anything that has to do with machines doing reasoning-like or sentient-appearing activities, ranging from planning a task or cooperating with other entities, to learning to operate limbs to walk. A pithy definition is that AI is anything computer-related that we don't know how to do well yet. (Once we know how to do it well, it generally gets its own name and is no longer "AI".) It's my impression, contrary to Wikipedia, that Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning are the same field, but the former is practiced by computer-science folks while the latter is practiced by statisticians and engineers. (Many technical fields are discovered over and over by different subgroups, who often bring their own lingo and mindset to the table.) Data Mining, in my mind anyhow, takes Machine Learning/Pattern Recognition (the techniques that work with the data) and wrap them in database, infrastructure, and data validation/cleaning techniques.
