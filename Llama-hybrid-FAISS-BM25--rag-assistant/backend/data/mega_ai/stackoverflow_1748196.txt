Several years ago I was involved in a project that used HOOPs. The company didn't want to pay royalties any more and wasn't very convinced that HOOPs was the right product for them so I ported all the HOOPs functionality they used over to OpenGL. I have summarised my experience of this below but you will have to determine what is relevant for your projects. Disadvantages/costs for that project: Needed to write object picking (HOOPs supplied that) Needed to write virtual trackball (HOOPs supplied that) [although sample code to do this is freely available] Had to move some data storage from HOOPs over to our own data structures Advantages for that project: Able to use features of OpenGL such as transparency (although surely HOOPs has that by now?) Lots of resources to find help with OpenGL Better performance (for our case - I don't know if this is still true as it seems HOOPs uses OpenGL/DirectX underneath now) Better support for consumer-priced graphics cards & laptops More flexibility to go beyond what HOOPs thinks you should need to do The big wins were the resources to find help and greater flexibility.
