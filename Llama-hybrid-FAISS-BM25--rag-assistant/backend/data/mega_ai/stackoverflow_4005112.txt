From the standard 6.2(4): If the input stream has been parsed into preprocessing tokens up to a given character, the next preprocessing token is the longest sequence of characters that could constitute a preprocessing token. They even add the example: EXAMPLE 2 The program fragment x+++++y is parsed as x ++ ++ + y, which violates a constraint on increment operators, even though the parse x ++ + ++ y might yield a correct expression. So your statement: a = b+++++b---c--; Is equivalent to: a = b ++ ++ + b -- - c -- ;
