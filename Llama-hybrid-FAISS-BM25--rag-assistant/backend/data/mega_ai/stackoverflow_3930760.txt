space to share the target to the developer. The disadvantage is, that we have artifacts in our SVN! But the p2 repository sounds much better. When every devloper activate auto-update, he will informed when updates avaiable. I think we must try it in the future at my company. Our actively developed source code we share by Team Project Sets (*.psf). This is an single text file which contains all repository information of the exportet eclipse projects. Try it in your Eclipse IDE with File -> Export -> Team -> Team Project Set . Are there any changes on the Project Set actually we send an email to our developers. An more elegant way I think is it to share it over the p2 repository. I hope that helps and sorry for my bad english!
