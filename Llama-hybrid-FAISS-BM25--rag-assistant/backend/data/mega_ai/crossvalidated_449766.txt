Once you have the form of the PDF, there are various techniques for sampling. Some easy forms can be handled via Inverse Transform Sampling . Some special forms can be handled via methods special methods, e.g. sampling from normal distribution via Box-MÃ¼ller . Other general methods exist for PDFs with non-easy/non-special forms (i.e. inverse transform sampling is not possible or easy to employ), such as Rejection sampling , or may others under MCMC topic. The discrete cases are easier to handle as described in @Haitao's answer.
