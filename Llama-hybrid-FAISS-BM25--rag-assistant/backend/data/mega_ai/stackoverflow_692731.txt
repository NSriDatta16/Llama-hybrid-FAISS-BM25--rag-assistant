For us, all we use is Adobe Version Cue, Google Docs , Google Calendar and Gmail . Design wise, Version Cue does the trick in terms of file management really well. As for Google, well, it helps organizing all of my activities more than very well. I find most collaboration tools, like Basecamp, a tad too restrictive or just not exactly right. Google lets me organize my stuff just the way I want it to be.
