I found this article to be very helpful in my case: https://mapr.com/blog/deep-learning-tensorflow/ Using this basic RNN structure, I was able to predict the outcome of the next timestep. By centering all events to the nearest minute, the network was able to recognize the pattern that correlates within the timeline.
