Is this set of vectors representing direction in a sequence trainable across LSTM? if not, what are the drawbacks?

I am starting my Neural Network Project for the first time, I have a lot of expectations: The main idea is primarily analyzing the pattern of my writings or drawings when using the mouse given a determined set of steps. I recorded myself writing the letter 'Z' and saving the direction of each stroke to a dataset of shape (200, 50, 9) . Example of an individual set: (50, 9) [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0], ..., [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]], Where one (1, 9) vector is which direction the mouse is currently heading towards. My network is fixed just like this: _________________________________________________________________ Layer (type) Output Shape Param # ================================================================= lstm (LSTM) (None, 10, 50) 12000 _________________________________________________________________ dropout (Dropout) (None, 10, 50) 0 _________________________________________________________________ lstm_1 (LSTM) (None, 50) 20200 _________________________________________________________________ dropout_1 (Dropout) (None, 50) 0 _________________________________________________________________ dense (Dense) (None, 30) 1530 _________________________________________________________________ dropout_2 (Dropout) (None, 30) 0 _________________________________________________________________ dense_1 (Dense) (None, 9) 279 ================================================================= Total params: 34,009 Trainable params: 34,009 I divided each set into 10 sequences to make the LSTM work. and consecutively the output is the next (1, 9) vector to which the mouse should move. However, I have hit a wall and the model does not seem to learn, I might suspect there is something wrong with my dataset. So I have come to clarify one thing: Is this dataset even trainable?, or in other words, I want to know whether there is an X model that is capable of predicting the next vector direction. So I just can keep trying and finding the optimal model or even keep cleaning the data. Or, I am missing a basic concept that makes the dataset lack information to be understandable to any model. Thanks and regards.
