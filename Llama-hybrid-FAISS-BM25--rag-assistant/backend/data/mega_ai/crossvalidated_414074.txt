CNN architectures for predicting next frame

I am currently trying to generate image of a body tissue at time t+1, by using image given at time t (or t-1,t-2...). Until now, I experimented on some Incomplete Conv Autoencoders in two main approaches, the first one is feeding 3 images that represent different aspect of the same tissue at time t and predicting 3 outputs corresponding same aspects a.k.a. 3 channel input 3 channel output. the second one is feeding 3 images that represent different aspect of the same tissue at time t and predicting 1 output for a specific aspect. And doing this for all aspects a.k.a. 3 channel input 1 channel output for each channel. In each approach, MSE is used. Is there a more suitable architecture or approach to this problem? I also checked the literature about future frame prediction but cannot find anything about the medical implementation. Also looking forward to some paper suggestions.
