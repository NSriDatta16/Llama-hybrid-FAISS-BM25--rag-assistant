Random forest - OOB error rate when some observations appear in all tree

I am just curious about how Random forest calculates the (Out-of-bag) OOB error rate. In my course note, it says that RF will predict each observation using only trees in which that observation does not appear. It makes sense but what if a observation appears in all the tree, how can we calculate OOB error rate for this observation? Really appreciate any help
