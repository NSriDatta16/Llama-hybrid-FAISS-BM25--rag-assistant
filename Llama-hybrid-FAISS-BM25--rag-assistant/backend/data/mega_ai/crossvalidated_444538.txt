This is an interesting question... and some scholars have tried to address this issue in the past: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15702203 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20837637 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21113051 https://academic.oup.com/biostatistics/article/13/4/637/240843 My take is that meta-analysis is akin to a retrospective observational research, you can always pool non-inferiority, equivalence, or superiority studies, but only with a superiority aim. Indeed, you cannot usually stipulate you defined pre hoc any non-inferiority or equivalence threshold before your meta-analysis. Very rarely and early on (eg in case you work for a pharmaceutical company and are planning a series of phase I, II and III trials) you could pre hoc design prospectively a non-inferiority meta-analysis, but I assume the credibility and impact of such work would be small. In any case, the best way to exploit any meta-analysis is by using confidence intervals of effect estimates (within a classical or Bayesian framework). Accordingly, you can always post hoc estimate then distance of your actual effects from a given threshold of choice.
