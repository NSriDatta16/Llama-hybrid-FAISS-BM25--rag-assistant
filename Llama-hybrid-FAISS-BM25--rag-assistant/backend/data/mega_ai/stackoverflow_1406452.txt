Can Cocoa Touch UI objects be serialized, transmitted over a network, and reconstituted on a client?

I've been working on and off with a team that's developing an iPhone app. Like a lot of other developers new to Cocoa Touch, we decided to create a hybrid Cocoa-Web app which was essentially a few buttons controlling some UIWebViews -- partly to (a) leverage existing web development expertise, partly because of (b) the advantage in pushing out changes (change stuff on the server, no need to push out a new version of the app), and partly because (c) the app is inherently focused on pulling data from the network anyway. We've reached a point, however, where this hybrid approach looks like it's having notable costs against polish and performance. We're working on this problem, but I think we've all started to wonder if a more purely Cocoa client might not be a better move. The big question is -- is there an arrangement under Cocoa where we can keep advantage (b)? Is there some way to serialize Cocoa Touch UI objects in such a way that they can be transmitted over the network and reconstituted for display on a client? If so, when serialized, are they lightweight enough for this to be practical?
