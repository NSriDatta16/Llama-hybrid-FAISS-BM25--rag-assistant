Although still a somewhat immature platform, Silverlight 2.0 supports many of the features that I would expect from a platform needed to create full sized applications. Data access through web services and local data/object query support with Linq Many feature rich controls such as datagrid, treeview, etc A very usable subset of the CLR (common language runtime) Access to restricted local storage on the client machine It is cross platform There are already some great add-ons, like Telerik and the Silverlight Control Toolkit For your specific scenario, Microsoft has published a tutorial on Multi-page Applications
