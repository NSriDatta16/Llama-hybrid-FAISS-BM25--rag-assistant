Based on the comparison of BCP, BULK INSERT, OPENROWSET (infer Linked Server) here : ...the bcp utility runs out-of-process. To move data across process memory spaces, bcp must use inter-process data marshaling. Inter-process data marshaling is the process of converting parameters of a method call into a stream of bytes. This can add significant load to the processor. However, because bcp [both] parses the data and [converts the] data into [the] native storage format in the client process, they can offload parsing and data conversion from the SQL Server process. ...bcp possibly isn't the most efficient means of transferring data. You might be better off to: Create a linked server instance to the other database Use INSERT statements, so that the tables are populated based on records from the database exposed in the linked server instance. Besides potentially being more efficient, you only need to setup the linked server instance once versus running BCP to create output scripts every time you want to move data. Mind that the linked server instance is based on a user on the other database, so permissions to the other database are based on that users' permissions.
