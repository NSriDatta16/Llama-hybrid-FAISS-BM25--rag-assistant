Since you said other suggestions are welcome I will post this as an answer rather than a comment. First I would ask yourself, What is the reasoning for the default images? Users have the ability to delete images from their photo library, if you are relying on these default images to be there, this is not a good solution. Will this feature upset users? As a user myself, I would be pretty annoyed if an app forced its own pictures into my album, unfortunately the iPhone doesn't allow good organizing of pictures on the device itself, making something like this even more annoying. Will this void Apple's EULA/TOS? I can very easily see your app being rejected by the reviewers for doing something like this. It's very intrusive so to speak and if it is possible to pull off without user acknowledgement I think it walks on the line of the "app sandbox" rule. Meaning your app needs to keep its data in it's own area.
