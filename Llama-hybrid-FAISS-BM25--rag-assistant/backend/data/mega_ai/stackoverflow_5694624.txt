You want to look for a space-filling-curve or spatial index. A sfc reduce the 2d complexity to a 1d complexity although it is just an reorderd of the surface. A sfc recursivley subdivide the surface into smaller tiles and keep picking information of the near by tiles. It can be compared with a quadtree. This can be usefull to compare images because you compare near by tiles. The difficult is then to make the tiles comparable. I believe a DCT can be useful here. You want to look for Nick's hilbert curve quadtree spatial index blog.
