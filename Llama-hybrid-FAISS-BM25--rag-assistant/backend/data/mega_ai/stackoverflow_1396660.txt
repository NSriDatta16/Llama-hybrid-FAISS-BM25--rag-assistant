You can try changing the Build Agent Service settings to log-on as a normal user account instead of SYSTEM (the default), this can be done from the services control panel (Start | Run | services.msc). If it doesn't help, you can also try configuring the appcmd to always run elevated, refer to this document for details. In case such option is not available for appcmd or it still doesn't work, you can disable UAC completely for this user.
