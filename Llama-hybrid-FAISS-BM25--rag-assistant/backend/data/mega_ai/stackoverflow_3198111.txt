How to use R Random forests to reduce attributes having no discrete classes?

I want to use Random forests for attribute reduction. One problem I have in my data is that I don't have discrete class - only continuous, which indicates how example differs from 'normal'. This class attribute is a kind of distance from zero to infinity. Is there any way to use Random forest for such data?
