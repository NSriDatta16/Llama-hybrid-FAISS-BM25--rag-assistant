Would I need to change my $ into sales numbers #? Ideally yes. Since this is not a unique product, how do I know if 600\$ is one 600\$ unit or 2 300$ units? Is there a Python package for crostons or do I have to use R? Right now there are not any good R packages for Croston's and similar intermittent methods. R offers better options. Is my assumption correct that ARIMA has issues with data structured like mine? Depends. ARIMA might work with the data in the top graph, but it won't work with the data in the bottom graph (or anything sparser than that). Croston's and it's newer versions (TSB, etc...) are a better option. But you need to keep in mind that such methods don't produce a normal forecast the way ARIMA or ETS does. They forecast a rate of sale (or velocity) which can then be used then to figure out average sales over a long period of time. You should also look at count predicting methods like Negative Binomial and Poisson distributions.
