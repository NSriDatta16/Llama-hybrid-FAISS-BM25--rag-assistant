The problem itself is essentially semantic segmentation or pixelwise classification . In this case, you're taking coarser labels and trying to extend them into a segmented pixelwise labeling. As such, the segmentation side is more important, I think. (And the more I think about it, the more I would recommend graph cuts (last paragraph).) Since you're attempting to create a neural network with these, there may be some oddities from biases whatever model you create has. Still, a neural network should be able to learn to be roughly as good and more generalizable, so it makes sense. It is a good idea to look into probabilistic graphical models such as conditional random fields. Perhaps a Gaussian mixture model classification of some sort is all you need, where the inputs are binned RGB(I) histograms. That will take a little experimentation on your part. However, simpler models may be good enough. I would even say a majority vote or nearest neighbor approach with superpixels would be suitable. Graph cuts is another method that may work, where the energy function would a function be how close it is to the center of the labeled block in color and physical space.
