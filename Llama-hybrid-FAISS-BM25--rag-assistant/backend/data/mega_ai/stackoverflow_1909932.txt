New SSL cert broke applications abilty to use WSDL

I am very new to SOAP and WSDL. The problem: SSL certifacte has been updated (renewed and upgraded to Extended Validation), and now vendors application is no longer able to post to databse though WSDL (certifacte error). My test case using soapUI works flawlessly (of course generated from the WSDL hosted on the server with the new certifacte). Vendor didn't change anything and doen't feel that they should have to. (and I do not think would know how). The Back story: I inherited this problem. The consultant before me used PowerBuilder to generate a WSDL (server component) that runs over https (as authentication is being used). The vendors application uses the WSDL to post trouble reports to a database. The SSL certificate expired and has of course now been replaced with a current one. The problem is that the vendor that has the application, that posts trouble reports to our database, now has a certificate error every time that they try to use the WSDL so they are not able to post to the database.. This makes sense as the client was generated against the WSDL using the old SSL certificate. All of my tests work as everything I generate by definition uses the new SSL certificate. The vendor has no idea how their application works, let alone how to fix it. (the are a "solution provider" that esentally just pulls together diffrent hardware and applications and stuffs them together without knowing how it all works.) I know next to nothing about their application, and they cannot/will not provide me with information or documentation. I work for a bunch of bureaucrats that are very non-technical, and I have a directive to solve this problem. Is there a way that I can update the client for them without knowing what the application is even written in? I can create a new WSDL using Visual Studio 2008 (C#), but again I would have no idea how to have them implement the changed WSDL. And the WSDL is not the actual issue anyway. Is there a way to force the client to update the SSL cert for the WSDL? I do not control the web-server that the WSDL is on, but I can write code and have the webmaster upload it. Technical details web server is Microsoft-IIS/6.0 the WSDL was generated in C# by PowerBuilder 10 XML C# code that generated the WSDL using System; class open_support_ticket { public static void Main(string[] args) { ///Create instance of n_application_name.dll n_application_name open_support_ticket = new n_application_name(); // get input //Console.Write("Enter domain_name: "); //string domain_name=Console.ReadLine(); // Console.Write("Enter Ticket # "); int app_ticket_number=Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); Console.Write("Enter Area ID # "); int area_id=Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); Console.Write("Enter Area Name "); string area_name=Console.ReadLine(); Console.Write("Enter Equipment Type "); string equipment_type=Console.ReadLine(); Console.Write("Enter equipment_id # "); int equipment_id=Convert.ToInt32(Console.ReadLine()); Console.Write("Enter Equipment Error "); string equipment_error=Console.ReadLine(); } } The WSDL (as seen from the web) XML that works to post to database (soapUI). https://server/maintenance/workorders/aplication_name/n_application_name.asmx?WSDL ]]> http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/ https://server/maintenance/workorders/application_name/n_application_name.asmx http://hostname:8088/mockn_application_nameSoap12 UTF-8 http://hostname:8088/mockn_application_nameSoap12 ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ]]> &lt;xml-fragment/> UTF-8 https://server/maintenance/workorders/application_name/n_application_name.asmx svcAPPLICAIONNME 7654321 123456 123C-AB123-1 Type of Equipment 42 Lteral Error ]]> svcAPPLICAIONNME BadPa55W0rd DOMAINNAME https://server/maintenance/workorders/application_name/n_application_name.asmx?WSDL ]]> http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/wsdl/ https://server/maintenance/workorders/application_name/n_application_name.asmx http://hostname:8088/mockn_application_nameSoap UTF-8 https://server/maintenance/workorders/application_name/n_application_name.asmx ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ]]> SEQUENTIAL n_application_nameSoap12 open_support_ticket UTF-8 https://server/maintenance/workorders/application_name/n_application_name.asmx svcAPPLICAIONNME 7654321 123456 Name-for-area Name of Equipment Type 42 Literal Error Message ]]> svcAPPLICAIONNME BadPa55W0rd DOMAINNAME SEQUENTIAL n_application_nameSoap open_support_ticket UTF-8 https://server/maintenance/workorders/application_name/n_application_name.asmx ? ? ? ? ? ? ? ]]> false SEQUENCE Response 1 ? ]]> false SEQUENCE Response 1 ? ]]> Any help would be appreceated.
