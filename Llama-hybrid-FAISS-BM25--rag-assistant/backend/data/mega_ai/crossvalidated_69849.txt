For our credit risk paper on predicting loan defaults, a reviewer also suggested we produce confidence intervals for cross validation estimates and in particular recommended bootstrapping of the resampled mean. Bootstrapped CIs were produced for risk ranking measures including the AUC, H -measure and the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic. They were used to compare discrimination performance of two survival models - Mixture Cure, Cox with logistic regression. It would be interesting to learn of other approaches to such CIs.
