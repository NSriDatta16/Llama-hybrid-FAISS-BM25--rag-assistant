Ajax Grid field grouping

I research modern Ajax Grids capable of grouping rows by fields (into collapsible sections), in a manner similar to ExtJs Grid grouping . Important requirements to such a grid is not only grouping, but sorting by multiple fields, e.g. by country and gender. Ideally user needs to be able to select fields to group by (sort by) dynamically. I don't expect grids to do it, but knowing that given Ajax grid at least allows to build such a feature would be good. Such a grid exists in ASP.Net world - http://demos.devexpress.com/ASPxGridViewDemos/GroupingSorting/Grouping.aspx - see it allows dynamic grouping by dragging required columns to upper bar. But as PHP developer I am not sure such thing exists as pure js-lib or as some PHP library. What are other grids, except ExtJs grid, that support flexible/nested/dynamic field grouping, for using it in PHP?
