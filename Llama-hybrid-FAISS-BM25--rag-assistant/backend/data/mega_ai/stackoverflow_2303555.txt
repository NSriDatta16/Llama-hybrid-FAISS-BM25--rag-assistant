Taking user input with pointers

I'm trying to get better at using pointers, and not using array notation. So I have a function to read user input and return a pointer to that array. I can do it like this and it seems to work ok: float *GetValues(float *p, size_t n) { float input; int i = 0; if ((newPtr = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float))) == NULL) { cout But then if I do this: float *GetValues(float *p, size_t n) { float *newPtr; float input; if ((newPtr = (float *)malloc(n * sizeof(float))) == NULL) { cout I get just 0s entered into p. Why is that? Also, do I have to allocate memory here for an array of size n? I first tried it with the method above using pointers and not allocating memory but just set p = to input and I was getting garbage values. Thanks! Edited: Sorry, I allocated a new ptr and was returning the wrong one like you said. I was just trying to input the numbers into my pointer and display it back on the screen to myself and wasn't paying attention to the return type and I was getting an output of 0 when I would cout
