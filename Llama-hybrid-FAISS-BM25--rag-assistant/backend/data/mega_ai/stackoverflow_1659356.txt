Although the suggestions were in place, there were also several things that were forgotten. Range of the REAL kind, and some formatting problems. Anyways, here's one patched up solution, compiled and working, so try to see if this will work for you. I've took the liberty of choosing my own method for fibonacci numbers calculation. program SO1658805 implicit none integer, parameter :: iwp = selected_real_kind(15,310) real(iwp) :: fi, fib integer :: i character(60) :: line character(1) :: digit integer :: n0=0, n1=0, n2=0, n3=0, n4=0, n5=0, n6=0, n7=0, n8=0, n9=0 open(unit=1, file='temp.txt', status='replace') rewind(1) !-------- calculating fibonacci numbers ------- fi = (1+5**0.5)/2. do i=0,1477 fib = (fi**i - (1-fi)**i)/5**0.5 write(1,*)fib,i end do !---------------------------------------------- rewind(1) do i=0,1477 read(1,'(a)')line line = adjustl(line) write(*,'(a)')line read(line,'(a1)')digit if(digit.eq.' ') n0=n0+1 if(digit.eq.'1') n1=n1+1 if(digit.eq.'2') n2=n2+1 if(digit.eq.'3') n3=n3+1 if(digit.eq.'4') n4=n4+1 if(digit.eq.'5') n5=n5+1 if(digit.eq.'6') n6=n6+1 if(digit.eq.'7') n7=n7+1 if(digit.eq.'8') n8=n8+1 if(digit.eq.'9') n9=n9+1 end do close(1) write(*,'("Total number of different digits")') write(*,'("Number of digits 0: ",i5)')n0 write(*,'("Number of digits 1: ",i5)')n1 write(*,'("Number of digits 2: ",i5)')n2 write(*,'("Number of digits 3: ",i5)')n3 write(*,'("Number of digits 4: ",i5)')n4 write(*,'("Number of digits 5: ",i5)')n5 write(*,'("Number of digits 6: ",i5)')n6 write(*,'("Number of digits 7: ",i5)')n7 write(*,'("Number of digits 8: ",i5)')n8 write(*,'("Number of digits 9: ",i5)')n9 read(*,*) end program SO1658805 Aw, ... I just read you need the number of digits stored in to an array. While I just counted them. Oh well, ... "left as an exercise for the reader ..." :-)
