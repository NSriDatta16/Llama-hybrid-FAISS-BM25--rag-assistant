Can I remove seasonal autocorrelation through aggregation?

I have monthly time series data and there is autocorrelation? I can solve for this using lagged dependent variables and other methods and other models, then aggregate into annual terms. However, I need to summarize my forecast results into annual terms. So I am wondering whether I aggregate the data first, which seems to remove seasonality and autocorrelation and use an annual time series model instead? I understand I will lose information but is there any problem statistically with running regressions on an annual basis rather than a monthly basis?
