I didn't expect to be answering my own question, but after 2 days of mind bending pain and a weekend to experiment it seems this is the problem: The tutorial and my examples should work, but there seems to be a minor flaw in the way phpdoc interprets the switch values . Here is what I've been using: phpdoc -o HTML:Smarty:HandS -d "/path/to/code/classes/", "/path/to/code/docs/tutorials/" -t /path/to/output However if you use the following: phpdoc -o HTML:Smarty:HandS -d /path/to/code/classes/, /path/to/code/docs/tutorials/ -t /path/to/output It will correctly format your tutorials and extending docs, all I did was drop the double quotes surrounding the directory paths. Single quotes don't work at all - as phpdoc itself wraps the directories in double quotes if there are no spaces ... this does seem like a bug with phpdoc, and the same behaviour occurred with the web based interface, so its an internal issue. my original attempt should have worked but didn't I will contact the developers and bring it to their attention. Problem solved.
