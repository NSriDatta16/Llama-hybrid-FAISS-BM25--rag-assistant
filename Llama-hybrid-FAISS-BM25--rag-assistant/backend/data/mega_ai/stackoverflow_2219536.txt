Can any one please suggest any good Network share explorer WebPart in SharePoint where in it provides all basic features like expand-collapse network share folders in left pane and containing files/folder in right pane, Drag and drop feature, Cut and or copy - Paste feature... I really appreciate any help. Nikhil.
