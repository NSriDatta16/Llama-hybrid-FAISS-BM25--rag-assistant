I'm not sure what large amounts of data you need to delete. But if it is "old" data that you need to periodically delete, you may look into using MERGE tables. You can create a MERGE table out of any MyISAM tables that have an identical structure. For example, you could create a table for each calendar quarter. At the end of each quarter, you create a new, empty table and redeclare the tables that make up the MERGE table. So the MERGE table always has the past years worth of data. If your code always references the MERGE table, you won't need to change anything when "migrating" data. Redeclaring the UNION tables of a MERGE table is nearly instantaneous. That's just an example, but you can separate your data any way you like. http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/merge-storage-engine.html
