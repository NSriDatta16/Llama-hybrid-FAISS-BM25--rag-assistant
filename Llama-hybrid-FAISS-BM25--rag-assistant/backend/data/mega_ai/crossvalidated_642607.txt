Its funny that this question is yet to be answered correctly, despite of the additional clarification provided. I want to use PCA to avoid using correlated variables in the GLM. However, PCA gives me output like .2 variable1 + .5 variable3 etc. I'm used to just putting variables 1 and 3 into the GLM. So since PCA gives me a linear combination, should I for example put that into the GLM as a new variable (to account for systematic variation in the response by variables 1 and 3)? The answer is yes, you are supposed to use the linear combination because the values corresponding to each linear combination (or each PC component) are uncorrelated. Although how many components you use is entirely up to you.
