Statistical test for forecasting models

I developed many forecasting models over the same dataset (multiple iteration of simulated time series data). My dataset basically is a multivariate timeseries so the forecasting models forecast many values at the same time. My question is how can I decide which forecasting model is better. I already have calculated the MSE and MAE for each model, but I want to compare them statically. I read about Diebold Mariano test but I think it used for comparing forecasts not models. I also thought of t-test for dependent data but am not sure how can I apply it in my case where I have many models (more than two) I appreciate your help.
