OK, time to try to answer this as the comments section is getting a bit out of control and not really helping us clarify things. First, I would suggest you put aside all questions of finding cohorts and clusters, and all the machine learning terminology, and buy yourself a text book on basic statistics and surveys and their analysis. Second you should go back to your actual business problem. I simply don't believe that it is to find clusters of respondents defined by a combination of six variables out of 32. Your real business problem is probably one of: "given the various characteristics of a new individual against up to 32 variables, what will be their attitude towards each of my products?" This makes it an individual prediction problem; OR "which demographics should I market each of my products to?" This makes it a problem of identifying the most important factors in explaining the NPS score. In either of those cases, the basic toolkit is going to be a statistical model with attitude to each product as the response variable, and the up to 32 other variables as explanatory variables. As you have the underlying data that has been summarised in the NPS score, you should use that as your response variable - it has much more information in it that the simple NPS score, and in this situation you want to use all the information you can get. Unfortunately the strategy for determining the best model is difficult and fraught with conceptual pitfalls for the inexperienced, and the type of model you need is not taught in a basic stats course. I would recommend Harrell's Regression Modeling Strategies as a guide, but you will need to get some more basic stats before you are ready for this. Frankly, you are probably best off getting a statistician to do the work for you. On the positive side, the numerical and computational problems are all solved and the problems you started with - length of time to the computations etc - will all vanish. If you really want to go the self learning route, then look for articles on ordinal regression. The free open source stats environment R has an implementation.
