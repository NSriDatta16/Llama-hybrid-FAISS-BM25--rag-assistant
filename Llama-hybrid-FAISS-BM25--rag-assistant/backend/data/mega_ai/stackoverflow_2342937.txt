If the language isn't optimized by the compiler, recursion is very likely to be slower than iteration, because on top of descending down given lane, which is pretty much equivalent to iteration, you have to backtrace your steps back to top upon finishing the job. Otherwise, it is pretty much equivalent, except it may be much more elegant, as you let the compiler and system handle the loop behind the scenes. And of course there are tasks (like processing tree-like structures) where recursion is the only way (or at least the only that isn't hopelessly convoluted).
