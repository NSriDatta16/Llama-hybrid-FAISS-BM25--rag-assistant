What models do Create ML and Turi Create use

I'm taking a course on Apple's machine learning technologies. I just came across this paragraph: Turi Create and Create ML are task-specific, rather than model-specific. This means that you specify the type of problem you want to solve, rather than choosing the type of model you want to use. You select the task that matches the type of problem you want to solve, then Turi Create analyzes your data and chooses the right model for the job. My question is when you select a task like binary image classification, and Create ML / Turi Create selects an appropriate model for you, what models does it have at its disposal. Aren't there MANY models in the market that do this? Did Apple simply pick the one they thought was best? Thanks!
