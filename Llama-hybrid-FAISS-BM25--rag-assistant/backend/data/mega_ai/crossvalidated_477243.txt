What does it mean if magnitude of the variance of each measurement is allowed to be a function of its predicted value?

To better understand Logistic Regression and why it is called regression still, I was reading about Generalized Linear Models on Wikipedia, and I came across the below statement: "The GLM generalizes linear regression by allowing the linear model to be related to the response variable via a link function and by allowing the magnitude of the variance of each measurement to be a function of its predicted value." I am not quite sure I understand the latter part as highlighted in the question. Is it possible this can be clarified for me please?
