This is known as a few-shot or one-shot classification problem, which is a widely studied problem setup, also in audio machine learning. The key to this task is generally to have a strong data representation, where the classes of interest is easily separable. Usually this is done using a pre-trained neural network, trained on a large/general audio dataset. Some starting points could be PANNs, YAMNet or OpenL3. Your overall approach is valid, but a major challenge in your case would be to avoid overfitting on the single test set and contaminating your results. I would recommend two things: 1) split the test set recording into a validation set, used for hyperparameter tuning 2) construct another dataset to form a similar task. And use that for all early experimentation.
