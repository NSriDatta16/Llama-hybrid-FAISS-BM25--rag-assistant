How to send and receive headers via PHP

I'd like to study how headers are sent and received. I know about PHP's header function and think I can just look at an actual request header (e.g. using Firebug) and make identical requests to a server (including spoofing the User-Agent). Is this correct? The other problem is how do I get the header responses back? I want to analyze the response. Thanks. EDIT: @Tatu, here's the code I ran: $ch = curl_init(); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_URL, "http://www.google.com/"); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_HEADER, 0); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_RETURNTRANSFER, 1); curl_setopt($ch, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, 'Mozilla/5.0 (X11; U; Linux x86_64; en-US) AppleWebKit/540.0 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu/10.10 Chrome/8.1.0.0 Safari/540.0'); $result = curl_exec($ch); curl_close($ch); header('Content-type: text/plain'); echo($result);
