R:how to use random forests to predict binary outcome when features are super-sparse?

Consider this outcome df outcome string 1 1 I love pasta 2 0 hello world 3 0 1+1 = 2 4 1 pasta madness 5 1 pizza madness Here I would like to use random forests to understand which words in the sentences contained in the string variable are strong predictors of the outcome variable. Someone suggested to use the randomForest package library(dplyr) library(tidyr) outcome % mutate(string=strsplit(string,split=" ")) %>% unnest(string) library(randomForest) mm Problem is: my original dataset is much larger. Think of the string column as a short english sentence of 5/6 words. The full dataset has 800k observations. Here, randomForest fails because of obvious memory issues. What would be an alternative algorithm for my classification purpose? Many thanks!
