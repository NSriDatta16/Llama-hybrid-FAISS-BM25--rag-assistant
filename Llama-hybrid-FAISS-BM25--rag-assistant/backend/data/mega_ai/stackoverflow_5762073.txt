Problem Attaching internal file to GMail in my android app

My app writes data to text files (on sd card and internal memory). Later the app emails the text files to a list of people. I am having trouble getting gmail to attach a file that is pulled from the internal application files area. 'Native Android mail' can attach a file from either internal or SD card area with no problem. Gmail will attach a file if it's from SD card, but won't attach a file if its located in internal storage. // this sends a file from SD - works for android mail and gmail Intent jj=new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_SEND); String fileName = "file://" + Environment.getExternalStorageDirectory()+"/aFolder/externalfile.txt" jj.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, Uri.parse(fileName)); jj.setType("text/plain"); Intent chooser = Intent.createChooser(jj , "Select Sender"); startActivity(chooser); // this sends an internal file-works for android mail, but no attachment sent with gmail Intent jj=new Intent(android.content.Intent.ACTION_SEND); String fileName = "file://" + getFilesDir().toString() + "/internalfile.txt"; jj.putExtra(Intent.EXTRA_STREAM, Uri.parse(fileName)); jj.setType("text/plain"); Intent chooser = Intent.createChooser(jj , "Select Sender"); startActivity(chooser); Any suggestions? Do I need to give Gmail special permission somehow? My attachments are all text files - written by the app. Internal files were created with openFileOutput(myFile,32769) Thanks John D
