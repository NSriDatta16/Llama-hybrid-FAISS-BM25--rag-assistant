Let's assume you are writing a program that is modeling an auto repair garage. You need a class that represents an automobile. Further this garage wants to know whether or not the car needs an oil change. you might add getters for public int getMiles() and public Date getLastOilChange() -- this seems fine two getters that allow a calling program to get information about the car. Now the garage class can call these methods to figure out whether the car needs an oil change. But this is wrong. The garage does not need or want to know anything about these two pieces of information. All the garage class needs to know about is public boolean needsOilChange() And so you are exposing implementation details that the garage doesn't need to know about. Perhaps a type of car in the future doesn't use this information to determine whether an oil change is needed, maybe some other mechanism is used. The garage class would have to be rewritten if it used the two methods above. On the other hand, if it used the needsOilChange() method it wouldn't have to.
