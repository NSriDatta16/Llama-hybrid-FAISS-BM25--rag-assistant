While verbatim might be the best choice, you can also try the commands \smallskip , \medskip or guess what, \bigskip . Quoting from this page : These commands can only be used after a paragraph break (which is made by one completely blank line or by the command \par). These commands output flexible or rubber space, approximately 3pt, 6pt, and 12pt high respectively, but these commands will automatically compress or expand a bit, depending on the demands of the rest of the page
