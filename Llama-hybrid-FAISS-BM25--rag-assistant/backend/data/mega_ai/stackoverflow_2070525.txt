You're asking about the backend storage sorting of the image, on a filesystem, right? I would organize it like this: imagefolder/user.id/image.jpg Because it's much more simpler than doing something like year/mont/day/thread.. -- Just seen the update. For your database part, I would say you don't really need to save it in a separate table. If you save a thread's posts in a row, you can save html in there and provide some window where a user can check which images he want to insert / upload. this writes the according html tag relative to the saved position. So basically just an extension of an editor like stackoverflow has here. Saving images / paths in relation to posts/threads is only necessary if you need to store additional data with it, e.g. creation time, comments, ratings etc.
