Where Are Statisticians Going?

There is an interesting thread I was reading here , discussing the "future of statistics." This got me thinking about the future careers which may be in-demand and future careers which may be created for statisticians. Originally, academia and mathematics were the careers of choice. Then, Wall Street adapted probability and statistics through fixed income products, and later algorithmic trading. After that, Silicon Valley scooped up the statistically-inclined for machine learning and algorithm development. This shift in demand was (relatively) rapid, ocurring over the past 50 years or so, after the development of Black-Scholes-Merton model in 1973. Since then, demand for an understanding of advanced statistics has skyrocketed, and many careers were created from this new demand. It is likely that many new types of jobs will be created in the near-future, and that some antiquated industries will evolve to incorporate the use of statistics. In your expert opinion, where do you think most statisticians will be working in 15-20 years from now? What sorts of new jobs will be created to involve the analytically-minded?
