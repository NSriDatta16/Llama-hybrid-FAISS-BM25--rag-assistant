What if you swap a relational database for an object oriented one? I think that this should be possible with JDO. Actually, in my memory, JDO was elaborated and promoted by OODMBS vendors and I see this standard as a kind of unified way to interact with OODBMS (and the master plan was in two steps: first, Dear customer, use my JDO implementation for persistence and then Dear customer, replace your Oracle/Sybase/Whatever database with my Versant database ). But I wouldn't define JDO as an "ORM", it's more a transparent object persistence standard (that can act as an ORM tool when the storage system is a relational - the R in ORM - database).
