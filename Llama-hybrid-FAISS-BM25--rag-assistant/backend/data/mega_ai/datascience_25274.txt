Twitter has rules that limit sharing of complete datasets, instead limiting sharing to the tweet ids (see this discussion and the developer agreement ). Tools such as twarc can be used to "rehydrate" the tweet metadata by calling the Twitter api and retrieving the info. The Twitter API has rate limiting which can make this a somewhat slow process. For a package that works in R, see RTextTools or check out RWeka which bridges the gap between R and Java to use Weka. If using Python, you can also use scikit-learn's svm implementation.
