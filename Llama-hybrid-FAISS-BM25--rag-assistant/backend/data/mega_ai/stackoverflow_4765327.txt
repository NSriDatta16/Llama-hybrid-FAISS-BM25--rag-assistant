How can objective C classes be encrypted

I would like to encrypt a few of my obj c classes in my iphone game which handle openfeint data and classes which handle scores. I have heard there is a way to encrypt this data to act as another level of security, at least enough to discourage some from cracking it and forging scores on a jailbroken iphone and then spam the leaderboards. How is this done, what are good techniques to secure this data and discourage some from attempting to spoof data? Thanks
