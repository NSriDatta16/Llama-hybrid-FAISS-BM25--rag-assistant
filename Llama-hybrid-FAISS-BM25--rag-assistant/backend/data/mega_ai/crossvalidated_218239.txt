Short answer: it will all depend on your loss-functions . For instance, I do forecasting for replenishment in retail stores, like supermarkets or drugstores. The only forecast that is important in this context is a high quantile, because we don't want to replenish based on average demand , but to attain a high service level . (This is not always easy to communicate to our clients.) Other use cases may indeed be most interested in getting the expectation right, so the MSE would indeed be useful (but see below). You may want to look at the tag wikis for some prediction error measures, like the mae , mape or mase , all of which are minimized in expectation for different functionals of the true future distribution. And of course you should still look at your errors to see whether there is any remaining structure you could exploit to improve your algorithms or models. Method A may have a lower MSE than method B on average - but it may completely (and unacceptably) break down in certain rare cases. In such a case, you want to investigate why it breaks down in such cases and hopefully improve it. (I have found that not only looking at average errors, but also at high quantiles of errors is often helpful.) Finally, of course, if you are not predicting numerically, but classifying, then MSE is pretty much meaningless, and you need to look into confusion matrices and base your [tags:loss-functions] on false positive and false negative rates and similar concepts.
