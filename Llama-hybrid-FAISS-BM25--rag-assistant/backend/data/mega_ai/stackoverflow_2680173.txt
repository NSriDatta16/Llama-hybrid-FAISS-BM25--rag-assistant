If the text is all in that format (: followed by a space) you can probably just say: $str = explode(": ", $pattern); echo($str[1]); It's not the most elegant solution per-se and I have no idea if this is incredibly slow, but it works for most things. Unless you're hell bent on using regular expressions that is.
