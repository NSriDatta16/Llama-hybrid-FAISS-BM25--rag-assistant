MySQL Using Subquery To Get Table Name?

I'm trying to select some data from a MySQL database. I have a table containing business details, and a seperate one containing a list of trades. As we have multiple trades business_details id | business_name | trade_id | package_id 1 | Happy News | 12 | 1 This is the main table, contains the business name, the trade ID and the package ID shop_trades id | trade 1 | newsagents This contains the trade type of the business configuration_packages id | name_of_trade_table 1 | shop_trades 2 | leisure_trades This contains the name of the trade table to look in So, basically, if I want to find the trade type (e.g., newsagent, fast food, etc) I look in the XXXX_trades table. But I first need to look up the name of XXXX from the configuration_packages table. What I would normally do is 2 SQL queries: SELECT business_details.*, configuration_packages.name_of_trade_table FROM business_details, configuration_packages WHERE business_details.package_id = configuration_packages.id AND business_details.id = '1' That gives me the name of the database table to look in for the trade name, so I look up the name of the table SELECT trade FROM XXXX WHERE id='YYYY' Where XXXX is the name of the table returned as part of the first query and YYYY is the id of the package, again returned from the first query. Is there a way to combine these two queries so that I only run one? I've used subqueries before, but only on the SELECT side of the query - not the FROM side.
