When you are running an analysis with only an intercept, does it make sense to include random subject and item intercepts?

Lets image a study where people get two shapes and are told to pick one. They each get 40 trials, each with a different shape/colour. There are 40 different pairs of shapes. There are 100 participants. The DV is how often they choose the left one. (This isn't my study, just an example.) I want to know if they choose the left shape more often than chance. The intercept of a logistic regression model tells me this. If all I have in the model is the intercept, is it sensible to include a random subject and item intercept? I did out of habit, but now that I think of it, it seems to not make much sense. If it does make sense can you explain why? Edit: Let me add that there is another analysis in which each person only received two trials. On this analysis, including a random subject intercept increases the intercept value by almost five times. I'm struggling to get my head around this. How can a random subject intercept lead to such a larger intercept? How does the model "know" what to do with that variance in subjects, whether it is genuine or not. Edit: Output for the models in which participants only got two trials, one that included a random subject intercept and one that did not. Edit: I still find it hard to really grasp how the inclusion of a subject intercept changes the actual estimate of the intercept to such an extent. As I understand it, the random intercept tells the model that some people tend to score really high, and some people tend to score really low, and it models the variance in this difference. But what sort of information in that variance could "tell" the model that the overall intercept should be higher? I can imagine how that variance in subjects' intercepts would alter the p-value; but I don't totally understand it changing the intercept itself.
