The latest Xcode+SDK drop doesn't know about iOS 4.2.1, because it was published before the latest patch came out. Xcode's Organizer has a new feature that tries to download debug support files directly from the device, but apparently it has some (possibly jailbreak-related) issues for some people. iOS 4.2.1 is similar enough to 4.2 that Xcode can be coerced to use 4.2 support files to debug on 4.2.1 devices. To do this, simply go to the /Developer/Platforms/iPhoneOS.platform/DeviceSupport folder and manually copy the Symbols subfolder and/or the DeveloperDiskImage.* files from 4.2 (8C134) to 4.2.1 (8C148) (or whatever release folder Organizer creates for your device).
