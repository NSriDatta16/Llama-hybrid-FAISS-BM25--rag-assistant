You are using the fixed effects model, or also within model. This regression model eliminates the time invariant fixed effects through the within transformation (i.e., subtract the average through time of a variable to each observation on that variable). And probably you are making confusion between individual and time fixed effects. Time fixed effects change through time, while individual fixed effects change across individuals. Think of time fixed effects as a series of time specific dummy variables. For example, the dummy variable for year1992 = 1 when t=1992 and 0 when t!=1992. You see immediately that if you take the average of year1992 through time, it will be The thing is different for individual fixed effect. Also in this case, think of individual dummy variables. For example, the dummy for individual j = 1 along the whole time period you are considering. The average of j is exactly 1, you subtract its average through time and sim-sala-bim...it is eliminated by the within transformation. Therefore, you won't get an estimate of the effect of being individual j.
