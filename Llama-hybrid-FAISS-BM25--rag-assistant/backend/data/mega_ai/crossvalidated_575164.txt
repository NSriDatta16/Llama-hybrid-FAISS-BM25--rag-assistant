Basically, your data consists of multivariate timeseries. Since you have a time-varying dimension, you are looking at a few models that can do that. 1D Convolutional Neural Networks: convolutions are applied in the time dimension. Then usual pooling operations are used to reduce the dimensionality to a single output. Recurrent Neural Networks: RNNs are applied and you either keep the last (in time) output or pool across the whole time dimension. It's very usual to use Bi-directional RNNs here as well. Transformers: Attention layers are used to obtain new time-distributed representations. You can then pool as usual, or use attention itself to obtain a single vector-representation for the whole sequence. If the timeseries are aligned (like, for example, all multivariate timeseries represent a process after a trigger/stimulus onset), then you can also use Functional Data Analysis (FDA) tools. These are usually based on basis expansion of the data itself.
