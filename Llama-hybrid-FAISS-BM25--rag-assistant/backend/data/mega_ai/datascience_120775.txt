How can I get tortoise-tts to pronounce acronyms correctly?

I'm trying to get tortoise-tts to pronounce acronyms correctly. Example of text that I'd like tortoise-tts to generate an audio file for: OpenAI ChatGPT is a new language model . The audio file generated by tortoise-tts is: OpenAI Chat is a new language model (GPT is missing from the audio file ). I can replace ChatGPT with Chat gee pee tee but I've had a case where the jee pee tee changes the tone of the audio file. Questions: Is replacing ChatGPT with Chat gee pee tee the most optimal solution? If it is the most optimal solution, is there any convenient script to replace acronyms with their pronounced version (GPT->jee pee tee)? If it is not the most optimal solution, what is the most optimal solution?
