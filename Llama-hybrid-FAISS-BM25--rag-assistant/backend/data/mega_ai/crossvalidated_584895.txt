If the average ratings you have are based on thousands of responses, it is virtually certain that the differences are statistically reliable (i.e., statistically significant) and not due to chance or random fluctuation. The question then is are these differences practically meaningful. I suggest you use a two prong approach to reach an opinion on the question of meaningfulness of the differences in which you have an interest. First, look at the rating scale. What are the definitions of the rating scale anchors for 3 and 4. If one anchor is "acceptable"and the other "less than acceptable" that gives some meaning to the means of 3.5 and 4.1. Second, if you know anything about any two of the products that were rated, you might be able to say that the difference between these two known products is this big, so any other difference of that size has some meaning in terms of what you know about the two known products.
