Adding buttons for HTML elements to the Sitecore rich text editor

I would like to add a button to the Sitecore rich text editor toolbar, specifically one that inserts the H2 element. I know the H2 element can be inserted using the paragraph styles pulldown menu, but all my editors are now using the bold button for their headings because they don't "see" the paragraph styles pulldown. So, I want to make the H2 easily available using a toolbar button. (And maybe even removing the bold buttons, since it's not semantic at all.) But no matter how I go through the documentation, I cannot find a good explanation on how to do this.
