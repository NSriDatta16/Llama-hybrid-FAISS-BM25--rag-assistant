Chances are that your weights came from a continuous measure of BMI. Hence you should not categorize it for statistical analysis, and you should just directly use BMI as a continuous outcome: this gives your statistical test more power to detect a difference in average BMI pre/post intervention. If there's no control group, you can just use a paired t-test to determine differences, however that test is biased by design due to the Hawthorne effect. Is there a control group in these data?
