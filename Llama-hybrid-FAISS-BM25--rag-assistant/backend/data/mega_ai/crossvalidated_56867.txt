I am not sure why you were looking at correlations and similar measures. There doesn't seem to be anything to correlate. Instead, there are a number of options, none really better than the other, but depending on what you want: Take the average rank and then rank the averages (but this treats the data as interval) Take the median rank and then rank the medians (but this may result in ties) Take the number of 1st place votes each item got, and rank them based on this Take the number of last place votes and rank them (inversely, obviously) based on that. Create some weighted combination of ranks, depending on what you think reasonable.
