Informative prior for a binomial proportion close to one (or zero)

I want to do inference on a binomial proportion, which I have reason to believe a priori is close to one. Let's say my prior expectation is 0.98. I'd like to do incremental updating of my beliefs as Bayesian inference allows me to, and I'd like to be able to calculate quantities such as the (posterior) probability that the binomial parameter is greater than 0.95. The question is how to parameterise my prior such that my posterior inferences are not invalidated by a beta distribution with a parameter less than 1. This would happen if I, for instance, observed 10 data points all of which were successes. In this case I'd have a posterior which was: $\theta | data \sim Beta(\alpha + 10, \beta)$. To ensure this behaved in a sensible way, I'd need to use a prior effective sample size of at least 50, which feels somewhat limiting as my prior beliefs might not be quite this strong. Can I resolve this quandary while retaining simple (not expensive) iterative posterior inference? Am I being limited by the choice of the conjugate prior?
