I would use a Java API that wraps libpcap . libpcap has an "inject" function that allows you to send a raw packet. (Of course, you must have root or administrator priveleges on the machine you're trying to send the packet from.) There are a number of Java APIs that are available, such as jNetPcap or jpacp . jpcap, for example, has a class that allows you to send any packet .
