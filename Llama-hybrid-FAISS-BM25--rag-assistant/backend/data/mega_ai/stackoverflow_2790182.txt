Thank you for your responses. They were helpful in further diagnosing why it wasn't working. It turns out that everything does work and that the 401.1 response was misleading (but correct). Our problem was due to a change in the web services directory structure. Had I been paying better attention, I might have caught it before asking this question. To answer my question: Yes. A .Net 1.1 client can call a .Net 2.0 web service and, in general, no additional configuration is necessary. Just make sure you're URI is correct.
