Where is the setCouponCode function is defined in Magento

I know that setCouponCode is catch inside __call in Varien_Object but I can't figure out where it is defined. I need it because I want to show the coupon code even if the discount equal zero. I believed it's done inside this function. So if anybody know where the function is defined or where I can modify the code to get the coupon code displayed all the time, please let me know.
