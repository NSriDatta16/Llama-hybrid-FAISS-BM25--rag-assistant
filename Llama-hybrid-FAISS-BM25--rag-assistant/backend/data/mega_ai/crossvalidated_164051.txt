This is a potential answer to the title of the original question and not necessarily the body of the question... Looking at the Agresti confidence interval measurement, to my eyes it bears a resemblance to a Bayesian estimator. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binomial_proportion_confidence_interval#Agresti-Coull_Interval Looking at p = 1/n * ( X + 1/2 * z^2), I suspect the 1/2 could be considered Bayesian prior knowledge. Letâ€™s say for example, that one conducts a congressional approval poll and historically those polls have an approval rating of 0.35. Using a Bayesian train of thought perhaps one could use that information as prior knowledge and feed it in by using 0.35 instead of the 1/2 coefficient? I suspect one could do so successfully.
