Fatal error: Call to a member function setActive() on a non-object

I am getting the following error on the backend of Magento: Fatal error: Call to a member function setActive() on a non-object in /var/www/vhosts/pro-pin.ca/httpdocs/app/code/core/Mage/Adminhtml/Controller/Action.php on line 82 I've gone through the community forum, but found out that this was due to the magic slider or lightbox extensions. I haven't had this problem on any other server. Any help please..
