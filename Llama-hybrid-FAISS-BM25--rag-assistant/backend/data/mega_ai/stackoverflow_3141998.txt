Here is a simple super pragmatic solution: First split your text file into smaller files, perhaps with something like 10,000 entries in each file. Lets call them numbers_x.queue. Create a threadpool based app where each thread processes the files using the following steps: Look for a file called numbers_x.done if it exists find the last full number in it. If you found a .done file scan through numbers_x.queue to position yourself at the number after the last in the .done file. Read a number from the .queue file Do your web api calls Do your logging Append the number to the .done file If the .queue file is not at the end yet, goto 3 Delete the queue file, then the done file Grab another unprocessed .queue file and continue from 1 While this is a pretty crude approach, it is super easy to implement, pretty fault tolerant and you can easily split the .queue files between a set of servers and have them work in parallel.
