How to reverse PCA and reconstruct original variables from several principal components?

Principal component analysis (PCA) can be used for dimensionality reduction. After such dimensionality reduction is performed, how can one approximately reconstruct the original variables/features from a small number of principal components? Alternatively, how can one remove or discard several principal components from the data? In other words, how to reverse PCA? Given that PCA is closely related to singular value decomposition (SVD), the same question can be asked as follows: how to reverse SVD?
