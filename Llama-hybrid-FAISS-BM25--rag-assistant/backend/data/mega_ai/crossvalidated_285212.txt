Best way to aggregate a set of observations over overlapping time ranges into a time series?

A data manipulation I commonly need to perform involves creating a time series by aggregating a quantity which was sampled over many overlapping time ranges. For example, consider the following contrived data on movie times and attendance at a movie theater: | Movie ID | Movie Start Time | Movie End Time | Attendance | |----------+------------------+----------------+------------| | Movie 1 | 0:00 | 2:00 | 30 | | Movie 2 | 1:00 | 3:00 | 40 | Treating all time intervals as half-closed on the left, like [Start time, End time) , I'd like to compute the total attendance at the theater as a time series, i.e., | Time | Total Attendance | |------+------------------| | 0:00 | 30 | | 1:00 | 70 | | 2:00 | 20 | | 3:00 | 0 | What is this type of manipulation called? Is there a way to do this efficiently, preferably in a Python/pandas environment?
