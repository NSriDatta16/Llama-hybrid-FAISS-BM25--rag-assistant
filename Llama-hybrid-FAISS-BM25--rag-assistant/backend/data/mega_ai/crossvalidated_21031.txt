Undergrad Stat Major here. I'm interested in your question, but am no expert. Experts, do please correct me where I'm wrong. So it sounds like the current criteria for selection are subjective, and possibly nondeterministic (e.g. the same application may be accepted one day and not another for no apparent reason). That sounds difficult, if not impossible, to quantify in any meaningful way. You've got a complicated situation, but I think you need to first analyze what you're trying to achieve. It sounds like you'd like to do 2 different things: come up with a way to quantify the process that you think can be relied on to make "fair" decisions, and determine whether the current system is "fair" in some respect The first is "model building". You take what you know and build a model of how you think the selection process works, or how it should work ideally. This depends on what you think is fair, based on what you value in these applications. In other words, maybe perfect equality in acceptance isn't "fair" if it does not favor those who are more valuable to your organization. Maybe you value number of articles a lot more than you do years of experience. I'd recommend coming up an idea of how valuable features are relative to each other, building models based on that, and seeing if you like the results based on how your models would decide acceptance based on sample applications. When you have a result you think is "fair", you've probably got a decent model for your purpose. The second thing you want to accomplish involves generating hypotheses about what you think is fair (i.e. building ideal models), and testing past results based on those models to see how they match up. You can also perform regressions against the data from the current selection process to see which features are significant and which are not. Simple correlation data would paint a nice picture to begin with, but performing some formal variable selection and regressions would be the next step in analysis.
