Are non-zero paddings used?

I currently tried to figure out which paddings are directly supported by the frameworks: Tensorflow ( tf.nn.conv2d ): padding='VALID' : No padding padding='SAME' : 0-padding such that the output has the same size as the input By applying tf.pad and then padding='VALID' one can get reflect and symmetric padding. Lasagne ( lasagne.layers.Conv2DLayer ) (and probably also Theano): pad='full' : A variant of 0-padding which results in a bigger image pad='same' : Like SAME for TF pad='valid' : Like SAME for TF Caffe ( docs ): I have no idea which padding they support. As pad_h and pad_w seem to be in convolution_param , I guess padding is supported. Probably (only?) zero-padding. Hence my question: Are there publications where CNNs with padding, which was neither VALID nor SAME , or not 0-padding, was used? For example, I know of the following other options: reflect nearest both of them might have the advantage, that the filter does not detect a border, where no border is.
