Say $X$ and $Y$ are your variables. The end goal will be to determine whether there exists a function $f$ satisfying $f(X) = Y$ to some degree of accuracy. Linear regression could possibly yield the function $f$, but it is not likely due to the fact that $f$ is restricted to be linear. You should instead consider methods for non-linear regression. You mention dividing the variables into tertiles or quartiles and attempting logistic regression. This approach attempts to reach the same goal, but the relationship in the end will be weaker. It is recommended to try this if non-linear regression works poorly.
