What's the expected average time

We have the following situation: We are trying to find the path to a coffee shop. We have 3 streets when we exit our home and only one takes us to the coffee shop. If we take the 1st street, we make 20 min until the coffee shop. If we take the 2nd street, we will make 40 min and it will takes us back home. If we choose the 3rd street we will make 60 min and it will takes us back home. We choose a street randomnly and hope it will take us at the coffee shop. We can't rely on previous experiences when choosing a door. What is the expected average time in minutes to get to the coffee shop? Thanks!
