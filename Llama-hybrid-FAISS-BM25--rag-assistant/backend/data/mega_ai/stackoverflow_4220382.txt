It ain't easy, at least not to get it all. You might look at the metadata removal package called Metadact by Litera (formerly Softwise). There are several others out on the market too. If you want to do it yourself, first, you'll need to decide on what you consider "metadata". Some is pretty easy to get to using the Word Object Model (Interop from C# or VB). Some can't be accessed via Word, so you'll need to use the Structured Storage API to get at it (Like last 10 authors). If you're talking about DOCX files, you can use the OpenXML SDK to get at all the packages inside the file. then use XML to navigate and edit out the bits you don't want. Going that way, though, it's MUCH harder to remove "metadata" in the content of the document, because you'll have to deal with internal Word structures like RUNs, and change tracking stuff.
