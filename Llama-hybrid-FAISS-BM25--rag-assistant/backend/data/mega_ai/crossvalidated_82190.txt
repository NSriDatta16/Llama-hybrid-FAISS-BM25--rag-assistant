Not particularly. The sigmoid function has interesting mathematical properties. In particular, the sigmoid is the link function for the generalized linear model for binomial response data. Logistic regression as a special case existed before the advent of theory surrounding GLMs. GLMs greatly codify this, however. The relationship between the mean-variance structure and the score equations for the logistic regression model give the log-odds ratio as the natural parameter to a sigmoid-linear mean model. To understand this, it would help to review the McCullagh Nelder text "Generalized Linear Models", 2nd ed.
