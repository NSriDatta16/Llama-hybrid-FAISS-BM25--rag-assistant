A couple more points not already noted. Fragment identifiers: How would the browser handle a link to http://www.example.com#someID ? Internal references : If someID was on two input elements, and you had ... if the user clicked on the label, the browser would have to decide which input should receive focus. (In HTML5, this is defined to be the first input, which is not necessarily what you want). Likewise for ARIA support, some attributes such as aria-labelledby and aria-describedby rely on pointing to a single place.
