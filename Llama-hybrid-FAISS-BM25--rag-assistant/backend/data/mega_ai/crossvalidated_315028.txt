I'm not sure if I'm understanding correctly, but you aren't doing multilevel modeling, right? I believe that multilevel modeling could handle the aggregation by parsing the within-person variance and the between-person variance, while the the variables that don't vary within-person should be simply be treated as between level variables (don't know what repercussions would the binary nature of the variables would have). I think that this would adjust for the non-independence of observations that would occur by adding repeated measures of a non-varying state, the underestimation of standard errors. I've merely heard about multilevel modeling though, you could read if it can be of help. If the three observations are not being considered as longitudinal in character, perhaps you could model a latent variable using these three observations as indicators (with the proper technique, e.g., wlsmv or irt models, the binary measurement would be no problem as lots of literature will confirm). A latent variable could be considered better than an average score in that it's based on the covariance among the indicators and tries to eliminate "measurement error", and perhaps model fit could be evaluated to test if it makes sense to try to aggregate them. Sorry if that's not helpful.
