I guess for sysbase it is the same as for sql-server. There is a setting to switch between (old?) sybase default set ansi_nulls off select case when null = null then 1 else 0 end -- returns 1 and ansi behaviour. set ansi_nulls on select case when null = null then 1 else 0 end -- returns 0 Today the question is hardly which setting is more elegant, but with which setting causes more trouble.
