What are embeddings in the context of machine learning?

I would like to find out an intuitive explanation of what are embeddings in the context of machine learning and neural networks. Is that essentially the same thing as a manifold ? I've read a bunch of abstract explanations but I would appreciate one that intuitively explains what they really are, giving examples if possible.
