Understanding the simplicity of Git is hard. If you have some experiences with other (centralized) version control systems, try to forget them and understand Git's basic concepts (objects, commits, branches,..). There are lot of books out there. I would recommend the short (30 pages long) Git from bottom up , it is free and very useful. Another free learning materials are at gitcasts . Pragprog and peepcode have also great books and screencasts. They are not free, but useful. I use git with XCode for several months, and they work together. Although XCode hasn't git listed as a supported version control system, you can use git from the command line. I tried to use GitX, but never found it more useful then git from command line. Try it out, maybe it fits your habbits more. For XCode I found this gitignore and gitattributes file useful for my projects: .gitignore: # xcode noise build/* *.pbxuser *.mode1v3 *.mode2v3 *.perspective *.perspectivev3 # osx noise .DS_Store profile # other .svn *.swp .gitattributes: *.pbxproj -crlf -diff -merge
