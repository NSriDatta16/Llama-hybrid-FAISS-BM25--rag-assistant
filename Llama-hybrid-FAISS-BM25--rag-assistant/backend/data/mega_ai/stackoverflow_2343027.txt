How many separate flash movies can be rendered on one HTML page before performance is noticebly smaller

I'm currently developing a portal application that will require a number of Adobe flex elements. Each portlet could potentially be it's own flash movie. What I would like to know is how many of these portlets can be rendered in a browser on an average system before the number flash player starts using up too much memory and performance starts to degrade. Any kind of documentation on how Flash handles memory in this regard would be very helpful. Thanks in advance!
