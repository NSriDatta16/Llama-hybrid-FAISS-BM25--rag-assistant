Is it trivial to train a NN to classify numbers as integers or non-integers?

I understand that the data type of the inputs would have to be the same, but say that I have all of the numbers as floats with two decimals. Would a neural network be able to learn the classification: X y 100.00 1 100.09 0 100.70 0 78.00 1 78.17 0 ... Intuitively I think that it wouldn't be an easy task. Perhaps it is trivial but then I'm missing how it would work. Suprisingly some googling hasn't given any results (may be I'm not using the right terms...) Edit: as per the comments below, in order to narrow down the question, let's suppose the Xs are stored as float variables defined in Python. Thanks!
