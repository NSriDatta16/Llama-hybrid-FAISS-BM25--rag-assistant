How can I switch to the Halo theme in Flash Builder 4?

As you know, Adobe added a new theme called Spark in Flash Builder 4, but it looks really ugly to me. The problem is that I can't switch the current theme to Halo! What I've tried: Change theme settings in project properties. No effect - all new buttons and other controls had this theme Use compiler settings: -theme=${flexlib}/themes/Halo/halo.swc - no effect also, the same story as above Then I noticed that there are 2 namespaces in my MXML file: xmlns:s="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/spark" xmlns:mx="library://ns.adobe.com/flex/mx" When I switched button declaration from to then my button began to look much better. But I can't switch all such declarations manually, and I don't imagine making the same change to the Application tag would apply the style at an application level. So, my big question: How can I make Flash Builder 4 use the same theme as in Flash Builder 3? How can I apply it to all new controls? Are there any tricks that I missed?
