This is not a complete answer, but I think ChatGPT's response to the same question as the OP was asking is interesting, (1) to highlight that it can change it's answer and even be inconsistent within the same answer, and (2) the text at the end of the following answer seems like a reasonable explanation for why it said what it did before: ChatGPT is a type of language model that uses a transformer architecture, which includes both an encoder and a decoder. Specifically, GPT-3, the model on which ChatGPT is based, uses a transformer decoder architecture without an explicit encoder component. However, the transformer decoder can be thought of as both an encoder and a decoder, since it receives input and generates output, similar to the way that an encoder-decoder architecture works. Therefore, even though ChatGPT does not have an explicit encoder component, it can be considered to have both encoding and decoding capabilities within its transformer architecture. I appreciate the debate going on in the other answers. I think we need to get into semantics. There are three generally-accepted classes of transformer LLM architectures: encoder, decoder, and encoder-decoder. Within this overly-simplistic taxonomy, the OpenAI GPT family of LLMs seem to best fit in the decoder branch because they do not have a full encoder like BERT, so they can't do things like extract structured data, e.g. named entity recognition, directly. On the other hand, no language model can understand language without some form of encoding. At a minimum, the LM needs to convert words into word embeddings. This could be considered a form of encoding, though a very minimal one. I suspect ChatGPT does much more than word embeddings, so it would have an even less-than-minimal encoder. But I'm not an expert, so I can't give details here ... yet.
