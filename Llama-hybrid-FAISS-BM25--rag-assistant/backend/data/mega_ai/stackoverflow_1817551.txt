There are several different approaches to your problem. I'd use a morphological image processing tool like this one . You will have the flexibility to define "rectangle" even something that not "exactly closed" (where the fill algorithm will fail). Another possibility could be to use a machine learning approach, which basically is more data-driven than definition-driven like the previous one. You'll have to give your algorithm several "examples" of what a rectangle is, and it will eventually learn (with a bias and an error rate).
