Since you said "Cocoa" and "NSRunLoop", I'm going to assume you are on Mac OS X. As long as you are on Snow Leopard, you can use Grand Central Dispatch to solve this kind of problem very elegantly. If on Leopard or later (or iPhone, for that matter), you can use NSOperations to do the same (with slightly more code). All of this is discussed in the Concurrency Programming Guide . Even if your algorithm isn't designed to be executed off of the Main thread -- outside of the Main event loop -- you could still solve the problem of scheduling stuff for "later", to be executed serially, via the main queue.
