SFML window resizing events blocking the main thread

I just started using the SFML library and its fantastic. However when resizing a window by dragging the corner with my mouse i don't get the resize events until i release the mouse. This means i can't update my graphics until the mouse is released (game loop is on the gui thread) and is also causing a massive flood of events to come through of all the resize positions. How can i make it so resizing doesn't block the thread?
