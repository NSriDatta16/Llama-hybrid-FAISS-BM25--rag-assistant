Logistic regression does not predict the class of an observation, just the probability that it will belong to a given class. So it only defines a set of "parallel" hyperplanes $b_0 + b_1x_1 + \cdots + b_kx_k = A$ , where $A$ is any constant. Each choice of $A$ will give a different sensitivity/specificity for the resulting classification. There is an entire set of techniques (usually called "ROC analysis") for trying to get a good value for this cutoff. Edit As @cardinal points out in the comment below, $A=0$ is a special case of using ${\rm logit} (p) = 0$ , that is $p=0.5$ as a cutoff between the two classes. So it corresponds to the intuitive rule of classifying into the class with the higher predicted probability.
