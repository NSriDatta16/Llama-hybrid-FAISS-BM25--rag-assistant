Regardless of what storage method you choose, don't let that stop you from writing the code that will use it. Write a class that abstracts this from your app and just gives you images, how/where it retrieves images from, doesn't matter, this will also help you in the future if you decide to change your storage method, you will only have to change this class, not the whole app. Back to the original question, it depends how you'll be using the images, if you already have a db and need to associate the images with other records or add additional properties (i.e. a database of animals in a shelter with their pictures and other attributes), makes sense to store in a db. If all you care about are pictures that don't have any need to be organized (i.e. the built in Gallery), then store in a folder. Here's a link on how to store in DB: http://www.helloandroid.com/tutorials/store-imagesfiles-database
