FDR and Bonferroni corrections and Logistic Regression / Classification in High Dimensional Space

My work involves Classification --e.g. Logistic Regressions-- in a relatively High Dimensional setting (i.e. 300 to 1,500 variables). I wonder if the Bonferroni and FDR corrections have any relevance for my work. Your advice will be appreciated. More specifically, my question is: Are the Bonferroni and FDR tests applicable in the process of developing a powerful predictive model for Classification purposes and if yes how?
