How do you deal with overdispersion in a zero-inflated negative binomial regression AND when you expect data to have zeros?

Background: I am analyzing the effect of multiple variables (lineage, ancestral plant species, plant species reared from, larval density, body mass) on different traits: ovigeny index (initial egg load/fecundity) and initial egg load (continuous). I have an overdispersion problem with my initial egg load data. There are many virgin females that emerge from plants with 0 eggs, but this is expected. Anyway, I figured out how to do a zero-inflated negative binomial regression to test for overdispersion on the non-zero count data. My Log(theta) is significant, indicating overdispersion. My question is, can I still accept this model? I do not really know how to correct for overdispersion of it is necessary. Output: Call: zeroinfl(formula = iel ~ population * adapthost + population * expthost + adapthost * expthost + expthost * f1dens2 + mass | population * adapthost + population * expthost + adapthost * expthost + expthost * f1dens2 + mass, data = data124.fem, dist = "negbin") Pearson residuals: Min 1Q Median 3Q Max -1.6907 -0.7544 -0.1254 0.5934 5.5976 Count model coefficients (negbin with log link): Estimate Std.

This response is set up as two columns: initial egg load and remaining eggs. The latter of which is the difference of initial egg load and lifetime fecundity. Both analyses showed overdispersion, perhaps because of the number of females that emerged with no eggs. I tried searching for "zero-inflated logistic regression", but no luck or nobody thinks it is a model that could be done. What should I do? Note: Ovigeny index and initial egg load are different ways of assessing a female's tendency to reproduce early.
