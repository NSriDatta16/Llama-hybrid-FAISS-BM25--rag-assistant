I'm a big believer in CSS resets - particularly Eric Meyer's reset, but trying to graft on a reset to an existing site can be really tricky. You don't really have a huge amount of CSS, so I'd be tempted to combine it all into one file and organize/optimize it manually. Check out Natalie Downe's presentation on CSS Systems - read the PDF as it includes a ton of notes not included in the slide show.
