I wouldn't tie up the database waiting for the user to download 100Mb, even for a high speed user. When the user requests the file have them specify an email address. Then call an asynch process to pull the data, write it to a temp file (don't want > 100mb in memory after all), then zip the temp file to a storage location, then send the user an email with a link to download the file.
