percentage of difference with estimated marginal means

I am calculating the difference between concentration of different metabolites according to the factor sex (male/female) and age group ( =55) from this linear model: model Now I want to calculate the percentage of difference of male vs. female by age group and plot it. I am trying this mean_diff_sex However, I am not sure if I can transform this estimate into the percentage of difference doing: ((2^estimate)-1)x100 or it would be better to using: Absolute difference / Average x 100 Thank you in advance for any help
