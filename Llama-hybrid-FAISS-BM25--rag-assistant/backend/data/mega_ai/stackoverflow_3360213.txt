slow category import in magento

I wrote a custom adapter for importing 6K categories using the advanced profiles. The import is too slow. I've tried increasing the number of records from 1 to 5 but it doesn't help. I also tried using ->setDisplayMode($dispMode) and ->setIsMassupdate(true) before saving the category but it also doesn't help. Any idea how to speed things up?
