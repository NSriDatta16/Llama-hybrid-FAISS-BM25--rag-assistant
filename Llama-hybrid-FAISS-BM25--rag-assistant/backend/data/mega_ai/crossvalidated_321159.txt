See Juho Piironen and Aki Vehtari (2017). Comparison of Bayesian predictive methods for model selection. Statistics and Computing, 27(3):711-735. http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-016-9649-y which shows that most approaches overfit during the selection, and that projection predictive approach performs the best. The projection predictive model selection has been implemented in projpred R package https://github.com/stan-dev/projpred which supports rstanarm models. For a quick intro see https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/stan-dev/projpred/blob/master/vignettes/quickstart.html We have tested projection predictive model selection with many small n large n datasets up to 20k predictors.
