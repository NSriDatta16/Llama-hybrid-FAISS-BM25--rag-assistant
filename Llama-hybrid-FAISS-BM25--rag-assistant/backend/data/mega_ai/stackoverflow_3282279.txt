The best one is Pascal Analyzer (PAL) by Peganza, which you said you tried and found unsuitable, but did not say why. I will say a bit in its favor: It's Commercial, inexpensive, and so worth it. They recently released version 5, and if version 5 doesn't do what you want, you should tell them what you want, because they have always answered my requests whenever I have mentioned a feature I wish the product would add. We use it instead of the high-end SKUs of Delphi's metrics because it costs less and does more than the built-in $3000 stuff. I think it costs about $160 us. I am a happy customer . Here is a sample of some of the metric areas that I like: convention compliance - class names that don't start with T, exception types don't start with E, class fields not in private, identifiers with goofy names, class visibility confusion or bad order, local identifier/unit outer scope identifier clashes. Inconsistent case, Many many many more! The weakness is that the output is plain text in a "TMemo" control. Of course, I have found a lot of ways to take that output and write my own small sort/filter utilities to mine even more useful stuff from the reports. A powerful tool that you won't be able to live without once you try it. I realize you said in your answer that you tried that already, but if it's not what you want, it's already the best LINT like tool for Pascal that currently exists.
