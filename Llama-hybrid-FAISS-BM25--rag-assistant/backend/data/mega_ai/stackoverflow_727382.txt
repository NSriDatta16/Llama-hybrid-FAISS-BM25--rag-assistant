Whats the best way to deal with pages loaded via browser history in asp .net?

I have an app which is very database and user intensive. The users are very keen on the browser history buttons for navigation. Is there a way that I can absolutely guarantee that the page will reload if a user picks something out of their browser history? What I regularly see is that a copy of the page will be shown from the browsers cache, rather than being reloaded. I've tried: this.Response.Cache.SetNoStore() this.Response.Cache.SetNoServerCaching() this.Response.Cache.SetCacheability(System.Web.HttpCacheability.NoCache) And this.Response.Cache.SetExpires(DateTime.Now.AddSeconds ( -1 ) ); None of these seems to help, sometimes the browser will load the old cached version anyway.
