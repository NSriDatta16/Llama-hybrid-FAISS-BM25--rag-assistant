Why doesn't the Moving Average model contain past time series values?

The moving average model looks like: $$X_t=\mu + \varepsilon_t + \theta_1 \varepsilon_{t−1} + \dotsb + \theta_q \varepsilon_{t−q}$$ It only contains the mean and some white noise factors, with lags. I am wondering, given a time series $\{X_1, X_2, \dotsb , X_t\}$, how could you estimate the white noise part? I just don't understand the link between the past time series values, and the white noise. For auto-regression, that is easy to understand.
