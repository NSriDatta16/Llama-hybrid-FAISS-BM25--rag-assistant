How to Standardize/Normalize three sets of test data of different lengths

I have three sets of data that were sampled at the same interval (20hz). The data is from a data logger that measured vehicle speed at a specific time. In each of the tests, the Car starts at the same starting point A, and is manually drive to the end point B. This was performed 3 times. The point at which the vehicle comes to a stop is different each time since it is manually driven but that is intended. My intention is to gather enough data sets from this test route so if another person drives the test route, we can compare how he performed. I would ultimately like to average the data sets from my run and call it the optimal path and add an error band, so if someone else runs the test route, I can compare how they did to it, like distance from end of route, and max speed through a turn. Initially I thought I could plot the data vs distance and take the average that way but the problem I am running into is, log A is 400 samples, log B is 420 samples, log C is 440 samples. So they arent exactly 1:1. Any idea how to skin this cat?
