How can I use a time series consisting of both Mean and SE to obtain predictions with Mean and SE

This is a slightly modified version of a programming question that I asked in that forum and was redirected here to get a better sense of the statistics involved. https://stackoverflow.com/questions/74839826/how-can-i-pass-a-time-series-consisting-of-both-mean-and-se-to-the-predict-funct/74840556?noredirect=1#comment132089220_74840556 I have a time series but each value in the time series is a mean and an SE. I do not have access to the raw data that calculated these Means and standard errors. I might get the sample size for each year, but I do not have that at the moment as well. I would like to use this information to create an exponential model. However, I am unsure how to use the SE values of my time series for this prediction. My understanding is that whatever be the SE in the time series, the predicted values of the Mean remains the same. But the SE of the model itself should have a dependency on the SE of the time series. This SE is very important for me and I would later introduce that in the plot as well. I got some good advice that I can calculate the CI for each year and predict Mean + CI and Mean - CI. However, that prediction itself will have an SE and how to add them up is not clear to us. I also got an advice to throw multiple points for each year using the Mean/SE of that year. Then use those points to fit a model and predict. Intuitively, that seems fine to me but it would be great to obtain a confirmation. If there are other tactics to solve this, I would be much grateful.
