What's the right structure Deep Learning structure for Multilabel classification

I have the following data feat_1 feat_2 ... feat_n label gene_1 100.33 10.2 ... 90.23 great gene_2 13.32 87.9 ... 77.18 soso .... gene_m 213.32 63.2 ... 12.23 quite_good The size of M is large ~30K rows, and N is much smaller ~10 columns. My question is what is the appropriate Deep Learning structure to learn and test the data like above. At the end of the day, the user will give a vector of genes with expression. gene_1 989.00 gene_2 77.10 ... gene_N 100.10 And the system will label which label does each gene apply e.g. great or soso, etc... By structure I mean one of these: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Autoencoder Deep Belief Network (DBN) Restricted Boltzman Machine
