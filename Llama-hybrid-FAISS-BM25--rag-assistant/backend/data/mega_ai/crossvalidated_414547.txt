Difficulty in understanding the proof of the Wold decomposition theorem

The proof of the Wold Decomposition [1] of $x_t$ involves the definition of the process $$w_t = x_t - P_{\mathcal{M}_{t-1}^x} x_t,$$ where $x_t$ is a stationary zero-mean process, $\mathcal{M}_n^x = \overline{{\mathrm{span}}}\{x_t, -\infty \lt t \le n\}$ , and $P$ denotes the projection. If $x_t$ is a real-valued process (as opposed to a vector-valued one) and $x_i \ne 0$ for some $-\infty \lt i \le (t-1)$ , isn't $\mathcal{M}_{t-1}^x = \mathbb{R}$ and, consequently, $w_t=0$ ? I guess it doesn't, since the rest of the proof would not make sense if it did. Could you please point out where my interpretation is wrong? [1] Shumway, RH, Stoffer DS.
