The problem is one of applying a permutation in place with minimal O(1) extra storage: "in-situ permutation". It is solvable, but an algorithm is not obvious beforehand. It is described briefly as an exercise in Knuth, and for work I had to decipher it and figure out how it worked. Look at 5.2 #13. For some more modern work on this problem, with pseudocode: http://www.fernuni-hagen.de/imperia/md/content/fakultaetfuermathematikundinformatik/forschung/berichte/bericht_273.pdf
