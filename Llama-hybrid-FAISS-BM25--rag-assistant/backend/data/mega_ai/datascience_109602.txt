There is no theoretical upper bound for t-SNE. However, pragmatically it will become increasingly computationally impracticable to reduce higher and higher dimensions to lower and lower dimensions. This is because t-SNE constructs a probability distribution over pairs of high-dimensional objects. In your problem, 60 data points in an 3,000 dimensional space are is more computationally intensive than 3,823 data points in 64 dimensions. Additionally, t-SNE is a dimensionality reduction, not a clustering technique. You can directly cluster in the high-dimensional space.
