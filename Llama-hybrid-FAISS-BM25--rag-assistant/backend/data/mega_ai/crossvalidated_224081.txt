Probability distribution estimate of target continuous variable

I am looking for litterature/reference on algorithms for a regression task that can give the probability distribution estimation of the output variable, or multiple outputs with their respective likelihood. As I am not sure about the correct vocabulary or if this makes any sense, let me illustrate what I am looking for with an example. Let say I want to predict age (continuous). I have 9 binary features, $x_1, .. x_9$ such that when $x_1$ is active, the subject is likely aged 10-19 , $x_2$ for 20-29 and so on until $x_9$ (and more features that allow to have a more detailled estimate). With algorithms like linear regression that give the most likely output, I fear that in a case where both $x_1$ and $x_6$ are active, the algorithm will average and output ~35 to minimize its loss where I would like it to output that ~17 and ~61 are the most likely answers. In other words, I would like to know if the likelihood of the response given the features is multimodal and get those modes. Or, if simpler, just get the density estimation. I know I could do this using multi-class classification with ~100 classes, but I expect there exists something built for this purpose. What are the algorithms to do this? What reference/literature can help with the terminology of this subject?
