The best way to maximize a payoff based on a binary decision with neural network

What is the best way to maximize a payoff based on a binary decision with using a neural network? I understand that with a binary cross-entropy loss function I can bring a network with a sigmoid output function to make the right binary decision. But when each of the decision in the sample may have a different payoff, how would i best weight those payoffs or losses during the trainig? Is there any recommended way to do that? Any suggestions are appreciated.
