Rule engine vs machine learning

We would like to implement rule engine in one of our products, but when I read on the Internet, many are suggesting that rule engines are an old way of doing things and it will be very hard to manage as we add more rules into it. To be successful in implementing a rule based system we need to know all the rules beforehand. Instead, everyone seems to be suggesting that we use Machine Learning algorithms to predict the outcome, but I am new to Machine Learning. So my Question is, should I learn Machine Learning or go on implementing Drools as rule engine in my application. Or can you suggest any online resources achieving the same using Machine Learning?
