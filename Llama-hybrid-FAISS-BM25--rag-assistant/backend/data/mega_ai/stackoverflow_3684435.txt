Truncating html text appropriately into a fixed size area

In a generated html page, we have a fixed size area (lets say 200 x 300) in which we need to fit in as much text as possible (like a regular paragraph of text), and if it doesn't fit, remove an appropriate number of characters and append "..." to the end. The text is NOT in a fixed sized font, and although we are using one specific font for this text, a "generic" solution would obviously be preferred. This looked interesting, but I'm thinking it would be very slow with this function being called for several items on a page - http://bytes.com/topic/javascript/answers/93847-neatly-truncating-text-fit-physical-dimension The solution can use an intermix of html, css, js, and php as needed. Suggestions on approaches are more than welcome!
