"undefined" on line 0

I have a Magento controller with a block and a template. It's supposed to act as a dynamic style sheet with dependencies on store number etc. When I view it in the browser it looks good: http://www.example.com/module/css/ line 1: body { color: #6e6e6d; } line 2: a, #vert-nav li.active a.level-top, .regular-price .price { color: #0076cf; } line 3: body { background-color: #696969; } ... But when I include it in the head of the intended document Magento curiously prints "undefined" at line 0 of the file: link rel="stylesheet" href="http://www.example.com/module/css/" type="text/css" media="all" line -1: line 0: undefined line 1: body { color: #6e6e6d; } line 2: a, #vert-nav li.active a.level-top, .regular-price .price { color: #0076cf; } line 3: body { background-color: #696969; } ... Also, the file is not recognised as "text/css" by the browser even though I set the header type correctly. My guess is that the "undefined" is echoed before I set the header type (that would cause it to fail right?). I don't have a lot of experience with Magento so any help is appreciated.
