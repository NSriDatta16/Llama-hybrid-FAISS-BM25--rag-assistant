useless class storage specifier in empty declaration

gcc 4.4.1 c89 I have the following code: static enum states { ACTIVE, RUNNING, STOPPED, IDLE }; And I get a warning: useless class storage specifier in empty declaration However, if i remove the static keyword I don't get that warning. I am compiling with the following flags: -Wall -Wextra Many thanks for any suggestions,
