Neural Network for classifying humans

I am currently searching a neural network that can classify if there is a human in an image or not. I checked the ImageNet dataset, but the 1000 classes there contain nothing like human or person or such, mostly animals and things. Segmentation CNNs usually have a lot longer runtime, and all I really need is basically a binary NN, just "Yes = Human in Image", "No = No human in image". Can someone point me to a training set or a pre-trained network?
