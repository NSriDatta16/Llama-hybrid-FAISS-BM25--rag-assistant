There are statistics that prove that fixing a bug found in the unit/integration test costs many times less than fixing once it's on the live system (they are based on monitoring thousand of real life projects). Edit : for example, as pointed out, the book " Code Complete " reports on such studies (paragraph 20.3, "Relative Effectiveness of Quality Techniques"). But there is also private research in the consulting field that proves that as well.
