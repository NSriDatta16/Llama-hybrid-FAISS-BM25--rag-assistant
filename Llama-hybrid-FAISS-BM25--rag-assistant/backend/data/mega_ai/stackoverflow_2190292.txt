Desired script tag: src="https://ecn.dev.virtualearth.net/mapcontrol/mapcontrol.ashx?v=6.2&s=1"> Actually, no. In fact, your desired script tag is: You do want the & to be encoded as &amp; . Why? Because the HTML standard says so. See, for example, Section C.12. Using Ampersands in Attribute Values (and Elsewhere) of the XHTML 1.0 standard: In order to ensure that documents are compatible with historical HTML user agents and XML-based user agents, ampersands used in a document that are to be treated as literal characters must be expressed themselves as an entity reference (e.g. " &amp; "). For example, when the href attribute of the a element refers to a CGI script that takes parameters, it must be expressed as http://my.site.dom/cgi-bin/myscript.pl?class=guest&amp;name=user rather than as http://my.site.dom/cgi-bin/myscript.pl?class=guest&name=user .
