I don't think this is a problem to which machine learning is the answer. I can't think of any kind of clustering that would work here. My instinctive approach would be to remove the trend of the data and then use a fourier transform to assess the recurrent frequencies. It should then be reasonably straightforward to classify the points as being part of the patterns that are identified there, and everything else can be dropped into an "other" bucket.
