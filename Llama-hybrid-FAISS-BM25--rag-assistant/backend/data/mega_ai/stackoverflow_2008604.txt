Eclipse Library Reference Out of Date in Project

I am using Eclipse Ganymede. I have a project open and call a static method of a class in another project, which the current one references. I close the current project, open the referenced library's project, change the method return type, and rebuild its jar. (It's set to build automatically, but I tried explicitly rebuilding all anyway.) When I go back to the original project, it still thinks that the static method returns the old type. What am I doing wrong? P.S., "refresh" on the context menu doesn't fix it either.
