The fact that there exists a fixed probability (equivalent to the limiting relative frequency of the outcome) for each outcome on the die follows from an assumption of exchangeability using a famous mathematical result called the "representation theorem" (see related answers here , here and here ). Essentially, this says that if the outcomes on the die rolls are exchangeable (i.e., the order of a result doesn't affect the overall probability) then those outcomes are independent conditional on some underlying fixed probability for each outcome (which is then equal to the limiting relative frequency). If exchangeability does not hold then there is not a fixed probability for an outcome (see related answer here looking at a coin-flip instead of a die roll). Absent some strong theoretical reason or empirical analysis, we cannot know that the die roll is "fair" and so the assertion that the probability of a six is $1/6$ is just an assumption. In fact, there are some cases of statistical analysis which allows for some possibility of bias in the allegedly "fair" mechanism. This was examined in a series of papers on the "gambler's fallacy" and broader methods of binomial prediction under the Bayesian paradigm (see O'Neill and Puza 2005 ; O'Neill 2012 ; O'Neill 2015 ). Of course, if we are satisfied that the outcomes of the tosses are exchangeable then we can toss the coin a large number of times to estimate the probability of getting a six, but the idea that this probability is exactly $1/6$ is highly specific and is typically just an assumption.
