When is Markov chain a generator for iid sequences

Definition: Markov chain as : A stochastic process $X_1, X_2, \ldots, $ is a Markov process ( or Markov chain) is for any discrete time index $n = 1,2,\ldots,$ , $ Pr(X_{n+1} = x_{n+1}| X_n = x_n, \ldots, X_1 = x_1) = Pr(X_{n+1} = x_{n+1}| X_n = x_n)$. Q1: What is the meaning of the above statement in English? Q2: Is Markov chain composed of an independent and identically (iid) random variables. Or when the Markov chain is stationary, then we can say that it is iid random variables? Thank you
