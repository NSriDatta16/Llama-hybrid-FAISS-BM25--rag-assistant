Slicing the image is typically the way this is done, but beware that the tutorial as it's written has already painted you into a corner. Notice that the entire image (which I assume is meant to fill the browser as a website) is only 766 x 700 pixels. That's just over half the size of a modern monitor, so you'll have an enormous amount of white space to the right of content (or on either side of centered content). Average monitor sizes differ by geography, so become familiar with what is typical for your audience and make your background layer that size or larger. Five years ago all of my sites were sized for 800 x 600 monitors, and now they're made for 1024 x 768. But I'm watching my sites' traffic data as larger monitors are used by nearly half the visitors. The method that you use to create the HTML to display the images and text depends on your reason for doing this. If it's a hobby or sideline, use any of the WYSIWYG site creation software packages or online tools. If you intend to learn how to do this as a career, then do yourself a favor and learn how to create sites using web standards (semantic HTML/CSS). Everyone learns by looking at other people's code, but just be careful who's code you learn from. Check out the Eric Meyer books on CSS and the Jeffrey Zeldman book on web standards for lessons on how to make sites that will work not only in today's browser, but also on modern mobile devices and next year's browsers. While on their sites, check out their articles and postings, and take a peek at their HTML source to see how they do it. Also, check out this article of seven different PSD to HTML tutorials to see how other designers would tackle the problem.
