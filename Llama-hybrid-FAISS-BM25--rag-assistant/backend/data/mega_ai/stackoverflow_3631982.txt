Change application's starting activity

I have created the meat and guts of my application but I want to add a different activity that will be the starting point (sort of a log-in screen). Couple questions: 1 I have a fairly decent handle on how to switch between activities (based on this article: http://www.linux-mag.com/id/7498 ) but I'm not sure how to go about creating a new one (with eclipse) . 2 Once I have a new activity created, how can I set it as the default activity of my application? I presume I could just change the name of the classes...but is there a more elegant way to handle that (maybe within the AndroidManifest.xml )?
