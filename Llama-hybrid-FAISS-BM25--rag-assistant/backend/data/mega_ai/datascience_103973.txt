In logistic regression, you assume that each target value follows a Bernoulli distribution - takes on value 1 with some probability $p$ , and 0 with probability $1-p$ . Your model predicts that the target takes on value 1 with some probability $\hat{p}$ , and 0 with probability $1-\hat{p}$ . You are in some sense comparing these two distributions, predicted and actual, by using log loss, yes. There is a 'regression' here; logistic regression is just a generalized linear model with logit link function. You could say you are regressing log-odds (which you then turn into a probability with the inverse link function, the logistic function). Log-odds is assumed to be normally distributed about your predicted mean, sure. But this does not mean that log loss applies in other regression problems, no. You are not computing log loss on log-odds here, but the probabilities.
