You could combine the 2 approaches by switching to a Bayesian analysis. Gather the experts estimates of the missing values, then use those to construct priors on the missing values, then fit a Bayesian model. This will estimate the missing values as a combination of the prior (expert judgement) and what the model fits (like imputation).
