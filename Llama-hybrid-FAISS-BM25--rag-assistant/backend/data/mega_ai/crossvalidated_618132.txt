How can I interpret this ACF PACF?

Data I am using is Relative Humidity from 2004-01-01 to 2022-12-01 (day is always 01 as it is a monthly average). I established a linear regression model to find a trend. Used the residuals and plotted ACF and PACF but have no idea on how to interpret this. I am noticing seasonality (all I understood). So Seasonal ARIMA would be the idea but don't know which pdq PDQ 12 to use. After having my SARIMA I have to compare the performance of the combined estimate with the estimate of Cross-Validation. (This part I can't understand completely). Thank you.
