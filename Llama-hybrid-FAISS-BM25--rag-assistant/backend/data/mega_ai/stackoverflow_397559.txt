This article on devx.com contains a library (Stego) with source code you could use: Keeping Secrets Secret: Steganography with .NET After implementing that API, it's trivial to hide a message inside a .bmp file: ICoverFile cover = new BMPCoverFile("cover.bmp"); cover.CreateStegoFile("stego.bmp","Hello","MyPwd"); Likewise, you can extract the message just as easily: IStegoFile stego = new BMPStegoFile("stego.bmp","MyPwd"); Console.WriteLine(stego.HiddenMessage); UPDATE: Oh, sorry. Matt linked to the same article... didn't see that while writing this answer.
