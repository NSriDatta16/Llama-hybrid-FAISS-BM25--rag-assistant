Silverlight: Log4Net to Isolated Storage

First, I know about Clog , and I do not want to implement this piece. The reason? We can't maintain severeal logging 'frameworks'. So to my question: Is it possible to implement log4net in a Silverlight application? What I want to achieve is logging to the Isolated Storage . I know, there's only 1 MB of storage available, but this limit can be increased (the user has to accept this, I know too). By the way, please don't provide me alternatives. I do only want to know if somebody implemented a log4net to isolated storage .
