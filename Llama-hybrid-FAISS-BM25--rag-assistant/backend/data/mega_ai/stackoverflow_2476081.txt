Screen-scraping of a secure page of any site on https:// with asp.net in C#

I've done site scraping of secure page of any site on http by below code: string cookiedata = "fsfsfsdfsfsfsfsfsdf"; NetworkCredential credential = new NetworkCredential("xxx", "xxx"); HttpWebRequest request = HttpWebRequest.Create("https://ysats.com") as HttpWebRequest; //set the user agent so it looks like IE to not raise suspicion request.UserAgent = "Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 7.0; Windows NT 6.0)"; request.Method = "POST"; //set the cookie in the request header request.Headers.Add("Cookie", cookiedata); request.Credentials = credential; //get the response from the server HttpWebResponse response = (HttpWebResponse)request.GetResponse(); using (Stream stream = response.GetResponseStream()) { using (StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(stream)) { string pagedata = reader.ReadToEnd(); //now we can scrape the contents of the secure page as needed //since the page contents is now stored in our pagedata string Response.Write(pagedata); } } response.Close(); but when I am trying to scrap any site on https:// by this code then i always scrape the login page not secure page not required page. Please advice what should i do for scraping a secure page of any site on https.
