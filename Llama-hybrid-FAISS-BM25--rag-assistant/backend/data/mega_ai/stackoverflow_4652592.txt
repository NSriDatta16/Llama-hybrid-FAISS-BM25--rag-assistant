changes to datacontext and linq-to-sql data model

I'm building an asp application from the ground up using Linq-to-SQL as my ORM. I have a dbml file with a datacontext that includes all the tables of the database (15 for now). If I make changes to the database, by adding a table, adding fields or by changing the data type of a field for instance, how are these kinds of change handled when they occur? Do I simply drag and drop the new table on the ORM mapper and voila? Thanks.
