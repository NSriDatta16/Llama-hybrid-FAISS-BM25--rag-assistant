I suggest you don't use cookies any more, you can take advantage of the new HTML5 specifications and you can use the so called "localStorage" feature. I recommend that you use jquery and it's magnificent plugins. A good example in this case is http://plugins.jquery.com/project/html5Storage , in wich case you could just do something like : $('#formId') .children('input') .each(function(){ $.Storage.set( $(this).attr('name'), $(this).val() ); }); then,if you want to load the saved values , you will do something like : $('#formId') .children('input') .each(function(){ $(this).val($.Storage.get($(this).attr('name'))); }); If tou want full browser compatibility , you should probably go with the cookie implementation, but localStorage is supported by webkit based browsers, firefox, opera and IE 8 :), so it's only a matter of old browsers compatibility.
