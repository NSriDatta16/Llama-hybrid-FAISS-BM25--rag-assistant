I finally figured it out, you have to use _html as a suffix for any yaml-keys, that you do not want html-escaped: paragraph_html: "This is some text with a %{link}" paragraph_linktext: "really cool link" and then link = link_to t( paragraph_linktext ), "http://www.example.com" link ) %> and voila, there you have your i18n-ized link.
