There's an episode of freakonomics radio that is very relevant to this question (in general, not in the specifics of en election). In it, Stephen Dubner interviews the lead of a project from a United States defense agency to determine the best way to forecast global political events. It [also] helps a lot to know more about politics than most people do. I would say they’re almost necessary conditions for doing well. But they’re not sufficient, because there are plenty of people who are very smart and close-minded. There are plenty of people who are very smart and think that it’s impossible to attach probabilities to unique events . Then they discuss what not to do if you ask those types of questions, most people say, “How could you possibly assign probabilities to what seem to be unique historical events?” There just doesn’t seem to be any way to do that. The best we can really do is, use vague verbiage, make vague-verbiage forecasts. We can say things like, “Well, this might happen. This could happen. This may happen.” And to say something could happen isn’t to say a lot. Then the episode goes into the methodologies that the most successful forecasters used to estimate these probabilities, advocating an informal Bayesian approach So, knowing nothing about the African dictator or the country even, let’s say I’ve never heard of this dictator, I’ve never heard of this country, and I just look at the base rate and I say, “hmm, looks like about 87 percent.” That would be my initial hunch estimate. Then the question is, “What do I do?” Well, then I start to learn something about the country and the dictator. And if I learn that the dictator in question is 91 years old and has advanced prostate cancer, I should adjust my probability . And if I learn that there are riots in the capital city and there are hints of military coups in the offing, I should again adjust my probability . But starting with the base-rate probability is a good way to at least ensure that you’re going to be in the plausibility ballpark initially. The episode is called How to Be Less Terrible at Predicting the Future , and is a very fun listen. I encourage you to check it out if you're interested in this sort of thing!
