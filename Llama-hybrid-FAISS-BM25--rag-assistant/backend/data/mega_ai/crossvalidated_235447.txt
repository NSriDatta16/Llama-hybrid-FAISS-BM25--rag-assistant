Differing from your model, I can give you some ideas based on my experience. Let's say you have a state space model: $y_t = ax_t + \alpha_t$ $x_{t+1} = bx_t + e_t, \quad e_t \sim N(0, 1)$ A regular assumption on a state space model is that $\alpha_t$ is also a random variable from Gaussian distribution, e.g., $N(0, 2)$. We can use the maximum likelihood method to estimate parameters $a$ and $b$ under a Gaussian distributed on $\alpha_t$. However, if we consider $\alpha_t$ is a random number from an $\alpha$ stable distribution, then the pdf is not analytically expressible. A possible way to handle this kind of problem is to use Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) method. Please read the following link to learn this method if you like. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Approximate_Bayesian_computation
