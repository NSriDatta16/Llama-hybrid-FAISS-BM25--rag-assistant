Navigation Controller Transparent Bar Style is not working

I am using a navigation controller, and I have the style set to : navController.navigationBar.barStyle = UIBarStyleBlackTranslucent; But when I run my program, the navigation controller looks like it is on top of a white background, not my background. When I push a controller, left or right, all my view, the current one, shifts to the top exactly the size of the navigation bar. And it is there where I can see my background through the navigation controller bar. Any ideas? When my barStyle is set to opaque, everything looks fine. I was thinking on setting my view frame a negative 'y' value, but I think there should a more elegant way.
