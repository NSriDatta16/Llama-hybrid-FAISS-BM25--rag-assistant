To prevent the average from leaking the value associated any individual factory, you would typically use differential privacy , for example by adding Laplace noise of scale $\frac{C}{n\varepsilon}$ to your average, where: $C$ is the maximum contribution of any given factory (that you have to fix in advance , based on your knowledge of the problem space and typical data distributions, not based on the real data) $n$ is the number of factories, $\varepsilon$ is the desired privacy parameter. If any factory's value is larger than $C$ , you have to clamp its value (replace it by $C$ ). If the values you're averaging can be negative, you also need a lower bound $B$ , and the scale of the noise is $\frac{C-B}{n\varepsilon}$ . Now, if only one or a handful of factories have a completely oversized contribution compared to the rest, this noise might be too large to get meaningful results. But if that's the case, you're essentially trying to solve an impossible problem: if the statistic inherently leaks data about large factories when reasonably accurateâ€¦ the trade-off between accuracy and privacy leakage might be an unacceptable one.
