Retrieving the Windows username from a logged-in machine through an intranet application

How can an application, running on a production server , access the login username of the machine that a user is accessing an application from? For example, I am currently logged into my machine on the INTRA corporate intranet. My username will be INTRA\Username . I have added specific usernames to a database and wish to check this intranet username against the database to restrict access to an application and leverage the username across the application. Currently, I am using the following code to access the username: Private username As String = Thread.CurrentPrincipal.Identity.Name This is working great on localhost, but when authenticating against the database on a development server , I'm getting the following error: Login failed for user 'NT AUTHORITY\ANONYMOUS LOGON'. Is this an incorrect approach? Is this even possible, or is it too much of a security issue? This application will be an internal intranet application running in an IE shop. Relevant pieces of web.config that already exist include:
