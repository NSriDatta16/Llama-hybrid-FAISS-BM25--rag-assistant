contradiction between PCA and Multicollinearity

From here Should one remove highly correlated variables before doing PCA? we know that when there are some highly correlated Features during the PCA, we should remove them to avoid some incorrect extremely high variance principle component. On the other hand, PCA is used to solve Multicollinearity . So are above two things contradict? I understand that PCA just aggregates the correlated features together into one feature.
