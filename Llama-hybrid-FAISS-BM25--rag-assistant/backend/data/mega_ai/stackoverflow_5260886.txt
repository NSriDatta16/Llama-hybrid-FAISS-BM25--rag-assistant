Although an answer has been accepted, there is another answer that gets to the heart of the assumptions underneath your question. What is the business concern that you have related to getting a list of changes to the data? What if, instead of merely getting the list of changes to the data, you received a set of events that told you why and how the data changed. This concept is one of the fundamental reasons behind "CQRS" as an architecture. Basically you store all events that caused a change to your data, e.g. FundsDeposited, FundsWithdrawn, etc. and you gain the ability to "replay" those events and discover not just how your data changed over time, but why. Once you go down that road, you gain the ability to store events as a stream and you are no longer limited to a small handful of storage engines. Instead you could literally use any storage engine and it would get the job done.
