Yes. An example from here : struct { /* field 4 bits wide */ unsigned field1 :4; /* * unnamed 3 bit field * unnamed fields allow for padding */ unsigned :3; /* * one-bit field * can only be 0 or -1 in two's complement! */ signed field2 :1; /* align next field on a storage unit */ unsigned :0; unsigned field3 :6; }full_of_fields; Only you know if it makes sense in your projects; typically, it does for fields with more than one bit, if the field can meaningfully be negative.
