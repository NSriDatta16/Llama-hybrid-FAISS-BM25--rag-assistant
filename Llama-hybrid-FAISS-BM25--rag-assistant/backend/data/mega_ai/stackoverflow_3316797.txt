avoidind a loop in R

I will like to avoid a loop in the following code: delta_S My problem is that in my dataset, i varies from 1 to more than a million. I guess by using something like apply I could save time compared to the 19h currently required. Thank you for any reply! Update: I have read some info about vectorization but it seems largely out of my skills (and I do not even speak about using C ou FORTRAN: I have learned R for three months only, to resolve this study). So by chance, if somebody has some time to look at in details my code and to propose a vectorization if it is possible, it would be hugely appreciated! Thank you Julien PS I copy the entire code because I do not know where it can be vectorize! data dudi$nf) stop(paste(nf, "factors need >", dudi$nf, "factors available\n")) if (!inherits(dudi, "pca")) stop("Object of class 'dudi' expected") cent And here's the final loop to avoid: for (i in 1:nrow(Rrecon)) { gri[i,6] Thank you very much !
