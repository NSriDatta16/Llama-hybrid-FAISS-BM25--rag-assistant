How to sum 2 joda-time DateTime values (one containing a date and a zero time and another containing a time and a zero date)?

In a Scala 2.8 program of mine I use joda-time with its scala-time wrapper. I've got 2 DateTime values, one for a date (with zero time fields) and one for time (with zero date fields) (the reason of separation is a storage architecture). How do I get another DateTime value with both date and time parts set from a source pair?
