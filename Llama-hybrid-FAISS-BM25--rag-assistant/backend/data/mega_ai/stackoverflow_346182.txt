Java works in browsers! ( Milpa for example). You can say Flash too, but with Java you can leverage the numerous classes coming with it (another advantage over C++, even if both languages has a good set of free libraries on the Net) and your knowledge of the language. As said, Java is supported on many platforms with minimal adjustments, with a fast, efficient VM, from big servers to mobile phones. OO support is arguably better designed, avoiding mistakes done in C++. Somehow, C# is to Java what Java is to C++ ^_^ (I won't argue on this, I don't know C# enough actually, it is just an historical point). In the same spirit, Java is slightly more abstract, avoiding pointers, manual memory management and some other low level stuff. That doesn't mean than one is better than the other, STL helps C++ for some of the issues above, etc. I am not sure how to answer the last sentence, these are object and method respectively, not classes. I never used System.in yet, I suppose it is usable if you feed the Java program with Integer class.
