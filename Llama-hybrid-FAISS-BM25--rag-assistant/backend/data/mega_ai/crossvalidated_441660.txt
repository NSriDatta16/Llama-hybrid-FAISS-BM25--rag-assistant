Suppose you have several valid instrumental variables. Then you can think of the following when choosing among them: If they capture the same local average treatment effects (i.e. they generate the same set of compliers), you can perhaps choose both and conduct an overidentifying restrictions test, or choose the one that has the strongest first stage (largest F-statistic). If they do not capture the same local average treatment effect, then you should compute both IV estimators, and compare their value. Try to explain why they give different or the same answers by thinking about the local average treatment effects that they induce. You cannot simply base your choice of instrument on the $R^2$ .
