Which test for lagged effect of one time series on another?

I have a data set with three variables: year (21 consecutive years) and two time series which are count data (count1 and count2). I want to know whether count2 correlates with some time delay lag with count1. Both time series follow a positive (and similar in size) linear trend as resulting by running a linear model for each time series (in R, function lm ). According to the Augmented Dickey-Fuller Test (in R function adf.test from tseries ) Count1 neither count1 and count2 are stationary but they become stationary after differencing once. According to partial autocorrelation functions of the counts after differencing (in R function pacf ) count1 shows significant autocorrelation of order 1 (lag=1) and count2 shows no significant autocorrelation. Questions: Should I use a cross-correlation test (in R function ccf ) on the variables obtained after differencing each time series (say, diff.count1 vs. diff.count2)? Or should I use a distributed lag model on the time series after differencing (in R dlm from dLagM )? I have tried but I have problems to select the model with the right time lag because as I increase the value of q (no. of time lags) the AIC improve always (decreases), even when the model is not able to estimate any slope. I know of a third possibility that is the autoregressive distributed lag model (in R ardl from dLagM ) on the raw data but I have the same issue with the AIC. My data look like this (in R): data
