How do you disable caching on Modal dialogs in IE?

We have implemented a popup window as a modal dialog using the IE method: window.showModalDialog('...aspx') The target of the popup window is itself an ASP.Net web page. Assume for the following steps that the popup has never been launched: Launch popup. Page_Load event handler executes on server side. Close popup. Immediately launch popup again. This time Page_Load event handler doesn't execute. It's clear that the popup content is being cached because if at Step 4 we clear the temporary internet files the Page_Load event handler is executed the second time. We have experimented with adding the following to the Head of the web page (as recommended by several other sources) but none of it seems to work. We have also seen places where the use of these is discouraged Can anyone help?
