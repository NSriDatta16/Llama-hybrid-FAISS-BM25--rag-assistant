As @RobertLong pointed out, it is important to know if the tests were administrated on the same day. If yes, then you cannot distinguish between the day grouping factor and the subjectID grouping factor. If however the tests were administrated on different days, then you could consider a more elaborate random effects design/model. This is more easily fitted in lmer() from package lme4 . E.g., you could use something along these lines: lmer(score ~ testTime + age + sleep + time + (1 | subjectID) + (1 | Day), data = df) where Day is the variable in df identifying on which day the test was given.
