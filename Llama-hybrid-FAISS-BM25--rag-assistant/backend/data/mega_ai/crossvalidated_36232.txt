Is it valid to use only some of the components as regressors from a PCA?

I was trying a 4 components PCA where the 1st and 2nd components have emerged exactly as I expected, but the other two components do not commensurate with the theory. I mean, I expected a little different kind of loads. Some of the variables expected to belong to component 3 have actually loaded highly on component 4 and some expected to belong to component 4 have loaded on component 3. I have tried in different ways, but things don't really improve and theoretically component 3 and component 4 do not make much sense to me. You can have a view of the loadings table here- Now, I am planning to use the 1st and 2nd components as regressors (as they have clearly emerged) along with the 9 individual variables that have loaded highly on the other two components (because their linear combinations don't hold to be meaningful) in a further regression on a dependent variable. My questions are- 1) Is it statistically valid to use only component 1 and 2 (component scores, basically) along with the 9 individual variables of component 3 and 4 as regressors in a regression? 2) Is it possible to include a few other variables as regressors too which were not included in the PCA?
